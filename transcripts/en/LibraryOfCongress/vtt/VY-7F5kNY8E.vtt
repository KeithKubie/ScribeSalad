00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.890
&gt;&gt; Ford Peatross: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.260
Thank you for coming.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.880
On behalf of the Princeton
Photographs Division of the Library

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.110
of Congress and its Center
for Architecture, Design,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.770
and Engineering, it is my
great pleasure to welcome you

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.950
to today's program, an
illustrated presentation

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.090
by the distinguished
American architect

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.650
and photographer, Norman McGrath.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.970
I would like to remind you that
this event is being videotaped

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.330
for broadcast on the library's
website and other media.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.720
We encourage you and the
audience to ask questions

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.960
and offer comments during the
question-and-answer period,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.810
but please realize that in
participating in the Q&amp;A period,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.050
you will be consenting to the
library possibly reproducing

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.660
and transmitting your remarks.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.850 position:56%
Perhaps we also should take a moment
to thank the Roman goddess Minerva,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.120
the Roman goddess of
wisdom and learning,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.560
who presides over this place,
who apparently has worked

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.110
out an accommodation with her
sometimes feckless brother Mercury,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.210
the god of travel and
transportation,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.770 position:56%
so that you all could be here today.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.020
My name is Ford Peatross, and I
direct the Center for Architecture,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.040
Design, and Engineering, whose goal
is to further our understanding

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.010
and appreciation of its subjects.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.510
Certainly, this is what
Norman McGrath has done during

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.860
over five decades as an
architectural photographer.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.050
I am here today with my
colleague, Mari Nakahara --

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.350
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Hello.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.270
&gt;&gt; Ford Peatross: Our new
Curator of Architecture, Design,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.250
and Engineering, to
introduce Norman,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.420 position:56%
in possibly my last official
program introduction before I retire

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.210
at the end of April after
over 40 years at the library,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.230
happily handing over the
reins to Mari and doing

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.680
so with total confidence in her
abilities to carry on this work.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.340
But back to the subject
at hand, born in London,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.160
Norman's father was the
Australian born architect

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.470
and author Raymond McGrath.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.560
Norman was educated in Ireland,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.470
where he earned an engineering
degree at Trinity College Dublin.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.160
Thus, how appropriate
it is that he is here

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.980
with us on St. Patrick's Day.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.850
And I see he's wearing a bit o' the
green, as are a number of people

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.960
in the audience, and I
failed, and I'm part Irish.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.720
I don't know how that happened.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.920
After working in Dublin for a year
or so as a structural engineer,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.760
he moved to New York in 1956.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.030
Over the next five years, he
gradually made the transition

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.390
into the field of professional
photography,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.290
specializing in architecture
and interiors.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.580
Norman has become one of the best
known and respected photographers

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.210
of the world's great
buildings and architecture.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.260 position:56%
Every major architectural
publication has featured his images.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.010
His long career includes
a wide variety of work

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.940
for many well-known
architects and designers.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.030
Norman is the only
architectural photographer invited

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.950
to join Canon's Explorers of
Light program, which includes many

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.930 position:56%
of the top professionals in a wide
variety of photographic specialties.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.780
His most popular book,
"Photographing Buildings Inside

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.020
and Out", has sold more
than 47,000 copies.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.940
For Princeton Architectural
Press, he co-authored two books,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.590
"Manhattan Skyscrapers" with text
by Eric Nash, published in 1999

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.250
with revised editions in 2005 and
2010, and "Skyscraper Rivals",

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.920
a book featuring four
early New York buildings,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.440
with text by Daniel
Abramson, published in 2000.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.670
In 1985, the AIA selected
Norman for its Institute Honor,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.840
and the New York chapter of the
AIA awarded him a special citation

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.580
for photography in 1999.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.010
In addition to his assignment work,
Norman gives seminars and teaches

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.170
with the Maine Photographic
Workshops

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.890
and the Palm Beach Photo
Workshops and the Calumet Institute

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.150
in conjunction with the
University of Maryland.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.970
In 1995, the AIA selected
him for its Institute Honor.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.030
And I've already talked
about the special citation.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.040
[ Laughter ]

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.700
Exhibits of his work include
a solo exhibition of his black

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.870
and white photographs
at the Royal Institute

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.610
of Architects of Ireland in 2001.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.080
Norman contributed a
photo essay to the book

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.800
"New York's Pennsylvania Station".

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.690
It's written by my
esteemed colleague,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.190
Hillary Ballon, and
published in 2002.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.710
This was especially meaningful
because Norman's first job

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.510
in architectural photography was
documenting the 1963 demolition

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.760
of McKim, Mead, and White's
great lost structure,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.860
whose fate is still very
much in the news today.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.660
The significance of the station's
destruction further was made

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.030
tangible by architectural historian
Vincent Scully's memorable words,

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.090
quote, "One entered
the city like a god.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.360
One scuttles in now
like a rat," unquote.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.580
Both McGrath and Scully have shown
us that architecture does matter.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.700
In 2011, Norman began
to donate the archive

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.640
of his professional photography
to the Library of Congress,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.440
rights free, that now includes
well over 100,000 large format film

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.230
and high resolution digital images.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.560
We are fortunate that
Norman will now share a part

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.670 position:56%
of his considerable talent,
experience, and wisdom in helping us

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.400 position:56%
to understand what makes
architectural photography different.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.510
I can think of no one better
qualified for the task.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:55.140
[ Applause ]

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.600
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.980
for those glowing words,
and thank you all.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.560
It's great to see such a
lively and full audience here.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.120
I'm really honored, in
particular, of course,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.970
and I have to wish you all
a happy St. Patrick's Day.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.590 position:56%
When Ford gave me the opportunity of
selecting a day in April, of course,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.450
he sooner came to today's
date, the 17th of March.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.950
I knew that that's
the date it had to be.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.520
In any event, so here I am.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.290
And thank you, Ford, for all
those interesting details

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.500
about my early life because that
now means that I don't have to go

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.640
into too much detail about that.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.190
But let me say, of course, that my
father was enormously influential

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:52.600
and without fostering the interest
in architecture that I gained

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600
through him, I would
not be where I am today.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.990
And you might wonder why
it is that, for example,

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.120
I did not study architecture
in the first place.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.550
And it so happens that
Trinity College Dublin,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.550
where most of my education was
funneled in the early '50s,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.650
has no school of -- it
has all the major schools,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.230
but no school of architecture.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.890
So you cannot study -- in
other words, if you go --

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.790
if you interview an Irish architect
and asked him where he studied,

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.830
he's certainly not going to
say Trinity College, Dublin,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.170
because it has no school.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.890
So I did what I thought
was the next best thing,

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.500
and as a structural
engineer, of course,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.480
structural engineers work
with architects closely.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.380
And they are the ones that
make the buildings stand up,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.650
make the dreams come true.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.580 position:56%
And so, they play an important role.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.410
One of the things, however,

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:54.090
that engineering training
normally lacks is any emphasis

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.480
on the aesthetics of things.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.340
And so, it's -- that is usually --

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.460
when you get really
elaborate structures,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:11.370
that's left to those few engineers
who really have the imagination

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.570
to see how marvelous
these structures can be,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.580
people like Calatrava, for example,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.590
and Luigi Nervi before
him, and so on.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.610
And -- but they are unusual,
and they are standouts.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:33.330
And -- but I wanted to dwell on the
fact that architectural photography

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:41.640
as a field of endeavor is different
than other fields of photography.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.010
Why is that?

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:50.520
Part of the reason is that we are
all very familiar with the subject,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.110 position:56%
what it looks like, and if the
photograph doesn't look the same way

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.350
the structure does,
we feel uncomfortable.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:02.730
I am -- I used to constantly gripe
about the fact that, for example,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.530
when I picked up the real estate
section of the New York Times

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.010
that very frequently the buildings

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:14.160
that I saw depicted there
were very, very distorted.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.130
They were taken with
wide-angle lenses,

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.160
and clearly the photographers
had tilted their cameras back.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.850
And these buildings
looked like pyramids more

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.310
than the rectangular subjects
that they in fact were.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:33.720
And I often wondered why they
accepted that, because I knew

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.320
that they -- it didn't
have to be that way.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.650
The New York Times didn't have

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:44.230
and still doesn't have many
photographers who are really gifted

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.470
in the documentation
of architecture.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.830 position:56%
They have a couple, but that's not
their -- normally their main thrust.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:57.070
So one of the aspects
then is to somehow

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:03.460
or other determine what it is
that making the documentation

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.210
of architecture such a challenge.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.910
And in the early days of
architectural photography,

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.830
most of it was exterior initially.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.880
The lenses that most photographers
used were fairly long focal

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.180
lengths lenses.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.820
In other words, you stood
back from your subject.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.930
And because these were longer
focal length lenses, the --

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:36.010
you did not get the same
depth that is possible

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.150
when you approach your
subject more closely

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.390
and photograph it with
a wider angle lens.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.430
This is true of both
interiors and exteriors.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:52.270
And this is a factor which really
comes into play because today --

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.930
well, let me go back a bit.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:03.540
When I got into photography first,
I was a -- really a late bloomer,

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.760
really, you might say, because
I didn't take any photographs

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.480
until after I graduated
from college.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.010
And at that point,
I decided I was --

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.860
I knew that I wanted
to come to America.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.430
And I thought, well, you know,
I'm going to document a little bit

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.910
of what Dublin is all about so
that when I come to America,

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:28.590
I can show my American relatives
what Ireland is all about.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:35.270
And indeed, I am -- even before
I came here, I was half-American,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.350
because my mother was
from Dallas, Texas.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.000
So it was really because
of my American grandfather,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.570
whom I met as a child,
that I had decided a long,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.050
long time ago that I wanted
to come and live in America.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.290
I mean I really literally made

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:56.020
that when I was still
a very young person.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.770
And so, the sort of die was cast.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:06.380
In any event, when I got into
the field of photography first,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.540
on graduation, my best friend
was given a graduation present

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.330
of a brand-new camera, and
I bought his old camera.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.300
And that was the camera
that I started out with,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.510
which was a 35-millimeter
range finder camera,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.060
very straightforward,
rather awkward to use.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.210
Every time you changed -- it
had interchangeable lenses,

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.150
but every time you changed
the lens, you had to put

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.330
on a separate viewfinder because
it wasn't a reflex camera.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.470
So it was very, very tedious,
completely unlike today's cameras,

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.360
which make life so easy
that you not only don't have

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.090
to know what the settings mean
or say, you know, it does it all.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.000
Now, not all cameras,
but many of them do.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.910
So in the -- one had to learn
the hard way by trial and error.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.940
And because of my interest
in architecture,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.280
a lot of the photographs

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.310
that I initially took were
architectural in nature.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:08.800
And I quickly found
what a challenge it was.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.910
And I came to America.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.670
I worked as -- for
four or five years

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.590
as a structural engineer,
as Ford has mentioned.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:22.620
And at the end of that period,
the firm that I had been with went

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.420
into a rather long, slow
decline due the death

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.030
of principle partners in the firm.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.500
And at that point, they --
you know, they had been one

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.570
of the top ten consulting
firms in the country

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.890
with over 100 structural engineers.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.880
They gradually wrapped
-- that got reduced.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.180
I was number 25.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.740
They went down to about 20.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.310
But at that point, I
said, "Do I really want

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.050
to be a structural engineer
for the rest of my life?",

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:53.090
because I had been finding that,

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:57.620
although engineering
was interesting,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.450
it wasn't as creative
as architecture was.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.490
It just lacked that extra
thing for me at that point.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.290
So I decided, okay, I'm going
to have a fling at photography.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.720
I'd been becoming an increasingly
involved amateur at that point.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.500
I'm talking now about the
late '50s, early '60s.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.800
And so, I went out, bought myself
a four by five view camera.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.800
I already had determined
that the tool of choice

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.400
in that era was a four by five
view camera, and if I was going

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.490
to be serious about the subject, I
had to have one of those cameras.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.370
Well, there weren't very many
places to learn how to do that.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.100
So it was a lot of
question of trial and error.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.900
And in those early days, I actually
spent quite a bit of time here

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.720
in Washington, DC, as what can be
described by my old friends here,

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.190
the Luces [assumed
spelling], whom I meet today

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.030
for the first time in 53 years.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.990
And that's saying something.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:08.820
So I would come down to Washington,
and I would stay with my aunt

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.440 position:56%
and uncle, who lived in Chevy Chase.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.580
And I got -- I became very
friendly with a couple

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.840
of Washington architects,
one of whom,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.030
a man named Tad Dynelle [assumed
spelling], was very interested

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:28.170
in a book on Georgetown
architecture.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:32.580
So I would come down, and I would
go out with Tad with my by four

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.400
by five view camera
and document all of --

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.020
all the famous houses in
Georgetown from that era.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:44.100
And we -- I even had I think
probably the first exhibition

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.520
of photography was something
that Tad had organized

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.570
in promotion of that idea.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.840
Sadly, the book never
came to fruition.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.620
But it was a very good
way of cutting my teeth.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:16:03.340
In any event, not long after I
had made this decision to get

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:09.930
into the field, I got a call from
one of the engineers who had been

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.560 position:56%
in the firm that I had also been in,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.480
and he said he had
left the firm too.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:22.040
And he was one of the associates
and had founded his own firm.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.240
And on the strength
of his major client,

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.990
which was the Intercontinental
Hotels,

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.200
he was looking for employees.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.030 position:56%
And he said, "Norman, I hear you're
interested in getting into the field

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.900
of architectural photography.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.010
Are you also interested in eating?"

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.310
[ Laughter ]

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.040
And that was becoming
rather pertinent.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.760
So I decided, yes,
that that was something

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.470
that I was interested in doing.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.850
And I managed to make a --

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.480
an arrangement with him
where I worked part time.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.370
Now that meant that I no longer
had to rely on any income,

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.190
which was pretty minimum
in the initial stages.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:05.380
I had also decided that the way
to get a foothold in the field

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.450
of architectural photography
was to try

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.630
and get publication
as much as possible.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.660
And in those -- in those days,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.010
there were four major
architectural magazines.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.790
It's amazing to think
that of those four,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.340
only one still exists,
Architectural Record.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.990
None of the others, Architectural
Plus, Progressive Architecture,

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.490 position:56%
they're all gone by the [inaudible].

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.330
Now these were magazines that I
worked for on a regular basis.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.340
I knew the people there.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.170
I would photograph a lot
of things on speculation,

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.600
bring them to their attention.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.840
Sometimes I would get assignments
then to go back and do them again.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.070
One such assignment I
did was on the way back

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:56.080
from Washington, DC, to New York.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.950
I stopped in Baltimore, and it
was just after the completion

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:10.380
of the One Charles Center by Mies
van der Rohe, beautiful afternoon.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.840
I took out my four by five camera,
and I shot the hell out of it.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.220
And I got back to New York, and
I called up Architecture Forum,

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.460
and I said, "By any chance, would
you be interested in photographs

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.760
of the new Charles Center?"

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.580
And they looked at
me, and they said,

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.040
"We just sent back a
photographer for the second time

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.290
and has produced absolutely
unusable material.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.090
Are we interested?"

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.830
Well, not only did
they get featured.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.850
They got on the cover
of the magazine,

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.690
and I got assignments
from Mies's office.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.540 position:56%
I never met -- got to meet Mies, but
I got assignments from his office.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.000
And I met associates
from his office.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.890
And that was -- you know, that
was a tremendous piece of luck.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.160
Another thing that happened
here in Washington, DC,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:02.840
was that back in the early
'60s, Interiors Magazine decided

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:09.040
to do a feature on Washington
architects and interiors

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.710
for the national convention
of the NSID.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:23.390
And that was edited by a lady
named Olga Geft [assumed spelling].

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.270
This magazine had absolutely
no money.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.580
I don't know how they ever
put that magazine out.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.460
And so, most of the time,
Olga would take the pictures.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.860
And she was a pretty
good photographer,

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.160
but she really didn't have the time

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.940
because she was running
the magazine as well.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.170
So what she would do is
she would say, "Look,

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.810 position:56%
I want to go feature this building."

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:46.050
And so, she would twist the arms
of the architects of the buildings

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.620
to employ me to take the
pictures, and I would do that.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.930
And that's how I met
many of my early contacts

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.840
in the Washington, DC, area.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.130
And then I -- a lot
of the -- of that --

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:05.200
I think it was 1963 vintage
edition featured my work

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.070
and -- in Washington, DC.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:13.310
And it was, you know, another way
of -- that luck played a part.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.410
But I interrupted myself
a little bit.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:24.920
One of the things that I -- when
I got into the field early on,

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.300
wide-angle lens photography
was in its --

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.950
I mean it was still a
very developing field.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:40.300
I felt, especially with interiors,
that when you got into an interior

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.640
that you -- that you
needed to do that.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.140
And in order to do that, you needed

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.780
to have a fairly wide field
to capture the interior.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.180
But you had to do that
very carefully

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.650
because if you don't the
picture gets very distorted

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:55.950
and uncomfortable.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.820
So you -- it's always a compromise.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:04.190
The job of -- or what it
boils down to in many cases is

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:08.050
that you are trying to disguise
the fact that you've used

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:13.420
as wide a focus length lens or as
short a focal length that you have

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.260
to give you the coverage
that you want

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.590
without making it look distorted.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.080
You want to get -- you want to sort

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.280
of capture what it's
like to be in the space.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:28.490
And also, you want to -- if
you have to introduce lighting

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.630
into that space, do
so very carefully,

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:37.250
because if it's obvious,
I think it detracts.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.340
I -- and this is particularly
true in today's --

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:46.300
in a more sophisticated era when
most interiors, be they domestic

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.560
or otherwise, involve lighting
consultants and so on so that most

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:57.310 position:56%
of them are well lit and they don't
need a lot of supplemental lighting.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.610 position:56%
So if somebody looks at a photograph
of mine and says did I light it

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.790
or not, then I feel I've
succeeded because they don't know.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.790
I've only introduced as
much light as necessary.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.570
And in today's world,
in the digital world,

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.410
most of my photography
is done without the aid

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:19.010
of additional lighting because of
the techniques that have now come

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:27.430
to pass in digital which enable you
to take maybe two or three images

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.710
from the same spot, use them --

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:37.960
a technique which is known in some
circles as high dynamic range, HDR.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:44.550
And some cameras have this ability
so that when you click the shutter,

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:49.450
instead of getting one image,
you get three, a normal exposure,

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:56.020
an underexposure, and an
overexposure, under, normal, over.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.290
You combine that range, and
if it's done properly and well

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.580
and the program is good,
you can in fact get a --

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:10.530
an end result which
is much the same if --

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.510
as though you had introduced light.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.180
And if it's done badly,
it looks awful.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.030
But if it's done properly,
it can be terrific.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:25.710
And that's one of the great
advantages of the jump to digital.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:35.230
Now as I say, in the early
days when -- as -- not --

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.640
when I first got involved
in photography,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.010
most of it was in black and white.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:44.240
But that was in the era when in
fact it became a lot less expensive

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.220
to reproduce in color.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.760
So as that happened,
obviously I start -- I --

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:56.760
the demand for color photographs
evolved as it did so that now,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.890
of course, it's -- nobody dreams of
photographing in black and white,

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.670
which is sad because I think
still it's a very beautiful medium

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.350
for the depiction of architecture.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.110
And I think that some
of the old classic black

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:12.030
and white photographs you
have to look at them clearly.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.440
And I still have in my files
photographs of the same subject

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.800
in color and black and white.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.940
And I prefer the black
and whites to the color.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.380
And I don't want to -- I am going

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:30.620
to show 50 slides,
which I will talk about.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.040
I didn't want to start doing

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.320
that because I get carried
away once we're at the images.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.460
And I digress too frequently.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:47.430
But let me say as the color
evolved, I also evolved.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.680
In -- when I started
out in photography,

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.450
many of the architectural
clients that I have -- and my --

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.140
most of my clients were
either editorial magazines

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.220
and that or they were architects.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:09.940
Not many others, I mean, but that's
simply the way it worked out.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.720
The particular point, though,
that I wanted to make was

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.800
that in those early those the --

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.280
in the practice of
architecture it was different.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.030 position:56%
There were major architectural firms
that regards interiors as something

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.800
that they didn't want
to get involved in.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.130
Now today's world, I
mean it's very different.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:39.600
It's amazing to compare now
how much that has changed

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.420
because once architects realized

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:50.050
that they were cutting off a major
component or a major potential

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.770
by excluding themselves from
the interiors, you know,

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.690
that really didn't make sense.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.660
So nowadays it would be unheard

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.460
of for a major architectural
firm not to tackle interiors.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:10.230
But as that necessity developed,
then so too did the necessity

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.650
for good documentation
of those interiors.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:19.930
And I have never divided or thought
about architectural photography

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.150
in terms of interior and exterior.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.970
It's all architectural photography,
whether it's inside or outside,

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.750
although the rules, of
course, are totally different

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:34.540
because when you're photographing
an interior, not very many subjects

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.340
that you have to be inside
when you're photographing them.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:44.290
And of course, the scale
of them is very important.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:56.300
Now I will say that in the days
and up to the early 21st century,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.960
my four by five view camera
was the tool that I used

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.190 position:56%
for virtually all of my photography.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:09.360
I might do slides in addition,
but the slides were primarily

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:15.190
to provide the architect with
the ability to have slide shows

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:21.280
in addition to photography that
was used not only for reference,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:27.320
but for possible publication
and other purposes.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:33.810
Now if you think back on it,
the four by five camera produced

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.460
for many purposes probably
-- it was probably overkill.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.590
I mean it gave you
really fantastic quality.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.970
You could enlarge these photographs
to great size with no problems.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.500
And any of you who have come

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.270
into photography more recently
will recognize the fact

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.840
that with certain systems
that are available today

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.370
that if your end product
is a large-scale mural,

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.250
you're going to have to
do it very differently

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.280
than if you were using it
for the projected image.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.790
There's a big difference
between those two.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:17.670
And I must say that even today I --
since I am a comparative newcomer

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.700 position:56%
to the digital world, and I don't --

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:30.150 position:56%
I'm not a computer expert by any
means, that the idea that a file has

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.120
to be totally different depending
on whether it's a projected image

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:41.840
or whether it is a printed
image is -- it surprises me.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.000
Most of the images that you're
going to see here started life

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.270
as much bigger files because
the end product at the time

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:55.020
that I did them was going to be
a print rather than projection.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:01.320
But these days, architects promote
themselves almost universally via

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.340
the website.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.880
So these are projected images.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.980
And when you think about
it, many of the photographs

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.760
that people take today are --

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.350
you take photographs
with your cell phone.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.160
You take them -- it doesn't
matter how you take them.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.050
You -- you're not sending
prints to your friends.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.630
You're sending files that show you

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.510
with the Lincoln Memorial,
whatever it is.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:30.310
But that's what you do, and
it's fine for that purpose.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.860
But when it comes to a
large-scale reproduction,

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.470
then you have think again.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.290
So it means that it's going
to be a little bit different.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.620
The slide that you see in front

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:47.790
of you is the old shed
roof of Penn Station.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:52.360
Now when I made that
arrangement with Wayman C. Wing,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.880
a structural engineer, still
around, still goes into his office,

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:04.790
although he's now in his mid-90s,
Wayman C. Wing did the structure

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.240
for the Washington Hilton Hotel,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.570
and I was resident engineer
for part of that work.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:16.240
Prior to that, I had -- when I was
still working for my previous firm,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.910
I had -- I had worked where?

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:34.200
Well, I had been resident engineer
for the final phase of the redo

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.910 position:56%
of the Capitol Dome, which is now --

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.080
it's now been so long that that
redo is not being redone yet again.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.140
[ Laughter ]

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.010
So that's how long ago it was.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:50.810
So that came about under
a slightly unfortunate --

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:57.400
not for me, but for one of my
associates because those of you

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.220
who are not familiar with the
Capitol realize that's it's got an

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.070
inner and an outer dome
and that between the inner

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.950
and the outer dome is
this great structure

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.100
that holds the whole thing up.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:11.890
And then at the base of the
dome, there is this wing,

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.520
and this is where the
balcony is, at that --

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.950
it ties the whole thing together.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:23.380
Well, over the years,
because of poor waterproofing,

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:30.680
but also due to the --
due to bird damage, the --

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.580
that part of the dome,

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.430
which structurally held the
thing together, was compromised.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:41.460
This series of laminated
plates had corroded badly.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.940
You couldn't replace it
because to replace it you have

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.560
to take the top of the dome off.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.590
That clearly wasn't feasible

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.540
and would've indicated
weakness on some part.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.840
And so --

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.140
[ Laughter ]

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.320
So they -- so the company
devised a method for --

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.390
they introduced a series of saddles
around the 36 beams there and put

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:07.030
in steel beams or steel cables
and then stressed these cables up

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:13.750
and relieved these metal plates
of all the stress and, thus,

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:20.580
reintroduced the integrity
of the dome structurally.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.840
The reason that I ended
up being there, however,

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:31.290
was that my predecessor fell inside
the dome and badly damaged one

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.690
of his feet and could no
longer continue with that work.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.360
So I was lucky enough then
to be his replacement.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.880
But in any event, so I was
-- and this era, I might say,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.550
was during the era when Richard
Nixon was Vice President.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.830
John F. Kennedy had
just been selected

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:54.440
to be the Democratic
candidate for the presidency.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.240 position:56%
Lyndon Johnson was either Speaker
of the House, or it was Sam Rayburn.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.880
I don't remember the details
of how that all worked.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:09.470
But I had a grandstand seat to
some of the events that occurred

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.790
in the capital in that era.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.230
So my association with Washington,

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.480
as you can see, goes
back a long way.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:23.460
One sad note was that I was
on my way to Washington, DC,

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.020
when President Kennedy
was assassinated.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:31.270
And that was a terrible,
terrible time in Washington.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.050
But it was even worse for my family

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.770
because my uncle died
on that same weekend.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:41.090
He -- and he died of pneumonia,
which had been misdiagnosed

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.100
in the excitement of
everything that was going on

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.440
and the preoccupation
that everybody had.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.700
They didn't diagnose
the sort of pneumonia

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.590
that he had until it was too late.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.070
So that was a very sad thing, but
it was -- it was one of the --

00:33:55.070 --> 00:34:00.740
of many Washington events
that occurred that were --

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:05.460
had a major impact on me.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:12.690
When I think back to the
days of film photography,

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:17.010
and I had one assignment
in the mid-80s

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:22.330
that was a round-the-world
trip to do a --

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.530
an annual report for the
Schlumberger Corporation

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:32.850
that had headquarters in New
York, Paris, and England.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:37.550
And I had -- because I was going
to many different locations

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:42.780
in different parts of the world, I
had 13 separate pieces of baggage.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.860
I didn't know what piece of
equipment I was going to need

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.010
for which part of this job.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.680 position:56%
So I had to take everything with me.

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.360 position:56%
When that whole assignment was over,

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.930
we ended up in some
place like Frankfurt.

00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:57.230
No, it wasn't.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:02.410
No, I -- we ended up in
Dubai I think it was.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:09.910
And because the representative
from Schlumberger -- we had --

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:14.380 position:56%
and my assistant -- we had been able
to divide our baggage allowance,

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.300
and we were traveling
business class.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.160
We were -- we could divide
it between three people.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.520
Then it was manageable.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.750
But at that point, you're going
to different destinations.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.070 position:56%
And we had to divide it between two.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:31.700
So they said, "Okay, that's going
to be $2500 in excess baggage."

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.410
Well, the Schlumberger
representative had already

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:35.710
flown out.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.910
So I said, "Well, okay, here's
my American Express card."

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.930
Well, this exceeded the thing.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.200
So there I was on the -- I was
there waiting to get on the plane,

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.320
and everybody was seated
in the plane.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.360
And they said, "Well, you know,
what are we going to do here?

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.470
We've loaded all the baggage on.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.330
He's maxed out his credit card.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.630
What are we going to do?"

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.100
The pilot had to come down
and intercede and say, "Look,

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.000
accept the damn credit card
and get -- let's get on."

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.100
[Laughter] And it was
really pretty hilarious.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:11.950
In any event, I -- had I
to do that same job today,

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:17.250
I would not have a fraction
of the amount of equipment.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:24.370
This was taken with a -- my first
really sophisticated wide-angle

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.980
camera was not a view camera.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:33.360
It was a camera that used 120
film, and it had a negative two

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.640
and a half -- two and
a half inches by three

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.810
and a half inches,
very, very wide angle.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:44.230
It had a 47 millimeter
super angle on it.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.210
And it was really quite something.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.940
So this is -- this is
a little bit before.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.480
One of the interesting things
about Penn Station that --

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:59.110
first of all, let me point out that
the office of Wayman C. Wing was

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:03.440
on Seventh Avenue right
across from Penn Station.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.580 position:56%
Penn Station became a very important
part of my life because I worked

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.270
across the street from it,
and all I had to do was to go

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.330
up to the top floor of
the Pennsylvania Hotel,

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:22.430
and I could get a bird's eye view
of the hotel -- of the station.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.080
The station, of course,
was enormous.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.050
This is the part of the
roof structure that you saw

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.860
from under -- underneath.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.870 position:56%
[Inaudible] suggested that I should
take a course with Alexey Brodovich.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:39.420
Alexey Brodovich was an art
director of Harper's Bazaar.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:47.720 position:56%
Brodovich was influential to many
of the top photographers of his era.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:55.940
He encouraged us to produce
stories that were unique

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.990
and that could be discussed
by the class.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:05.710
And my set of topic was in
fact the -- was Penn Station.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.990
The demolition of Penn
Station occurred

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:14.800 position:56%
over an almost four-year period, and
during that time, the station had

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.520
to remain completely operative not
only for commuters but for long --

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.620
as a long-distance railroad hub.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:28.720
So this is a view of the
Seventh Avenue facade,

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:34.820
which I mean was almost
identical to the western facade

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.580
with all these eagles
and things like that.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:44.170
This is obviously before
the demolition had started.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:51.510
What I have done more recently,
and this is now a retake

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:56.520
on all the images that
I took back in the '60s,

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.660
but now what I have done is I have
scanned all these images together

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:06.760
and made a series of five
composites -- six composites.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.910
So this takes up lots
of different elements,

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:13.310
some of which are immediately
recognizable, and others are not.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:18.380
And so, this is something that
I've only very recently done.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:24.270
And it's a way of clearly
looking back on some

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.710
of this early photography.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:31.840
While it does have meaning
as -- simply as a record,

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.010
I thought that this was a new take

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:39.170
and would give it a somewhat
more up-to-date feel.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:44.160
So this is a digital take on
the demolition of the station.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.810
So here you see the base
photograph here is an aerial,

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.700
almost aerial view taken
from the top of the --

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.080
of the Pennsylvania Hotel.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:58.170
You have the post office
building at center background.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:59.470
Yeah, that's right.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.770
I've got a point there.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.070
Don't I?

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.370
[ Laughter ]

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:04.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I knew I nearly forgot something.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.970
Yeah. Up here, you've
got the post office.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.900
And the base of the
final photograph,

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.030
this is the Seventh
Avenue side here.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.330
Eighth Avenue is there.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.010
So I'm -- here I'm looking west.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.410
One of my most recent
involvements was --

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.330
and we've heard and read
an awful lot about drones.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:25.670
So I thought this is the
way of introducing --

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:29.380
this is a local store in
New York that sells drugs.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.010
One of -- one of my fellow
architectural photographers

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:35.950
in New York is consultant to
a group of Chicago that comes

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.720
and does drone photography.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:46.430
So here is a drone, and it's
interesting to speculate.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:52.230
Is, for example, a radio-controlled
model aircraft a drone?

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.530
Why the definition of --

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.720
by some people's definition,
it might be a drone.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.740
But it's remotely controlled.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.040
Nobody's in it.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:06.020 position:56%
Anyhow, this is a 5DR or 5DS camera.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.600
This -- the span of that
rotor is about six feet.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.550
And this is a pretty
complicated piece of equipment.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:17.350
It's got -- it can fly for
maybe 15 minutes at a time.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.650
That doesn't sound like much,

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.760
but in fact actually
it's quite a long time.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.750 position:56%
And what they do is they put this
camera on this cradle at the bottom,

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:30.150
which rotates as the plane rises.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:33.780
And once it gets to
a given altitude,

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.400
they do a 360-degree sweep.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.910
And the camera has a full
frame fish eye lens on it.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.890
So it doesn't need to take
that many images going around,

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:47.970 position:56%
which you can then get a panorama of
the sort of view that you would get

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.300
from one of these needle
skyscrapers.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.440
One of the things that really
surprised me about this,

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:58.610
and you can -- for example, this
-- that photograph up there,

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.980
you can fly these things in
really very confined spaces.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:06.330
And I mean mind you
it was fairly close

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:10.300
to about a $20,000
piece of equipment.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:15.830
But it's -- even in the wind and
stuff, I was amazed at the degree

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.060
of control that they
could have over things.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.130
And -- because I thought
it was pretty scary going

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.730
up in these narrow spaces.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:26.270
And they insisted that this flight
be done during the lunch hour

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:30.830
so that the -- so that the
workers wouldn't be jeopardized.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:36.160
Now don't ask me what
the details of the --

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.510
whether they had permits
to do this thing.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.310
I will say these guys were
so efficient that they came.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.610
They set up.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:45.910
Twenty minutes, they were gone.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:47.210
They had what they
needed, and they were gone.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.670
So by the time anybody
could have complained,

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.010
I think they were long gone.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.310
[ Laughter ]

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:54.610
And that may be -- that may be
the -- that may be the secret.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:43:00.070
Now what has -- what happened
very recently is that based

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:08.680 position:56%
on photographs of Penn Station there
has been a new stage production.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.040
And this stage production was
partly based on my photography

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.310
and other photography
of the station.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:20.310
So they had a -- they made
a set here, and the set --

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:24.820
and they project these different
images of the station on the set.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.630
So here are the -- here
are the two actors.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:32.260
The two actors in this
production are a photographer

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:36.540
who is documenting the
destruction of the station

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:43.920
for the Pennsylvania Railroad
and this commuter professor.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.040
And they initially have
a rather antagonist feud,

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.370
but then finally they
become friends.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.340
And gradually, the
station disappears.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:59.140
So it was -- they spent so
much money actually on the set

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.300
that they did -- had nothing
left over for promotion.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.030
So unfortunately, I can't
say it was a great success

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:06.900
from a financial standpoint.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.200
Now we have to do this one here

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:15.550 position:56%
because this was taken while I was
observing one of these drone flights

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.810
from the top of the W Hotel
just south of Ground Zero.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.730
And this, of course, is
what was used for the --

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.260
for the [inaudible] lecture.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.640
And there, this, of
course, was at dusk.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:32.010 position:56%
And this is, of course, the -- what
used to be called the Freedom Tower.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.300
So here is -- at dusk, here is
this drone that was -- that --

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.380 position:56%
and I will say that the -- it had
to be at least 20 mile an hour wind.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.950
And I would not normally
have flown a model plane

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.550
in that -- in such wind.

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.490
But these guys took this thing up.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:51.770
They managed to hold it
remarkably sturdy and were able

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.970
to accomplish their objective.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:59.700
And I got, of course, to have the
benefit of the marvelous panoramas.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.670
There's the drone with the
moon in the background.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:10.160
Okay. While we were up there, I
suddenly saw lights begin to appear

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.320
at the base of One
World Trade Center.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.160
They were doing a test,
and apparently,

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.590
what they have done now is they
can transform the lower part

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.290
of that building into
an American flag.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.180
And I don't -- and it had
-- it hasn't happened since,

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.930
and this is I think the first
time that anybody could record it.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.230
So I was just lucky that I
was there at the right time.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.340
Now this is sort of
hot off the press.

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.910
This is the -- this is
the Calatrava Center.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:44.810
That is part of the PATH
system that is at Ground Zero.

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:49.610
Now I'm a great admirer
of Calatrava.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:53.060
This building is very elegant.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:59.580
It cost almost $4 billion,
which I --

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.480
you know, it just is
astounding to me.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.030
The thing is I find
it oppressively white.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.040
[ Laughter ]

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.580
I mean I feel like I need
snow goggles when I go --

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:14.270
when I go into that
building and that --

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.200
it only serves about
60,000 commuters a day.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.830
So it doesn't handle anything like
the sort of traffic that you get

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:23.700
through Grand Central
Station or anything else.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.980
So the -- this is a full-frame
fish eye lens from the same view.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:31.040
Now I don't -- I don't
normally use fish eye lenses

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:34.940
for my architectural work, but in
this particular case, it somehow

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.290
or other captures how this
thing does envelope you.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:44.570
But there is a degree of monotony
about this, quite frankly.

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:48.310
And all the structural
elements are all coated

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:52.120
with this luscious marble.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.730
And I just wonder what -- you know,

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.850
you just wonder, well
what is this is?

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.730
This is just a glorified passage.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.140
I mean they're going to have
retail stores and stuff.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.130
So, you know, you --

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:09.370
it's interesting to
play with these images.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:16.570
And it's an interesting thing
to go see once, maybe twice.

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.010
But I'm just not quite sure --

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:19.310
[ Laughter ]

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:21.030
That for $4 billion
it's worth all the hype.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.040
[ Laughter ]

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.340
Yeah. I mean here -- Yeah.

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.640
Now here -- here's --

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.970
now admittedly, this is a
full-frame fish eye lens.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.430
So this is not the
typical view that you get.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:35.930
And you do -- you do see that the
whole of this skyline from one end

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.430
to another, it's an immense space.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.220
But I really feel like
there was a --

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.560
I remember just on
PBS the other night,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.710
I watched a program -- oh, no.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:52.600
I went to a show with my wife about
-- based on ice fisherman who go,

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.650
and they -- and you feel like ice
fisherman with orange uniforms

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.790
and stuff like that
would be more suitable.

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:05.290
Now it's impossible not to compare
that transit hub with this one,

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.820
which is only a ten
minutes' walk away,

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.880
which is the Fulton
Street Transit Hub,

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.660
which is infinitely more
-- it's got great variety.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:20.420
It's got -- its materials I
think are very interesting.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:25.450
So here is a view up through
-- from a lower level.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:29.850
This -- that actually -- that ring
there is actually the balustrade

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:34.180
around the opening in the floor to
the space that I'm photographing.

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.570 position:56%
I mean this is a part of a stairway.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:39.470
And then this is oculus
of the whole thing.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:44.100
And at different times of
day, it looks quite marvelous.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:49.100
I just thought I would just end
with that -- with that slide there.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.400
This -- she's on post.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.790
She just happened to be there.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.010
And I just thought, well, gosh,
that's pretty appropriate.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.310
[ Laughter ]

00:48:55.310 --> 00:49:02.370
So any of you that haven't, I have
not been yet into the museum there.

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:07.140
But I think that this design here
and the One World Trade Center --

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:14.290
World Financial Center behind
here, that's well worth visiting.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.590
I can't speak for the museum.

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:16.890
It's rather expensive.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:18.190
[ Laughter ]

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:20.480
In any event, okay, I'm --

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:25.430
I apologize that our slide show

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:28.690
for reasons beyond my
control couldn't --

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.140
didn't -- is -- was not complete.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:39.770
But you get a hint for I think what
I'm still doing, and those of you

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.800
who have questions, I'll
try and answer them.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:53.300
[ Applause ]

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.050
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: You're shooting
these big fish eye pictures.

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:59.410
Is it safe to say that
earlier in your career,

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.620 position:56%
you would not have been [inaudible],

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:07.050 position:56%
that you would have always been more
the straightforward architectural --

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.040
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: Well, what
I'm doing a lot more photography

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.840
for myself these days, and I --

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.530
one of the things that I have
been doing is doing photographs

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:18.820
that I call upshots.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.770
And for the upshots, I
take -- I will take any --

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:25.210
I will extreme wide-angle
lenses, including fish eye lenses,

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:29.810
because that gives you a very
different view, and yet it --

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:33.040
I mean it's reality, but
it's a distorted reality.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.980
And it -- you can make very
interesting images I think

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.320
doing that.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:45.060
But whether you do those as part
of an assignment, I don't know.

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:53.070
You would have to have a client
who recognizes that, okay,

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.940
this is maybe not part
of the documentation

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:56.730
but nevertheless is
an interesting take.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.520
It's because, you know,
every now and again,

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.070
that sort of thing will happen.

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:02.690
But you have to have
a flexible client.

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:12.610
You wouldn't do it
with just any client.

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:13.910
Yeah?

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:22.380
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: So it seems
to me that both architecture

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:32.580
and photography have become
more classic as we get --

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:36.770
since the advent of purists.

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:40.760
And I'm just wondering since
you've bridged this gap

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:46.700
in a wonderful way how the
conversation has changed

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.600
between architects and
architectural photographers.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:55.360
I mean I know that it's easy to
be dictated to by the architect

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.690
in a certain way, especially

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:01.380
as their creations become
more frothy, you know?

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:02.680
&gt;&gt; N Yeah.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.980
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Acrobatic.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.280
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: Yeah.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.580
It's an interesting
point that you bring up.

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:09.750
As I mentioned earlier,
many, many architects are --

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:16.770
would be or could be very talented
photographers if they had the time

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:21.340
and had the equipment to do it.

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:25.790
However, when it comes to the
documentation of their own work,

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:32.000 position:56%
they usually seek out a photographer
with whom they feel compatible

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.380 position:56%
and that they understand that once
they have worked with a photographer

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:39.910
who has gone out and documented
something that they have done

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:44.340
and that they like it, then
they become more trusting.

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:45.640
And then they give -- they tend

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.050
to give the photographer
less and less instruction.

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:53.580
And that works usually to both
the benefit of the photographer

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:57.060
and the architect because sometimes
an architect doesn't always --

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:58.770
you know, they're so
close to the design

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:01.800
that they don't necessarily
see it objectively.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.550 position:56%
You know, it's an interesting thing.

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:07.730
And the other I think very
particularly interesting aspect

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:11.070
of architectural photography
is which is more important,

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:14.920
the quality of the
architecture or the photograph?

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.940
And that's an interesting
question to pose.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.240
And it's surprising that --

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.900
and quite a number of instances
you get collections of photographs

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.170
of the work of a particular
architect

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:32.850
without any acknowledgement
of who took those photographs.

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:37.250 position:56%
And yet, they can be -- they can be
widely divergent and very different.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:38.870
I personally find that clients
who give me more direction end

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:40.170
up really -- you know, sometimes,
you know, they might say, "Okay,

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:41.470
we want it done this way."

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:42.770
Okay. You do it that way, but
you also do it your own way too,

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:44.070
show them the two, and then
afterwards, you know what?

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.370
Your way was better?

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:46.670
[ Laughter ]

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:47.970
Because you're -- you know,
that's really what you do.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:49.870
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: And in
a way you become a proxy

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:51.170
for the first visitor.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:52.470
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: Yeah.

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:53.770
Yeah.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:59.600
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: This is the first
experience, and it's a reflection,

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.740
I imagine, that some architects
don't like held up to them.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.040
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: Well, maybe not.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.340
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: It's a way

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:09.560
of showing whether their
building succeeds or fails.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.860
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: Yeah.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.590
Most architects recognize how
important the documentation

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.730
of their buildings is because
only a certain proportion

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:18.890
of their audience will actually get

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.910
to see the finished
product in many cases.

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:24.290
And therefore, they're
really seeing it --

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.020
they're seeing an interpretation
of the design by somebody else.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.320
And that person has to
be on the same wavelength

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.620
for that to be successful.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:36.430
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: And those
processing [inaudible] now.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:39.230
The building on the left
is skewed to the left.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:43.990
Were you -- do you use the
post [inaudible] software

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:47.620
where it just straightens
those buildings up?

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.920
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: I could have.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.220
You're talking about this building?

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.520
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Correct.

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.820
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: Yeah.

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:55.370
I must admit that I -- one
of the things at Ground Zero

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:58.790
that you can't do is use tripods.

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:03.710
So I have to -- and using a
tilt shift lens on a camera

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:06.490
and keeping it level is tough.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:08.980
I could have corrected
that afterwards.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.850
I didn't do so, and I could have.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.150
&gt;&gt; Do you -- okay.

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:16.090
But do you do that routinely
when you take images?

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:19.380
&gt;&gt; If I were -- if I had done
this on assignment for somebody,

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.680
I certainly would have, yes.

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.980
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Okay, good.

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:23.280
That's what --

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.580
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: Yeah.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.110
Yes, those sort of tech -- it
depends on who your audience is.

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:30.940
For a general audience,
the point of this is, okay,

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:34.250
it's a familiar part
of Manhattan now.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:37.170
And just the inclusion of this
little girl who just rushed

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:38.870
into the picture at the
last minute, I said, "Wow,

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.170
[laughter] I got to get that."

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.170
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: Well, I think
you sort of answered this question

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:50.920
in a few ways, but I
wanted to ask it again.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.910
You used the phrase
documentary a number of times.

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:57.320
And so -- and you reference it, and
this is a good example [inaudible].

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.250
How much -- you say an
architect might have a vision,

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:04.380
and you sort of have a way
that you like to shoot.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.900
Is the way that you
like to shoot to --

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:10.570
is it important to you to
have it being documentary

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.750 position:56%
so that it's as correct as possible?

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:14.510
So you had fun with the fish eye.

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:17.490
But as part of your motivation
and the photographs that you take

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:20.820
that you would like for it
to be perspective corrected

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:23.430 position:56%
and that you're trying to make it --

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:26.310
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: I just start
-- I just -- well, the main --

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:27.610
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: How
does that [inaudible]?

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: The main -- yeah.

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:32.230
The main objective simply would
be to produce a photograph

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:37.960
that is comfortable enough that
the fewer is not preoccupied

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.880
with the method that has been used

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.930
to document the thing
in the first place.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:43.620
You know, you -- in other words,

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.460
when you look at an
architectural photographer --

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.870
a photograph, you want
the viewer to say, "Ooh,

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:50.530
that's a great looking building.

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.390
That's terrific."

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:55.230
You don't want them to
say, "Wow, I wonder --

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:56.530
that's a marvelous photograph.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:00.220
I wonder how that was done."

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.980
Then maybe the photographer
has overdone it

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:07.850
because then the photograph
itself becomes more important

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:09.150
than the subject.

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:11.980 position:56%
And that's a -- that's one of the --

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.090
one of the big quandaries

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:17.170
with architectural
photography in general.

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:21.110
And it's one of the reasons
that architectural photographers

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:26.710
in general are not as widely
known to the general public

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.970
as photographers in
some other fields.

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:33.590
Ford?

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:36.900
&gt;&gt; Ford Peatross: Has that client
dynamic that you just described

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:41.900
over 50 years had any major shifts,
or is it still pretty steady?

00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:52.410
&gt;&gt; Norman McGrath: Well, it -- I
mean one thing that it has done is

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:59.450 position:56%
that because in fact many even
modest sized architectural firms can

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:07.100
afford to go out and buy a $3,000
camera like this and a $2,000 lens,

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:09.960
you know, $5,000 sounds
like a lot of money.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.740
But if that permits you to
get good quality photographs,

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:18.280
then a moderately skilled
photographer

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:25.490
who is not necessarily
professional can go out and capture

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:31.210
for an architect photographs
which are quite adequate for use

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:34.940
on a website or for reference
purposes, not necessarily

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:37.190
for publication, but maybe I
mean if they're good enough,

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.680
they could be for publication too.

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:44.000
So that -- I think architects
in general are doing more

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.870
of their own photography than
has been true in the past.

00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:53.390 position:56%
They are doing it now because this
is an infinitely easier to learn how

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:57.920
to use and to use than a four
by five view camera ever was.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:04.240
&gt;&gt; Just a note from the
[inaudible], they have to close.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.550
&gt;&gt; Oh, they have to close.

00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:06.850
Okay.

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:08.150
&gt;&gt; This is official
[inaudible] continues.

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:09.450
I'm the [inaudible].

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:10.750
[ Laughter ]

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:12.550
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:17.060
[ Applause ]

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.950
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
