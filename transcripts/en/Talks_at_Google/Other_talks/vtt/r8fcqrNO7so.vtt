00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.350
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Hello everybody.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.350
Welcome.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.180
My name is Chip Conley.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.510
I'm not Bill Clinton and I'm not the Dalai
Lama.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.900
I was third choice of Meng's to actually introduce
him today.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.430
[laughter] But I'm incredibly honored to be
here as a friend of Meng.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.690
I'm just a huge fan of him and his work.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.160
In preparation for being here today, I decided
to google "Meng" and "search inside yourself".

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.880
The first thing that came up was "Mengstupiditis",
which I didn't know that you had this website,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880
Meng.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.460
But he has a website called Mengstupiditis.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.610
There's actually a little point in that website
where he says -- there's a picture of him

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.219
-- and it just says, "I'm just a random generic
guy."

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.220
There's a picture of him and Barack Obama.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.680
So I don't -- [laughter] I actually think,
although it doesn't say it on his website,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.110
I think the symptom of Mengstupiditis is excessive
need for getting your photo taken with famous

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.110
people.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.850
I don't know about you, but I think that's
one of Meng's more endearing qualities.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.360
I think he should have named the book "How
To Be A Jolly Good Fellow."

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.870
But what I love about Meng more than anything
is his combination of humility and humor.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.860
In looking at that website, the Mengstupiditis
website, there was a wonderful little poem

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.900
that he wrote last month called "The Not Difficult
Path".

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.220
I'm going to read it to you very quickly,
it's very short, and then we'll have him up

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.220
here.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.640
Meng says, "With calm mind, I see my true
nature.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.080
With jolliness, I open Dharma doors.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.500
With open heart, I welcome my Buddha.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.780
And with non-doing, I enlighten the world."

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.720
Meng, come please, enlighten us.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720
Thank you.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.720
[applause]

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.000
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Thank you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.160
Thank you.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:23.950
I like to stand behind the podium so you can
see less of me.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.040
It's always an improvement when you see less
of me.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.450
[laughs] So welcome.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.450
[inaudible].

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.320
Thank you, Chip.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.510
Chip is a wonderful, beautiful human being.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.340
It's always nice to be introduced by you.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.420
Thank you.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.640
I want to start by telling you a famous Zen
parable.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.610
It's a parable of the guy on the horse.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.490
So some guy was riding on a horse, and he
was passing by some guy walking on the street,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.270
or standing on the street.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.800
The guy standing on the street asks the guy
on the horse, "So, rider, where are you going?"

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.500
And the guy on the horse says, "I don't know,
why are you asking me?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.780
You should be asking the horse.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.220
How do I know?"

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.950
So this is a parable about our emotional lives.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.120
The horse signifies our emotion, or emotional
life.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.740
Usually, we allow a horse to take us where
the horse wants to take us.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.569
We don't think we have any control.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.180
But in fact, I want to tell you today that
we do have control.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.760
To this, the book in general and to this talk
is about mastery.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.569
But first, I think even beyond allowing the
horse to take you where he wants, I think

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.070
most of the time we analyze this.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.500
We're like, "The horse is dragging us."

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.320
And especially if we're experiencing emotions
like fear, nervousness.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.290
For example, you're speaking in front of a
crowd of a hundred people, and you're going

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.290
on YouTube.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.250
For example, that could be nerve wracking,
right?

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.040
I don't know, I'm just creating the example.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.830
Or anger, and things like that.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.280
Then you feel like, "I have no control.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.930
I have lost control."

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.819
You feel like you're being dragged along.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:16.780
Search Inside Yourself is the idea that you
can improve on that.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.560
The first level of improvement is going from
that to this.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.280
[laughter]
Looking cool.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.190
[more laughter]
And smoking a Marlboro.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.620
But no, I'm just kidding.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.780
But looking cool.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.780
So you're on the horse, and you don't just
look cool.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.710
You get to at least have influence on where
you want the horse to go.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.940
To a certain degree, you get to control the
horse.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.750
The horse still has his own mind, in the same
way our emotional processes have a quote-on-quote

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.750
"own mind".

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.590
But you get to control it, guide it where
it wants to go.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.800
However, it gets even better.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.040
You can go from this skillfulness into this
mastery, like you stand on a horse and so

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.040
on.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.130
I wish the Geshes were here.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.830
I think they would appreciate this.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.450
So this is emotional mastery.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:14.600
The question then is, "What does emotional
mastery look like in the context of work?"

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.620
I think that emotional mastery manifests itself
in the type of statement we make about ourselves

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.900
in relation to our emotional skills and success.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.830
Oh, the Geshes are here.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.460
Okay, I'll just continue talking.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.270
[laughs] [pause]
For example, the example of those statements.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.200
We tell ourselves, "If I have strong self-awareness,
I'll be so successful.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.699
If I can remain calm and confident in crisis,
I'll be so successful.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.460
If I can create optimism and resilience, I'll
be so successful.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.930
And if I can understand people better, then
I can instinctively like people, and it can

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.000
help people like me.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.639
I'll be so successful."

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.639
So all these qualities that I've talked about:
confidence, awareness, optimism, and so on,

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:19.860
they come under the umbrella of emotional
intelligence, which is defined as this: the

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.550
ability to monitor one's or the others' feeling
to discriminate among them.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.280
And, most importantly, to use this information
to guide one's thinking and actions.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.090
This is emotional intelligence.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.240
The good news.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.729
The good news is that these qualities are
skills.

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.400
And like all other skills, these skills are
trainable.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400
Emotional skills are trainable.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.480
Emotional intelligence is trainable.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480
That's the good news.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.050
However, there's better news.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.460
The other thing with me, there's no bad news.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.610
There's good news and better news.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.650
This is why people like me, I mean, in addition
to my good looks.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:05.419
[laughter] The better news is that we've found
running Search Inside Yourself that those

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:12.520
skills are trainable to a meaningful degree
in as little as seven weeks.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.400
Seven weeks you can train to a large degree
of those skills.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.380
This is what Search Inside Yourself is about.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:25.820
Search Inside Yourself is an EI, or emotional
intelligence, curriculum for adults.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.699
A cartoon to show what that looks like.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:36.850
[pause]
The question then is, "How do you --" hello,

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.380
welcome.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:45.590
[pause] It looks like I'm being nice and waiting
for guests to sit, but I'm just taking a break,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.990
drinking my water.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.550
People think, "Meng is so nice" but no.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.509
[laughter] Just kidding, just kidding.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:00.620
How do you learn emotional intelligence?

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.380
It turns out that you cannot learn emotional--
it's just by reading the book.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.770
You can learn about EI, but you cannot learn
EI.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.770
In the same way, there's an analogy.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.430
The analogy is the gym.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.720
Exercise, working out.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:25.240
You can learn about getting fit, but the only
way to get fit is to do it, is exercising.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:34.669
So therefore, to acquire emotional skills
requires training, just like to acquire muscles

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.169
requires training.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:42.400
The question then is, "What are we training?"

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.560
We are training the brain.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:53.379
We can do that because of something called
neuroplasticity, which is the discovery that

00:08:53.379 --> 00:09:00.339
what you do, what you think, and what you
pay attention to changes the structure and

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:03.910
functions of our brains, even for adults.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.999
Even for engineers.

00:09:04.999 --> 00:09:08.610
[laughter] The most important part is attention.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.149
What you pay attention to changes the structure
of the brain.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:18.850
That is how we can acquire emotional and mental
skills, by training our brain with our attention,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.189
which I'll talk about soon.

00:09:20.189 --> 00:09:24.910
Which leads us to another question -- oh,
by the way, and this is a very important insight.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:30.009
The insight that even adults and even engineers
can train their brains.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:35.290
Which leads us again to the next question,
which is, "How do you train emotional intelligence?"

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:39.800
It turns out; all you need is three easy steps.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:48.019
Step 1 is attention training, Step 2 is self-knowledge
and self-mastery, and Step 3 is to create

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:49.019
mental habits.

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:51.610
Now I will talk about this in some detail.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.519
By the way, the cartoons you see on the slides
are the cartoons in the book.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.600
So the book has cartoons.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.459
I know, I was writing -- I told myself, "If
I'm writing a serious book about emotional

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:07.139
intelligence and mindfulness, it has to have
cartoons.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.959
Whoever heard of a serious book without cartoons?"

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:11.970
This is why I did that.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.220
Anyway.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:21.120
[laughs] The first step is this, is training
attention, which is counterintuitive.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.829
We talk about attention.

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:29.029
You come to a class that calls itself an emotional
intelligence class.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:32.339
What has attention got to do with emotional
intelligence?

00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:36.119
It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.

00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:42.689
So here is where it makes sense: the attention
we're talking about is to basically create

00:10:42.689 --> 00:10:49.869
a quality of mind which is this, which allows
you to be calm and clear, at the same time,

00:10:49.869 --> 00:10:52.050
on demand.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:58.130
The idea is to develop your mind, develop
your attention to such a degree that whatever

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.363
situation you're in, whether you're just hanging
out, speaking in front of the public, or under

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:10.119
stress, customers shouting at you, deadlines,
bosses are looking at you, and you can drop

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:16.779
into the state where you mind is calm and
clear, and at the same time, on demand.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:21.519
And that, my friends, that is the foundation
of emotional intelligence.

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.779
Again, the good news is this is highly trainable.

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:27.319
Again, this leads to a question.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:31.050
Yeah, it's highly trainable, but how do you
do this, how do you train this quality of

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.300
mind?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.749
The answer is very simple.

00:11:35.749 --> 00:11:37.040
It's embarrassingly simple.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.889
It is a true technique called mindfulness.

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:51.269
[inaudible]You're going to laugh at me because
it's so embarrassingly simple is this: mindfulness,

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:59.410
[pause] [laughter]
mindfulness is paying attention, but not just

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.410
paying attention.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:08.049
Paying attention in a particular way, on purpose,
in the present moment, non-judgmentally.

00:12:08.049 --> 00:12:11.480
Thus said, that is mindfulness.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.259
It's so embarrassingly simple that we can
even do it in a couple of seconds.

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:20.529
So I'm going to invite everybody to do a ten
second exercise.

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:22.980
It's very, very simple.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.910
All you have to do is to bring a gentle attention
to your breath, the process of breathing,

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.810
whatever it means to you, and then if attention
wanders away, just bring it back very gently.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.499
Thus said, we're just going to do ten seconds,
which is one breath.

00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:37.980
Easy to do, right?

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.980
Even an engineer can do that.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.519
But because I'm an engineer, I'm going to
time ten seconds.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.200
[laughs]
[laughter]

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200
Okay.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.369
So, ten seconds, attention to the breath,
beginning now.

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:53.769
Very gentle attention to the process of breathing.

00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:57.629
If attention wanders away, just bring it back.

00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:00.119
That is all.

00:13:00.119 --> 00:13:02.170
And that was ten seconds.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.570
Easy.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.069
So easy anybody can do it.

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:07.160
So that's the embarrassing part.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:14.319
The hard part is doing this-- being able to
deepen the mind of mindfulness, like calm

00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:15.949
and clear.

00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:21.060
Deepen it and bring your on demand, and stay
in it for as long as you want.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.060
So that's the hard part.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:28.239
The easy part is, you know what it is, you
can bring it about in ten seconds in a semi-controlled

00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:32.879
environment, where there's nobody fighting
each other or something.

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:34.739
It's easy.

00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:40.199
You might ask the question, which is a valid
question, except it's what I call a WTF question,

00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:45.880
which is: "It sounds so embarrassingly easy,
what good can it possibly do?"

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:52.290
You bring attention to it -- what good can
it possibly do for you?

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.329
It turns out it does wonders.

00:13:56.329 --> 00:14:02.069
Here's the analogy, the physical exercise
analogy: what you just did is the equivalent

00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:05.470
of me telling you, giving you a dumbbell and
saying, "Do this once."

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.839
It sounds stupid, right?

00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:11.230
You take a heavy object, you lift it, you
put it down.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.739
What can that possibly do for me?

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:18.119
It turns out that if you can do this enough,
you develop strength.

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:22.790
Once you develop strength, you realize that
you can do things that you can never imagine

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.899
before you were strong.

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:32.639
A simple thing like this, a simple practice,
done repeatedly, over, so practice, over a

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:36.089
long stretch of time, changes you.

00:14:36.089 --> 00:14:38.199
That is the power of mindfulness.

00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:40.959
So what does it do?

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.800
How does it change you?

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.440
A couple of things.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.249
[pause]
The first change you realize if you practice

00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:54.660
a lot of mindfulness, like I said, very simple
techniques, giving attention to breath.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.989
The first effect you find the perception changes.

00:14:59.989 --> 00:15:03.660
Specifically, the quality of perception changes.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:09.929
You see things in more clarity, especially,
specifically, the process of emotion, the

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:10.929
process of thought.

00:15:10.929 --> 00:15:11.929
You can see in clarity.

00:15:11.929 --> 00:15:16.100
But I talk about it a bit more detailed.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:22.079
The second thing it does-- so it sharpens
the mind, increases the quality of attention,

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:24.999
and it calms the mind.

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:31.230
This practice, done often enough, once again
mastery of it, in the middle of stress, you

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:36.759
can just bring attention to the breath and
your mind is calm.

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:37.759
That easily.

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:38.759
If people think, "Wow, nothing can bother
you."

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:39.759
It's not true.

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:42.720
Things bother you, but you calm yourself on
demand.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.189
So what's the proof?

00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:51.470
There's a study done-- this is one of the
earliest fMRI studies done on highly achieved,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.850
highly enlightened monks, like the monks we
have in the audience today.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:01.720
People with between 10 and 50,000 hours of
meditation training.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.939
This involves the part of the brain called
the amygdala, which is a very special part

00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:08.749
of the brain.

00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:12.509
The amygdala, it has to do with emotion.

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:17.220
It's especially active when you perceive a
threat.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.220
It doesn't have to be real.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.160
You just have to perceive it.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.579
Examples of perception of threat.

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:26.220
One example is if you see a saber-tooth tiger
running at you.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.419
Now that's perception of threat.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:32.859
Another perception of threat is when the boss
comes to you and says, "Meng, we need to talk."

00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:34.649
[laughter] [pants]
Oh, crap!

00:16:34.649 --> 00:16:35.649
You know?

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:37.329
That's perception of threat.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.279
The amygdala likes that.

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:44.160
An interesting thing about the amygdala is
that it has a very privileged position in

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.419
the brain, which is that when it activates,
when it perceives a threat, it takes over.

00:16:49.419 --> 00:16:55.639
The way it takes over is that it shuts down
the executive part of the brain, the prefrontal

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:57.119
cortex, over here.

00:16:57.119 --> 00:17:02.540
You almost, not literally, yeah, you almost
literally stop thinking.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.540
You just react.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.839
Then, gradually, this "Oh my God, I don't
believe I just said that to the boss!

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.021
I just told the boss to go do whatever."

00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:15.280
[laughter] And then we tell ourselves, "I
wasn't thinking."

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.930
Well, it turns out neurologically, you were
not thinking, like for real, literally.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.370
That mechanism has been around for millions
of years.

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.380
It's there for a good reason: it helps us
survive.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.350
If you see a saber-tooth tiger running at
you, you don't want to think, "Oh, is that

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.350
dangerous?

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.350
Should I google this?"
[laughter]

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.880
Wait a minute, Google hasn't been invented.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.170
This sounds like a problem.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.420
You don't want to go to this.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.410
It's just a "Oh, crap.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.410
Run!"

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.520
So that's how the mechanism works.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.310
Unfortunately, it has slight negative consequences
that we have today.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.650
Because if the amygdala triggers all the time,
it's not very healthy.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.350
It causes problems.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.230
Especially if you're shouting at the boss.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.430
Career-limiting.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.030
[laughter]
However, the question then is, "Is it possible

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.250
to down regulate something as primitive as
the amygdala?"

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.760
Well, of course not.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.890
It sounds stupid.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.040
It turns out the answer is yes.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.050
Accomplished monks like the Geshes we have,
we can do this.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:14.360
It's shown in the fMRI that they can down
regulate something as primitive as the amygdala.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.501
And the more practice they have, the more
effectively they can do that.

00:18:17.501 --> 00:18:19.130
That is fascinating.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:25.170
This was one of the beginnings, the birth
of contemplative neuroscience.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:32.030
One of the first glimpses into the mind of
a meditator, from fMRI. [pause]

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.650
One of the objections, here we see the graph,
is that, "Yeah, this is like 10,000 hours

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.650
of training.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.760
I don't have 10,000 hours to meditate."

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.391
Happily, so again like good news and better
news.

00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:43.470
Good news is this works.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:48.660
Better news is that it turns out you do not
need 10,000 hours.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.560
The latest research I've seen is-- anybody
want to guess?

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.130
Those who haven't been to my class, by the
way.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.270
Anybody want to guess how little time it takes
to have a measurable effect?

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.500
[pause]
Okay, no guesses.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.060
I'll tell you: One-hundred minutes.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.290
That's slightly more than an hour.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:09.350
One-hundred minutes is all it takes for it
to begin to have a measurable effect, for

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.950
your life to begin changing.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.950
Fascinating stuff.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.970
Okay, let me see.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.220
[inaudible] Okay. so this is step 1.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.110
Step 1 is attention training.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:31.910
Mindfulness, another way to see mindfulness
is this: it is like [pause] your mind is like

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:38.680
a flag fluttering in the wind, in motion or
in distress.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.310
Mindfulness is like a flagpole that in this
case literally grounds the mind.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:49.490
This is how you can remain under stress [blows]
and yet stable at the same time.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.450
This is one way to look at mindfulness.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.680
So this is step 1: attention training.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.910
So, what is step 2?

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:03.310
Step 2 is self-knowledge and self-mastery
using attention.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.620
What does that mean again?

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.180
Let's begin with a picture.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.860
I'm going to show you a picture.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.870
Okay.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:15.210
If you look at this picture, you don't know
what it says.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.110
However, if we do two things to the picture.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.340
The first thing we do is we increase resolution.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:30.220
The second thing we do is we increase vividness,
or in this case vividness means brightness

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.170
and contrast.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.350
What happens?

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:40.140
If you do that-- excuse me-- you find that
you have useful information that was hidden

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.970
from you before.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:47.550
In this case, for those who can't see, it's
Colonel Sanders trying to hide the recipe

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.560
of chicken.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.040
[laughs]
If not for Colonel Sanders, you can see the

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.860
recipe already.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:21:01.740
[laughs] [pause]
So the equivalent of the analogy is this:

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:08.571
in the mind, when your attention becomes--
when you have training in mindfulness, your

00:21:08.571 --> 00:21:14.740
attention not just becomes calm, it also becomes
sharp.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.910
And what that means is two things.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:24.130
First thing it does is it increases the resolution
at which you perceive the process of emotion.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.130
What does that mean?

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.860
So resolution is on two dimensions.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.550
There's a spatial dimension and a temporal
dimension.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.131
Spatial dimension means that you're able to
perceive changes in the emotional process

00:21:35.131 --> 00:21:38.280
that you never noticed before.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:44.110
For example, to make this substantial, you
begin to be able to see-- oh, later.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:51.000
Temporal resolution is the ability to see
changes in small deltas in time.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.830
Combined together, to make it substantial,
it means for example, the ability to see an

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:03.120
emotion the moment it is arising, and to see
the emotion the moment it is seizing and all

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.840
the tiny changes in between.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.900
The mind acquires that ability.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.470
Hmm.
[laughs]

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.470
Oops.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.200
Okay, we're back to this.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.890
So that's what it does for you.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.660
It creates-- so that's resolution.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.200
What is vividness?

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.000
Vividness is when you increase the signal
to noise ratio.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.620
Parts of an emotional process that was almost
hidden from view.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.520
You begin to see it in clarity.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.850
So combined, you begin to get useful information
about yourself.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.590
What does that mean substantially?

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:43.580
Substantially, it means that you begin to
see yourself objectively from a third-person

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.580
perspective.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:51.470
Instead of seeing your emotion going wild,
I can see this anxiousness from a third point

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.030
of view.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:58.760
This is what it is like to have a certain
experience of emotion.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.140
Rather than I'm experiencing it, I see it
objectively.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:09.180
The way that works is it has to do with the
insula.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:15.600
There are parts of the brain here on both
sides called the insula.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.360
They are related to a few things.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.340
The first thing they are related to is awareness
of bodily sensations, especially visceral

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.750
sensations, sensations inside the chest and
stomach.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:32.080
The second thing it's correlated to is awareness
of emotion.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.240
A third thing, surprisingly, is empathy.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:44.050
So people with strong insulas are strong in
all three dimensions.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.440
It turns out the insula can be trained.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.390
It's very easy.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:52.610
All you have to do is to bring attention to
the body.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:53.610
That's all.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.510
If you do that a lot, every time you do that
you strengthen a little bit more.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:04.050
If you do that a lot, you become very aware
of yourself or your emotions.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.290
The question then again is "What does that
do for you?"

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.610
It's like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm aware that I'm
feeling anger at the moment.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.610
Whatever."

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:19.360
There are a couple of very useful things,
and they're so useful that the degree of self-awareness

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.240
that you can gain can create profound changes
in your life.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.160
Let me give you some examples.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:34.970
[pause] The first example is that if you're
able to perceive an emotion the moment it

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:40.670
is arising, that gives you the power to turn
it off if you want to.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.990
It gives you choice.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.170
Therefore, you have a choice of, "Hmm, I feel
anger rising.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.930
Should I be angry or should I be not?"

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:48.930
You can choose.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:53.930
I mean, there are situations where I chose
to be angry, and because I was getting ripped

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:54.930
off.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.130
I figured the best reaction is to put that
other people.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:03.100
What it can bring off is to become generally
angry, I faced them and banged on the table.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.570
And the situations where you're "Nah, I don't
want to be angry, especially since she's my

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:07.570
boss.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:08.830
Let's turn it off."

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:09.830
So you have a choice.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.040
The first thing, already, this is life-changing.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.800
If you have to ability to turn off anger.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.320
Already, it changes your life.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320
That's one.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320
It gets better.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:24.010
Another example is that if you have a lot
of strong self-awareness, emotional awareness,

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.330
the emotional awareness translates into self-assessment.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.580
You get to know yourself a bit better.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.980
You get to know your resources.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.900
This is what I'm good at, this is what I'm
bad at.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.180
These are my strengths, these are my weaknesses.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.950
This is what I really like to do, this is
what makes me happy, and so on.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:45.170
And the effect of that is that once you are
able to figure out, quote on quote your "deepest

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.710
values and motivations", then you know what
opportunities to look out for.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.350
That could change your life.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.630
For example, let's say you are good at coding.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.760
So you know, "Writing code makes me happy."

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.830
But suppose that you took SIY and then you
know something beyond that.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.620
You know that beyond writing code, something
else makes me happy, which is connecting people.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.350
Just saying, just an example.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:19.000
If you discover that motivation in yourself,
then when Google starts a project called Google+,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
what do you do?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.990
It's like "Oh my God, this is what I want
to work on.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:24.150
This is it."

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:28.600
If you did not have the insight, the opportunity
would just come and go.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.360
However, because you had the insight, you
catch the opportunity when it's there.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.860
Therefore, you're always successful.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.050
And then people will think you're very lucky.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.430
I mean, you're lucky, but at the same time,
you're there to catch your opportunities and

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:47.280
you're able to catch opportunities because
you have deep knowledge of self.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.490
So that's another example of how it changes
your life.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.820
Very simple practices, changing your life.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:02.690
There's a third one, which is even more profound,
which is this: if you experience an emotion,

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:07.390
we like to think that our emotions are existential
experiences.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.510
What does that mean?

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:15.480
We like to think the emotion itself, is us.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.070
And it reflects in the language that you use.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.420
For example, we say, "I am angry.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.060
I am sad.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.120
I am happy."

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.130
So the emotion becomes me.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.300
I become the emotion.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:38.110
However, as the power of your mind, the sharpness
of mind, your resolution, your vividness becomes

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.640
stronger over time.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:46.260
You discover something about a process of
emotion and then you read an emotion in a

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.230
very subtle way that has a profound change
in your life.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:55.830
And that profound change is this: is going
from existential to experiential, which means

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.900
going from "I am angry" to "I'm experiencing
anger.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.100
I'm experiencing happiness, or sadness, or
whatever."

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.880
What does that change?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.809
Now it changes from "I am this, this is me"
to "My mind is like a sky."

00:28:10.809 --> 00:28:14.630
Then emotions are the clouds occupying the
mind, but they're not the mind.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.630
So that's a powerful shift.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.630
But wait, it gets better.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:20.630
For only $9.99-- no.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:26.490
The way it gets better [laughs] which is there
is another step you can go.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:31.070
As your attention becomes even more refined,
you discover something else, beyond being

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.130
experiential.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:38.050
You discover that the process of emotion,
the experience of emotion is physiological.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:41.170
You experience emotions in the body.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.360
Every emotion has a bodily correlate.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.690
And then you discover something.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:54.140
You discover that painful emotions are not
that different from painful feelings in the

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.140
body.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.020
For example, I hurt my hand.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.260
Ow!

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.980
And then I know this is pain, I know this
is unpleasant, but the pain is not me.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.260
It is a sensation in my body.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.740
Having that perception changes everything.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.080
Because it's not me, I can do things about
it.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.300
I can take Tylenol.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.110
I can massage.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.559
I can put in ice.

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:20.190
Or I can ignore it.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.870
Or I can experience it mindfully.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.809
Or I can just eat ice cream and forget all
about it.

00:29:23.809 --> 00:29:24.809
And so on.

00:29:24.809 --> 00:29:28.140
There are things I can do because this experience
is not me.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.610
It's just an experience in my body.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:40.830
That is the power of this-- oh, I already
put it up, okay-- of this change in perception,

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.680
of framing from existential to physiological.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.810
And this is one of those insights that will
change; that can change your life.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.830
Just one of many in Search Inside Yourself,
to change your life.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:30:02.270
So that is part 2 [pause] which is self-knowledge
and self-mastery.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.380
You might think, "This is it, this is emotional
intelligence."

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.380
But wait!

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.380
There is more.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.210
It gets better.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.480
So there's step 3.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.860
By the way, everything I say is incremented
improvements.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.170
So if you only do one, it's already huge.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:20.059
If you do a second one, it's even huger.

00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:25.770
And now it's hugest, huger-er. [laughter]
Which is creating mental habits.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:32.640
I say "useful mental habits", but specifically,
they are habits, they are conducive for social

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.400
skillfulness.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.400
What does that mean?

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.530
Let me give you a few examples.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:42.610
The first habit that is very conducive to
being socially skillful is the habit of kindness,

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.610
or loving-kindness.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:49.290
That is a habit of looking at any human being,
anyone you've never met before.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.059
Looking at any human being, my first thought
is, "I want this person to be happy."

00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:56.960
I want this person to be happy: that's just
it.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:03.420
Already, you can imagine if you have that
mental habit coming effortlessly, it changes

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.740
everything.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.210
You go into a meeting room; you look at everybody,
you think, "I want all these people to be

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.520
happy."

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:16.480
It reflects unconsciously in your body, your
face, your language, your tone of voice, your

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.240
facial expression.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.929
Because it reflects unconsciously, it's picked
up unconsciously by the other person.

00:31:23.929 --> 00:31:25.600
Their feeling, their perception is, "I like
this person.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.880
I don't know why.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.000
This Meng guy, I really like him.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Maybe it's his good looks.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I don't know."

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.550
[laughter] But it's not just the good looks,
it's because I'm wishing for this person to

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.550
be happy.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:39.380
I want Tara to be happy, and Tara can sense
it unconsciously.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.390
In a situation like meetings and so on, if
you have that mental habit all the time, people

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:45.890
want to work with you.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.980
Then you find yourself becoming successful.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.150
You're not clear why.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.440
But it's this; it's just simple things like
that.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.740
So here's one example.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.880
The other example is the habit of human similarity.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.770
The habit of looking at a human being and
thinking, "This person is just like me."

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.601
But in three specific dimensions, by the way.

00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:05.601
Not like every way.

00:32:05.601 --> 00:32:10.730
It's not like Chip and I, like we're so alike
only our moms can tell us apart.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.280
Not like that.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.650
Just like me, three dimensions.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:20.120
The first is looking at any human-- oh, especially
in a situation of conflict, this is very useful.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.420
Looking at any human being in a situation
of conflict, "This is a human being, just

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.130
like me.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.150
This person wants to be happy, just like me.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:31.760
This person wants to be free from suffering,
just like me."

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.559
This is it: three things.

00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:36.220
Three things alone can do wonders.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.650
It changes in the situation of conflict.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.120
It changes how you react.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.880
It changes how you solve the problem.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.800
It creates a possibility of solving the problem.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.770
Changes are really what makes you successful.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:52.300
So just a cartoon to show-- there was a right
way to do "just like me."

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:59.429
A wrong way to do "just like me" would be
this.

00:32:59.429 --> 00:33:03.830
Don't do this.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.340
[laughs]
Beyond talking, I want to create some things

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.540
that we can bring home today, that are useful
for you already.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.179
The first useful practice is mindfulness,
bringing attention to the breath.

00:33:14.179 --> 00:33:16.920
If there's any distraction, to let it go.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.929
I want to introduce you to a very simple second
practice.

00:33:19.929 --> 00:33:26.530
Again, it's one of those ten second practices
that if you do a lot, will change your life.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:32.260
The practice is a random intention of kindness.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.010
The idea is look at any human being at random
and think, "I want that person to be happy."

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:41.410
That's it.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.650
If you want to, I want to invite you to participate.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:49.170
In the next ten seconds, look at two random
human beings in this room and just think to

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.270
yourself, "I want this person to be happy."

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.900
Okay?

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:52.900
Ten seconds.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.550
Don't say it, just think it.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:04.340
[pause] Well, this is it.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.000
Kind of fun, right?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.660
[laughs] Kind of fun.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.119
I mean, first it changes your life, you do
it a lot.

00:34:10.119 --> 00:34:14.730
But beyond changing your life, you might find
that the intention that you're wanting other

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.139
people to be happy is intrinsically rewarding.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.149
I think it has to do with evolution.

00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:24.869
Being altru-social beings, wanting the other
to be happy, creates the conditions for altru-sociality,

00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:28.460
for trying to survive.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.460
So try this a lot.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.830
When you walk out of this room, every hour
or so, just look at a random human being and

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.450
say, "I want that person to be happy."

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.019
Really think that thought.

00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:38.239
And make it a habit.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:43.480
Oh, by the way, everything I just told it,
these informal practices, there are ways,

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.239
formal practices, to make them even better.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.239
So read the book.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:52.679
[laughs]
Again, the question: why does this matter?

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.080
I wish for people to be happy, helps me succeed.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.869
Why does it matter?

00:34:57.869 --> 00:35:01.470
It matters especially if you're a manager.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.770
If you're a leader.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:09.160
There was a study which I found fascinating,
which was published in '03.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:15.210
It showed this: in the study, they compared
a bunch of managers.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:20.640
They ranked them by effectiveness and they
compared the most effective top 25% of managers

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.260
in the company with the bottom 25% and figured
out what difference is between them.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:31.109
It turns out in their study there's only one
difference, which is a faction, which is the

00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:32.109
top managers.

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:35.809
They love people and they want to be loved.

00:35:35.809 --> 00:35:38.749
Somehow that makes them even more effective.

00:35:38.749 --> 00:35:44.099
It turns out there's a simpler explanation,
which is if people love you, they work harder

00:35:44.099 --> 00:35:45.099
for you.

00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:46.099
That's it.

00:35:46.099 --> 00:35:48.529
The quality of the work improves.

00:35:48.529 --> 00:35:54.769
But knowing the data, it turns out that being
loved is good for your career, especially

00:35:54.769 --> 00:35:55.769
if you're the boss.

00:35:55.769 --> 00:36:00.240
It's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds good,
but I'm sure there are limiting situations.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.170
I'm sure it doesn't work in the US Navy.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.789
It turns out in the US Navy, and this is a
study back from 1988.

00:36:08.789 --> 00:36:13.849
[laughter] A study on what makes the best
naval commanders.

00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:17.710
You think naval people, Navy, they give orders.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.160
"Make it so.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.160
Engage, fire.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.809
[laughs] Go wash the toilet."

00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:23.259
No, no.

00:36:23.259 --> 00:36:28.190
You'd think the tough people, the tough guys
don't do nice, and so on.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:34.161
Now it turns out, according to this study,
it's a famous study, even in the Navy, being

00:36:34.161 --> 00:36:35.161
nice works.

00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:41.059
Here it says the description of the most effective
naval commanders in the US.

00:36:41.059 --> 00:36:46.609
They are described as "more positive, outgoing,
emotionally expressive, dramatic, warmer,

00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:50.160
more sociable, appreciative and trustworthy,"
and so on.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.990
In other words, these are nice people, people
you want to hang out with.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.560
The title of this study is Nice Guys Finish
First.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.369
So even in the Navy.

00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:10.460
And just to reinforce the point again, um,
a comic: Nice Guys in the Military.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:15.630
[laughter]
So this is it.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.630
It's very simple.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.480
How to train emotional intelligence: three
easy steps.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.589
You come to SIY, this is it.

00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:25.280
In seven weeks, we go through this in detail,
of course.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.950
But these are the three basic steps.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:37.319
So our hope is that when we train emotional
intelligence, it helps to become more successful.

00:37:37.319 --> 00:37:39.200
It helps to become a better leader.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.470
And, I think more importantly, I think most
importantly, at least to me, is it creates

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.239
the conditions for happiness.

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:51.029
And happiness, I really like this definition,
which is "a deep sense of flourishing that

00:37:51.029 --> 00:37:56.210
arises from exceptionally healthy minds, not
the mere passable feeling of fleeting emotion

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:02.319
or mood, But an optimal state of being."

00:38:02.319 --> 00:38:06.160
This is from Matthieu Ricard who is one of
the happiest men in the world.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.160
There's a story behind it.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.950
We shall tell you when we have time.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:10.759
But this is it.

00:38:10.759 --> 00:38:16.980
What you learn, the emotional skills you learn
in Search Inside Yourself are, and in general.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:22.690
The emotional skills, the skill for self-awareness,
the skill for mastery over self, the skill

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:29.140
for loving-kindness and compassion, ultimately
what it does is this: creates the condition

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.420
for happiness for everybody.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:37.009
I want to create a happy world, so that's
what I do.

00:38:37.009 --> 00:38:38.009
So let me see.

00:38:38.009 --> 00:38:39.009
There are some more minutes.

00:38:39.009 --> 00:38:40.640
So does he actually work?

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:45.890
We've been running this in Google for about
five years.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:52.160
The feedback we get over and over again, which
most warms my heart, is this: oh, not the

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.160
circle.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.420
[laughs] The thing inside the circle.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.779
Which is "Your class changed my life."

00:38:58.779 --> 00:39:00.619
That's very powerful, right?

00:39:00.619 --> 00:39:06.359
I mean, imagine coming to work on a Monday
in the office, and you take a class in the

00:39:06.359 --> 00:39:08.819
office, and it changes your life.

00:39:08.819 --> 00:39:13.950
And just simple things like what we talked
about, like awareness, empathy, and so on.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.789
There are different ways people's lives have
been changed.

00:39:16.789 --> 00:39:21.279
Some people say, some of this is purely like
career wise.

00:39:21.279 --> 00:39:23.410
"I got my promotion because of SIY.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.890
It gave me the skills that got me my promotion."

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:30.940
Some people say, "I was going to leave Google,
and then doing SIY I discovered I love my

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.940
work.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.099
I decided to stay."

00:39:33.099 --> 00:39:36.910
And there are people who say, "My marriage
became better.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.330
I see myself through kinder sets of eyes.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.930
I see people in more kindness."

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.529
Profound changes in seven weeks.

00:39:44.529 --> 00:39:48.329
That warms my heart.

00:39:48.329 --> 00:39:53.819
The last part of this talk is the question
of: why did I do this?

00:39:53.819 --> 00:39:58.230
How did Search Inside Yourself begin?

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:02.249
Embarrassingly enough, it began with world
peace.

00:40:02.249 --> 00:40:08.210
[pause] Search Inside Yourself started because
I wanted to create the conditions for world

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:11.619
peace in my lifetime.

00:40:11.619 --> 00:40:16.359
The way it started was we have this thing
called "20% time project", but for those of

00:40:16.359 --> 00:40:22.999
you watching on TV, engineers, at least in
my days, when I was a young man, we could

00:40:22.999 --> 00:40:27.080
spend 20% of our time working on whatever
project we wanted.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:31.029
I figured since I could do whatever I wanted,
I might as well solve the toughest problem

00:40:31.029 --> 00:40:32.980
I know, which is world peace.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:38.400
I mean, like, mining asteroids; anybody can
do that.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.309
[laughter] World peace, that is tough.

00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:45.019
So I started thinking to myself.

00:40:45.019 --> 00:40:50.270
The first question asked, "What are the necessary
and sufficient conditions for world peace?"

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.270
I figured something out.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:56.289
I figured that the two conditions which are
necessary, each one insufficient, but combined

00:40:56.289 --> 00:40:57.539
maybe sufficient.

00:40:57.539 --> 00:41:00.240
The first is the end of global poverty.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.650
The second is inner peace, inner happiness,
and compassion on a global scale.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:09.539
Combined, I think they are necessary and sufficient.

00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:15.349
Then I figured since Gates and the rich guys
are working on the first one, the second one

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:17.890
nobody's working on it: I'll work on it.

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:18.890
How do I do that?

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:21.109
Then after a few months, I figured it out.

00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:25.970
I figured out that the way to create inner
peace, inner happiness, and compassion worldwide

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:31.579
is to align it with the success of individuals
and businesses.

00:41:31.579 --> 00:41:37.150
If you can create those qualities in ways
that help people succeed at work, that help

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.339
businesses' bottom lines, that's going to
stick.

00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:42.589
If it's just about goodness, oh, that's kinda
nice, go hug a tree.

00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:48.739
[laughter] But if it's like this thing, this
thing will help you get your next three promotions

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:52.019
and you will earn the company a lot of money.

00:41:52.019 --> 00:41:53.940
Oh, by the way, you will create world peace.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.380
Okay, so where do I sign up?

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:03.029
So the idea, there's a word for it, I'm blanking
on it right now.

00:42:03.029 --> 00:42:04.369
"Upaya": skillful means.

00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:10.769
Which means that to do something good, do
what aligns with the people's self-interest

00:42:10.769 --> 00:42:16.010
in a way that the goodness is a necessary
and unavoidable side effect.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:21.009
Help people succeed in a way where world peace
is the unavoidable side effect.

00:42:21.009 --> 00:42:23.309
That's what I'm trying to do.

00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:24.309
Good.

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:25.309
How do I do that?

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:28.069
And then a couple of months of thinking, I
figured it out.

00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:32.640
I figured out the way to do that is to create
a curriculum for emotional intelligence for

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640
adults.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.069
That was how SIY started.

00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:39.539
That was a story.

00:42:39.539 --> 00:42:47.759
So, SIY, Search Inside Yourself started or
began with the story of one funny little engineer

00:42:47.759 --> 00:42:50.589
and his pursuit for world peace.

00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:55.910
I hope that this story will have a funny and
happy ending.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.529
It's about world peace.

00:42:57.529 --> 00:43:00.640
I hope for a happy ending.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.780
So I set out to write a book.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.560
Oh, can I borrow it?

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.339
I will hold it up.

00:43:05.339 --> 00:43:10.250
So I set out to write a book that is funny
and practical.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:14.789
I hope it's life changing for the readers,
and there are a few people who told me it's

00:43:14.789 --> 00:43:17.039
life changing, just the book alone.

00:43:17.039 --> 00:43:18.220
I hope you like the book.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.160
And more importantly, I hope you change your
lives.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:27.400
I hope all of you will aspire to create the
conditions for world peace in your lifetimes

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.400
too.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.400
Thank you.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:34.769
[applause]
Okay, we have time for questions.

00:43:34.769 --> 00:43:36.329
Any questions?

00:43:36.329 --> 00:43:43.339
I guess do we need to use a mike?

00:43:43.339 --> 00:43:44.900
Okay, yes.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:51.269
Please use a mike. [pause] Oh, we have thirteen
minutes.

00:43:51.269 --> 00:43:52.269
Yes.

00:43:52.269 --> 00:44:00.390
&gt;&gt;male#1: If I imagine you being happy, I
imagine you doing some recreational activity,

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:05.450
maybe watching a football game, taking large
amounts of your recreational drug of choice,

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:07.390
I suppose it's beer.

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:10.309
I must be doing it wrong.

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:13.760
If I imagine you being happy or most people
being happy, just being made happy with the

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:19.799
smallest change, I imagine them being completely
contented and useless.

00:44:19.799 --> 00:44:21.479
I don't think I want to do that.

00:44:21.479 --> 00:44:23.269
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: That's right.

00:44:23.269 --> 00:44:24.619
Yeah, me neither.

00:44:24.619 --> 00:44:27.480
So I tell you my experience, which may or
may not be universal.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.920
I think it's universal.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:37.569
Which is that I discovered for myself that
if I'm in pursuit of happiness, then I'm just

00:44:37.569 --> 00:44:38.569
doing happiness.

00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:40.369
Something is holding me back from greater
service.

00:44:40.369 --> 00:44:47.650
However, if I'm already happy, and I feel
that I'm free to contribute, and that is how

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.369
I feel that I can go out and try to change
the world.

00:44:50.369 --> 00:44:54.170
Because if I succeed I don't gain anything,
if I fail I don't lose anything.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:56.880
Therefore, I'm free to try.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:04.599
So for me, having a source of happiness that
is not dependent on sensory input, having

00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:10.210
that was actually freeing, and it frees me
to do big stuff rather than the other way

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.210
around.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:12.210
Of course, I don't mind playing golf too.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.730
[laughs] Thank you.

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:14.849
Yes, you?

00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:18.390
&gt;&gt;male#2: I have two kinds of questions.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:20.210
This is really not challenging you.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:21.210
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Yeah, you're so wise.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.410
You ask me questions, I feel humble.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:28.440
&gt;&gt;male#2: This is something that I myself
had experienced during my visits here and

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.440
there.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.220
One is that, for example, the talk that you've
given right now is really enlightening and

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:35.570
wonderful.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:41.260
But I do similar kinds of talks also, so what
I normally find is that these kinds of beautiful

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:45.749
talks that were are giving, and those who
come to listen to these wonderful talks are

00:45:45.749 --> 00:45:48.440
already good people.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.970
So the question is: how can we reach to the
dictators?

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:59.170
The totally dead and selfish, arrogant people
who don't care about any of these things.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.319
Many of these people have the power to destroy.

00:46:02.319 --> 00:46:03.319
This is one question.

00:46:03.319 --> 00:46:09.930
The second thing is: the many wonderful activities
done by Google or many other companies, this

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:11.160
is really amazing.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.349
I'm completely amazed by the innovative that
you have here.

00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:21.410
But again here the problem is the fruit of
all these things that great companies do,

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:25.309
they seem to be again enjoyed by educated
and rich people.

00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:31.180
Does it go anywhere on a larger scale to the
really, really downtrodden people?

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.470
I would like to hear you visit on this too.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:34.609
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Okay.

00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:35.609
Thank you.

00:46:35.609 --> 00:46:36.609
Thank you.

00:46:36.609 --> 00:46:39.890
I think the first thing to know is that I
don't have any wisdom.

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.849
I'm just trying my best.

00:46:41.849 --> 00:46:51.270
[laughs] But having said that-- so the first
question about reaching the people who are

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:56.829
least, what's the word, not susceptible, least
receptive to this, which is why is "upaya"

00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:58.239
is so important.

00:46:58.239 --> 00:46:59.239
Skillful means.

00:46:59.239 --> 00:47:04.130
If it's all about "Let's bring goodness to
the world", I think people in this room and

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.369
people in Google say, "Sign me up."

00:47:06.369 --> 00:47:07.859
But there are people who would not sign up.

00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:13.069
But if it's about profits, that's when I want
to hook people to sign up.

00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:16.269
To say, "Everybody wants to make more money,
especially those who are the least receptive

00:47:16.269 --> 00:47:17.640
to goodness."

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.779
However, if the money comes with being good:
"It's money, right?

00:47:22.779 --> 00:47:25.519
Okay, I'll be good."

00:47:25.519 --> 00:47:30.619
How about reaching people, the downtrodden
people?

00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:32.270
Right now, I don't know.

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:34.069
I have a theory.

00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:38.910
I want to say the Buddhists are expressing
in Buddhist terms.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.789
Then I translate it to real world terms.

00:47:40.789 --> 00:47:47.670
The Buddhist term is that I think America,
like Google in general, I mean, we're particular

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.020
in California and so on.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:56.819
We are heaven, and I hope that for the work
that we do, we turn heaven into pure land.

00:47:56.819 --> 00:48:02.170
In other words, for those who didn't understand
what I just said, we transform a place of

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:08.799
pleasure and happiness into a source of goodness
for the rest of the world.

00:48:08.799 --> 00:48:11.809
So for those who don't know, pure land is
not a place where you're happy, pure land

00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:17.279
is a place where you practice and become compassionate
and enlightened.

00:48:17.279 --> 00:48:22.710
I'm hoping that through the work that we do
that compassion will spread, at least in America,

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:26.450
and through that, the world will benefit in
some good way.

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:29.819
I'm just guessing, I don't know.

00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:33.569
&gt;&gt;male#3: This question is about reaching
another group of people.

00:48:33.569 --> 00:48:35.640
Can you write one for my ten year old son?

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.410
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Maybe.

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:38.990
&gt;&gt;male#3: How do we reach children

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.990
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Maybe.

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.990
I don't know.

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:45.050
I think this book may be readable by ten years
old already.

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.150
Let me know.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:47.250
&gt;&gt;male#3: I'll try.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:48.250
[laughs]

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.930
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: I'm actually thinking of
writing a children's book, but it would not

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:51.930
be as deep as this.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.079
&gt;&gt;male#3: Get him started.

00:48:53.079 --> 00:48:57.380
Get him started, that's a good thing.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.839
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Thank you.

00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:04.549
&gt;&gt;male#4: You almost answered the question
actually just now, but I still-- and maybe

00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:07.749
you have some other thoughts on this.

00:49:07.749 --> 00:49:17.619
Is there no hope for people to actually realize
that happiness is a value by itself, not through

00:49:17.619 --> 00:49:20.799
career advancements or money?

00:49:20.799 --> 00:49:29.329
Is there no hope at all in you to let people
understand that happiness is a value by itself?

00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:32.779
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: I think there's a lot of
hope.

00:49:32.779 --> 00:49:35.180
I'll tell how optimistic, how naively optimistic
I am.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.229
Can I?

00:49:36.229 --> 00:49:44.700
I'm so optimistic that that topic-- that there
is a source of happiness accessible to normal

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:50.859
human beings with mental training, and that
source for happiness is independent of sensual

00:49:50.859 --> 00:49:51.859
pleasure.

00:49:51.859 --> 00:49:53.450
I'm so optimistic it's in Chapter 3.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:56.769
[laughs] So near the beginning of the book.

00:49:56.769 --> 00:50:02.540
So I do think it is doable, and I think given
the right way the message is spoken, spoken

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.369
with signs, spoken tangibly and not just "Oh,
you're happy."

00:50:06.369 --> 00:50:11.269
But these are the specific practices, this
is what it does to you, and so on.

00:50:11.269 --> 00:50:16.749
Spoken in the right language with the right
data, I think you can reach masses and I think

00:50:16.749 --> 00:50:17.749
people get it.

00:50:17.749 --> 00:50:18.749
I hope.

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:19.749
Thank you.

00:50:19.749 --> 00:50:21.539
Sorry I keep stealing the books.

00:50:21.539 --> 00:50:26.069
Good thing-- I don't know, it's kinda scary
to take things from monks because they know

00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:28.660
kung fu or something.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:34.240
[laughter] Just kidding.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.680
So if you see me like "Krrr!", then...

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.511
&gt;&gt;male#5: You promised us the story of the
happiest man in the world if there is enough

00:50:41.511 --> 00:50:42.511
time.

00:50:42.511 --> 00:50:43.511
Is there enough time?

00:50:43.511 --> 00:50:44.511
&gt;&gt;Oh!

00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:45.511
There is now time, okay.

00:50:45.511 --> 00:50:46.511
Since there's nobody behind you, I'll tell
the story.

00:50:46.511 --> 00:50:50.940
So the story-- it turns out that neurologically,
there is a way to measure happiness, which

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.509
is very surprising.

00:50:52.509 --> 00:50:58.299
It's a very simple way which is they measure
the relative activation of the left prefrontal

00:50:58.299 --> 00:51:01.450
cortex over here, a specific part of the brain.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:04.710
And then versus the right prefrontal cortex.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:13.499
It turns out that if the left-right tilt,
if it's more left than right, the first person

00:51:13.499 --> 00:51:16.300
experiences "I'm happy, I'm optimistic, I'm
joyful" and so on.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:17.530
Positive stuff.

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:22.039
And the more the grade is, the more positive
the person's reports.

00:51:22.039 --> 00:51:24.619
And vice versa.

00:51:24.619 --> 00:51:26.220
Why is that so?

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:30.729
Nobody knows for sure, but there is a very
important clue, which is only the left prefrontal

00:51:30.729 --> 00:51:34.380
cortex here has a direct connection to the
amygdala.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.109
So only that part has the ability to tone
down the negativity.

00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:39.890
This part doesn't have that.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:41.719
It's not clear why.

00:51:41.719 --> 00:51:44.539
There is a relationship.

00:51:44.539 --> 00:51:48.569
This data has been around long enough, has
been studied for long enough, that there is

00:51:48.569 --> 00:51:52.769
a normal curve, a thing established on what
most people look like.

00:51:52.769 --> 00:51:54.299
The distribution.

00:51:54.299 --> 00:51:59.920
And Matthieu Ricard, when he was measured,
he was a couple of standard deviations away

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.359
from the mean.

00:52:01.359 --> 00:52:04.700
So at that time, he was the happiest person
ever measured by science.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.609
Again, that's the good news, but again there's
better news.

00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:11.619
The better news is that it turns out he was
not the only one.

00:52:11.619 --> 00:52:16.469
It turns out that as long as you put in your
hours of practice, you can reach the state

00:52:16.469 --> 00:52:20.779
of extreme happiness.

00:52:20.779 --> 00:52:25.849
That is a reason, voluntarily without sensual
input.

00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:27.440
On demand.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:31.849
And I suspect all the geishas have that ability,
but they just don't want to tell you.

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:33.009
They're very humble.

00:52:33.009 --> 00:52:35.170
They also have kung fu or something.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:38.299
[laughter] They can use the Force.

00:52:38.299 --> 00:52:39.650
Yes, Joe?

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.680
&gt;&gt;Joe: Hello Meng.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.680
Thank you so much for this talk.

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:43.739
It was very enlightening.

00:52:43.739 --> 00:52:44.739
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Thank you.

00:52:44.739 --> 00:52:50.450
&gt;&gt;Joe: So I know that SIY, the Search Inside
Yourself, course is offered here at Google.

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:55.720
But if I were a company that was really needing
the sorts of tools that you're offering in

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.719
this book, how would I be able to obtain them
if I weren't here at Google?

00:52:59.719 --> 00:53:05.349
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: There is good news, which
is--it sounds like a planted question.

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:06.859
But I didn't plant it, somebody else did.

00:53:06.859 --> 00:53:10.979
[laughter] If he also planted the question
he asked, "You're so good looking.

00:53:10.979 --> 00:53:12.230
How do you do that?"

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:13.299
[laughs] Okay.

00:53:13.299 --> 00:53:17.769
&gt;&gt;Joe: Also, if I want to look as good as
you, how do I do that?

00:53:17.769 --> 00:53:18.819
[laughter]

00:53:18.819 --> 00:53:22.799
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Study engineering.

00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:26.869
[laughter] All the engineers are good looking.

00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:29.140
Didn't you notice?

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.170
So how do you access this outside of Google?

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:35.900
We are creating an organization called the
Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute,

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:36.900
SIYLI.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.200
It's pronounced as "silly."

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.119
[laughs] [scattered applause] Siyli.org.

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:46.779
We're going to train trainers and bring this
out to the world.

00:53:46.779 --> 00:53:53.549
So if you're watching this from outside of
Google and you're interested, go to siyli.org

00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:57.170
and find more information.

00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:58.219
And I guess that's it.

00:53:58.219 --> 00:53:59.219
Nothing else.

00:53:59.219 --> 00:54:00.549
Thank you all for coming.

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:02.089
Thank you all for being my friends.

00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:03.130
I'm so happy to have you.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:04.130
Thank you.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.131
[applause]
