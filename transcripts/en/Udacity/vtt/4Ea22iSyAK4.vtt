00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.890
Congratulations on getting this far. Now that you

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.300
know how to draw things using code, here's

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.640
your mini project. We want you to write

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.830
code to draw a flower, or some fractals, or

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.200
write your initials. Once you're done, post a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.650
video or a screenshot of the output of

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.350
your code on the discussion forum. Check this

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.490
box after you've submitted your responses on the forum.
