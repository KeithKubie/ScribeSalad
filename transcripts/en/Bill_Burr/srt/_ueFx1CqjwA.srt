6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,600

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,300
Hello everybody.
How I can't do it.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,990
My voice. I know the voice
of Holland, Hank, Dj Helen,

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,710
Hank on emphasis a family.
You can officially say that we're back.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,060
We've got some funny shit for you this
week. Season for everybody. Season Four.

14
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:52,570
You heard me on the radio.
I have a feeling Dj Howland.

15
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:56,080
Hank will be making many, many
more appearances. I hope so.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,840
I love that guy so much.
It's not really hard for me to play it.

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,820
You play a coke addict Dj. I mean that's,
you know, just think back into my past.

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,260
Don't worry. I thought you were, will you?
Oxy pills. What we're doing is I know,

19
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:12,910
I mean, I mean I got to do
the whole smorgasbord. Uh,
let's get that way. You from,

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,630
I'm from Germantown, Maryland, right
outside of Washington DC. Okay.

21
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:20,530
Sports affiliations. My podcast
listeners have to, here we go, uh,

22
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:25,210
all crap teams except for one of them. A
Washington Redskins, Washington Wizards,

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,190
uh, and the Stanley Cup
champion. Washington capitals.

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,700
I can't believe I get to say that. It's
like the greatest feeling in the world.

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,440
And uh, no Orioles, no national snowmen
oils in a nationals fan of cut his splits.

26
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:42,170
I mean, I will, I grew up in an Orioles
fan, but I loved brace. Harper and I,

27
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:47,110
I really just root for the whole town.
So I'm, I'm a diehard oriels fan,

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,510
but I'm also going to root for the nets.
I just want that you old enough to,

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,960
to have been a Baltimore Colt fan before
they left or no, I was, I was alive,

30
00:01:55,961 --> 00:02:00,370
but I was already Redskins. I mean,
I mean they left a what, 82 84,

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,390
something like that. Uh,
something like that. 83, 84,
somewhere around. I remember,

32
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,420
this is what sucks is that I remember
just my foot from like from like zero to

33
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:15,631
10 it was just three Superbowls and then
at like 11 I think we got our last one,

34
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:20,860
which was in nine red one the red
skins. And then I was just like, oh,

35
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:25,540
we're probably going to be in this all
the time. And then nothing. Well that's,

36
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,900
that's what's going to happen
to like the Patriots and all,

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,020
all these kids who are lucky enough
to be born in the night 1990s

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,910
and remember 2001 the first
one or 2000 2001 you know,

39
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:41,370
it's going to be like,
you know, there was,

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,890
there was kids born when I
was born in 1968 and then, uh,

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,000
they got to watch Dan Marino.
I'm able,

42
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,850
I'm just saying as far as like
just being good and competitive.

43
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,180
I always compare it to Dan Marino cause
that guy was the best I ever saw man

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,780
other than Joe Montana. But even then,
I think Dan Marino with Bill Walsh,

45
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,980
she see definitely wins.
One.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,740
I only remember, I only remember
bad knees Marino. That's,

47
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,540
that's where I was at mean bad back bad,
which is bad. Everything. When I got in,

48
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,300
he was already in the,
in the down trodden.

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,463
That was him.

50
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,490
He came in and he was with Don Shula and
Don Shula like was a man who was a man

51
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:22,890
but, but by then everybody
had caught up with them,

52
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,940
stolen all his fucking
tricks and he was on like,

53
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,670
cause he was in the final 10 years of,
of going back to like,

54
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,010
like the 19 like fifties I want to say.

55
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,550
He was on the giants at one point
and you was on offensive or defensive

56
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:38,220
coordinator and the other
guy was Tom Landry. Okay.

57
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,060
Those were the two guys or
something like that one though.

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,530
I always forget who the hell
it was. But anyways, um,

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,500
I just remember, you know, we,

60
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,880
they went from Bob Greasy to
fucking Dan Marino is his name.

61
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,480
They just kicked our ass for
like the first 20 years of
me watching the Patriots.

62
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,950
He just couldn't take it. And, and
I, I look at the dolphins fans now,

63
00:03:55,951 --> 00:04:00,300
like this still waiting. I feel so
full for that. Next. Dan Marino,

64
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
my cousin is the biggest dolphins fan.

65
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:08,841
He named his dog Marino like he fucking
loves this team so much and it was like,

66
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,440
I remember at the beginning of the season
I was like, dude, they're looking good.

67
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,250
The winning some games and he's like,
they're going to fuck it up and then boom.

68
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:22,080
It's just what they finished like seven
and nine. There are seven and 19 I mean,

69
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:26,130
I can't talk to Redskins are what?
Like six and 10 I gave up,

70
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,840
what can I say once I know all four of
our quarterbacks, broken leg. I was like,

71
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:34,800
all right. I was like, we deserve
it. Racist team name. We can't,

72
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:38,220
you can't be four and 12
with a racist team name.

73
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:42,090
You gotta be 12 and four we can't help it.

74
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,460
I will say this too.
I still can't believe in all of this,

75
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:48,560
this fucking Hashtag and all this shit.

76
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,330
The fact that they still do
the Tomahawk chop all like,

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,390
I can't believe that in all of
that. Fuck it. It's so fucking bad.

78
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,060
It's so fucking bad.
And they sit there like it does.

79
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,270
I love when white people justify it.

80
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,580
Like it's literally the
people are saying don't

81
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,450
do where they're like,
but we're honoring the

82
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,730
parents because we committed genocide.
Who's kidding? Who with against those?

83
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,630
That would be like if the Germans one
and then at the soccer game everyone was

84
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:21,600
chanting, oh Yay or nay.
You know, it's funny,

85
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:22,860
22

86
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,760
is that,

87
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,830
Whoa is old school Hollywood imitating
their singing and all that thing on so

88
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:36,120
many fucking levels. It's just like,
dude, what can you just, and they just,

89
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,230
they fucking refuse. And
I don't know. That's why,

90
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:43,320
that's why there's this like a
backlash now on white privilege site.

91
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:46,440
There's people going out
there and uh, do what? Just,

92
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,490
there's white people saying that white
privilege doesn't exist, which is fuck.

93
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,460
And then you listen to their stories and
all their stories are as basically that

94
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:56,850
they weren't born rich, but at no point
was there, hey, I was driving down the,

95
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,010
and because I was

96
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,341
white,

97
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:03,341
I got pulled over tased and then shot
to death and then the cop got free.

98
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,980
I've got a cop was released. There's
none of that shit is not. Yeah. Like two,

99
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,150
two is like, look, there's to sit there
and act like the right privileges,

100
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,710
those privileges in everything.

101
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,130
There's all different levels to be
in white and this and this shit.

102
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,100
This shit that as if you're
just like a regular white guy,

103
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,750
shit that you see the private school
white kid doing. That pisses me off.

104
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,360
And there's different levels, different
levels of black people. You know,

105
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:33,620
there's the hugs for sure. Yes. I grew up,
I grew up middle class, some little note,

106
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:37,130
lower middle class and it's just like
I had that friend that just like, dude,

107
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:40,850
I had a friend who was like super rich.
His Dad worked for the FDA, right.

108
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:43,160
This kid always had money.
Their family always had money.

109
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,900
His Dad went into a lone star.
I remember that.

110
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,890
That steak house where they put like you
to give you peanuts and then you just

111
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,460
throw the shells on the floor. Right.
His Dad's slipped on the floor,

112
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,440
hurt his knee, got like $10 million.
They were already rich. Like,

113
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,260
that's the kind of shit that should
have happened to my dad cause he had,

114
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,900
she would've happened to, my
dad doesn't remember when, uh,

115
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,880
being in New York City one time and there
was this publicist who fucking snapped

116
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,950
or something out on,

117
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,580
on and she was out like I want to say
she was out in the Hamptons Long Island

118
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:14,650
and sh oh or something,

119
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,070
somewhere out there she snapped cause
something about some club or a restaurant

120
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:23,870
and she backed into like 17 fucking
people. I don't mean the lash rove away.

121
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,780
Oh that's horrible. Drove
the fuck away. [inaudible]

122
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,700
they got a license plate.
They knew who she was in.

123
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,880
The cops showed up and the
lawyer was in the driveway,

124
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,810
met the cops and said she'll turn
herself in tomorrow morning. Irish.

125
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:43,070
Remember reading that going like, what
the fuck? How is that possible? Is that,

126
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,810
what is that? Yeah, but so to sit there
and act like, I dunno, like I five,

127
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,810
it's fucking hilarious. It is
hilarious. It's, it's ridiculous. Every,

128
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,130
but the thing is back with the reds, the
work in a warehouse and unloaded trucks.

129
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,660
It's just like, I know, but there,

130
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,380
at no point did anybody ever look at you
and like you have white skin get out of

131
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:06,290
this neighborhood and
they just let him be.

132
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,040
That's the thing with the Redskins
though, is that it's, it's every,

133
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,760
every like six years a
senator or a congressman says,

134
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,300
you gotta change the name. And I
completely agree at this point I'm like,

135
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,210
just change him. I can't believe the
owner wouldn't do it considering,

136
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:24,140
I honestly don't notice now because it's
just been called that for so fucking

137
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,410
long now. But you're looking at this and
go look at the owner is first of all,

138
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:30,470
we have probably one of the worst owners
in football because he's like Jerry

139
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,120
Jones, just, it doesn't know
anything about football.

140
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:35,690
So he's fucking the team up causing
all these problems, you know? And,

141
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,050
and he wants money so bad that you would
think that he would change the name to

142
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:45,850
get all the merchandising money. Like
dude, that's like another, you know,

143
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,570
$100 million worth of shit.
Like that pays for a new parking lot.

144
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,010
And here's an argument that I been,

145
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I been something that I've been wondering
about for a long for a while now,

146
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,590
and I think I kind of understand it.

147
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:03,591
Where in every sport that I
like Major League baseball,

148
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:07,060
I thought they counted world series titles
back to the 18 days, but they kind of,

149
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:11,250
the first one, that account was in 1903,
which I think was the Boston red sox.

150
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,140
I literally looked it up last week.
I already forget.

151
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:17,770
But like they caught the all
the way back to fucking, uh,

152
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,840
1903 all right.
When it was a segregated league,

153
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,150
all of this shit, right? Like, you know,
crazy Lake Johnson who was fucking 10,

154
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,740
loved him, 10 teams of whatever, right?
Stanley Cup goes about that far back.

155
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,560
NBA titles goes back to the 1940s.

156
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,440
And even the Lakers count an NBL title.
They somehow want an end and a title,

157
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,250
the NBL and that was counted as a fucking
NBA title was there when they were the

158
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,670
Minneapolis Lakers. Yeah.
They're first looking of,

159
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,760
they want an NBL and then they
want for NBA titles in Minneapolis.

160
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,950
And, uh, but they, they for
some reason caught that one. But

161
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,480
Superbowls, they only started
in 1968 and what kills me.

162
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,660
Oh I saw you post something
about this. Yeah. It's just like,

163
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,770
so see it telling me and people
are saying, because it's,

164
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,360
I guess because they call it a merger,
but it was like the AFL came in,

165
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,260
it was like the Xfl of the USFL
or the world football league.

166
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:20,040
It was just this other competing
football and the NFL laugh on you're some

167
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,720
fucking, you know, piece of Shit League.

168
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,420
But it was early enough on I
guess where they, you know,

169
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,210
and they made an up moves and had
enough money or whatever and then we'll,

170
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,720
the style that they played that they
started to compete with them and then they

171
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:34,140
played them in the first two games,
Superbowl one and two,

172
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,720
which were called Nfl
AFL championship game.

173
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,200
And they got the shit kicked out of them
because they weren't as good a league.

174
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,230
And then then the AFL one in Superbowl
three which was still not called the

175
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,460
Superbowl, it was still the AFL
NFL championship. All right.

176
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,940
So then after that they agreed to merge
all the owners agree in the AFL to merge

177
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,140
with the NFL.
Al Davis was the only one.

178
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:01,100
He wanted to put the NFL out of business
because he was fucking Al Davis and

179
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,490
she's like, this is why I
got to love him. Right. So,

180
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,590
and then at that point they just go,
all right,

181
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,290
so those first three
games against the AFL NFL,

182
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,100
that's when we're going to start like
I guess cause they called it a merger

183
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,630
rather than, but I mean like the Aba
in a way merged with the NBA. Yeah.

184
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,950
And they still count all that shit back
to the 19 four days. They only NHL teams.

185
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,400
They only took some teams from the
Aba. They didn't take everybody. Okay.

186
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:29,250
But still. Oh yeah. But still it was,

187
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:33,270
it was a competing league that was
fucking with their numbers and they had a

188
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,610
more exciting game just like the AFL.

189
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,590
And then in the end the NBA at euro
was losing too many players too.

190
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,690
It same way was the NFL. At some point
it's like can't beat them. Join them.

191
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:43,411
And then they came together,

192
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:47,040
but they still count all those Celtics
championships in the 60s and all that.

193
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,100
So it's like you're telling me
that Johnny Unite John Unitas.

194
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,950
I gotta look at him in a
certain way or in all of the,

195
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:58,030
and half of those fucking teams, the
browns, the rams, the bears, the packers,

196
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,460
the giants, all of those fucking teams
were in the NFL playing each other.

197
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,550
There was, it was actually in a way
you could say, you know, I could,

198
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,170
you can't say it was more talent than,
but I'm just saying like,

199
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,970
I don't get why they just wipe that away.

200
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,340
They don't fucking talk about it at all.

201
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,550
And that the Steelers with six fucking
chat in 2018 six championships.

202
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,060
Yeah. Like it's so fucking ridiculous
that, that the Patriots, right.

203
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:28,240
If we win Sunday, which would be next
Sunday, which would be fucking awesome.

204
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,600
We would be tied for the
most championships won in
NFL history and we've got our

205
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,340
first one fucking 17 years
ago. That doesn't, that
doesn't make sense. And you're,

206
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,450
you're, that doesn't make any
fucking sense. That's still,

207
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,970
I see where you're coming
from, but at the same time, um,

208
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,540
you know, we're going by super
bowl one. I think, listen, I'm,

209
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,640
I'm not a patriots fan.

210
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,940
I think they have in the instance they
started winning them and what 2001 was

211
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,550
that the first one? Yeah. I mean
they're, they're definitely one season.

212
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,630
They're definitely, you know,
one of the strongest things,

213
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:07,060
but all the people that want to fight
and put up the fight about saying that,

214
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:10,760
you know, will like saw that thing
that guy posted. The Greenbay has like,

215
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,550
we've got like 14 or whatever,
but here's green bay though.

216
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,580
Green base won four Superbowls and
they won like fucking 11 NFL titles.

217
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,630
They've been winning the
entire fucking time you have.

218
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,130
If there's ever one in a minute.
I mean,

219
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:27,820
how long has it been since Green Bay's
one was that 2005 something like that. Oh,

220
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:31,180
like nine or 10 or something.
Okay. You're right. Yeah, but well,

221
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,320
I'm not talking about that with that.

222
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,200
Well then why would you fucking count
the Broncos have a one in 20 years?

223
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:38,290
So what those there's don't count.
No, they, no, no. They count are they?

224
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,190
I'm saying they count,

225
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:42,760
but I just thought you were getting mad
about somebody posting that Green Bay

226
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:46,870
had x amount because they were enclosed
and the earlier one. That's my argument.

227
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:50,650
They should keep those. Yeah.
But those should fucking count.

228
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,640
If the fucking Montreal Canadians can
count when they fucking beat somebody

229
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:58,330
playing on a pond. Oh, I didn't know what
Jangle you were going with. I'm sorry.

230
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:59,770
I thought you were going against,

231
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,950
I thought you were saying nor
Octos people for it. Oh, okay.

232
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:05,140
Then I love the history of the game.

233
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,300
The NFL has been the NFL and a bunch
of fucking leagues have tried to, to,

234
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,540
to compete with them. They've
never, they've never been able to,

235
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,350
the best you've ever had was
the AFL merged with them,

236
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,490
but it was still called the NFL.
It wasn't called the AFL.

237
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,220
It wasn't called the NFL. Slash. Afl,
like Sirius Xm or whatever. And right.

238
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,740
It was called the fucking
NFL. You joined the NFL. Yeah.

239
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,800
So those other championships
were NFL championship.

240
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,160
That's cause now you call it
the fucking super bowl. Sure.

241
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,090
It was still the two best teams and
those, you know, before the AFL existed,

242
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,600
those were the two fucking best teams
of who the fucking classic giants Colts

243
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,560
Game Played In fucking Yankee Stadium.

244
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,040
The winter that it can't camp fucking
walk up to somebody who super bowl four

245
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,530
and said, I know what that feels like.
They know exactly what it feels like.

246
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:58,100
A lot of people are dying off, but
yeah, they know what it feels like.

247
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,620
100% that's a great point. They are
dying. I don't know. I count them.

248
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,270
I that the Green Bay packers are the
fucking New York Yankees and I think the

249
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:13,190
giants are next and that's the way
it should be. Did I think it was

250
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,530
Redskins are up there. The Redskins have,
we have no, you've got you. I have three.

251
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:22,090
And then we had, I think we had like
four of the world championship ones.

252
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,560
All right. I'm going to give
you some trivia. Where did
the rams first started? Um,

253
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,710
and city.
St Louis.

254
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,750
No, no. Cause I know it was
with Los Angeles. I don't
fucking know. Jesus. Great.

255
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,310
You know, you just sounded like
me and math class a long time ago.

256
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,570
That's what I love about you is that
you, I know, I know sports, but dude,

257
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:49,740
you know fucking sports
like you like I can imagine

258
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,220
because I used, I used to no fucking
everybody in the league and I just,

259
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:55,210
I just don't have time anymore.
So I don't know.

260
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:59,200
But they started off in Cleveland and
I've never understood why they were called

261
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:03,310
the rams. I don't know that there was
any rams in there. Um, all right, let's,

262
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:08,050
let's look up. What am I
looking at? Washington Redskins.

263
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,280
What's your fights on

264
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,440
all to the Redskins?

265
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Don't re Braves on know
what bad fight for.

266
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,380
Oh, daisy. Oh there you go. And
then it goes into some weird thing.

267
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,490
Brandon doesn't jump in.
There's a lad, Steven Dapa.

268
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,780
Duba let the points.
So,

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,380
hey,
go NFL championships pre 1970 merger.

270
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,630
Uh, you got to right. Five
pretty good. I'll take it.

271
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,690
Yeah. So you've got five. So right now,

272
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,730
as for the way I look at your tie with
the Patriots, we've got five super bowls.

273
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,450
You got, you've got five champion.
We got, we have five championships.

274
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,870
I wish everybody thought like
you cause a lot of, you know,

275
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,570
do you a lot of people,
if you fucking people have ever said that,

276
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,450
no, I completely agree with
what you're saying. If he,

277
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:10,340
if the one before it was the official
Superbowl, it's still a championship.

278
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,560
Unfortunately a lot of
those people have died.

279
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,810
Yeah. Who would care, I guess. Um,
let's see here. Yeah, that, that

280
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,320
[inaudible] all right. Uh, Le
League championships. All right.

281
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:28,250
The NFL champ pre 1970s,
um,

282
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,960
the giants won four.

283
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,410
So they've won for NFL titles and
they won four super bowl ties.

284
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,520
Those you go to the stadium
said no way to be found.

285
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,430
They know they're not listed.
It's like it never fucking happened.

286
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,870
See the angle you're coming
with right now, and I respect
the, what you're saying,

287
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:47,090
dude,
100% that's not fair.

288
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,280
I'm not saying not fair. Not Fair.
I'm just, I'm just asking why,

289
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,280
why, why would your brother, dude lead
championships? Chicago bears. Okay.

290
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:03,840
They one fucking nine 19 2119

291
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,810
323340414346,
1963 and anyone a soup,

292
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,690
1985 and all they have is one fucking
banner hall hanging over their stadium.

293
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,450
Check one of the scores when they beat
the Redskins and one of those league

294
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:18,380
championships. It's like, it's
like crazy fucking lopsided.

295
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,440
70 to like 70 to eight from not mistaken.

296
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,110
So I don't know a lot about sports,
about facts, but I do know that,

297
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,360
that that is right. All right, let's
look up the, uh, Los Angeles Rams.

298
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,910
All right. And you'll find nervous. Are
you nervous about Sunday? Oh yeah. Always.

299
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,970
I'll tell you what's the funniest thing.
My a verse, he texted me and he's like,

300
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:45,900
dude, Todd Gurley, is it Todd Gurley
tug earlier? Yeah. He goes, he's heard.

301
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,190
And in my head I'm like,
dude,

302
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:52,191
there's no way to stand up comedians
know the injury status of the key running

303
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,370
back for the rams. If, if praise.
I got a guy on the inside. Yeah.

304
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,190
Who's your guy on the inside?
espn.com this is my, if,

305
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,210
if he was really fucking hurt,
we wouldn't know.

306
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,080
They would keep that under wraps.
But he was hurt in the last game.

307
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:10,930
I saw him on the bike for a little bit.
I know, but here's the thing, what is it?

308
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,300
Everybody's heard this time of year.

309
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:16,620
They all said he's got to funny bruise
of per cover. He's going to fucking play.

310
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,510
If they're leaking it out that he's hurt,
that means that he's,

311
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:22,590
he's way better than they thought he was
going to be because that's just good.

312
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:25,230
Always hurt and like, but they know
Bella check is going to be like,

313
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:29,700
well I guess we don't have
to prepare photog Gurley. Um,

314
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,600
but it was just funny. You know,
he showed up. Yeah. Alright.

315
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,600
Nfl Championships Pre 1970 the rams,

316
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,630
they wanted 45 and 51 and then they
won in 1999 and they were the yarn.

317
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Cleveland Rams from 1936 to 1942 they
took 43 off to finish off the Germans and

318
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,074
the Japanese.

319
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,940
1944 1945 that was the last year
and then they moved to Los Angeles.

320
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:58,941
They stayed there until 94 came back to
2016 which brings me to something I was

321
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:03,120
making fun of and let, did you see, do
you watch the saints ramps game? I did.

322
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,481
All right.

323
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:06,480
Everybody thought the worst fucking
thing in that was that fucking helmet to

324
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,160
helmet.
No pass interference call.

325
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,270
The worst thing in that game was when
they cut to the stands after the rams won.

326
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,070
And you saw those guys in the rams
jerseys in their twenties maybe early

327
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,510
thirties crying. I saw that.
Yes. Yeah, I did see that.

328
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,680
Girlfriends were trying to comfort them.
It's just like buddy,

329
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,620
you will fucking two years
old when they moved away.

330
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,880
Like what are you doing here?

331
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,950
You can waiting since 2016 it says,
listen,

332
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,330
you're, you're fucking bill. Ryan went
bill when you, cause if you remember how,

333
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,680
what happened when we watched,

334
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,000
because you watched the caps game with
me when they won the cup where you are on

335
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:42,751
my computer.

336
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:46,560
I was in London in London that I was
facetiming you so you could watch the game

337
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
if everybody was asleep.

338
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,570
And I was a pitch black and I
was in the bathroom of my hotel.

339
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,010
My wife and daughter were sound
asleep and I was going to it.

340
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,580
I'm so happy for you just just,
and I was sitting there like, dude,

341
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,310
I care graduations,

342
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,380
you always facetiming with you
when you had your fucking TV on,

343
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,840
but you were like,
congratulations buddy.

344
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,613
[inaudible] I know it.

345
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,540
But my wife probably thought I was
in there talking to a hooker. Okay,

346
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,780
everybody's asleep. Oh
man, it's so beautiful.

347
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,480
It's so beautiful.
But what was,

348
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,010
what was so funny is if
you would have seen me,

349
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:30,790
and I mean like I remember in
[inaudible] 91 with the Redskins won,

350
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,790
but I remember the day
after because my mom,

351
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,410
like I was watching the game and
then the uh, my mom made a bunch of,

352
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,250
of her famous Superbowl Chili and I ate
a bunch of it and then I fell asleep in

353
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:44,290
a laundry basket.
Uh,

354
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:48,550
I was 11 and then I didn't get another
championship until this caps one.

355
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,480
And we were watching it together
and you were facing the screen.

356
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,040
And I remember I was just like cheering
as the clock ran down and then the

357
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,240
member, it stopped for a second,
there was like a stoppage of play,

358
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,730
like 0.06 seconds.

359
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,320
So I was screaming and then I got
quiet and then they win the game and

360
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:09,130
everybody's running on the ice and I'm
just dead silent. I thought, I was like,

361
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:11,260
am I dead inside it?
What is wrong with me?

362
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,520
And then they brought
the cup out and dude,

363
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,200
I just started weeping,
just weeping dude.

364
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,210
It's like, why does it
matter so much? It's so,

365
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,040
so it's everything. It's just
all the, it's all due to,
to everything. It's all the,

366
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,830
it's all the, it's all the, you
know, the Times that they, they,

367
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:36,580
they chunked it before when they were
supposed to win and all the times that,

368
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,740
you know, they, they did,

369
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:43,741
she put so much into it and to
finally get it just was so sweet,

370
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:47,260
man. And it was like, I started
thinking about like, this is,

371
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,720
I'm going to go really like
John Cougar Mellencamp here.

372
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,320
But then I thought about all like the
middle class people that live in the

373
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:57,460
Washington DC area that worked these
dead end jobs and then they just,

374
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,540
they get that championship cause they
want it so bad and that, that team,

375
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,610
whether it's the Redskins
and the caps or whoever,

376
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,380
it's like that's what they have to him
to help them escape. And so I, you know,

377
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:12,410
I wouldn't say spring senior team
raised the cup is just like I,

378
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,810
I kind of was just,

379
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,810
I don't think I'm ever going
to see the Bruins through it.

380
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,000
And when they finally did it,

381
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,840
I watched him from 1980 to 2011.
That's how long it took me to,

382
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:26,100
what's that 10 2031 years. 31
years I watched him. And um,

383
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,750
so from age 12 to a,

384
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,760
what does that 43 when they
finally they finally did it and uh,

385
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,200
I, I was, I told this story before,

386
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:41,070
I was at the Chicago Theater on
Jim Norton's tour with Jim Breuer,

387
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:44,160
David telling myself on this
tour called the antisocial tour.

388
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,330
And I watched the first period and a half.

389
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:49,790
Then I went on stage and
then when I got off stage,

390
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:54,791
I watched the final seven minutes upstairs
in one of those where the green room

391
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,821
is something like that.

392
00:23:55,821 --> 00:24:00,821
And I remember being up there by myself
cause none of them cared because it

393
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:02,714
wasn't their team.

394
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,360
And the show ended and they went out to
do the meet and greet and I stayed up

395
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:10,240
there and there was like three minutes
left and they scored a goal or it's just

396
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,230
not enough time for the
other team to come back.

397
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,000
Vancouver and I was by myself
and my eye went up like 900

398
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,530
because I was like,
and I

399
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,850
one to see, they were like,
they were like, come on,

400
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,440
you got to come down from the
meet and greet people saying,

401
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,140
where the fuck are you calling you?
The bony for now. And I was like, wait,

402
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,010
did I say, I just had to see him
lifted up and I told my wife to tape,

403
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,560
but I knew she was taping it. And just
when I saw it as a, and I'll just lifted,

404
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:34,394
I'm just going,

405
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,360
good dude. That was 31

406
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,820
years just coming out of you and just,
Ah,

407
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,700
all those years of not being
able to get past the case,

408
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,160
not being able to win in the forum,
man.

409
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,570
Fucking getting past the Canadians and
then run into those fucking Gretzky

410
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,080
Edmonton Oilers in the mark messier the
Edmonton Oilers and just, and then just,

411
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,120
you know, Neeley's getting his
fucking leg taken out, you know,

412
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,410
and bore Kevin. It goes somewhere else to
win a cup and it's just fuck, fuck, fuck,

413
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:04,120
fuck,
fuck the lockout.

414
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,560
Oh yeah,
all of that.

415
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,270
[inaudible] I'll just go through
your head and then Bam, that's like,

416

00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,160
They would just like, did you, is I fucked
them all and then he fucking, you know?

557
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,560
Yeah.
But then he went back to his old ways.

558
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:53,210
I did not have sex with that woman.
That's a good Glenn Dude.

559
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,310
And I, if I said, if I would, I,

560
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,960
I do not have problems reading out loud.
Like that would be the end.

561
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,530
I would get impeached. Sure. That'd be I,
you know, I wouldn't leave just like him.

562
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,950
I need to leave my flaws in. That's
what it taught me to do. Yeah,

563
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,420
I do have a podcast. Uh, I love it.
Bill. I'm telling you I love this.

564
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,090
I'm more than 500, the 500.
It's about stock car race.

565
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,040
It is not about that. It is about
the 500 greatest albums of all time.

566
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,670
I'm going through rolling Stone Magazine's
list of the 500 grade his albums

567
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:26,290
starting at 500, working
my way down to one. Uh,

568
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,190
each week I sit down with a
comic actor or musician now, uh,

569
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:31,731
you know,

570
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:36,470
and I gave them a week with the record
and then I break the record down and we

571
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:40,730
sit down and talk about it is kiss
got one in the [inaudible] I just did.

572
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,130
I just did with Jeff Ross kiss destroyer.
I was going to say, you know he shit,

573
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,170
you could've got Steven Adler.
Ah. I mean I've got he lose love.

574
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,480
I would love to get Steven again in there.
Dude,

575
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:53,780
I love this so much man.
Like,

576
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,290
cause it's not just being able to sit
down and talk with my buddies about the

577
00:34:57,291 --> 00:35:01,220
album and ask them questions around like
the meanings of the songs and the facts

578
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:03,650
from the record. But Dude,
since I've started doing this,

579
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,280
like I have listened to music than I
thought I would never listen to him,

580
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,420
didn't even know about. And it's like
touching me and it's just so incredible.

581
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:15,440
Right now I'm listening to Steve Earle
Guitar town. You ever heard of him?

582
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,950
This guy is funny. He's
like, he's like the key.

583
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,490
This is like his born in the USA,
but country record dude,

584
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,240
I'd never listened to country.
I fucking love this record dude.

585
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,280
When did it come off?

586
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,380
1985 and he has a song
called guitar town and it's,

587
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,010
it's just, it's just incredible.
I mean once, especially
once you know, the history,

588
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,290
this guy and like how he dropped out
of school and then went to Nashville,

589
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:44,910
like you know, to, to find
Townes van Zandt and leg was
writing songs for people.

590
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:46,440
And then the record company was like,
all right,

591
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:50,000
well we want you to make a record.
And he was like, all right. And He's,

592
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:53,460
he just sat down and wrote the first
song and the last song and then just the

593
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:57,290
whole album came together. But it's like
that's what I love. How many albums?

594
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,750
Yeah. Oh he's got a shitload.
I listen to anything else.

595
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,430
So he must be real quality cause I don't
know who we are. You know what I mean?

596
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,500
Cause I figured like if I know who a
country person is for the most part,

597
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:16,000
they suck because it's going to be like,
you just know like the pop kind of,

598
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,250
here's the thing though. You don't
know. It's like, you know, like if, if,

599
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,280
if you were,

600
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,630
I don't know if somebody say name
is speed battlement metal band.

601
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,290
Everybody would say motorcycle.
That's right. You would
say motors. Motors, sickle,

602
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,810
our favorite band. Now
this is, this is the thing.

603
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,710
The guy could have been like enormous.

604
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:40,640
But then he developed like a drug
problem and then kind of fell off.

605
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:45,440
And now he actually still makes
music but a country, the country, uh,

606
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,700
fan base doesn't really fuck with him
anymore because he leans very left.

607
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,480
And I was actually watching
a documentary of his,

608
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:57,470
cause I'm getting ready to record the
episode with Tom Everett Scott from that

609
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:59,590
thing you do. Um, he played the drama,

610
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,360
you remember when he came
and did it at the jam. Um,

611
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,130
and you look at the youtube comments, you
know, of this documentary and it's like,

612
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,550
I used to like his music but he's a
fucking stupid leftist, liberal, tarred.

613
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,860
And it's just like, because they
can't accept that, you know,

614
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:18,870
you can play country music
but still lean towards. Yes.

615
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,270
It's also why I think,
you know,

616
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,530
you shouldn't be constantly putting out
your political opinions. Like, listen,

617
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,980
I just completed, I completely agree.
I make fun of people, you know,

618
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:34,300
the white privilege thing. I like
this. I make fun of feminists and shit.

619
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:39,130
I try to be like even handed
or whatever. But uh, you know,

620
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,020
all you do is just like nobody,

621
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,970
all you do is get people who agree with
you to agree with you and then people

622
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,350
who don't agree with you too now hate
you and not want to watch something that

623
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,800
you do because they
can't separate the two.

624
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,390
Like I can stay at a fucking Trump hotel
and not like Donald Trump and for a lot

625
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:01,570
of people can't get past
that because in their minds,

626
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,370
the people who run the Sheridan,

627
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:06,730
who were also billionaires for some
reason didn't vote for Donald Trump.

628
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,570
They're all there. They're all the same.
Fucking get 100% yeah, by no, not dense.

629
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,710
Imagine like it's just, they're just
painful. His name outside the thing,

630
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,340
it's not like living, it's, I've been in
a Trump hotel. They're extremely nice.

631
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,090
They're incredible. They're
incredible. Yeah. I said Nice. I mean,

632
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,970
everybody knew what I meant. You don't
have to one up me and say incredible.

633
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:28,720
It was incredible. I've only stayed
at one. It was fucking fantastic.

634
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,740
Like does that one opinion credible what
this guy should be doing? Fuck yeah,

635
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:36,460
dude,
it is to stick to a hotel on residency.

636
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:40,930
Was he competent as his fucking
hotel? I mean this, this, this.

637
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,890
We would be back.

638
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,200
He would make it great again if it's tax
cuts were as good as his bath towels.

639
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:51,070
I made come the fuck. You know what?
I was making fun of it the other day.

640
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:52,930
Somebody said, well, like there was some,

641
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,610
I guess there was some
sort of taxing out there.

642
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:57,880
If you make $11 million or more and
people make $11 million and while we're

643
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:01,120
complaining, Oh yeah. So, uh,

644
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,770
somebody had tweeted that, you know,
hey, you know, this is fucking bullshit.

645
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:08,830
Just pay your fair share.
So it makes $11 million a year,

646
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,470
doesn't work any harder than
somebody who makes 20 grand a year.

647
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,120
And I was fucking dying
laughing. I was like, oh yeah,
they do. Yeah, they do. Yeah,

648
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:20,140
they do.
You wonder why a guy make an $11 million.

649
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:22,690
He's getting a fucking divorce.
It's cause he never sees his wife.

650
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,670
That's why it's true. It doesn't see
his kids has a pool, never been in it.

651
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,980
And it's just like, yeah, this,
there's 24 fucking seven. I,

652
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,190
I've made 20 grand a year.
You always great.

653
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,730
It's the second the fucking whistle blows.
You don't even think about that job.

654
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,570
But once I think that nobody calls
you up, hey bill, uh, tomorrow,

655
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,160
when you unload the boxes,

656
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,520
could you maybe do we to get out of
her fucking conference call and how you

657
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:46,720
unload the fucking truck?

658
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,870
It's just his people don't think that
people think of like when you think

659
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,340
somebody makes 20 million a year,

660
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:56,080
like we just know shit from like Falcon
Crest and dynasty. All those shows are,

661
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,490
they're like, they
don't do anything. Yeah.

662
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,110
They hang out in country clubs and
they piss on us 20,000 hours. Yeah.

663
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,410
And you have pay petty fights with
people within your family? Yeah,

664
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:09,130
that's all they do. Like nobody sees
them like you know in the office from,

665
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,300
you know, from 6:00 AM until like
3:00 AM and then they go home,

666
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,820
like walk into their kid's room,
the kid's sleeping,

667
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:20,110
they sh t single teardrop falls and then
they'd go bang the mate and go to sleep.

668
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,900
Yeah. It's kind of what I, that's
what I assume happens. I have no idea.

669
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,920
I grew up lower middle
class, but I love, I,

670
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,730
what I love about this podcast is that
I would do this if nobody was listening

671
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:35,110
because I wanted to
listen to these albums.

672
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:39,610
And I started to, um, I was just
going, I want it to feel inspired.

673
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:43,210
I think I was as musically tapped
out and, and I was like, all right,

674
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:45,940
I'm going to listen to an album a day,
over 500 days.

675
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,680
And I started posting about it.

676
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,630
And when I got to like four 98,
which was like on the third day,

677
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,630
Jim Jefferies reached out to
me. He's like, dude, he's like,

678
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:58,450
that stone roses record is one of
my favorite records. He's like, oh,

679
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:02,440
the stories that I think of when I
hear that music and then like hit me.

680
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,990
And I was like, that's the podcast.
I've been waiting to do a great voice.

681
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,150
He can sing.
He's incredible voice.

682
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,890
Uh, but he came on and he
did, and he did that episode.

683
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:17,410
And that's basically what
it is. It's like, you know,

684
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:21,240
we're going to go through these great
records and we're going to talk about,

685
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,830
and we're gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask,

686
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:26,290
you need more than a day to listen to
one album that no, I give them a week.

687
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,580
He just pointed at me. No. Oh we, I give
you a week. Oh yeah. Were you did it?

688
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,413
You did.

689
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,330
I thought you only took a day to listen
to it because you're so busy because

690
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:36,770
you're making $12 million.

691
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:41,771
So you're out on how can we can have
$1,000,001 11,000,001 so I was the one who

692
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:46,580
complained.
I could tell it was you that was so,

693
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:51,610
but what it is is like I give every comic
or actor or whoever it's going to be a

694
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,550
week with the record,

695
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:57,580
and then I break the album down and
like ask them questions about their life

696
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:02,390
using the meaning of the songs,
the facts from the records. So,

697
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,410
so the album is really just like the
celery and the carrots and the onions have

698
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:09,740
the soup, but it's really just, you know,

699
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,150
the basis for me just to have a really,
you know,

700
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,600
funny or deep or whatever the fuck it is.

701
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:17,870
It's just a good conversation
when you run out of those albums.

702
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,810
And I was over that. Oh, I know
how you'd do it, which I do.

703
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,940
You could do the 500 albums.

704
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,970
That should have been in the
top 500 that'll be a 9.61 years.

705
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,540
And uh, that's not a bad
idea, but I might just be,

706
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:34,340
you know,
I think I've been,

707
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,270
when I retire it on May 31st, 2028. Oh,

708
00:42:39,271 --> 00:42:40,290
that's what I'm going to have.

709
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,550
My goal is on the final
episode to have a Oprah.

710
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,230
I don't know why, but it's
just, it's my way. Wales,

711
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,710
what's the number one sergeant
pepper's lonely hearts club band.

712
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,640
Then it's, then it goes a
number one album, number one.

713
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:59,550
Then number two is pet sounds.
And then number three,

714
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,250
I think his revolver,
this is white rough.

715
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,650
The number one white
rock in the top 10 note,

716
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,830
Marvin Gaye's in the top 10 Marvin
Gaye's number six, Marvin Gaye,

717
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:14,190
what's going on?
But it's all over the place.

718
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,710
The like album 500 was outcasts equipment.

719
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:21,711
I and then for life I'll be saying is
because the Beatles who really went rogue

720
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:26,730
and started their own Beatles where
essentially a boy band and then they that

721
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,080
they took control there,

722
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,500
Chris with a lot of people because the
Beatles now get a ton of shit by people

723
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:35,880
being like, you know, like they, there's
like people who think they stink.

724
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,270
Like I've, I've listened to two things.
The Beatles stink dumb people will their,

725
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,860
they're dumb. Yeah. I'm not
saying you can't be into them,

726
00:43:43,861 --> 00:43:46,920
they don't move you or whatever. And
they spent a long time but that, that's,

727
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,830
that's like saying count Basey
steaks or something like that. No,

728
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,610
it's just a night. Yeah.
He don't learn. Teach.

729
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:56,250
That's the thing is that somebody like
my age, I'm 39 like I, I, you know,

730
00:43:56,251 --> 00:44:00,240
was born in 79 so I wasn't really
alive during the Beatles era.

731
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,550
And from what I've been told
and everything I've read,

732
00:44:02,551 --> 00:44:07,530
like there will never be an artist
as big as the Beatles were like,

733
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:10,180
they were enormous. Like
we can't even, this was,

734
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,440
they broke out of what usually binds you
and they took control of their career

735
00:44:16,591 --> 00:44:21,150
and started their own label. And then
when they should have fizzled out,

736
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:25,200
they made this left turn where
they reinvented themselves.

737
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,370
You know, when they started doing drugs
and grew their hair and all that shit,

738
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:32,190
like rubber soul and then yeah,
in revolver

739
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,580
and all that stuff.
And then when that kind of went to,

740
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,100
they will now what the fuck do
we do? It's like, all right,

741
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:41,910
let's just play characters
now will be these, these guys.

742
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:45,990
How would these guys do that? So
during that time, Marvin Gaye,

743
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,710
I think he was stuck in the Motown
shit and he's got to sing what they're

744
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,180
writing for them.
And by the 70s you know,

745
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,880
he was doing what they did as far
as he kind of broke away is like,

746
00:44:56,881 --> 00:45:01,470
well I want to sing about
what I'm thinking about
rather than doing my version

747
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:02,880
of she loves you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

748
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,280
Where he's doing like heard it through
the grape vine and all that stuff,

749
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:06,850
which I still love all the songs.
I mean,

750
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,700
but then he wanted to go like deeper so
maybe they think that that's because,

751
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,040
well sergeant pepper, I was asking what's
going on is a better record than that.

752
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,280
Sergeant pepper.
Yeah.

753
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,810
I mean it's, listen they, all of these,

754
00:45:20,811 --> 00:45:24,960
all of this whole list is completely,
you know. Yeah. It's, it's,

755
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:28,720
it's all over them. It's designed
to do, there's your, you got like,

756
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,190
cause the way they made it, because I've
already had this discussion with people.

757
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,710
What is it? It's 20 years
ago today. It's not the job,

758
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,040
the band and play that are going
in and out of style. Common Schema.

759
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:45,230
Lava down the dial. That's good.
You the one in eligibility,

760
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,800
she is escaped diva ski but Duba Doo.

761
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,120
Yup.
Something like that.

762
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,160
One of the best moments we've had on
the jam is when Jim Jefferies sang that

763
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:57,750
first time he did it,

764
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:02,751
he did sergeant pepper and then into
with a little help from my friends and he

765
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:08,061
was wearing a jacket that he bought at
John Barbados that the only reason he

766
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,550
bought,
it's the gaudiest like most expensive,

767
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,890
weirdest Jackie you
ever seen in your life.

768
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,060
And it costs like $10,000 and he only
bought it because he was at this John

769
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,120
Barbados like event.
And he put it on de Laugh about it.

770
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:24,960
And then Ringo Starr walked by and when
you look good in that, so he was like,

771
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:28,710
well, I gotta buy it now. I
mean, if a beetle tells you
you look good in something,

772
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:32,400
it's like you gotta fucking get the fuck
I'm gonna go start was there? No. Yeah,

773
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,390
dude, bring, it was always at like
Barbados events. He wears all that.

774
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:40,110
Like interview with a vampire.
Clothing was an event. It wasn't as,

775
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:44,490
it wasn't a store. Not
a did. No, no, it was,

776
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:49,200
I was at an event. I spaced halfway
through the okay out. It's great.

777
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,930
It's great. It's what I'm
saying is, is that, you know,

778
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,070
Sargent pepper was this huge thing
for the Beatles. What was the coat?

779
00:46:56,071 --> 00:47:00,110
What did it have on? Oh my God,
I'll send you a picture. Sorry.

780
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:05,280
It was like an alligator gold style,
like,

781
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,190
like Rock Jack.
I don't even know what you'd call it.

782
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,420
Just like an allergy piece of that. If
he buys it. Was it a Beatles coat? No,

783
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:14,120
it was just a job.
He wasn't,

784
00:47:14,121 --> 00:47:16,560
he was seriously saying he looked
good in that fucking coach.

785
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,320
It just saying to John, he was ain't
a gym that you look good in it.

786
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:22,620
And so he told him, you know, he's
like, you look good. So Jim bought it.

787
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,460
That's the story areas. It was boring
the second time. It was interesting.

788
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:30,010
The final spaced out. The moment
everybody's laughing at, you know, I'm not

789
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,920
fucking listening from, but we're
not paying attention or whatever. Uh,

790
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,770
you didn't think that when
I sang a Johnny paycheck,

791
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,040
take this job,
but shove it down day,

792
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,330
I believe.
But now buddy

793
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,040
do what Josh has been
trying to get me to do.

794
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,050
You're going to do it. Um, he wants
mother fucker. You are gonna do this.

795
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,020
Wants me to get a brown curly wig.

796
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:57,080
Go out on stage is Don Henley.

797
00:47:57,081 --> 00:48:00,770
And then he wants me to play
drums and Sing Hotel California.

798
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,310
Doug doesn't Hauwei.
Yeah,

799
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,530
I can't say I'm going to help you.

800
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:07,600
I'm going to help you in the
crowd's going to help you.

801
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,120
So everybody knows because
bill's talked about it.

802
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,510
I do a show called the goddamn comedy
jam where Comedians do stand up.

803
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:16,900
They tell the story about a song and
then they sing it. Bill has done it.

804
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,630
You've done it more than
fucking like anybody.

805
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,860
You're the only counts it cause
it was pre the NFL AFL merger.

806
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:28,000
They don't call back.
Alright. But, but uh,

807
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:32,410
we had my birthday coming up and,
and I asked you,

808
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:37,450
I was like, could you please do
that? And I was spend the bird,

809
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:40,450
I said, I'm about to do it. And then you
called me and you'd gave me one of your,

810
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,960
you this. I've gotten this call a few
times where it's like, Josh, dude,

811
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,960
I got too much shit going on.
I can't learn this fucking song.

812
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:49,480
Don't make me learn this.
I can play the song.

813
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:53,590
But the fact that they have to sing
along with it and I can't sing, but you,

814
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,570
you understand that's a song that's so
popular. The second you start playing it,

815
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,230
the whole audience is going to fucking
join in with you and then you can just

816
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,220
kind of mimic it.

817
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,320
And then I'll be singing
in the bass player will be
singing the [inaudible] like

818
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,280
all the fucking lyrics in front of me.

819
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:11,830
Like it's going to be a shit show
thing I could do. I think, you know,

820
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:16,360
I can make that happen. We'd listen.
There's one in March. I got one coming up

821
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,690
March 20th do we haven't done
one in awhile? Yeah, I do.

822
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,710
Like my schedule doesn't open up again
until fucking April. Like I'm just,

823
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,430
I'm straight. I know what
the fuck happened, dude.

824
00:49:25,431 --> 00:49:27,800
I got in this business to not working now,
but we're doing,

825
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:32,330

be, cannot wait dude. Right. And Shit,

826

We're cruising. That's great. Yeah,

827
00:49:36,621 --> 00:49:40,790
we're cruising. But I made, yeah, it
takes a lot, a lot of time. Um, all right,

828
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,820
let's get into a some point.
I Will Sing Hotel California.

829
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,830
Oh, where did my hair, boom. Boom, boom.

830
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:54,070
So does [inaudible]

831
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:00,120
I just want to do that. You do that
one part where it's like boom, boom.

832
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,830
Then what is the date you
just kid killer bees do,

833
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:09,110
do, do, do, do on the tin. Bali.
Uh, all right. Body shaming.

834
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:11,910
We got people write in and then they,
for some reason they want advice.

835
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,820
I know this goes down. Okay. All right.
Body shaming. You'll Billy Brown shirt.

836
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,120
I don't know.
Brown ship meat.

837
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,600
So it wasn't that the people who
are sympathetic to fucking Hitler,

838
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,890
I have no idea who won't. Brown shirts
went brown shirts. Uh, wait a minute.

839
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:27,080
I can look that up.
Now you got to Google something political.

840
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,320
Maybe they hear sole unit picture that
you posted in a brown shirt and they are,

841
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:35,420
they're just rhyming in it.
Brown shirt.

842
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,410
Do they said so many weird
things like Billy elbows or

843
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:45,200
Billy dangled down. Yeah.
So they just made it up.

844
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:47,650
No Brown shirts.
Political.

845
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:49,330
Uh,

846
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,163
Nazi party.

847
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:54,670
His original parliamentary did played a
significant role in Adolf Hitler's rise

848
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:58,980
to power. Oh, I guess I'll eat
meat. It was brown shirts. Say.

849
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,760
See that's what the Internet
stupid cause I just,

850
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,430
I just fucking grazed over all at
gray's. Breezed. Graced. All right,

851
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:07,270
you'll Billy Brown shirt.

852
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:11,680
I vomited a little in my mouth halfway
through your tirade against fat clients

853
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,860
when you suggest,
I don't remember doing this.

854
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,280
Those who don't conform to your body
dysmorphic ideal should get therapy and

855
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,030
sort out their lives.
Did I say that guys?

856
00:51:25,031 --> 00:51:29,530
You have to understand something like I
have to do an hour usually by myself and

857
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:30,970
whatever topic comes up,

858
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:35,080
I have to destroy it because I'm
trying to make you laugh anyways.

859
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:38,590
I haven't heard anything less healthy
commodity your mouth for some time.

860
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,080
All right. You know
something dude? First of all,

861
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,600
the I vomited a little bit in my life.

862
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,610
You're the fact that I'm
supposed to literally take
what you're saying seriously

863
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:51,820
and you're speaking in soundbites.
Let me get Stan,

864
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:54,640
did you shake your head before
you rolled on the floor?

865
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:56,020
Laughing your ass off anyways.

866
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:59,590
If my partner thought my
weight was a deal breaker,

867
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:05,270
I'd thank her for the honest
glimpse into where vacant prisons,

868
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,740
soul and abandoned her in a
heartbeat. No, you wouldn't.

869
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,010
You overly sensitive jackass,
uh,

870
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:15,970
in a heartbeat to the Greyhound Hound
inspired Instagram influencers and

871
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:20,320
consumer program. Neil Neil
is, you seem to champion,

872
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:25,680
diversity is not a mental
illness, but body shaming is, ah,

873
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:29,900
God. Yeah. Wow. I gotta I
gotta I gotta like that's,

874
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,150
that's worded so much in that speak that
I don't even believe that that's true.

875
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:38,110
No, they're just throwing
buzzwords together, Brown shirt,

876
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,000
all of that type of stuff.
I love,

877
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:44,620
now I see why they called you Billy Brown
shirt. Like I'm a not mad at you. Yeah,

878
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:45,520
they're mad at,
you know,

879
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,670
cause what it was was there was
a guy who is with some chick,

880
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:50,230
she had a little meat on the bones,
whatever,

881
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,380
and he was went into it thinking I should
probably fucking lose it eventually.

882
00:52:53,381 --> 00:52:57,070
I don't know why he thought that
people tend to just get fatter.

883
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:02,410
Yeah. People, people do tend to age. It'd
be like this guy has a little gray hair.

884
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:05,740
Maybe it's going to turn Brown. No, it's
going to fuck it again. More Gray. Yes.

885
00:53:05,741 --> 00:53:07,900
So anyway,
my age and if so what happens is,

886
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,440
but she was putting it on at what he
considered to be an alarming rate.

887
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,090
So he wanted to stay with her,

888
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:18,420
but he needed to know how to approach
to ask her in a polite way to stay in

889
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,630
shape. Here's what all
these not least gained way.

890
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:24,580
Here's what all these proud fat people
are not like they're killing themselves.

891
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,100
So if somebody gives an intervention
and that this isn't about fatties is

892
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,590
they'll fucking sit there and
I'll talk about how addiction,

893
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,710
food addiction and all that is
no different than drug addiction.

894
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,220
I agree with you.
You legally agree with have it.

895
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:39,930
You have an intervention
with people to be like,

896
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,820
you're killing yourself with this heroin.

897
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,660
So I haven't for some reason
with big MACs. Yeah. You
can't fucking be like, hey,

898
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:48,150
why don't you lay off your
fucking chicken tenders there.

899
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,970
So I have a friend that, that
just had a kid, uh, my buddy, and,

900
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,980
uh, he, he was, he lost a little bit
of weight because he had prediabetes,

901
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:01,220
but he's putting it back on again. And
like, we had a thing tonight. And, uh,

902
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:04,190
and I was like, I was like,
hey man, like you, you know,

903
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,500
you look like you're putting on more
weight. And he goes, yeah, you know,

904
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:09,200
it's just the stress and blah, blah,
blah. I'm like, I know, but you know,

905
00:54:09,201 --> 00:54:13,550
we're celebrating your kid's birthday.
It's just, you should just, you know,

906
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,980
and he read wants to do it.
It's like that by saying that,

907
00:54:15,981 --> 00:54:19,370
it's just that reality check just to
let them know. I'm not shaming him,

908
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,820
but I don't think he's shaming his
girlfriend either. That the, you know,

909
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,930
that dude that, that wrote in. So it's,
it's just kinda like, hey, you know,

910
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:31,880
it's like you said, it's health. You know,
it's, you gotta you gotta Stop, you know?

911
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,600
Yeah. Fucking, just, you gotta
be exercise. If you want to live,

912
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,660
you got to exercise and take care
of yourself. What you eat is fuel.

913
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,110
It doesn't need to be doing everything.

914
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,820
I'm not gonna say his name, but a guy
I knew a couple of years ago. Yeah. Oh,

915
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:48,920
the last time I saw him, I saw him sit
down and go, this guy does not look good.

916
00:54:48,921 --> 00:54:52,760
And he was not eating healthy food.
Any I you fucking dead a month later.

917
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:56,540
Fuck yeah, dude. And it's just like, but
you're not supposed to say something.

918
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:01,040
Somebody who is addicted to heroin
but out and I got a temper and shit.

919
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:05,390
My wife can skin step in on that. But
there's something about like, you know,

920
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:09,890
being fat. These people are just
like, no man, I'm a fucking eight.

921
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,800
You've just been convinced by sis.
Like they take it, like you're saying,

922
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,690
they're not beautiful
people. It's like, you know,

923
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:17,840
if I just saw you would just some
fat shit. Yeah. I don't know.

924
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:20,370
But it wasn't my fucking idea
either, man. So yeah. Yeah.

925
00:55:20,371 --> 00:55:23,510
You can go fuck yourself with all
your stupid like that, that, that all,

926
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,490
all of that.
So you went to about brown shirt.

927
00:55:25,491 --> 00:55:26,780
The way this whole thing is written,

928
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,110
this is the kind of person that
tries to make you lose your job.

929
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,540
1000000% there.
They're very active on Yelp.

930
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:37,070
Yeah. All right, and then
fell titles. Hey, pasty pigs.

931
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,640
Spin takes chem professor, you've
asked about super bowl titles. First,

932
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:44,200
NFL championship. Oh Great. Maybe
this person has this solution.

933
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,260
The issue here is not the answer,
it's the question.

934
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,650
If someone asks which team
have never won a Superbowl,

935
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,660
it has a different answer than if someone
asks which team has never won an NFL

936
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:58,080
championship.
Even a complicated more,

937
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:01,060
you could ask who has never
won a league championship,

938
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,290
which also includes AFL champion
chips and other leagues. All right,

939
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:06,250
I understand all of this.

940
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,520
For official NFL champions from 1920
to 1932 there was no championship game.

941
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:17,080
The championship champion was decided
by the best record only. Okay.

942
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,700
Now none of this is answering my question.

943
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,190
That's like back in the day when baseball,

944
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:22,640
all those world series that they count,

945
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,690
do you not winning the pennant was
back in the year. Back in the day,

946
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,030
you had the brand of the regular season.

947
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:30,490
If you had the best record in the
American league, you won the pennant,

948
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,520
there was no play off. Yeah. And
then you went to the champions.

949
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,920
You went to the world series.
Yeah. So all those years,

950
00:56:35,921 --> 00:56:40,360
the Yankees won all those fucking titles.
They had one playoff series to win.

951
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,230
It wasn't this divisional,
it wasn't three rounds of playoffs,

952
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:47,680
which people have to do now are
they doing, but were they doing,

953
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:49,060
when they got into that world series was,

954
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,810
how many games was it was [inaudible]
seven that was still seven games.

955
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:56,830
The early 19 hundreds where it
was best was best five on a nine.

956
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,480
That's five out of nine. Yeah. Fuck Dude.

957
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:05,140
That would go until like December if they
did that now, like I think the Red Sox,

958
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:08,860
1903, we won that world series
five games to three. Hey man,

959
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:12,240
it's gay made coming to
your house for gay mate.

960
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,320
Um, anyways, from 1933 to 1969,

961
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:21,010
there was a championship game and the
winner of that was the NFL champion from

962
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:25,930
1966 on that champion went on to play
in the Superbowl and then when it was

963
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:29,860
called the world champion,
that's not true. 66, 67, 68,

964
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:34,710
the end of those seasons or
whatever, those are 66, 67, 68, 69,

965
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,470
whatever it was.

966
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,980
Those first three against the AFL was
called the AFL NFL title was not called

967
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:41,740
the soup bowl.
Later on retroactively,

968
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:46,330
it was named the super bowl from
1960 to 69 AFL had champions.

969
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:49,240
That's true.
But they aren't counted as NFL history,

970
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:53,890
but they are counted as the
team's history. If you are
asking how many? Yes. Okay.

971
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:58,810
Uh, from 1966, 69 in the NFL AFL
champions played the Superbowl.

972
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:03,310
I skies just telling me Shit. They didn't
play the Superbowl. It was renamed that

973
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:09,700
designers should be called facts.
Yeah, just facts. Facts. Facts, facts.

974
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:14,050
Facts. Okay. So in 1966, the AFL channels,

975
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,930
the Kansas City's ship chiefs, the
NFL champions, green bay packers.

976
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,200
This is the plus one league
championship for each team.

977
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,040
Chiefs lost when they played
in in the first NFL. If so,

978
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:27,490
they didn't get a Superbowl win,
but they still the AFL champion.

979
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,490
I understand all of this.
I understand all of this.

980
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,730
None of that cleared anything up.

981
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:39,160
I'm saying why don't they count those?
Yeah.

982
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,200
It's like you go to the stadium,

983
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:45,700
like the AFL merge to be part of the NFL.

984
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,530
So you're saying that at
any most NFL stadiums,

985
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:55,290
there are no trophies to represent
the league champions. Just yes.

986
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,520
If you look at the flow,
I'm sure in the,

987
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,050
somewhere in the stadium maybe
they'll have, they'll have that,

988
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:06,490
but it's just like, you know
when you go to a, you know,

989
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,070
you go to the fucking Red Sox,
Fenway park,

990
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:10,930
I mean we have our banners
right down the thing,

991
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:15,190
1903 to fucking 2018 yeah.

992
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,510
Everybody has all of that.
They're all of them count.

993
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:22,100
Know that that's there. I appreciate
it was fun to read all that history,

994
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:25,280
but that didn't answer my question.
Why aren't they counted?

995
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:27,460
Yeah.

996
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,550
I mean when it comes to the Superbowl man,
it's just if it's not in,

997
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,090
there's those words super in bowl
or before them they, they just,

998
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,670
they act like it didn't happen. You
Act like it didn't happen. Yeah.

999
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,350
Well I mean it's just,
you could still say do championships,

1000
00:59:41,351 --> 00:59:44,710
but I I, I completely see
what you're saying right now.

1001
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:48,040
It actually kind of fucked up
day on set about the eagles.

1002
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,940
They've never won a Superbowl.
They last thing they one was an NFL title.

1003
00:59:51,941 --> 00:59:52,390
It's like,
yeah,

1004
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:55,570
well that was the peak of fucking 1960
they were the best fucking football team

1005
00:59:55,571 --> 00:59:58,560
out there. And you're talking about her
like it would like they, they, they,

1006
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:03,490
they lost the election. Yeah, I
dunno. Anyways, living in Wyoming.

1007
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,280
Hey Billy, silly. It's silly city slicker.

1008
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:11,310
I was listening to some older podcasts
episodes and came across a rant you had

1009
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:15,770
about Wyoming. I like Wyoming. I didn't
remember what I said. Like these people,

1010
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,590
they just find tidbits. I
live in Wyoming. I got to say,

1011
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,150
you are not too far off.

1012
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:27,070
I listened to the podcast every
week while I feel my cows off,

1013
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,440
feed my cows off the back
of a flatbed truck. Shut up.

1014
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:32,560
I know this guy's fuck with me.

1015
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:37,060
Last week we killed a problem mountain
lion and next weekend we'll be entering

1016
01:00:37,061 --> 01:00:41,260
into a competitive coyote hunt. I live in
the absolute middle of fucking nowhere.

1017
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:44,530
This sounds amazing. This guy, this
guy listens to Steve Earle. Yeah.

1018
01:00:44,531 --> 01:00:48,760
But this guy is way more interesting in
a party than I am. I do stand up comedy.

1019
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,470
Oh yeah. What did you do? You know,
I saved five of our sheep, you know,

1020
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:57,130
from a mountain lion by, uh,
I came in third in it off.

1021
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:00,970
I came in third in the coyote hunt
nationals. I want to talk to that guy.

1022
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:05,620
The nearest town population is 3000
miles and it's 40 miles away. Also,

1023
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:06,700
just to clear the air,

1024
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:11,230
most of the billionaire
cons live up in Jackson,

1025
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,600
uh, and the rest of Wyoming.
Oh, that's what I was saying.

1026
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:16,930
I still want to be the Douche in Hollywood
that gets a place in Wyoming and the

1027
01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:20,350
rest of Wyoming pretty much discounts.
Jackson is being

1028
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,720
part of the state anyway,

1029
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,750
so I'll pretty much discounts it as
being part of state. Partially unrelated.

1030
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,110
I finished getting my pilot's license
last year and hope to start on my

1031
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:31,160
helicopter rating within the next year.
Good for you.

1032
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:35,730
My family has used a bell jet
ranger to hunt coyotes. Jesus.

1033
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,210
How much more of an advantage do
you need for three generations now?

1034
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,260
And I'm ready to start flying the Holly,

1035
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,610
do you have like one of those fucking
Vietnam guns? Dead Job. Yeah. Job Doo,

1036
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,460
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Today.
How do you shoot a doe? Easy.

1037
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,680
You just don't lead him as much.
Uh,

1038
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,620
am I ready to start flying
the heli to carry on the,

1039
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,900
Oh and I'm ready to start flying.
They had to carry and a tradition,

1040
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:59,600
so cheers to a fellow pilot.
That's cool as shit. Uh,

1041
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,650
just wanted to let you know there's at
least one can listen to your podcasts in

1042
01:02:02,651 --> 01:02:06,070
Wyoming and love all the shit you
put out things. And Go fuck yourself.

1043
01:02:06,071 --> 01:02:09,730
That's cool man. I'm trying to get
eight hours a month, uh, flying.

1044
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,200
And have you been flying a lot recently?

1045
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:14,920
I got 7.9 for this month and
I'm fine tomorrow morning.

1046
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,720
And then what are you
gonna take me up dude? Huh?

1047
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,800
When I have three over 300 hours,
uh,

1048
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,450
I want to do a little bit of instrument
training and just get better at it and,

1049
01:02:23,451 --> 01:02:25,100
and like do some full,
I would,

1050
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,350
I would do full downs in the whole fucking
thing before I would ever take up my

1051
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,820
first passenger. And I love you too
much to have you be my first passenger,

1052
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:37,110
but there's a few people in my life that
I like, so I'll be taking them up first.

1053
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,930
Okay. I believe that. And then, do
you know what I mean? It's just like,

1054
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:41,910
do I want to kill this guy or this guy?
Wait,

1055
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:45,210
dude wasn't like Sophie's choice with
a helicopter. How are we going to go?

1056
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:49,260
We're going to go to see iron maiden in
Las Vegas and then that should be like

1057
01:02:49,261 --> 01:02:51,140
the time that we do that.
Does that,

1058
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:59,490
sorry. Ps. If you want to try
a new cigar, checkout deadwood,

1059
01:02:59,491 --> 01:03:02,730
tobacco company out of Deadwood,
South Dakota.

1060
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,900
The sweet Jane is is my favorite
cigar I have ever smoked. See you.

1061
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,670
You see your ball.
Fuck.

1062
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:12,420
Well I mean some guy out there in
the fucking range shooting coyotes.

1063
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,720
I bet you know. Go to deadwood. Yeah,
that sounds fucking pretty cool to me.

1064
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,220
All right,
we've got to wrap this thing up.

1065
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:21,270
Do we get some gas and the smoke in the
desert? It's our three minutes. Perfect.

1066
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,890
Alright. Drone. You'll Billy up there. Uh,

1067
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:28,620
you were talking about a drawing last
week that would taxi people around.

1068
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:33,000
Sounded like the one you mentioned
was unmanned. Check this thing out.

1069
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:36,660
It's 57 batteries yet to do that is, I
was joking about that fucking thing dude.

1070
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:37,470
They,

1071
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,930
they're going to do this thing rather
than deal with the population problem.

1072
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:43,120
The next thing they do is have
like, like I got, it looks like a,

1073
01:03:43,121 --> 01:03:45,350
it looks like a helicopter
and you just get in it.

1074
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,770
There's nobody in there and he'll
just like take you across to la now.

1075
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:52,530
First of all, I would think it would be
super expensive unless it's electric.

1076
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:56,780
Unless, yeah. Uh, Elon Musk can
make the thing, but dude, you know,

1077
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:00,810
you fucking laptop crashes. Your phone
craps out on you. Oh, you open like dude,

1078
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,010
you're going to fly somebody like over
eight, like the level of insurance.

1079
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:06,240
Like how are you going to do that?

1080
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,860
I was joking that you're going to have
some hipster come fly through was on his

1081
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:15,750
way to a pocket watch convention out
in fucking Venice beach or something.

1082
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,090
Oh we found was his handlebar mustache.
Yeah.

1083
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:22,680
He was on his way to this to meet
this food truck. Um, yeah, whatever.

1084
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:26,430
I think it was. So there, there is a, so
what I just thought I'd get this clear in.

1085
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:29,100
Okay. Can I show you something
super pleased show to me. Boy.

1086
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:30,840
I remember just trying to, cause
I'm not, I'm kind of confused.

1087
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:35,841
You're saying there is going to be a
transportation that like is it a drone?

1088
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,570
So it's like you get into a tube and
then it just lifts the tube up and flies.

1089
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,750
You kind of looks like a helicopter.
It looks fucking cool as shit.

1090
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,620
I figured it looks fucking cool. You show
it as though he's showing me now. Wow.

1091
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:50,570
I want to show you this,
this app here for flight.

1092
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:55,880
Um, and this is what I'm getting
better at here. So this, this here,

1093
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,580
once I get good at,
you know,

1094
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,670
confident enough in my abilities and
I take up a passenger so it just,

1095
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,593
you don't have to know.

1096
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:10,040
It's not like back in the fucking day
we'd had to have like a fucking sectional

1097
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:14,030
map on your and you fucking
thigh as you're flying around.

1098
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,180
This thing gives you all the,
uh, the airports, all the, um,

1099
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:24,790
any of Santa Barbara. Where are we?
Where are we? The, there's Van Nuys,

1100
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:29,410
there's Burbank right there. So
it's pink. So that's a Charlie. Uh,

1101
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:30,244
and then you got,
oh,

1102
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,820
it's so great is you could just fucking
type in whatever you want to type in.

1103
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:37,540
It gives you, the aid is, it
gives you the, uh, contact tower.

1104
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,660
It has a map runway.

1105
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:43,090
This is probably what most of the time
would you land out there and why they

1106
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:45,490
slam on the brakes because
this is so fucking short.

1107
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,850
That is a small ass
landing strip. Yeah. Uh,

1108
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,260
well I don't know how he
could tell it from the APP.

1109
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:55,180
I think cause I just told you it was
um, uh, being a cut right now. Uh,

1110
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,250
there's Lti Burbank,
there's El Monte.

1111
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:01,700
It's one of my favorite ones
but it has all but it has,

1112
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,340
see what would you see with,
this is so boring for people here,

1113
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:07,340
but you see right there, that's
a delta. So grounded 2,400.

1114
01:06:07,341 --> 01:06:10,250
So right here when you're flying
it on the, the two 15, you know,

1115
01:06:10,251 --> 01:06:11,330
I'm going to be in the aerospace,

1116
01:06:11,331 --> 01:06:15,560
I got to call them and they'll just
give you clearance all the way through.

1117
01:06:15,561 --> 01:06:17,580
And then once you learn how
to read this fucking thing,

1118
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:20,570
you can kind of just fly around out here.
Now the rest of the country,

1119
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,710
they actually have to
deal with that weather.

1120
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,500
See I don't have to deal with because
people like you should just fly across the

1121
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:29,970
country. It's like, this is a dry climate.
I don't have to ever deal with, hey,

1122
01:06:29,971 --> 01:06:33,600
everything's do all that it all of
a sudden yet I can't see anything.

1123
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:39,030
There's a brutal fucking call of a guy
who like me is not instrument rated.

1124
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,520
Yeah. Which means if the
clouds came in underneath me,

1125
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:44,370
I don't know how to get back down other
than to just shut my eyes and go through

1126
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:46,380
the clouds and hope I fuck. Yeah. Yeah.

1127
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:49,920
So he's up there in the soup is or
whatever the fuck they call it and do this

1128
01:06:49,921 --> 01:06:54,060
guy is free. I've got a
dog. And then they fought,

1129
01:06:54,061 --> 01:06:59,061
the guy talked him down and then
afterwards he fucking so he lived.

1130
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,850
Yeah, but he called the tower.
He goes uh yeah, thanks about,

1131
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,650
and the guy says total ice go. Yeah. Well
he goes, what happened up there? Yeah,

1132
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:10,080
you fucking pussy is basically saying
what happened up there as he got involved

1133
01:07:10,081 --> 01:07:13,220
in some shit that, that you know,
he wasn't looking for. So that's,

1134
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:17,610
that's the one weird thing about flying
is you learned by other people die

1135
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:23,350
are doing dumb shit cause he died one,
one size going,

1136
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,560
she'll be one one time with this guy
was doing a tour in the 44 a Robinson 44

1137
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:32,520
and he had three people then
when he took off, right? Yeah.

1138
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:36,360
I'm fucking just did this really just,
I don't know what, he just didn't go,

1139
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,580
like he just ignored everything
you're supposed to do.

1140
01:07:38,581 --> 01:07:42,650
He was loaded up with people. He
had, I imagine, you know, a low,

1141
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,710
heavy with fuel.

1142
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:47,460
So what you wanna do is you should
forward momentum to get going.

1143
01:07:47,461 --> 01:07:51,810
And he just pulled all this fucking
power and as low RPM horn comes on.

1144
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:56,250
And now the weird thing was the chicken,
the passengers, she was going, whew.

1145
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,350
Like why did this like
the same fucking note?

1146
01:07:58,351 --> 01:08:01,350
So he didn't hear it at first and
all he had to do, he was bank,

1147
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:02,161
come out of the bank,

1148
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:06,600
lower your collective and it'll go
off and then just gradually climb up.

1149
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:09,270
And he did it for a second and
then he pulled it out again.

1150
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:12,750
And it came on again and then
he just started descending. And

1151
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,820
your instinct is want to poke
cause you want to go up. Yeah,

1152
01:08:16,821 --> 01:08:19,520
she wanna you actually want
to bring you collect it down.

1153
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:22,400
He kept pulling power in
these. Fuck, we're in the
ground. They all fucking died.

1154
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,840
Oh fuck man. So I'll take you up.
All right. Girlfriend is pregnant.

1155
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:30,900
Hey Billy sat. It's um, I'm,

1156
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:35,990
I'm 28 years old. Am I? 26 year old
girlfriend just found out she's pregnant.

1157
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:38,660
Now you're saying this dude like
you didn't blow the load dinner.

1158
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,840
She found out she's pregnant. Like she
got fucking shingles of something. Uh,

1159
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:47,690
this came as a big sharp
because I previously had a
vasectomy when I was 22. Ah,

1160
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,510
there's the ants. Jesus Christ at 22. You,

1161
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:55,010
they had nine kids by then and he never
wanted any here in the second 22 said,

1162
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:57,830
I never had never wanted
kids after she told me,

1163
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:02,900
I went to a urologist who told me I had
regained a sperm count, although rare,

1164
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:06,530
it was not unheard of. When I met
this girl, she changed my life.

1165
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:09,050
I had never trusted her.
Loved any woman the way I do her.

1166
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:13,940
She's the light of my life, but weren't
planning on this. We both have okay jobs,

1167
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:17,510
but living in California is expensive
and adding a third mouth to feed and

1168
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:20,510
paying for doctors visits
will crush us financially.

1169
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:23,690
She doesn't have health insurance.
Do you have any advice for me?

1170
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:28,730
My fear is losing the chance to have
kids with her as this may be a miracle

1171
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:33,710
considering my vasectomy and considered
you waited a long time to have kids.

1172
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:37,070
I want to know if you think this would
be a good for someone in my position to

1173
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:37,904
go through this.

1174
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:42,080
Thanks for taking the time to read this
poorly and probably not under understand

1175
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:46,790
my situation. You will. Great.
Cont uh, the old grey county word,

1176
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:49,130
he used to be.
Love your shows and I hope you here.

1177
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,080
I hope to hear more of
your ramblings from you.

1178
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:56,830
Best to you the baby and go fuck
yourself and your gay ass patriots.

1179
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:02,180
All right. Um, can I take this cause
I think that he should do it. Yeah,

1180
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,910
I think you do. Don't, don't wait on life
for your financial situation, man. If, if,

1181
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:10,310
if you guys will make it work,
that's what you will make it work.

1182
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,970
You'll figure it out. You might not think
that you have enough money right now,

1183
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:18,560
but something like life is constantly
changing and evolving and it's just like

1184
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:21,480
lay off the micro Bruce and
have the kid. Yeah, exactly.

1185
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:25,490
It's like you'll make it work. Just
I think you should, you should.

1186
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,270
You should consider it a miracle. Just
like you said, I think it's a great thing.

1187
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:33,980
I'm actually really happy
for you and I think a, put it
this way, I wish, you know,

1188
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:37,750
I wish I didn't wait as long as I did.
And the other day I was watching this,

1189
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,180
I was watching this,
uh, this kid's song. Um,

1190
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:45,240
it's just as simple as like
snow flakes, Snow Flake lit. Oh,

1191
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,980
snow flakes, no flakes, snow
flake, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

1192
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,050
And my daughter was trying to sing it
and she was throwing her head back goes,

1193
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:57,010
Yo. Flags I think wasn't
quite impaired, dude. I,

1194
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,140
I had to fight off getting emotional.
Just watching her do that.

1195
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:05,210
She's the most beautiful thing in the
world. And there's nothing, up until then,

1196
01:11:05,211 --> 01:11:10,180
anything fucking I've done. Madison
Square Garden was not as good as that,

1197
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,420
not eat and not even remotely is he
like lit Madeline's programs like wow,

1198
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:18,330
that's amazing. But that moment
with my daughter, I was like,

1199
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:21,920
this is what life is all about.
100% this is what it's all about.

1200
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:25,110
And then another great thing is you become
a dad and one of the greatest fucking

1201
01:11:25,111 --> 01:11:29,280
things ever and some sage advice I
learned from a good dad is he said,

1202
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:31,680
how awesome is cause he goes,
it's not about you anymore.

1203
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:35,700
And at first I kind of took that as
like, you know, cause I'm a very like,

1204
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,980
like don't tell me what the fuck to do
idiot sometimes. And then I realized,

1205
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,580
uh, uh, how great that is.

1206
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,300
Like the other day I finally had a day
off and my wife wanted to go on and go

1207
01:11:48,301 --> 01:11:50,130
get some breakfast. She goes, you
want to do that? I was like, no,

1208
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:53,400
finally homeowner to stay home
instead. I was just like, I fuck it.

1209
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:56,100
That's what she wants to do. And we
just went out there and I said, yeah,

1210
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:58,110
it's not about you.
They want to go out to breakfast,

1211
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,550
take them out the fucking breakfast.

1212
01:11:59,551 --> 01:12:02,790
And I went out to breakfast and I had
a great fucking time and I had a great

1213
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:05,700
time. And it's weird when you're home,
you're a dad or whatever, blah, blah.

1214
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:09,770
But when you go out, you kind of feel more
like a dad. I don't know why. We know,

1215
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,540
it's like you can take them out to
dinner or whatever out of the car.

1216
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,390
You're walk and she's holding your
hand or you're carrying her. You go in,

1217
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,090
you get her in the little booster seat,
he'd get her or whatever.

1218
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:21,450
Like it's usually like a Mac and cheese
or like a cut up hot dog or some shit.

1219
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,390
And I assume that she's at that
age and you didn't, you just,

1220
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,440
people are looking at the kid and look
how beautiful the kid is and everything.

1221
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:31,470
I know. It's just like, dude, you're in
your element, man. Yeah, no, it's awesome.

1222
01:12:31,471 --> 01:12:36,030
I know what's cool. She's really,
really beginning to talk now. So, uh,

1223
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,660
yeah it's getting to the point where I
can actually convey to her and she will

1224
01:12:39,661 --> 01:12:43,380
understand how much I love her, which is
going to be great cause that's doable.

1225
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,080
Yeah. Cause I always say you as how
much I love you. Do you understand that?

1226
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:48,620
And it should just be looking at
you smiling or whatever, but I'll,

1227
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:52,500
I'll actually be able to say it.
She'll be able to understand it. Yeah.

1228
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,630
I can't wait.
Can't wait to fucking play catch with her.

1229
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,510
I want to teach her how to drive my truck.
Three on the tree.

1230
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:02,680
What kid born in 2018 is going to know
how to work seven. Sorry. No, I know.

1231
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:06,390
I did forget about drivers stick five
three on the column. I took it today.

1232
01:13:06,391 --> 01:13:08,520
I took it over to a Jiffy Lube,

1233
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:11,030
which I know a lot of fucking car people
are going to give me shit for that.

1234
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,560
You went to Jiffy Lube? Well
I would change it but the,
the way they designed the,

1235
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:17,460
the guy who ever fucking design the
engine did not talk to the guy who fucking

1236
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:19,950
design the frame on that truck.
Because the frame,

1237
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,160
there's like literally a piece that
goes from one side or the other right

1238
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:25,980
underneath the fucking plug for the
drain play at Penn. So the only,

1239
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,530
it's just a giant fucking mess.

1240
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:32,430
Like when they do what they have to have
this giant thing underneath it and it

1241
01:13:32,431 --> 01:13:36,060
comes down and it splashes all over that,
that piece that goes across.

1242
01:13:36,061 --> 01:13:39,540
And then they have like this spray thing
and then the air thing that they shoot

1243
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,261
all off.
It's like,

1244
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:43,740
I'm going to do that in my garage and
have a fucking oil spill. I can't do it.

1245
01:13:43,741 --> 01:13:47,880
I hate it. I used to love doing it
when I was a kid. I used to though.

1246
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,400
It was like my favorite thing because I
knew how to do what I would change the

1247
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:53,220
fuel filter. I knew how to do a loop
job and he'll do the whole fucking,

1248
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,900
all of that maintenance stuff.

1249
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:59,130
But I never had the balls to start taking
apart the fucking engine or whatever.

1250
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:03,420
But uh, anyways, that's the podcast.
We've got a cigar to smoke. Uh, Hey,

1251
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:06,060
your pick for the Superbowl patriots.

1252
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:12,040
A Rams I think is going to
be the patriots. I really
do think so. I do. I can do

1253
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,260
to be honest with you. Like I, I kind of,

1254
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:19,090
I love watching greatness and I know
what people like to hate on the Patriots

1255
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:22,960
and I know I teased you sometimes, but
it's just like, dude, he's, he's so good.

1256
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:24,130
The team is so good man.

1257
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:26,980
And it's like to be able to say that
I watched Michael Jordan wins six.

1258
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,730
Like I know I was alive during that and
nobody else has matched that greatness

1259
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:31,640
except for Tom Brady.

1260
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:34,660
Well,
I think it's going to,

1261
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:39,310
I'm going to die a thousand deaths as
always and I really think that, uh,

1262
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,680
I mean we're going up against what's
looking like the next bell a check. Uh,

1263
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,410
I mean the kitchen big to me, he's
like fucking 33 34 years old. I mean,

1264
01:14:47,411 --> 01:14:50,860
it's fucking ridiculous skin dude.
He was our offensive coordinator.

1265
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:53,470
Like we gave him up like he,

1266
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:57,410
we have fucking one of the Goddamn
Gruden's you ain't doing shit. I know.

1267
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,660
Felecia coached the browns at one point
and it happens too. It happens. All right.

1268
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,840
Uh, that's the podcast.
I'm hoping my patriots win.

1269
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:08,590
I have no idea what's going to happen.
The fucking rams look great.

1270
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,380
And I think their quarterback, like
they just don't make quarterbacks away.

1271
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,990
They used to like,
they don't come into the league scared.

1272
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:18,730
They just fucking come in like Ah,
whatever. I don't know what it is.

1273
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:22,150
Maybe because they video games and shit
they've already seen. It's like, oh,

1274
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,430
I remember that gauge to beat them
all the time and eighth grade.

1275
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,800
Now I'm playing him
now he's fucking older.

1276
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:29,020
I'm not scared of any of these
people. All right, I'm rambling.

1277
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,740
Can I get my final pitch on the
podcast? Yes guys. Everybody, uh,

1278
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:36,880
my podcast called the 500 with Josh
Adam Meyers join the record book club or

1279
01:15:36,881 --> 01:15:40,530
going through the 500 greatest albums of
all time. Bill's done it. Jim Jefferies.

1280
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:44,380
We got to just table Wanda Sykes. Do
an earth wind and fire. It's cool.

1281
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,470
It's my fucking favorite
thing I've ever done.

1282
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:51,490
Experience the greatest music of all
time and then here a me and had done a

1283
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:56,020
comic talk shit about it. Not Shit.
We just go through it. I had a great,

1284
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:59,830
