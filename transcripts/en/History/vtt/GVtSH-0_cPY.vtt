00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.380
J NEILSON: Blade smiths,
welcome to our strength test.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.380
Now, what I'm going to do
is take each of your knives

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.120
and I'm going to thrust and
chop into these paint cans

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.670
several times.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.670
I don't really care what
your blades do to the cans,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.830
it's more about what the
cans do to your blades.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.620
Nick, you're up first.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.880
You ready?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.960
NICK: As ready as
I'm going to get.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.330
J NEILSON: That's all I ask for.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.040
NICK: My biggest concern
is that the blade

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.670
may not be sharp enough.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.420
It came out pretty
thick and I didn't

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.330
get to spend enough
time refining the edge

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.540
as I would like.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.540
[music playing]

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:44.920
[metal banging]

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
BRIAN: I'm so glad I
wore my brown pants.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.580
J NEILSON: First off, your
blade now looks like a ka-bar,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.170
which is what we asked for.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.880
Not the most comfortable
handle I've ever held on to.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880
It was really not much
in the way of indexing.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.000
I really needed
a glove for this.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.080
That being said, you
did give me a good guard

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.500
and you did give me
a button on the back,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.750
so when I pull
from the stab, I've

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.960
got something to hold onto.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.620
It doesn't just
slide out of my hand.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.960
But the big issue is a
bunch of little chips in it.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.290
See right there there's a
flake still sticking out.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.080
You still have most
of an edge, but now

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.040
it's partially serrated.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.540
But overall, it held up.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.250
Good job.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.080
NICK: Thank you.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.960
J NEILSON: Ready, Brian?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.080
BRIAN: Go for it.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.540
J NEILSON: I'm going to.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.620
BRIAN: My gut is in a knot.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.960
I'm afraid of my blade failing.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.420
[music playing]

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:50.750
[metal banging]
Ahh.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.170
J NEILSON: All right Brian,
we obviously have an issue.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.790
Welding on that back bar
to try and reinforce it

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.460
was a good idea.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.960
I think a little heat added
a little more stress to it.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.000
BRIAN: It was somewhat
expected, but I

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.500
am defeated on the inside.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.290
WIL WILLIS: Blade smiths,
these weapons tests

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.920
are designed to be
intentionally difficult to set

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.420
you apart from one another.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.750
Brian, your blade suffered
a catastrophic failure,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.170
but that doesn't mean that
you're out of this competition.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.250
One of our blades smiths still
has to perform this test.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.920
So your fate and his fate
ride entirely on the strength

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.540
of Alex's blade.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.040
ALEX: If my blade breaks,
I don't know what happens.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.380
I've got a couple big cracks
so I'm pretty concerned.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.380
[music playing]

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:51.210
[metal banging]

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.380
J NEILSON: Alex, nice job.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.960
Your edge held up very well.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.500
There was minor chipping.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.790
But overall, you've got
most of your edge on there.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.000
Good job.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.290
ALEX: Thank you.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.460
WIL WILLIS: Alex,
your blade held up.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.880
Brian, that means that your
blade did not make the cut.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.540
You suffered a
catastrophic weapons

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.750
failure in our strength test.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.580
And for that reason,
I have to ask

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.540
you to please leave the forge.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.920
BRIAN: Good job.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.250
Good job.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.920
I'm going home today
because it was honestly

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.420
my welding of my
cubes in the beginning

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.830
that led to all my problems.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.580
But going forward
I've learned a lot.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.380
And I picked up a bromance.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.750
I got a bro down in Florida
now, so that's awesome.
