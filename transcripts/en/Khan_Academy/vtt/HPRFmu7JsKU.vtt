00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.040
In the last video, I told you
that if I had a hyperbola with

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.080
the equation x squared over a
squared minus y squared over b

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.500
squared is equal to 1, that the
focal distance for this

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.750
hyperbola is just equal to the
square root of the sum

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.995
of these two numbers.

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:22.510
The square root of a
squared plus b squared.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.910
In this video I really just
want to show you that.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.290
And actually, just so you know,
this equation right here, this

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.090
is a particular hyperbola that
opens to the left

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.650
and the right.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.900
And that's because those
are the asymptote points.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.970
Those would be the axis.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.350
And that's because the
x term is positive.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.690
If the y term was positive and
the x term had a negative sign,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.210
then the hyperbola would open
upwards and downwards,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.470
like that.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.890
And the proof that I'm showing
you in this video, it's just a

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.110
bunch of algebra, really, is
identical in the y case, you'd

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.710
just switch around
x's and the y's.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.130
But I just wanted to make
sure you realize that.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.050
That I'm just doing a
particular case of hyperbola

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.370
that opens the left
and the right.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.830
I could call it a horizontal
hyperbola, instead of a

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.840
vertical one, but I wanted
to make it clear there is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.730
another type of hyperbola.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.790
But anyway, let's draw a
graphical representation of all

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.530
this just to make sure
we understand, or we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.640
re-understand, or better
understand what the foci points

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.570
are and where they sit on the
hyperbola So those are my axis.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.910
The asymptotes of this
hyperbola are the lines

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.090
y is equal to plus
or minus b over a.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.830
Oh woops, not using
my line tool.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.530
So, that's one and that's
the other asymptote.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.410
then the hyperbola will
look something like this.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.670
It looks something like that.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.940
It's going to intersect at
a comma 0, right there.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.700
This is going to be a comma 0.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.140
And the intersect at
minus a comma 0.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.460
We saw this in the
previous video.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.080
It looks something like that.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.370
And then the focus
points are going to sit

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.070
out here someplace.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.980
There and there.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.090
And the focal length this
a squared plus b square.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.940
The square root of a
squared plus b squared.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.690
That's just this
distance right here.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.000
That distance is
the focal length.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.080
So this is going to be the
point f,0 and this is going

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.330
to be the point minus f,0.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.510
Now we learned in the last
video that one of the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.070
definitions of a hyperbola is
the locus of all points, or the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.940
set of all points, where if I
take the difference of the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.700
distances to the two foci, that
difference will be

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.340
a constant number.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.620
So if this is the point x comma
y, and it could be any point

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.730
that satisfies this equation,
it's any point on the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.840
byperbola, we know, or we are
told, that if we take this

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.120
distance right here-- --let's
call that d1 --and subtract

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.370
from that the distance to the
high other foci-- call that d2

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.190
--that that number is a
constant regardless of where we

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.950
are on the hyperbola.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.530
In fact the locus of all points
are-- the hyperbole in fact

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.820
is all of the points that
satisfy that condition.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.500
And we learned in last video
just by taking the difference

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.390
of the distance, we picked this
point and we said, OK, what's

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.070
that distance minus
that distance.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.070
And we figured out
that it's 2a.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.570
So d1 minus d2 is equal to--
I'm going off the video screen

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.800
--d1 minus d2 is equal to 2a.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.130
So let's use this fact right
here that d1 minus d2 is equal

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.190
to 2a, to try to prove this.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.160
Right there.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.890
So the first thing to do is
figure out what d1 and d2.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.140
Just using the
distance formula.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.930
So what's d1?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.670
d1 is the distance between this
point and this point minus f0.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.280
So what you do is we just
use the distance formula,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.980
which is really just
Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.840
So it's the difference
of the x's.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.850
It's the x distance.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.890
So it's x minus f squared
plus the y distances.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.010
y minus 0, so that's
just y, squared.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.290
Take the square root of that.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.530
So that's d1, right there.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.140
d1.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.570
And we want to subtract
from that d2.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.090
the difference of the
distances, and in this case d1

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.770
is definitely bigger than d2.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.540
Or you could take the absolute
values if you didn't want

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.870
to worry about that.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.740
And so here, we get the square
root of x minus f, x minus

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.720
f squared, plus y squared.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.790
What does that equal to?

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.570
Well, we said that equals
to 2a, that equals this

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.350
distance right here.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.255
So that is equal to 2a.

00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:47.180
Now let's see if we can
simplify this at all.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.430
Well an interesting thing to do
my just to be the put this on

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.350
the other side of the equation.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.120
And this just can get hairy,
so I really hope I don't

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.230
make any careless mistakes.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.850
So this becomes-- and I might
write small to save space

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.220
--this becomes x plus f, right,
minus minus, squared plus y

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:15.810
squared is equal to 2a plus the
square root of x minus f

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.180
squared plus y squared.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.240
Now, to get rid of these
radicals, let's square both

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.740
sides of this equation.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.990
The left hand side, if you were
to square it just becomes x

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.980
plus f squared plus y squared.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.970
And then to square this we have
to square the first term,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.140
which is 4a squared.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.630
Then we multiply the two terms
and multiply that by 2, right?

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.530
We're just taking this whole
thing and squaring it, so

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.370
that's-- and this is just a
review of kind of binomial

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.960
algebra --so this is equal to
plus 2a times this times 2 is

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.980
4a times the square root of
x minus f squared plus y.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.430
y squared, I don't want to lose
that squared right there.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.780
And then we square this term.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.870
And this is just
multiplying a binomial.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.300
So that's equal to-- you just
get rid of the radical sign,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.760
and I'm just going to be
staying in that color for now

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.270
--that's equal to x minus
f squared plus y squared.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.670
And already it looks like
there's some cancellation

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.220
that we can do.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.430
We can cancel out-- there's a
y squared on both sides of

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.270
this equation --so let's
just cancel those out.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.940
Subtract y squared from both
sides of the equation.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.070
And let's multiply
this term out.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:42.840
So this right here is x squared
plus 2xf plus f squared.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.940
And then that is equal to 4a
squared plus 4a times the

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:58.896
square root of x minus f
squared plus y squared.

00:06:58.896 --> 00:07:00.750
And then multiply this out.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:07.230
Plus x squared minus
2xf plus f squared.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.860
And then let's see, what
can we cancel out.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.150
We have x squared on both
sides of this, we subtract

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.400
x squared from both
sides of the equation.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.460
We have an f squared on both
sides of the equation so

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.760
let's cancel that out.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.430
And let's see, what can
we do to simplify it.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.330
So we have a minus
2xf and a plus 2xf.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.080
Let's add 2xf to both sides
this equation or bring

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.670
this term over here.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.610
So if you add 2xf to both sides
of this equation-- let's see,

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.180
my phone is ringing, let me
just turn it off --if you add

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.780
2xf to both sides of this
equation, what do you get?

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.010
You get 4xf-- remember I just
brought this term over this

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:52.710
left hand side --is equal to
4a squared plus 4a times a

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:58.120
square root of x minus f
squared plus y squared.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.270
It's easy to get lost
in the algebra.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.690
Remember all we're doing, just
to kind of remind you of what

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.410
this whole point was, we're
just simplifying the difference

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.290
of the distances between these
two points, and then see how

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.840
it relates to the equation
of the hyperbola itself.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.570
The a's and the b's.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:19.980
Let's take this 4a put it on
this side, so you get 4xf minus

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:27.820
4a squared is equal to 4a times
the square root of-- well let's

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.950
just multiply this out 'cause
we'll probably have to

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:36.470
eventually --x squared minus
2xf plus f squared

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.500
plus y squared.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.990
That's this just
multiplied out.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.000
That's the y squared
right there.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.160
We could divide both
sides of this by 4.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.390
All I'm trying to do is just
simplify this as much as

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:54.180
possible, so then this becomes
xf minus a squared is equal to

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.450
a times the square root
of this whole thing.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:05.970
x squared minus 2xf plus f
squared plus why squared.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.140
And now we could square
both sides of this

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.440
equation right here.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.060
And then if you square both
sides, this side becomes x

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:26.900
squared f squared minus 2a
squared xf plus a

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.020
to the fourth.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.610
That's this side squared.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.600
And that's equal to, if you
square the right hand side, a

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.490
squared times the square of
a square root is just that

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:46.180
expression, x squared minus 2xf
plus f squared plus y squared.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.470
This really is quite hairy.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.350
And let's see what
we can do now.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.340
Let's divide both sides of this
equation by a squared, and then

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.150
you get x squared-- I'm really
just trying to simplify this as

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.000
much as possible --over a
squared minus-- so the a

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.500
squareds cancel out --minus 2xf
plus a to the fourth divided a

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.470
square well that's
just a squared.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:19.840
So a squared is equal to x
squared minus 2xf plus f

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.900
squared plus y squared.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.410
Well good.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.360
There's something
to cancel out.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.280
There's a mine 2xf on both
sides of this equation so

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.870
let's cancel that out.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.530
Simplify our situation
a little bit.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.210
And let's see, we have.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.580
so we could do is subtract
this x squared from this.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:43.300
So you get-- let me rewrite
it --so you get x squared

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.100
f squared over a squared
minus x squared.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.330
And let's bring this y to this
side of the equation too.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.240
So minus y squared.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.900
That's all I did, I just
brought that to that side.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.540
And then let's bring-- and I'm
kind of skipping a couple of

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.310
steps, but I don't want to take
too long --let's take this a

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.580
and put it on that
side equation.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.430
So we took the x and the y,
we subtracted that from

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.220
both sides of the equation.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.040
So they ended up on
the left hand side.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.600
And then if we subtract a
squared from both sides of this

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.510
equation-- this is a fatiguing
problem --then you get f

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.850
squared minus a squared.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.370
I think we're almost there.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.970
This can simplify to,
let's see we can factor

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.340
out the x squared.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:33.640
This becomes f squared
over a squared minus

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.790
1 times x squared.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.420
I just factor out the x squared
there, minus y squared is equal

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.750
to f squared, the focal length
squared, minus a squared.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.310
And let's see, let's divide
both sides of the equation by

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.230
this expression right there,
and we get-- and this should

00:11:53.230 --> 00:12:00.490
start to look familiar --we get
f squared over a squared minus

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:09.770
1, x squared divided by f
squared minus a squared minus y

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:15.450
squared over f squared mine
is a squared is equal 1.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.880
Right, I divided both sides
by this, so I just get a 1

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.910
on this right hand side.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.930
Let's see if I can
simplify this.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.790
If I multiply the numerator
and the denominator

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.850
by a squared, right?

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.420
As long as I multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.430
by the same number I'm just
multiplying my 1, so I'm

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.870
not changing anything.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:36.200
So if I do that, the numerator
becomes f-- if I multiply it,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.880
it becomes f squared
minus a squared.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.080
I'm just multiplying
that times a squared.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.750
And the denominator
becomes a squared times f

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.240
squared minus a squared.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.680
And all that times x squared.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.100
Minus y squared minus
a squared mine is a

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.160
squared is equal to 1.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.450
This cancels with this.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.630
And we get something to
starting to look like the

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.180
equation of a hyperbola.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.080
My energy is coming back!

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.510
It seems like I see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:14.550
We get x squared over a squared
minus y squared over f minus

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.260
a squared is equal to 1.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.820
Now this looks a lot like our
original equation of the

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.940
hyperbola, which was x squared
over a squared minus y squared

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.630
over b squared is equal to 1.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.790
In fact this is equation of the
hyperbola but instead set of

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.580
writing b squared, since we
wrote it, we essentially said,

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.030
what is the locus of all points
where the difference of the

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.410
distances to those two
foci is equal to 2a?

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.010
And we just played with
the algebra for while.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.410
It was pretty tiring, and I'm
impressed if you've gotten this

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.860
far into the video, and we got
this equation, which should be

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.890
the equation of the hyperbola,
and it is the equation

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:51.520
of the hyperbole.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.110
It is this equation.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.690
So this is the same
thing is that.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.390
So f squared minus a square.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.460
Or the focal length squared
minus a squared is

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.830
equal to b squared.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.170
You add a squared to both
sides, and you get f squared

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.740
is equal to b squared plus
a squared or a squared

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.190
plus b squared.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.310
Which tells us that the focal
length is equal to the

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.960
square root of this.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.440
Of a squared plus b squared.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.440
And that's what we set out to
figure out in the beginning.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.020
So hopefully you're now
satisfied that the focal length

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.480
of a hyperbola is the sum of
these two denominators.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.940
And it's also truth if it is an
upward or vertical hyperbola.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.220
And if we're dealing with an
ellipse, it's the difference of

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.590
these two-- the square root
of the difference of

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.730
these two numbers.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.240
Anyway, I'll leave you there.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.630
That was an exhausting problem.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.210
I have to go get a
glass of water now.
