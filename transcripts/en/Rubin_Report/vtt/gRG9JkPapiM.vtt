[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.310
<v 1>we're partnering up with the [inaudible] ran institute this week and joining me</v>

3
00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:11.150
in studio or two of their top intellectuals,
terrorists,
Smith and Ancar.
Got Jay.

4
00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:12.140
Welcome to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.230
We're going to be talking about selfishness and the virtue of selfishness.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.310
How could selfishness possibly be virtuous?
I thought selfishness was evil.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.610
<v 2>Could it not be virtual?
I love love talking about selfishness.
Um,</v>

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.670
I found the two most amount that you could possibly try.

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.900
I try and it's going pretty well.
And what I mean,
part of what I mean by that is

10
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.240
innocent.
You know,
it works for me.
It war.
If you want people to be happy,

11
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.150
I mean I'll give you one quick kind of capsule just to get us going.

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.340
If you care about people's being happy,
genuinely having fulfilling lives,

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.941
you know,

14
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.240
feeling good about their lives but with good reason to feel good about their

15
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.000
lives,
then I think you need to,

16
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.600
people need to think carefully about what's in my best interest.

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.240
And that's largely what selfishness is all about.

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.570
Doing what's really going to be good for you,

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.310
best for you so that you can have the best life that you can have.
I mean,

20
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.180
you're going to have to,
I can go on and on.
So that's why that's why we're here.

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.110
You may have to interrupt you

22
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.950
<v 1>sometimes.
All right.
So on when I ran sort of first was writing about,</v>

23
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:22.750
this was pretty radical to say selfishness was virtuous,

24
00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:23.360
right?

25
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.040
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
I think it still is</v>

26
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.900
<v 1>in a weird way.
It may be more rather than</v>

27
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.990
<v 3>now at some level,</v>

28
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.490
she's basically the only person who will say that selfishness is a virtue.

29
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.090
And people often say,
well,
look,

30
00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:40.120
we obviously know that it's a vice,
you know,

31
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:44.750
all kinds of people that you label as slbs,
they're cheaters.
Um,

32
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.840
they cut corners in their work.

33
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.630
They're always trying to take advantage of other people,

34
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.340
and she has a completely different conception of what it means to be selfish.

35
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:58.660
What she thinks about those people is they're actually not pursuing what's in

36
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:02.890
their self interest.
They're not doing anything that's gonna make them happy.
Um,

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.120
and if you really took seriously that it's your life,
you have one life to live,

38
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.840
I'm trying to make the most of it.
You would not act like that.

39
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.450
And I think even more important,

40
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:18.451
the way she thinks about it is that we bundled together into the concept.

41
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.590
So the idea of selfishness.
So the used cars salesman who's cuts corners,

42
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:27.310
you should put the odometer back in and he's trying to cheat as customers.

43
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.200
We put that together with a Bill Gates who's labeled as selfish because he makes

44
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.410
oodles and oodles of money,
but he makes it,
he doesn't steal it.

45
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:38.320
He doesn't cheat his customers.
He's often a tremendous of value.

46
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.910
We call a kid who wants to just play with his toys and doesn't want to share.

47
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.270
Maybe he's saved for a year to buy a bike and now he wants to use it.

48
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.750
And someone who hasn't done anything that comes by and you're,
well,

49
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.380
he doesn't have a bike.
You have a bike.
So you're supposed to share like why?

50
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.750
And we put all this together.
All these people are selfish.
Yeah.

51
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.220
And some of these people are bad.
And some of these are profoundly good.

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220
<v 2>You can't think with that kind of concept of a very good vocabulary for bad</v>

53
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:09.220
behavior.
So we just throw it all,
oh,
it's all selfish.
Well,
no,

54
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.700
not if you're really thinking about what is in your self interest.

55
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.850
Now a lot of that behavior is bad and should be condemned.

56
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.290
But because it's inconsiderate or non objective about the other person or

57
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.490
abusive in some cases,

58
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:25.930
I mean there's all sorts of bad exploitative behavior and iron ran is certainly

59
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:29.260
against that.
But doing what's good for you.

60
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.410
And sometimes that means turning away the appeal of somebody else.
You know,

61
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.200
we're oh,
but this person needs it.

62
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:38.140
Or this other person is more important than you.
It's like,
no,

63
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.440
my life is the most important thing to me.

64
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.490
Just as yours should be to you and just as yours should be to you.

65
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.110
And in fact,

66
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.450
that's really the only path by which people can lead the kinds of fulfilling

67
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:55.300
lives and rewarding lodge and genuinely good lives.

68
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.100
<v 1>So one of the things that I really like to do on the show is,
is defined words,</v>

69
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:00.330
because especially these days,

70
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:04.020
we live in a time where everyone's sort of defining words or ideas their own
way.

71
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:08.280
So partly what we're talking about here is a sort of misunderstanding in a

72
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:12.990
modern sense of what the word selfish means,
right?
That how,
what's the best way,

73
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:15.690
if you wanted to lay out what that other person is,

74
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.720
the used car salesman who's not really,

75
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.170
they're acting selfishly at some level,
but that,

76
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.780
but they're really not would be iron rods argument because they're not doing

77
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:27.310
what's in their best interest by cheating their customers.

78
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.570
It's probably not best for them,
right?
In the laundry room.

79
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.150
<v 2>Well,
I'm not sure that there's always going to be a term that's,
you know,</v>

80
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.800
a single best term to use for some of these cases.
Iround advocates,

81
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:41.910
what she calls rational selfishness.
It's gotta be thoughtful selfishness.

82
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.450
It's gotta be about what really is in my interest,

83
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.900
not just long term,
but longterm.
Not just today.

84
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:53.040
What's going to make me feel good now.
But all things considered.
I mean,

85
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:56.760
think about,
for instance,
when you go to a wedding and you wish the young couple,

86
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.650
all the happiness in the world,
right?
All the success in the world.

87
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.900
You go to college graduation and you hope they have a really successful life

88
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:08.160
that's good for them.
All right?
You're thinking about,
I mean,

89
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:10.530
it's not that you hope they'll do whatever will make them feel good.

90
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.630
They'll get the right drugs and they'll just be,
you know,

91
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.320
there'll be dumb and happy,
but they'll think they're having a good life,
right?

92
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.370
So the used car salesman,
the cheater or the philanderer or some of these,

93
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.560
these creeps,
right?
I mean,

94
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:26.100
they've gotten into relationships that then they're cheating on their wives or

95
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:29.790
whatever it might be cheating on their clients.
Um,
is this for,
I mean,

96
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.400
if you step back and actually think about it a little bit,

97
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.950
is that making them genuinely good life,
a genuinely satisfying life?
I mean,

98
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:41.370
you'll read about the Madoffs who were wracked by not just guilt,

99
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:45.150
but hating themselves the entire time there.
You know,

100
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:48.510
engaged in the kinds of games that they're engaged in.
It so it's not,

101
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:50.550
I think that there's always going to be a single team.
Now again,

102
00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:54.750
in some cases it is something like that was really inconsiderate of this,

103
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.220
you know,
and sometimes it's a smallish thing or that really non objective.

104
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:02.540
You weren't realizing well from his point of view and where he stands,

105
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:05.780
he had good reason to be concerned about this and you had good reason to be

106
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.050
concerned about that too.
Yeah.
Just one broader point.
Sure.

107
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.200
While I do think some of this is about what we mean by the term,
it's,

108
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.480
it's not just all ran to saying what everybody else is saying,

109
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.190
but she's using the word a little differently.

110
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:24.191
I mean she is saying no radically different from just about everybody else who

111
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.580
talks about ethics.
You know,
when she was writing today forever,

112
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.770
your life is yours.

113
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.870
You should make the most of it in a way that's respectful of the fact that

114
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:37.640
others lives are theirs and so on.

115
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.910
But to do that you need to be focused primarily on the value of your wellbeing

116
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.740
to you and trying to think about what's really going to put together a compose

117
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.880
that mosaic that is the best life for me.

118
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.760
<v 1>So would it be fair to say that acting in your own self interest is the most</v>

119
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.073
sort of,

120
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.560
it's sort of the best way you can live if personal responsibility is of primacy

121
00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:04.564
to you?

122
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.130
<v 3>If,
yeah,
if personal responsibility and your own life.</v>

123
00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:13.131
So I think another way of thinking about that she's advocating selfishness and

124
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:15.480
it's not the only term she uses as Tara was saying.

125
00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:19.470
I mean rational self interest is another one and another one is the pursuit of

126
00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:20.304
happiness.

127
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.340
But really taking that seriously and means the pursuit of your own individual

128
00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:29.640
happiness,
that that's what you should be aiming at.
And part of,

129
00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:33.030
I think what she's,
when she's trying to reclaim the term selfishness,

130
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.060
I think part of the way it gets a bad rap is people are presented with a false

131
00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:42.450
choice.
And the false choices,
either I give up my values,

132
00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:43.800
the things I really care about,

133
00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:48.530
the stuff that makes me happy for the sake of other people or else they,

134
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.540
I'm so I'm so I'm losing and they're gaming apparently it or else it's I

135
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:58.860
victimize other people and the ideas I'm somehow gaining by that and they're

136
00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:03.690
losing.
And those are your two choices.
So you can be selfless without a self.

137
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:07.080
And then you were sort of like a patsy and you give up everything for the sake

138
00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:09.060
of other people or else you're selfish.

139
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.350
And that means you're exploiting and taking advantage of other people.

140
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.040
And she says this is a false choice.

141
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.810
And I think that's really important to get it.
And both are not selfish.

142
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.680
So if you're really thinking about your self interest that neither is the way to

143
00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:23.491
pursue it,
right?

144
00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:27.750
So there has to be some kind of third alter and what she's putting out as a

145
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:31.650
third alternative that you can live a life that you're aimed at your own

146
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:34.950
happiness that's radically non exploitative.

147
00:08:34.951 --> 00:08:37.710
So you don't think of other people as prey.

148
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.890
<v 1>So I'm glad that you mentioned the term self lists,</v>

149
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.230
which seems like the reverse of selfish because it seems like we live in a time

150
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:48.770
right now where with all the virtue signaling and everything that's coming out

151
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:52.190
of this sort of social justice warrior crew that there is,

152
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.820
there is a facade of selflessness as if they're doing all these things to be

153
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:57.600
selfless.

154
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.280
But I would argue they are doing it probably because of some deep need within

155
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:04.870
them.
It may not be scratching that itch but,

156
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.880
but how did the idea of selflessness becomes so thought of as so obviously.

157
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.394
Right.

158
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.700
<v 2>Well that goes way back.
And I will say,
I don't think that,
you know,</v>

159
00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:17.660
to separate discussion,

160
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.010
but I don't think that all of these social justice warriors or whatever you want

161
00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:25.240
to call something,
I don't think they're all necessarily seeing themselves,

162
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.370
that a lot of them are seeing themselves as virtuous.

163
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.600
I think some of them are virtuous.
Um,

164
00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:33.170
I don't think they see it all in terms of being selfless and there's some real

165
00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:36.970
good that can be done for certain causes,
but that's a separate issue.
Uh,

166
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.770
you know,
I mean,
think of Christ,

167
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.280
think of scripture and certainly other religions and other philosophies have

168
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:45.290
this as well,
but you know,

169
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.270
it's due for God or do for your other,
you know,
I am my brother's keeper.

170
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.590
<v 4>Alright.
Um,</v>

171
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.580
<v 2>there's something greater than me.
I mean,
the individual,</v>

172
00:09:56.581 --> 00:10:01.380
the you as you as often just from religious traditions been,

173
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.580
no,
no.
You know,
you are a lucky retch that God loves you.
You know,

174
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:09.990
and if you're lucky,
if you earn salvation,
how do you earn it?

175
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.350
By serving others,
by serving the Lord,
by serving.

176
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:18.410
So it's sort of been drilled out of people just for centuries and we,

177
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.100
meaning it goes back in that sense.

178
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.420
<v 1>Yeah.
As to people that,</v>

179
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.010
that do this for a living and get in and out of these ideas,
what,

180
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.890
what techniques have you found to,

181
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.820
to take a young person who's been so taught that either being selfless is the

182
00:10:30.821 --> 00:10:34.180
right thing to do or doing for others is the right thing to do and putting

183
00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:36.040
yourself second year where the greater good,

184
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.840
all of those phrases you have any tricks to kind of wake people up to,

185
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.100
to some of this?
I'm not sure it's exactly a trick,

186
00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:44.230
but I think there's a question that,

187
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.230
<v 3>um,
it's not easy to ask and you can help people ask,
which is why,</v>

188
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.440
hmm.
So why do you have to do these things?

189
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:55.590
Why is it that the nation counts more than you?

190
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.010
And so you're asking where this comes from?
Yeah.
It has deep,
deep,
uh,

191
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.660
origins I think in religion.
And even prior to that,

192
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:07.620
when you look in philosophy and it goes,
it's for centuries and centuries.

193
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:12.570
If you just think of the,
the Republicans and the Democrats,

194
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:12.691
would,

195
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:15.990
you basically can take any president in his state of the union when he's trying

196
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:18.510
to say like,
this is morally what you should do,

197
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.500
live for a cause greater than yourself,
greater than your desires.

198
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:23.790
I was George W.

199
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.270
Bush asked not what you can do at what your country can do for you.

200
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:29.130
Ask what you can do for your country.

201
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.270
So there's always this kind of conception that there's something higher above

202
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:36.230
you.
It can be God,
the nation you're raised and so,

203
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.890
and your obligations are to that and to sacrifice what you why.

204
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.030
<v 2>So that's,
and we'll know it's,
and it's uh,
yeah,</v>

205
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:49.590
I think it's that so important because these ideas of selflessness and serve as

206
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.330
our so taken for granted.
People don't know why they're supposed to think about,

207
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.440
they know that they are,
we know it's like,
Woo,

208
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.140
this is what I'm supposed to think.
But everybody thinks this.

209
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:03.100
Everybody respectable,
everybody likable,
everybody good,
everybody decent.

210
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.360
You know,
so,

211
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:09.280
but it is this article of faith much more than a product of reasons.
So,
I mean,

212
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:14.110
when you trying to do with anybody,
it's a get them to start questioning.

213
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.730
But I think another thing sometimes it's helpful is think about some of the

214
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:21.100
concrete virtues.
Um,
you know,

215
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:26.101
think about honesty and how that might be self interested really or justice and

216
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:29.770
how that might be self interested or certain alleged virtues.

217
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:31.270
Maybe arm with our cracked up to be,

218
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:34.690
if you actually think about them in very specific kinds of circumstances.

219
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.600
And that's something I know that with students,
you know,

220
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:41.140
they can relate to the justice of dealing with roommates who don't pull their

221
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:45.250
weight around the house and do the dishes when they're supposed to do the dishes

222
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:45.680
or whatever.
Yeah.

223
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.990
<v 1>Right.
So just being selfless in that case,</v>

224
00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:51.640
in always cleaning up after your roommate would not be the wisest thing for now,

225
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.380
nor your room or the other roommate or anyone involved.

226
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.270
<v 2>I've got,
right.
It would be stupid.
You'd be a pattern.
No,
I mean what most people,</v>

227
00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:00.950
and you were speaking of the three alternatives,
well,

228
00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:03.670
I'm either going to exploit you or just be a sucker.
Right?
Right.

229
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.320
And Miranda's offering a third alternative.
But in a sense,

230
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.490
I think of it sometimes as a fourth alternative because another alternative that

231
00:13:10.491 --> 00:13:13.230
most people say,
well of course you got to be selfish sometimes.

232
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.790
Of course you're not stupid.
You know,
you got to take care of yourself,

233
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:18.080
you got to go to the doctor or whatever.

234
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.420
And but of course you got to put others first time.
So it's a balance.
You meant,

235
00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:25.430
you know,
you play exploiter SiTimes I mean that's their version,
right?

236
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:30.110
And what you're saying,
this is,
it's not a zero sum game morality,

237
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.370
having a good life.
If you become happy,
God bless you.
I don't believe in God,

238
00:13:34.371 --> 00:13:38.750
but you know,
he got the form.
I mean,
that's good.
That's great.
That's no,

239
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.880
that doesn't mean he can't be happy.
That doesn't mean I,
I,

240
00:13:40.881 --> 00:13:43.150
there's no zero sum there,
but

241
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.360
<v 1>right there,
I guess there's the idea that somehow if you're selfish,</v>

242
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:48.610
that that precludes other people's happiness,

243
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:52.900
that you're just going to run him shot at the world when it's street seems to be

244
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:56.950
in reality that things today that I don't think that a damn thing to anybody

245
00:13:56.951 --> 00:14:00.790
else.
You know,
you know,
I do exercise this morning,

246
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:04.810
left nothing for on are never good to good,
good snacks,
Huh?
Yup.

247
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.540
<v 2>I mean there's much that we do to try to take good care of ourselves,
you know,</v>

248
00:14:09.541 --> 00:14:14.100
on a,
on a regular basis that has nothing to do with winning off other people or

249
00:14:14.101 --> 00:14:15.000
anything like that.
But again,

250
00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:17.730
if you're really thinking about what is a person's wellbeing,

251
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.910
what is in their interest?
If you're really thinking about that as opposed to,

252
00:14:20.911 --> 00:14:22.710
well,
we've got these throwaway lines about it,

253
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.830
then you have to start taking seriously what might be

254
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.400
<v 1>so is that the key part of this then?</v>

255
00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:30.410
Then most people just don't think these things through.

256
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:33.470
So if you ask the average person while,
are you selfish though?
Might say no.

257
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.920
If you've attacked them and then if you,
but if you really widdled it down to,

258
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.300
well,
how do you live your day?

259
00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:42.050
Do you mostly do things that make your day go well,

260
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.060
basically be it at work or at home or anything else?

261
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.920
They usually they'll say yes if they're living somewhat of a decent life.
Yeah.

262
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:51.980
And I think part of what happens with what the demonization

263
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.790
<v 3>of selfishness,</v>

264
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.740
it's part of the whole split that there's morality and there's practicality.

265
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.980
So you can either be moral or practical,
or as Tara was saying,

266
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:02.990
it's sometimes you want it to be moral,

267
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.060
so you're going to be selfless and give up things.

268
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.500
But most of the time we wanted to stop this practical and pro my life and,

269
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:11.540
but it's putting a completely different category.

270
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:16.541
And what I ran the saying is it's hard to be practical to really devote yourself

271
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:19.760
to your life.
And if you do that,
it's moral.

272
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.060
And so she's a uniting to things that most people,
she would a party.

273
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.500
That's the most moral thing.
Yeah,
yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
And it's hard.

274
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.500
That's part of what's different in Oregon

275
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.670
<v 2>exceptions here again,
that you don't,
one of the characatures of selfish,</v>

276
00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:36.670
you're just saying do what you want to do,
do whatever you feel like doing.

277
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.570
Now again,
think about that.
Try that for a week.

278
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.780
I'm not going to study for the test.
I don't feel like it.
Yeah,

279
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.360
I'm not going to go to the dent.
I don't hate going to the dentist or the,

280
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:49.840
you know,
I mean live that way.
Oh,

281
00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:52.780
I don't feel like thinking about what I can actually afford and how much money's

282
00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:57.010
in the bank and say,
yeah,
see how that works out for Ya.
I mean,
no,

283
00:15:57.011 --> 00:15:58.780
it takes thought and think about,

284
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.250
I sometimes use these examples of where it's really clear you want to do what's

285
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:05.560
best for you.
You're trying to decide which college to go to.

286
00:16:05.561 --> 00:16:08.500
Let's say you've decided to go to college.
Okay.
You know,

287
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:13.570
there's a range of considering how much does it cost,
how far away is it?

288
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:18.040
How good are they in the subjects I'm interested in?
Um,
you know,
there's,
right,

289
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.980
what's the culture like at that college is too big.
Am I gonna you know,

290
00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:25.600
there's a lot of stuff to way where even though the objective is I want to do

291
00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:28.510
what's going to be best for me,
that might be clear.

292
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.390
Unequivocal in your mind doesn't mean it's a no brainer.

293
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:35.110
What's gonna be best for you people and people face.
That's just one example.

294
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.400
I mean,
you know,
medical treatments in some cases,
should I take this job?

295
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.210
There are a number of cases where it's not transparent.
It's not always easy.

296
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.380
It's sometimes takes discipline to,
you know,

297
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.930
beyond that Palio Diet or make that marathon and trained for it and so on.

298
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.360
So we're not saying just always take the shortcut or something like that.
Right.

299
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:58.140
<v 1>I suspect,
yeah.
If you remember when Mother Teresa died years ago,</v>

300
00:16:58.141 --> 00:17:02.610
that they said that on her deathbed she was realizing that she wasn't as happy

301
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.830
basically.
And,
and then she had had doubts all along.

302
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.110
I suspect that wouldn't surprise you as someone that tried to live for others

303
00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:10.944
all the time.

304
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.920
<v 3>Um,
yeah,
I think she had,</v>

305
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.510
when you read some of her diaries and some doubts about what she's doing,

306
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.930
I think part of the doubts are it's,

307
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:26.350
I've given up everything and there's the big question of why is there's really

308
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:33.521
no reason to do it and you need to event a god and all the particulars of it

309
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:38.000
that the God wants you to sacrifice and give up your things and it's,

310
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.670
you don't have any reason really to do it.

311
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:42.800
You've never been given a reason yours.
It's,

312
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.160
that's part of what the faith is that I'm going to subordinate myself to this

313
00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:50.490
higher alleged higher power hype and it's a live a life like that.

314
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:51.420
You're going to have doubts.

315
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.600
<v 1>Did Andre ever link any of this to just how we're wired that if you leave some</v>

316
00:17:56.701 --> 00:18:01.701
people to their own devices purely that they will do some of the shady or

317
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.020
selfish stuff?

318
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.710
Let's say that it's not just that because not everyone operates in a purely

319
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:10.740
rational way of thinking all the time.
Do you know about it?

320
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.060
If there was any connection to that.

321
00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.120
<v 3>I mean I wouldn't put it as,
it's exactly wired,</v>

322
00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:21.450
but it's sort of a default in that it's a real achievement to think.

323
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.900
So just to think and engage and think what is right and wrong,

324
00:18:25.901 --> 00:18:28.330
what is true and false.
That's an achievement.
It's not.

325
00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:29.390
You have to do something rotten.

326
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.080
Most people do that automatically and you have to be doing something wrong.

327
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.220
That is a positive achievement that a person has to choose.

328
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.470
And if he doesn't choose to do that,

329
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.260
then I think there's all kinds of defaults that he's going to follow.

330
00:18:41.261 --> 00:18:42.430
What other people do?

331
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.390
He need some kind of guide and he's not in this idea of self responsibility.

332
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.350
He's not his own guide.
He's not figuring out what to do.

333
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:55.180
So the typical thing is to look to other people and that easily then can become,

334
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.360
you're sort of living for other people.
They're telling you what to do.

335
00:18:58.361 --> 00:19:02.140
It's the authority and taking order kinds of things.
And it leads to,

336
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:05.200
so she has a lot from that perspective,
I think.

337
00:19:05.201 --> 00:19:09.910
But she thinks of it as a sort of default of you've got this tremendous capacity

338
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.360
that you could choose to realize and you could make something of your life,

339
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:16.990
and if you don't,
then there's all kinds of things that that happened.

340
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.690
<v 2>Doing your own thinking is one of the major virtues that she talks about.</v>

341
00:19:20.691 --> 00:19:23.440
She talks about it in terms of independence,
but it's,
you know,

342
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.480
you've got to do your own thinking,
learn from and be open to,

343
00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:28.490
and you can learn tremendously from others,

344
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:30.260
but you've got to think it all through for yourself,

345
00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:33.440
whether it's on moral issues and how I should leave my life or what I should do

346
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.410
or whatever.

347
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:39.320
That's actually one of her part of central selfish virtues is doing,

348
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.190
do your own thinking.

349
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:44.390
Try to understand for yourself so that you can make good decisions about what's

350
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:46.400
true,
what's real,
what's right,
what's moral,

351
00:19:46.401 --> 00:19:49.010
what's gonna serve my wellbeing and my hat.

352
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.970
<v 1>Yeah.
Are you guys particularly enthused at this moment for some of these ideas?</v>

353
00:19:52.971 --> 00:19:56.610
Because when I hear you say that about people thinking for themselves,
I mean,

354
00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:57.500
you know,

355
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.290
I'd like to think I'm a little part of something that's happening online right

356
00:20:00.291 --> 00:20:03.530
now where people are doing it doesn't mean they're all objective,

357
00:20:03.531 --> 00:20:07.880
isn't sure or anything else of course,
but there does seem to be a resurgence,

358
00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:10.580
especially amongst young people and when I've done events with Ari,

359
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.750
I meet all sorts of young people who may be agree on this or disagree on that

360
00:20:14.751 --> 00:20:18.020
and they're every color and race and sexuality and all of that stuff.

361
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.040
Better thinking again,

362
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:22.820
and I don't know that if I was doing this exact thing say 10 years ago,

363
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.790
that it would have been as influential or effective.

364
00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.650
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean I think it's a very positive sign that there's these,</v>

365
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.300
I mean are you do long form stuff with deep conversations and it gets a big

366
00:20:34.301 --> 00:20:35.690
audience and eyes are,
yeah,

367
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.580
and I actually think that part of what's going on when you're thinking

368
00:20:39.581 --> 00:20:40.630
predictive of the young people,

369
00:20:40.631 --> 00:20:44.380
it's this is what they expected college to be more like.

370
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.920
And unfortunately college is like that anymore.
Yeah,

371
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.840
it was I think more when I was still a student undergraduate student than it is.

372
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.880
And so this deep exploration of ideas,
ideas I haven't encountered before,

373
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.200
I might not agree with,

374
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.400
but it takes work to even just listen and like what's this other perspective?

375
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.230
And let me think about it in this space to think and you're not supposed to just

376
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:12.970
fall into lockstep with everybody else.
Yeah.
There's too much of that now.
Um,

377
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:16.330
so I've been the fact that you can't,
you've got an audience in other people.

378
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800
It's a really good,

379
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.150
<v 2>are you seeing that someone that's teaching young people,</v>

380
00:21:20.151 --> 00:21:24.800
are you seeing sort of a resurgence of an interest in ideas?
Somewhat.

381
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.160
I mean,
even though I'm at a big university at the University of Texas,
um,

382
00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:33.161
I often teach small classes and somewhat selective honors classes often at

383
00:21:33.651 --> 00:21:36.650
least.
Um,
so it's,
in that sense I can give you,
you know,

384
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.870
the most representative a spectrum,
but I definitely see,
for instance,

385
00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:44.420
I've had free speech dialogues for several years.

386
00:21:44.421 --> 00:21:47.600
I was hosting these sorts of things and just as encore was saying people were

387
00:21:47.601 --> 00:21:51.800
students,
all sorts of students attended and really responded positively.

388
00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:55.940
Again in the sense that they really seemed like they wanted to engage with

389
00:21:55.941 --> 00:21:56.930
different ideas.

390
00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.910
And I do think you're right that 10 or 20 years ago there wouldn't have been as

391
00:22:01.911 --> 00:22:04.460
much interest in hearing other ideas.

392
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.540
But I think it's just the bankruptcy of the reigning philosophies,

393
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:13.640
the reigning political philosophies and moral philosophies and the fact that the

394
00:22:13.641 --> 00:22:18.080
selflessness,
you know,
really be selfless and serve even though that's still,

395
00:22:18.081 --> 00:22:22.280
you know what you're supposed to think of when everybody says how long can you,

396
00:22:22.281 --> 00:22:24.890
I mean you have to cheat on that in order to actually live,

397
00:22:24.891 --> 00:22:27.920
you have to be prudential or practical is Ancar was saying,
right,

398
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.880
how long can people cheat and people are,

399
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.120
I mean enough people and often young people are honest enough with themselves to

400
00:22:35.601 --> 00:22:40.220
realize maybe we need some different broader theories here about what is good

401
00:22:40.221 --> 00:22:44.960
and bad and maybe there is more to be said for self interest or,
yeah.

402
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.880
So you both mentioned morality here.

403
00:22:46.881 --> 00:22:49.040
So let's try to link selfishness to morality.

404
00:22:49.041 --> 00:22:52.490
So obviously you can just look at America.
We live in a country of,
I don't know,

405
00:22:52.491 --> 00:22:57.490
350 million,
some odd people who have all sorts of different moral beliefs.
Yeah.

406
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.600
<v 3>Does that then complicate a society's ability to operate in a selfish way?</v>

407
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.720
Because people have,
people are,

408
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.660
they're bedrock of moralities starting in a different spot.
I think it does.
Um,

409
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.780
so if you think back to the founding of America,

410
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.860
you need,
it's not everybody has to agree with this,

411
00:23:19.861 --> 00:23:24.861
but you need a significant minority who thinks that the pursuit of happiness is

412
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:27.950
it good thing to engage in.

413
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.320
And you can have different conceptions of all the details of what that

414
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.940
happiness,
consistency and the five founding fathers were creating a system.

415
00:23:38.941 --> 00:23:40.110
What's your free?
Um,

416
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.190
and so you have an enormous amount of latitude of how the kind of life you're

417
00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:46.040
going to build and so on.
But if there's,

418
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:51.110
if you really have a perspective that it's a sin to pursue your own happiness

419
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.070
and to exhibit a,
so another one of mine runs virtues,
pride.

420
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.610
And Pride is,
is it about making something of yourself and you can,
I mean,

421
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:05.320
put it very colloquially,
you can look in the mirror and have a moral approved,

422
00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:09.980
like I'm morally good to have that and that that takes work to achieve that.

423
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.080
If that's regarded as a sin,

424
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.270
then I think the whole system political system that the founding fathers

425
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:19.790
designed,
there's something deeply problematic about it.

426
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:24.950
And what you saw in the 19th and into the 20th century with the rise of fascism,

427
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:29.480
communism,
various forms of socialism I think was targeted at,

428
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.230
it's selfish to pursue your own happiness and it isn't.
Yeah.

429
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.390
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean freedom is what's,
you know,</v>

430
00:24:36.391 --> 00:24:40.020
once you're talking about a society of an organized political society,
I mean,

431
00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:44.280
what allows people to have great variations in the gods that they pray to or

432
00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:47.070
whether they pray at all in the mortalities that they practice?

433
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.050
What allows that is a common commitment to individual's freedom.

434
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.710
But that's in compact.
I mean,
truly this was one of the things that I ran.

435
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.500
You know what's really,
I think insightful on,

436
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:03.720
you can't defend that idea that your life is yours.

437
00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:06.510
And you have a right to it.
If you think,
oh no,
it's not,

438
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.410
it belongs to this God or that God or these people or societies like the,

439
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.440
so no wonder we're losing freedom again.

440
00:25:13.441 --> 00:25:15.690
That's another political con conversation to have.
Right.

441
00:25:15.691 --> 00:25:19.500
But no wonder when will the underpinnings,
the moral underpinnings or,

442
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.230
<v 1>yeah.
I'm being lost.
You briefly touch on the phrase rational self interest.</v>

443
00:25:23.231 --> 00:25:24.130
Do you see any,

444
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.730
is there any distinct difference between rational self interest and selfishness

445
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.920
or is it just another way of saying,
oh,
I just seen them as the same.
Yeah,

446
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.380
know true.
Genuine selfishness,
I mean is,
yeah.
Yeah.
Do you think that,

447
00:25:35.381 --> 00:25:38.170
so that's a little bit of a branding thing,
right?
I mean if the word selfish,

448
00:25:38.171 --> 00:25:39.790
this is going to scare a certain amount of people.

449
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.410
I think rational self interest sounds maybe a little more palatable to a certain

450
00:25:44.411 --> 00:25:46.480
amount of people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's parked

451
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.680
<v 3>Brandon and I think it's important that she's in the sell idea,
right?
I mean,</v>

452
00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:53.270
she didn't only use selfishness,
she used rational self.

453
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.810
She used pursuit to happiness.

454
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.140
So it's not like she's saying this is the term you have to use.

455
00:25:58.141 --> 00:25:59.670
Don't use any of these others.

456
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:04.940
But I think she's using selfishness to be deliberately controversial,

457
00:26:05.311 --> 00:26:08.340
deliberately provocative,
but in a very deep way.

458
00:26:08.341 --> 00:26:11.880
And that goes back to some of what we were talking about that people's attitude

459
00:26:11.881 --> 00:26:15.870
disorders,
we know it's selfishness means you don't to iron rent.

460
00:26:15.871 --> 00:26:19.860
And her perspective is exactly the reverse,
right?
I know what it means.
You don't,

461
00:26:19.861 --> 00:26:24.600
you lump all kinds of people together under this rubric selfish and they're so

462
00:26:24.601 --> 00:26:25.110
different.

463
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.930
And some of these people are good and some of these people about you don't

464
00:26:27.931 --> 00:26:32.490
really have a concept of what selfishness means and this is how to think about

465
00:26:32.491 --> 00:26:34.950
it properly and that's what she's trying to do in the book.

466
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.700
So it's deliberately provocative,
but there's a deep point about like,

467
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.630
I understand this better than you do.
Yeah,
I

468
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.910
<v 1>know.
And people think the reverse.
So that,
that's a good segue then to altruism.</v>

469
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:46.830
How do we fit in?

470
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:50.520
How much should you save do for others?

471
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.820
Because a certain amount of people are going to watch it.
So these guys,
I get it.

472
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:54.241
Okay,

473
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:57.000
but what are they doing for other people then if they're just doing things for

474
00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:59.700
themselves all the time,
which to get to that,
that definition,

475
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:01.200
that more narrow down options.
Uh Huh.

476
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.220
<v 2>Unselfishness.
Yeah.
Well</v>

477
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:09.750
rand and I agree with her completely opposes altruism by which I mean,

478
00:27:10.121 --> 00:27:14.860
you know the elevation of others above oneself,
you know,

479
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.720
up the valley,
you know,

480
00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:21.310
presuming that there is greater value in another person or the need of another

481
00:27:21.311 --> 00:27:25.810
person trumps my life,
my needs,
my values.
Right.
That's what she's against.

482
00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:30.811
Now that's not the same thing as being against ever helping other people or

483
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:35.380
certainly not against,
but now again they think,
oh,
you're just a

484
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.150
solid system isn't even the word I'm looking for him.
You know,
you just,

485
00:27:40.151 --> 00:27:45.100
you don't like other people or you're antisocial.
No,
not are you kidding?
Again,

486
00:27:45.101 --> 00:27:48.220
think about,
think about your life.
I don't know about you,

487
00:27:48.221 --> 00:27:52.010
but I love p they're individually.
I think that's little bit,

488
00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.050
get to know them a little.
You know,
you get to know some people that goes away.

489
00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:01.030
But would you,
is your life better?
I mean just broadly again to start,
right?

490
00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:05.440
Is your life generally better because about people good things.

491
00:28:05.441 --> 00:28:09.340
They came up with fantasy football.
I came up lot.
I mean there's like a reason.

492
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.170
I mean they came up,
don't get me started,
but uh,

493
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.890
you can value other people.
You can have very different kinds of relations.

494
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.620
I mean there are some people who will become good friends.

495
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.250
There's some people you'll love from it.
I mean,
my God,

496
00:28:24.251 --> 00:28:27.520
you're in love with this person.
I mean there are people who you just like for,

497
00:28:27.521 --> 00:28:27.821
you know,

498
00:28:27.821 --> 00:28:32.200
as a tennis partner or as a student or we have all sorts of relationships and

499
00:28:32.201 --> 00:28:32.620
then there's,

500
00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.920
there are circumstances in which it makes sense to do things for those people,

501
00:28:35.921 --> 00:28:40.090
but not as a sacrifice.
Not at the expense of,
okay,

502
00:28:40.091 --> 00:28:42.220
I'll give it to him because he needs it now.
Damn it.

503
00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:45.880
I'm not going to get to do that serious thing I've been wanting to do and saving

504
00:28:45.881 --> 00:28:50.020
to do.
And so that's what she's against.
Yeah.
Self sacrifice,
putting others first.

505
00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.090
But there are men,
one of the things I talk about,

506
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:57.091
I have a book which talks a lot about Rand's version of selfish virtues.

507
00:28:57.221 --> 00:29:00.760
And I have a section in there where I talk about generosity and charity and

508
00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:05.290
where they shine it because they're not virtues for her,
but nor are they.

509
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:09.010
Thou shalt not,
you know,
oh my God,
that would be a mortal sin.
And you know,

510
00:29:09.011 --> 00:29:13.240
how can,
oh,
Tara,
you're going to be excommunicated.
No.
So there are circumstances,

511
00:29:13.241 --> 00:29:17.530
shoes in and of themselves,
but they're,
they're not obligations.

512
00:29:17.531 --> 00:29:21.220
They're not standing obligations.
You know,
when the opportunity arises,

513
00:29:21.221 --> 00:29:24.640
you must give.
Yeah,
sorry.
Yeah,
no,
no,
I get it.
I get it.
I get into it.

514
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.760
<v 1>No,
I think that,
that,
that's really interesting.
Um,
I mean,
yeah,
that was good.</v>

515
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.850
So you were asking a little bit before about,
um,

516
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.270
thinking of this from a more biological perspective.

517
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.900
And I think part of the way she thinks about it is,

518
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.010
so the whole issue

519
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.480
<v 3>of fact in value comes from biology.
So when you think about living things,</v>

520
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.480
you think about them as having values.

521
00:29:49.481 --> 00:29:52.600
That is some things are good for them and some things bad,

522
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.330
some things beneficial,
some things harmful.

523
00:29:55.331 --> 00:29:56.980
And that any living thing I'm going to plant,

524
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.100
if you don't water it for two weeks,
is that good or bad for it?

525
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.700
And everybody has this perspective while it's obviously bad for it and any

526
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:06.580
living thing you look at like that.
And it's true of human beings as well.

527
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.950
And it's how you should look at your own life.
That I,

528
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.420
there's values in the world that I have to pursue given that I'm a human being,

529
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.890
but the,
the selfishness as exploitation,

530
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.420
the idea is it's dog eat dog.
Um,

531
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.620
and that's what she's rejecting completely.

532
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:27.790
And I think this is what's radically different about human beings that we're

533
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:31.570
capable of trading.
And so whore principal,

534
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.080
she calls it the trader principle.
It's the you,

535
00:30:34.081 --> 00:30:36.940
you should be giving value for value with other people.

536
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:40.990
So you should seek out other people.
It's not just,
okay,
they happen to be here,

537
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:44.500
so I'll go talk to them.
So seek out,
there's all kinds of values you can,

538
00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:47.800
you can learn from them.
There's companionship and there's trade.

539
00:30:47.801 --> 00:30:52.180
And specialization.
And so I mean w w civilization we live in,

540
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.120
well you couldn't live in like each person on a desert island.

541
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.090
I mean it's ridiculous,
but there's a vast,

542
00:30:58.091 --> 00:31:02.920
vast difference if you're dealing with someone where you're both profiting from

543
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:07.900
the relationship or only one person is.
And if it's,
if it really is win,

544
00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:09.370
lose whatever the direction,

545
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:14.260
it's not a good relationship and we're capable of having win,
win relationship.

546
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.720
That's particularly interesting to me cause I think a lot of people think you

547
00:31:16.721 --> 00:31:18.610
can't have a win win situation.

548
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.800
<v 2>I think a lot of people think in the terms of if I'm getting something okay,</v>

549
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.200
yeah,

550
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.540
as if there's a finite amount of something I have to be taken and I will now

551
00:31:27.541 --> 00:31:30.050
have,
we're different.
Human beings are different,
right?

552
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.360
We're not just like animals.
We have to scavenge and oh no,

553
00:31:33.361 --> 00:31:36.900
there's only so much meat.
And if this wolf gets it this one long or something,

554
00:31:36.901 --> 00:31:40.440
it's like,
no,
we create values.
And this was obviously,
well,

555
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.970
as anybody who's read red nose major theme,
it's our mind,

556
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.780
our use of reason that enables us to create the values,

557
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.690
not just find them somewhere.
Oh,
good.
Got there first.
Right.

558
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.670
Create the things that we need to survive,
to flourish,

559
00:31:56.671 --> 00:32:01.230
to enrich our lives,
to make our lives so good.
Right?
And so,
uh,
I'm going to get,

560
00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:03.720
and you just think of some of your best relationships now again,

561
00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:07.350
that starting with your best relationships.
Right?
But hopefully I don't,

562
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.050
I don't know if you're married or what your situation is,
right.

563
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.270
But it's pretty when hopefully it's good for the two of you,
right?
I mean,

564
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.950
we're friends.
Yeah.
I think it's good for the two of,
you know,

565
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.640
um,
[inaudible] I mean,

566
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:28.650
there are all sorts of relationships.
Again,
less person,
not the best one,
but,
uh,

567
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.430
you know,
not just to focus on the very best ones where,
hey,
this is good.

568
00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:35.520
This guy likes being a butcher.
I like his meat or wouldn't,
you know,

569
00:32:35.521 --> 00:32:36.910
whatever it might be.
Yeah.

570
00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:42.170
<v 3>Think how bizarre it's there.
There's this common view that love is selfless.</v>

571
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.990
Think if you really try to spell it out,
and this is,

572
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:48.890
you were asking like for four tips for people ask what?

573
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:51.590
Like what does that mean and why is this true?
It is.

574
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.000
And what are we really mean is you're in a relationship with another person and

575
00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:59.420
you would be telling them like,
I don't get anything from this relationship.

576
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.160
I don't really know why I'm in it,

577
00:33:01.161 --> 00:33:04.110
but you seem to be benefiting so that it makes it good.
Right?

578
00:33:04.111 --> 00:33:08.750
So are they in that way too?
And then,
yeah.
Yeah.
I mean if it's,

579
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.610
and you can't,
when you really projected you,
it doesn't make sense.
Um,

580
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.220
and when she talks about trade,

581
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:20.600
so she means it both in economic and material values,

582
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:25.601
but also spiritual values you gain from being around good people and gain in a

583
00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:27.710
way just not do like in your pocket book.

584
00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:28.810
<v 2>It's exactly right.</v>

585
00:33:28.811 --> 00:33:33.040
I think sometimes the word trade does have those narrowly economic connotations

586
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.100
and it's not like,
oh,
you calculate how much you get.
You know,

587
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.710
the more good successful people are around you,

588
00:33:38.711 --> 00:33:41.800
the richer the pool from which we all have to benefit.
I mean,

589
00:33:41.801 --> 00:33:45.910
I will write just all,
you know,
thinking of another natural win-win.
That's great.

590
00:33:45.911 --> 00:33:49.150
If the woman who wrote all the Harry Potter books is richer than Midas or

591
00:33:49.151 --> 00:33:53.230
whatever,
she bought a hell of a lot of pleasure and so on to other people.
Right?

592
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:56.620
I will frequently write an author if I really liked there where I might be

593
00:33:56.621 --> 00:34:00.310
fiction or whatever,
you know,
or a singer or performer.
I really like,

594
00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:04.510
that's great.
You know,
she's getting the accolades or she's getting the money in.

595
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.120
I really enjoyed this book or that concert or so it's win win.
That's,

596
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.270
I see it as a,
uh,

597
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.000
an application in a way of justice of respecting what I think somebody desserts.

598
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.090
Like,
wow,
that was really,
that was out of the ordinary in my view.

599
00:34:19.091 --> 00:34:22.120
So I just want to tell them that lots of wind went out there.

600
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.520
So when someone says,
well wait a minute,
uh,

601
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:29.260
j JK Rowling has made hundreds and hundreds and millions of dollars and nobody

602
00:34:29.261 --> 00:34:33.220
could possibly need that much money.
She didn't get it because she needed it.

603
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.470
She got it.
Cause people wanted to,
they fought.
I'm better off.

604
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.870
I want that book.
I actually haven't read those,

605
00:34:40.871 --> 00:34:42.790
but I've been reading her mysteries,
which I liked very much.

606
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:45.040
So there's a plug for you now.
Yeah.
But um,

607
00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.510
let's make that woman out of the money.
Yeah.
Look for thing.
Yeah.
Hey man,

608
00:34:49.511 --> 00:34:51.850
she worked hard to do that.
And at war and it's,

609
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.670
and people want it so they want to pay.
So it's

610
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:56.580
<v 3>right.</v>

611
00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:00.660
If you think about the question that which he has more money than she needs,

612
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:06.030
that only seems like the criticism if you have the zero sum.
So it's,

613
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.770
she's amassed so much and that means other people are losing out.

614
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.910
Yeah.
But what he should want if,
and again this is,
if you're selfish,

615
00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.820
you should want everybody doing what she's doing.
Yeah.

616
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.150
Like you should want more people like that.
More people like Bill Gates.

617
00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:25.860
More people like Steve Jobs.
I mean,
think of how Steve Jobs transform the world.

618
00:35:25.861 --> 00:35:30.450
What the iPhone,
it's [inaudible] would you like?
You want to get rid of him?

619
00:35:30.451 --> 00:35:32.430
Are you on 10 more people like him?
And,

620
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.560
and just from the perspective of your life and you're benefiting,
it's for sure.

621
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:41.820
I would rather have 10 more than try to take him and then discourage these

622
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.660
potential 10 upcoming.
Because look,
when he gets really successful,

623
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:48.390
which is what happened,
Bill Gates,
so we're going to go after it,
right?
It's,

624
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:52.770
it's in their interest to be free like that.
But it's in my interest to be,
yeah,

625
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.770
<v 1>right?
Because everyone wants to be that person.</v>

626
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.580
If you're living in a sense of like,

627
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.350
you want to do something not because necessarily you just want to be rich,
right?

628
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:04.230
You want to do something that has value.
Right?
So it's interesting.

629
00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:06.750
Let's try to bring this into a little bit of what's happening right now.

630
00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:06.931
You know,

631
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:11.610
there's all this talk about taxes now and Alexandria Ocozzio Cortez talking

632
00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:13.170
about the 70% marginal tax rate.

633
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:17.530
And I saw this really interesting Twitter thread where someone took,
uh,

634
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.980
the rock.
They said,
you know,
Dwayne Johnson,
he makes you know,

635
00:36:19.981 --> 00:36:21.780
$250 million a year.

636
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.140
And then they tried to break it down what it would look like if he was having to

637
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:27.540
pay all these taxes and the kids,
you know,
over 10 million,

638
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.780
then it's at 70% and basically after this long Twitter thread,

639
00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:34.980
they got it down to something like even if he's making 250 and we taxed them out

640
00:36:34.981 --> 00:36:39.000
of the Wazoo,
who made $35 million a year and who couldn't live on that?

641
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.570
And I just was reading it,
I thought I'd put it.

642
00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.820
<v 3>That just doesn't make it right.
Makes you kind of feel good.</v>

643
00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:50.560
So we sort of outsourced our brains on this in a way.

644
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.930
Well I think it,
it,
it's theirs to the,

645
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:57.250
to feeling good about something that has nothing to do with you or something to

646
00:36:57.251 --> 00:37:00.670
that effect.
But it's,
it's,
you're making him sacrifice,

647
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
you're making him give up values for other people and that's supposed to be

648
00:37:06.371 --> 00:37:08.980
good.
So they think of it as they're doing something good,

649
00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.070
but it comes from a view that selfishness is wrong.

650
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.410
And being selfless is right.

651
00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.440
And if someone's not going to be do it voluntarily,

652
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:21.850
we're gonna force him to do it.
And I mean,
um,

653
00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.430
which is directly correlated to just that

654
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.250
<v 1>state power and the role of government,
which obviously I ran,</v>

655
00:37:27.251 --> 00:37:29.080
talked about a lot too.
Um,

656
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.790
what about some of this is just that we live in a way in a society where we have

657
00:37:33.791 --> 00:37:36.580
outsourced our virtue so that,
you know,

658
00:37:36.581 --> 00:37:40.870
it's like if the government does everything and the government takes care of

659
00:37:40.871 --> 00:37:41.351
poor people,

660
00:37:41.351 --> 00:37:45.400
where do they do it well or not is a separate issue that we don't have to do

661
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.840
certain things that perhaps if we lived in a society that was a little freer,

662
00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.080
we might actually do more and feel good about it.

663
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.780
<v 2>Well,
we'd have to think more.</v>

664
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:56.850
It goes back to some of what we were talking about much earlier in the

665
00:37:56.851 --> 00:38:01.290
conversation.
I think.
Um,
yeah,
there's a lot of outsourcing of conscience,

666
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:06.270
um,
both to the government and to just society in general.

667
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.140
Like there's a sense in which it's easy to be the altruism of the selfless.

668
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.290
You say all the things that all the respectable people say,
right?

669
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:17.250
You get variations of those you were reading or mentioning some of the kinds of

670
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:21.330
things that state of the Union addresses or commencement addresses.
All right,

671
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:26.460
so you seem like one of the,
you know,
one of the with it guys or whatever.
Right?

672
00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:30.510
So whether it be we outsource it to government to,
well yeah,

673
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:34.530
I have a guilty conscience,
so tax me so that I'm fulfilling my duty,

674
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:37.570
but then I can still go by the person I want to buy or whatever it might be.

675
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.990
Again,
all we see are,
you know,
are we serious about,

676
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:42.280
do you want to be a good person?

677
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.620
You got to think about what it is to be a good person.

678
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:46.570
But from the more positive end too,

679
00:38:46.571 --> 00:38:49.600
I think you want to be happy and you think you think it's a good thing for

680
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:51.820
people to be happy holes again,
you know,

681
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:55.240
like if you are okay then we have to seriously think about how you're going to

682
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:57.040
get that.
How is anybody going to be happy?

683
00:38:57.041 --> 00:39:01.990
And I know for me one of the real turning points as I was discovering

684
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:06.520
objectivism and,
and coming around to yeah,
there's self interest,
you know,

685
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.410
on the right understanding and her is really good is when,

686
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:12.880
when it clicked for me and yet I had been thinking about it in a while.

687
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:16.050
Like you can't make other people happy.
This,

688
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.980
I think this is really important.

689
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.230
There's also things you can do for other people and that that can be of

690
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.570
substantial,
serious benefit to other people.
Right?

691
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.740
But I can't make you a happy person.
I can't make you fulfilled.

692
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.640
I can't make what it's like to be you feel good to you feel fulfilling,

693
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:38.950
feel rewarding,
feel like this is a life worth.
I can't give that to you.

694
00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.590
Even if I look,
if I know you really well and I let her do everything,
you know,

695
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.390
there's more to say that,
but it's like,
but if that's the case,

696
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.470
then the only way for anybody to be happy to have the best life,

697
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:53.020
they can have this for them to go after it for themselves.

698
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.310
And that's going to take,
again,
really thinking,
maybe I'm inclined,

699
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.530
there are circumstances in which you know your rich uncle can pay for your

700
00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:04.210
tuition.
I mean,
they're right.

701
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.060
You can be the good friend who really listens and tries to understand and you

702
00:40:09.061 --> 00:40:12.900
know,
I mean,
so there are a variety of ways in which we do benefit.
Again,

703
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.780
we were talking earlier about relationships is potentially real wind winters,

704
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.940
right?
So there are all sorts of things you can do,

705
00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:22.360
but you've got to know what somebody else can't give me.
You know,

706
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:27.160
at some it's like,
ah,
that comes from,
let's say I'm learning chess.

707
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.390
Okay,
quick example,

708
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.900
you're teaching me chess and now it's the first time I'm actually going to go

709
00:40:31.901 --> 00:40:35.260
have a match with this guy over there,
right?
And you're like,

710
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:36.580
in the room feeding me all that,
you know,

711
00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:41.480
you're telling me everything to do and I do,
and I beat him.
Uh Huh.

712
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:46.540
Am I gonna feel good?
Am I going to be learning anything?
Like,

713
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:51.250
am I really getting ahead?
I won.
Right?
But it's like,
so it's some,
I mean,

714
00:40:51.251 --> 00:40:54.640
that's a rough analogy.
You gotta do it for yourself,

715
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:58.780
you have to lead your life.
And you know,

716
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:03.490
thinking about what's gonna make me fulfilled,
happy,
feel good,
you know,

717
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:06.520
what's actually going to be me using my resources,

718
00:41:06.521 --> 00:41:09.880
my capacities and growing and self realization and all that.

719
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.250
That's a kind of thing somebody's got to do for themselves.

720
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:15.640
They could still have great relationships with others and that can be part of,

721
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.440
you know,
them building their good lives.

722
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.950
So a lot of those that comes down to the right way of parenting probably too,

723
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:24.580
which is that you just want to give this person that you brought up into the

724
00:41:24.581 --> 00:41:28.060
world the right tools so that they could go ahead and figure it out for

725
00:41:28.061 --> 00:41:31.800
themselves and to really encourage handing them a bag full of yeah,

726
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.010
problems are all

727
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v 1>fixed and</v>

728
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.930
<v 3>you know,
do whatever the hell you want to do.
Yeah,</v>

729
00:41:36.931 --> 00:41:40.260
and I think it's the parenting and wider education.

730
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.970
I mean we're both teachers and it's,

731
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:45.900
we both know there's a lot of things you can do to help students learn.

732
00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:49.220
But if they're not putting in the work,
there's nothing.

733
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:52.170
You can't shove the knowledge into their mind.

734
00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.170
And if we're thinking about valuing as it requires a lot of knowledge and of

735
00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.000
really thinking things through,
is this the right career for me?

736
00:42:00.001 --> 00:42:02.700
Is this really worth doing?
Is this producing a value?

737
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:04.650
And having a firsthand view about that,

738
00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:09.510
you can't shove that into who's head he has.
You can help him see certain things,

739
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.900
but they have to do a lot of work and you're trying to encourage them and show

740
00:42:12.901 --> 00:42:15.480
them like there's an end result that's really positive,

741
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:20.070
but they have to put in the work.
And this is the,
um,

742
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:21.143
both,

743
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:26.340
I think I ran thinks a two virtues as virtues don't,

744
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:29.790
it's a moral traits of character that most people don't.

745
00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.180
They might think of him again as practical but not as more.
And that's,

746
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.800
you need to be rational,
which is really think things through for yourself.

747
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.190
Don't be too quick to just agree with everyone else.

748
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:46.220
Do I really understand things and to be really pursuing and loving knowledge and

749
00:42:47.071 --> 00:42:51.510
then to be making stuff to be producing and I think that's the most distinctive

750
00:42:51.511 --> 00:42:54.300
and it goes back to this,
she views life as trade.

751
00:42:54.301 --> 00:42:59.301
When you're interacting with people you can create new values and if to go back

752
00:43:00.721 --> 00:43:02.700
to the Cortez,
the 70%

753
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:09.530
she's seen as moral because she's going to take somebody else's money and give

754
00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:14.541
it to somebody else and the guy who's created it is not seen as moral and he has

755
00:43:14.911 --> 00:43:16.350
no say about what happens to his money.

756
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.010
<v 1>Yeah cause he made it here cause I already did the dirty work</v>

757
00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.750
but somehow no,
no this is moral.
This is,

758
00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:29.840
Oh yeah this is the higher ground than we should all be on.

759
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.820
Will it also see at some of the,

760
00:43:31.821 --> 00:43:34.700
I suppose comes down into that a certain amount of people think that they can

761
00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:38.510
control the universe or or or something to that effect.
Right.

762
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:41.450
Like she's trying to build a system that if she could only build her perfect

763
00:43:41.451 --> 00:43:45.910
system,
we would all behave in the way she wants us to.
[inaudible],

764
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.780
which is [inaudible].
There was a word for that,
right?

765
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.700
Not Polite to say of of you know,
Saint Cortez.
Right,
right,
right,
right.
Well,

766
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.950
we just opened the youtube comments of,
Hey,

767
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.410
let's link this dough to justice.
As long as we're talking about Cortez,

768
00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:04.670
and you mentioned justice before.

769
00:44:04.671 --> 00:44:08.840
Not everyone that watches my show knows how frustrated I am with the social

770
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:13.340
justice.
But as you alluded to earlier,
there are,
it's not all first off,

771
00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:16.740
I would never argue that it's,
it's totally a mountain 10 short.

772
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.250
Most of these people think that they're doing good.

773
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:21.950
I think they're ultimately what they're creating is not good.

774
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:25.220
But where does justice,
well,
I guess,
how would you define justice and where,

775
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:26.810
where would it fit into this conversation?

776
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:32.280
Justice is definitely one of the central virtues and rans of selfish

777
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.900
<v 2>virtues.
Um,</v>

778
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.040
she says justice is a matter of judging other people objectively and treating

779
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:47.430
them accordingly.
So it involved.
So you know,
couple of parts to that,
right?

780
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:52.470
It does involve judging people as opposed to judge not and be not judged or who

781
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:55.200
are you to be judgmental or who do you DJ and all that.
No,
no.

782
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:58.320
You have to judge individuals,
right?
People always say,
don't judge me,

783
00:44:58.321 --> 00:44:59.950
but when I do this ridiculous,

784
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:04.890
<v 3>you have a suggestion and notice that if you're good,
you're not going to say,</v>

785
00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:06.460
don't judge me.
But if you're

786
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:11.250
<v 2>crazy,
judge.
Right,
right,
right.
But it's again,</v>

787
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.780
judge objectively.
So you have to go by the evidence,
right.

788
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.750
And sometimes you don't have enough evidence.
So don't judge prematurely.

789
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:21.810
Don't be like,
oh,
I gotta reach a judgment.
I don't know enough yet.

790
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.080
Or I don't even have to go or whatever.
So you have to judge,

791
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:27.690
judge objectively and doctor accordingly.

792
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:33.000
Treat the person as he deserves.
And Yeah,
so it's definitely a virtue.

793
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.030
It's a virtue.
Again,
it's an application of being rational,

794
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.240
as uncle was talking about earlier,
to be realistic about people.

795
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.780
People vary in many,
many different respects.

796
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.300
It's not just a matter of judging their moral character,
right?

797
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:48.840
I have to judge my mechanic.
She,
every time I bring the car to that guy,

798
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.420
I always have to bring it back three weeks late or whatever.
Right?

799
00:45:51.421 --> 00:45:54.600
Or this place charges too much for whatever it might be.
Right?

800
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.790
You judge roommates again,
uh,
you know,
college roommates,
whenever Conrad,

801
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.700
who should I,
who should I have to babysit the kids?
I mean,

802
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:06.810
we judge people for all sorts of things.
Minor,
major,
you know,

803
00:46:06.811 --> 00:46:08.400
very consequential or not.

804
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.580
It makes sense for your own self interest to try to be very clear eyed in the

805
00:46:13.711 --> 00:46:18.480
judgments that you make.
And you know,
I'll give my business there or not,
or no,

806
00:46:18.481 --> 00:46:19.980
I'm really interested in that person.

807
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.100
Let's see if she wants to go out Saturday night or whatever it might.

808
00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:25.830
So you judge people,
you treat an objective.
When we

809
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:26.850
<v 3>live in a society though,</v>

810
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:30.720
where people have a different moral bedrock and I know that even though you'd

811
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:33.720
love for everyone to live by these rules,

812
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.120
obviously you're not going to impose it on them.
I know that much.
Um,

813
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.790
how do we get a consistent definition of what justice is then?

814
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.730
Um,
as a society,
I think it has deeper foundation.

815
00:46:47.731 --> 00:46:51.840
So it,
it end,
there has to be some agreement on those deeper foundation.

816
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:55.410
And again,
not every single person has to agree,
but you don't if,

817
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.520
if you have on the foundational issues in a,
in a society,

818
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:02.460
everyone disagreeing about everything,
you can build a call.

819
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:06.000
You don't really have a culture,
you have a clash,
um,
uh,

820
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:10.550
an ideological clash.
Right.
And I think the base of the sort of,
yes,
yes.
And I,

821
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:15.180
and I,
I think it's,
it's because there's various competing issues.

822
00:47:15.181 --> 00:47:20.181
They're still the enlightenment heritage of viewing people as individuals and

823
00:47:22.231 --> 00:47:27.090
that they have control over their lives over there thinking in action and I can

824
00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:30.370
therefore judge them as individuals.
And that justice

825
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.570
<v 2>is an issue of judging individual by individual.</v>

826
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:36.790
You can have blanket,
um,

827
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:41.910
and collective when we're talking about moral judgment that all blocks are all

828
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.750
gays.
That there's no such thing.

829
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:48.751
If you're really thinking of guys and the more you have and can at the deeper

830
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:51.680
foundations of the culture,

831
00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:55.840
the more it's pushing that what your identity is,

832
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.600
is your group.
And it can be different groups.

833
00:47:58.601 --> 00:48:03.580
And the more that your conception of justice is totally different because you

834
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:07.660
don't think of it as an individual in control of their lives and have to judge

835
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:10.630
individual by individual.
And if there's not agreement about that,

836
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:14.140
like if most people think no,
we're just these group,
right.

837
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:17.950
The tribal 70%.
Right?
Yeah.

838
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.310
And this is tremendously what's happening right now.

839
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.570
I mean this is what I would say,

840
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:27.070
the sort of oppression Olympics of judging us by those traits and looking at

841
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:30.130
somebody and going,
you have darker skin.
So I should think this,
right?

842
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.230
You're a woman.
So I should think this.
I mean this,

843
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:35.590
this seems to have become mainstream thought right now.

844
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.650
So it's funny when I've had,
you're on Brooklyn in a couple of times,

845
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:42.280
he'll talk about how well when he goes to eastern Europe where they're starved

846
00:48:42.281 --> 00:48:44.800
for ideas because they've lived through communism,

847
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.970
will they love iron ran because they need a,
a little more individual

848
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.430
uptown,
just a few and nothing like your own,
um,

849
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.760
a few eastern European countries and,
and spoken there.
And yeah,

850
00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.140
the reality of the alternatives is more palpable to these people,

851
00:49:02.141 --> 00:49:03.460
even younger generations,

852
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:06.460
but they remember their grandfather's farm and you know,

853
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:11.461
the do it all because it did not have a free or economy and so on.

854
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.640
It's all much more real to them.
Yeah.
Um,
but yeah,

855
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:19.090
I think we've definitely kind of socialize the idea of justice.

856
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:24.560
Justice is an interesting virtue in that it goes way back and many different

857
00:49:25.811 --> 00:49:26.201
cultures,

858
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:30.520
eastern West have very strong ideas of justice and many of them are essentially

859
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:33.190
this idea of you're treating people as they deserve,

860
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:38.820
but it's gradually over the years been distorted and ideas about individual

861
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:44.050
desert.
Oh,
dessert.
No,
no individual can deserve anything.
You know,

862
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:48.460
you are with the community made you,
you are just,
you know,
it takes a village,

863
00:49:48.461 --> 00:49:53.260
you know,
you didn't build that God forbids like kind of did in some cases.

864
00:49:53.261 --> 00:49:54.970
You know,
it is the individuals who did,

865
00:49:55.270 --> 00:50:00.270
but it's a sort of a transposition of the anti individualists that's really

866
00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:04.210
perverted justice in some of these ways that we're seeing.

867
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.370
So this has been a through line through everything we've done here.

868
00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:10.180
But let's just bring this to honesty also and why honesty is so important.

869
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:15.520
It's again,
I think she has a very distinctive view.

870
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:19.930
So most people think of honesty back,
linking it to selfishness,

871
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:22.750
that if I were to be selfish,

872
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.950
I'd be dishonest because I'd explored other,
I lie to them.
I cheat.

873
00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.090
I tell more

874
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:32.440
<v 3>than one story.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And so that's what's selfish.</v>

875
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.650
But honestly,
well,

876
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:38.710
I tell the truth and I'm interested in the truth for other people and rans view

877
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.800
than I think it's that it's really important to get that this is right is you

878
00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:48.080
should care about the truth for yourself.

879
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.840
So you should be horror.

880
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:55.970
Conception of honesty is a passionate commitment that I want to know what's true

881
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.270
about my life in the world.
Jen,
if I'm in a bad relationship,

882
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.200
I don't want to fake and pretend that I'm in a good relationship over.

883
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:04.910
I've never been to get to be in a good relationship,
right?

884
00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:07.040
If I don't face the fact I'm not in a good relationship,

885
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:08.810
I don't like my job at war.
Right?

886
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:12.670
Buckle on Facebook will think you're happier than you are.
And that's true.

887
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.840
That's true.
And that's,
I mean,

888
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:18.770
if you're really have a conception of is my life,

889
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.720
I've got one to live and so on.

890
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:24.290
It doesn't matter what other people think about it and if they think you're

891
00:51:24.291 --> 00:51:26.810
happy or they think you're not,
it's okay.
You know,

892
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:31.250
from the inside you have a perspective on your own life.
Is it going well or not?

893
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:36.430
And part of honesty is to look at yourself in a deep way and think,

894
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:41.060
do I like everything about myself?
Um,
are the things that I don't,

895
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:42.620
things that I can improve.

896
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:47.570
Do I like my situation in life and thinking about happiness of I'm in a dead end

897
00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.640
career or I've exact like I liked it,

898
00:51:49.641 --> 00:51:53.400
but I'm so now just going through the motions sort of I need to change.

899
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.470
And the,
the,
if you pretend or fake,

900
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.770
what don't,
you don't gain it.
Anything you don't,

901
00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:03.560
you're still in this new job that you're not really fulfilling.

902
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.650
You're pretending to yourself and maybe other people because you have to be

903
00:52:06.651 --> 00:52:09.800
respectable and you kind of have a midlife crisis or whatever.

904
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.130
But if that's what's happening,
you should really face it.
Yeah.

905
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.910
<v 2>I mean,
the way I think of it often is,</v>

906
00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.460
is just faking things doesn't change things.

907
00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.970
You can pretend to other people or to yourself,
right?

908
00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:23.910
But faking things doesn't change things.

909
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:29.270
So the sooner I figure out what things are and like face that honestly,

910
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:33.660
the better position I'm in to pursue my happiness.
You know,
to,

911
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.880
to have a good life to get out of this really like,

912
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:41.190
and a lot of it is avoiding self deception.
I think that's really important.

913
00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:45.300
It's not just a matter of are you honest with,
do you tell lies?
Right?
It's like

914
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.330
the road to hell is paved with evasion of fudging or Justcan,
you know?
Yeah.

915
00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.600
You gotta be honest with yourself.
You've got to be honest.

916
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:58.620
You got to try to face facts and find out when you don't know what's what so

917
00:52:58.621 --> 00:53:01.590
that you can make the best decisions.
Right.
So faking isn't going to help.

918
00:53:01.591 --> 00:53:06.120
But again,
what's interesting I think is usually when people are taught well,

919
00:53:06.121 --> 00:53:08.460
you gotta be truthful.
You gotta be honest.

920
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:13.900
Because the reasons given are when you get a bad reputation.

921
00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:17.260
If you're found out to be a liar,
right?
Your credibility will suffer.

922
00:53:17.261 --> 00:53:20.470
People won't want to deal with you.
Or in general,

923
00:53:20.471 --> 00:53:25.230
this is bad for the social fabric of trust,
but you know,
we needed a lot it.

924
00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.020
Well now that those most things are both true.

925
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.073
<v 3>Mm.</v>

926
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:34.370
<v 2>But one solution would be become a better a lie or don't be found out,</v>

927
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.540
right?
It's like,
no,

928
00:53:35.541 --> 00:53:39.170
that's not really going to help because more fundamentally than what other

929
00:53:39.171 --> 00:53:41.090
people think or your dealings with other people.

930
00:53:41.091 --> 00:53:44.810
If you're alone on a goddamn desert island,

931
00:53:44.811 --> 00:53:46.580
I don't want that old movie castaway or so I'm like,

932
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:48.290
you gotta be honest about it.

933
00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:51.950
I've got something here that I think I should worry about or I think there's a

934
00:53:51.951 --> 00:53:55.550
storm coming this way.
I've got to follow the facts,
right?

935
00:53:55.551 --> 00:53:58.520
I got to track the truth if I'm going to make rational decisions.

936
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:03.620
So it's a very reality based approach to honesty.

937
00:54:03.621 --> 00:54:07.220
Yeah.
Faking things doesn't change them.
You can lie on the CV and pretend you,

938
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.230
you can do something that you can't.

939
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.420
Good luck when you get in the job then you know,

940
00:54:11.421 --> 00:54:15.140
if you can fool people for awhile but you can't fool reality.

941
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:21.110
<v 3>And then are there moments where being dishonest is actually within your</v>

942
00:54:22.391 --> 00:54:26.260
rational self interest?
I wouldn't put it as dishonest,

943
00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.480
but if you have two concrete,

944
00:54:28.481 --> 00:54:31.690
a view of what honesty and dishonesty mean then.

945
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:35.230
So are there times when I would lie?
Yes.
Um,

946
00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:38.890
if I'm in the kind of standard examples of this fifth,

947
00:54:38.891 --> 00:54:41.770
some gang is going around killing people and they ask,

948
00:54:41.771 --> 00:54:44.570
well what does your wife or whatever I'm going to lie,
right.
And,

949
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.830
and I don't view that as dishonest.
So if I think of honesty,

950
00:54:47.831 --> 00:54:52.180
his loyalty to the facts,
it's,
oh,
okay,
okay.
And dishonesty is,

951
00:54:52.181 --> 00:54:56.160
I'm trying to get around the facts and trying to achieve something wild,

952
00:54:56.161 --> 00:54:57.910
getting around the fact I don't think you can achieve.

953
00:54:57.911 --> 00:55:01.820
So you can try to put just people off the scent for him an in line to them.

954
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:04.540
And I think there was situated,
I mean that's the standard kind of,

955
00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:08.130
I think there are other situations where I would lie because I did.

956
00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.090
Someone's trying to invade your privacy and so on.

957
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.180
And if you just say no comment or something like that,
it,

958
00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:17.800
it's often better if you lie and they go off looking in some direction where

959
00:55:17.801 --> 00:55:20.050
they should.
Um,
so there are situations,

960
00:55:20.051 --> 00:55:23.680
but I don't think of that as it's honesty is about,

961
00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.630
I'm loyal to the facts.

962
00:55:25.631 --> 00:55:30.220
I want to know because I need knowledge in order to guide my life and to succeed

963
00:55:30.221 --> 00:55:32.350
in everything that I'm trying to do.

964
00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:36.310
And I think even when you think of it in regard to other people,

965
00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:41.080
the reason you brought a Bernie Madoff before who lied on left,
right center,

966
00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:46.030
um,
why does he feel out of control of his own life?
And when you read that,

967
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:50.770
it's because,
as Tara was saying,
he knows that he's lying.

968
00:55:50.771 --> 00:55:55.771
So these are not facts and the liar typically thinks I'm so sophisticated in a

969
00:55:56.441 --> 00:56:00.400
good liar and these are all idiots who can discover any facts.

970
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.210
But the facts are out there to discover and you know,

971
00:56:04.211 --> 00:56:06.970
that and some so viewed longterm,

972
00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.210
someone's gonna find out the way he's cooking the books.

973
00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:14.800
And the more his scheme goes on,
the more things there is to find out.

974
00:56:14.801 --> 00:56:18.580
And he knows that any experiences and massive that he's out of control because

975
00:56:18.581 --> 00:56:21.490
he is out of control.
Right.
So basically I was building a house.
A car.
Yeah.

976
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:25.600
And that other people might,
the one that knocks inadvertently.
Yeah.

977
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:29.350
He tells somebody like he has to keep his five different stories straight and he

978
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:32.320
told the wrong thing to the wrong person who then starts to question.

979
00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:36.850
And that's like inevitable in the situation because the facts are still,

980
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:40.270
they're out there for people to discover it doesn't make it.
So,
yeah.

981
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:42.970
So that's an interesting way to link to the final topic that we'll talk about,

982
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:46.940
which is pride.
So you may say pride cometh before the fall.

983
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.520
He must've thought made off,

984
00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:52.330
must've thought I can manage all this stuff because of these people.
As you said,

985
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.570
they must be idiots and I can manage all right.

986
00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:01.670
But it was his pride in a way that was almost his downfall at some level.
Well,

987
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.800
he's,
well he's,
I would say his fake pride or,
yeah,
that's the,
yeah,

988
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:10.530
that's I think the big so not is authentic presence.
Yeah.
I think it's,

989
00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:15.030
yeah,
we're,
we're coming from,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's good.

990
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.780
I'm not taking care of the right virtue of pride in mind,

991
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:21.190
but that he had this here concocted a system.
Yeah.

992
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:26.170
In his mind that he felt that he is superior to everybody so he can juggle this

993
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:30.190
and so on and he's capable nobody else's.
And so,
but that is just,

994
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:32.800
that's such massive self deception.

995
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.290
I think there is no reason to think that.

996
00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:37.150
I urge you to just think of the investment world.

997
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.320
There's all kinds of people like a Warren buffet and so on who are hoarding like

998
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.950
orders of magnitude,
a better investor than made up.

999
00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:47.230
If you were really thinking about this,
no way you could think that I'm,

1000
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:49.600
I can do everybody about everything.

1001
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.840
And there were rumors over lot of long period of time of people who understood

1002
00:57:55.001 --> 00:57:59.180
that there's no way that hit the scheme is the Tragile Jalynn's I might not be

1003
00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:03.120
noticed specific fraud,
but there's no way and a lot of smart money to be true.

1004
00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:03.400
Yeah.

1005
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:08.110
A lot of smart money invited him into it and that like that's a fact that it's

1006
00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:12.350
so there's such self deception going on and pride is about um,

1007
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:17.170
developing a character that's good and therefore you can respect and he's doing

1008
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.490
exactly the opposite.

1009
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:21.760
He's expecting someone that he can look in the mirror and when you read about

1010
00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:24.040
the account,
it's more and more he feels like that,
that,

1011
00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.070
<v 2>and it just trying to put something over on others.</v>

1012
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:31.660
And that's where he's seeking his self esteem by.
Oh,
what a good,
clever guy.

1013
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:36.620
Right?
Yeah.
Ran Talks about pride as a verb.
Right.
I used to pride go,
you know,

1014
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:39.610
we're told,
oh,
you know,
pride is one of the seven deadly sins.

1015
00:58:39.611 --> 00:58:42.520
She says it's one of the,
you know,
the six or seven major virtues.

1016
00:58:42.521 --> 00:58:46.540
What she talking about.
She's not talking about patting yourself on the back,

1017
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:51.160
you know,
it's not the self congratulatory,
Oh,
I'm a wonderful,
you know,
get,

1018
00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:54.880
get ready for my closeup.
Pride is about mate.
Well,

1019
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.240
she describes it as moral ambitiousness,

1020
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.930
which I think is one of the loveliest phrases in her nonfiction writing.

1021
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:06.000
I'm trying to be the best person you can be.
You,

1022
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:10.060
you referring to making your character.
You know,
we talk of a self made man.

1023
00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:14.950
He made his fortune or j k rallying made her fortune.
You make your character,

1024
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.390
you can make your character as good as it can be,
not as an end in itself,

1025
00:59:19.391 --> 00:59:22.070
but so that you can have the best light.
Hey,

1026
00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:26.300
I want to really live according to the principles that make sense for human

1027
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:27.134
happiness,

1028
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:32.230
for human beings to have rich flourishing lives worth living.
I want to do it.

1029
00:59:32.231 --> 00:59:36.620
So if I figure out what the right principles are,
I want to practice those.

1030
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.130
You Bet.
I want to be perfect now,
perfect or not.
You know,

1031
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:43.970
everybody freaks out and you say the word,
but I want to be as good as I can be.

1032
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:45.890
You know,
when I'm 22 years old,

1033
00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:48.740
when I'm 28 I have different capacities and so on at different times.

1034
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:52.730
So it's make your life as good as it can be.
Be Morally ambitious.

1035
00:59:52.731 --> 00:59:56.990
Dot means again,
you gotta be honest with yourself.
It doesn't mean you excuse.

1036
00:59:56.991 --> 01:00:00.830
It's like,
no,
no.
If you realize,
oh,
Tara,
that was not,

1037
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.230
I was not too good.
You've got to be honest.

1038
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.350
If you really care about your character,

1039
01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:09.980
your life being as good as it can be,
but that's what she's talking about.
Yeah,

1040
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:14.000
you should be proud.
You should feel good about yourself when you've earned that.

1041
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:17.180
Aristotle said,
same thing on that part,
you know,
he said,
yeah,

1042
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.910
pride is the crown of the virtues.

1043
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:24.440
When you practice all the other virtues and can honestly look at yourself in the

1044
01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:29.270
mirror,
but what it's about is not this gaze and it's not comparative.

1045
01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:30.970
It's not all.
I'm so much better than him.

1046
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.180
It's I want to make my life as good as it can be.
I want to be morally ambitious

1047
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:39.990
<v 3>and if that's a pretty good,
it's pretty good.
I'll make one like that too.</v>

1048
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.740
[inaudible] to me and then,

1049
01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:46.230
and then we locked guys [inaudible] here.
All right.

1050
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:50.380
Just to look at it back from the perspective of the moral in the practical.

1051
01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.420
This is when she's saying they go together.
Most people fear morale,

1052
01:00:55.421 --> 01:00:58.690
lead or suspicious of it because they think of it.

1053
01:00:58.691 --> 01:01:02.650
It's there to take their values away.
It's uh,
it's the rock.

1054
01:01:02.651 --> 01:01:06.330
He's made 70 million and now,
well,
to be moral you would give 70% of it away.

1055
01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.940
And so,
and what her whole conception is,
no,

1056
01:01:09.941 --> 01:01:11.530
you live it to the fullest.

1057
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:16.710
So pride is both its moral and practical and you're trying to unite these things

1058
01:01:16.991 --> 01:01:19.960
together.
So instead of fearing morality,

1059
01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:23.590
you're interest in it and you want to learn its principles because it's going to

1060
01:01:23.591 --> 01:01:24.670
advance your life.

1061
01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.420
It's such a radically different view of thinking about morality.

1062
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.650
That is a salad ending,
my friend.
All right,
well it's me.

1063
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.630
It's been a pleasure chatting with you guys.
Thanks for watching everybody.

1064
01:01:34.631 --> 01:01:35.021
Remember,

1065
01:01:35.021 --> 01:01:39.550
this is just one in a series of six of these interviews that I'll be doing over

1066
01:01:39.551 --> 01:01:41.800
on the iron ran institute youtube channel,

1067
01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.930
and you can find a link to that right down below.

1068
01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:47.620
