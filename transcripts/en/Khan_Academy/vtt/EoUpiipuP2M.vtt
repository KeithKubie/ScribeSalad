00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.461
- In your mind, why is the
Supreme Court important?

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:05.010
- Well the Supreme Court is important

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.940
for the original
founders' reasons or that,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.710
it was like all American institutions

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.020
there were ideas the founders had

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.264
and then John Marshall,
an important justice,

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:17.390
created the office by the
practice of the office

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.570
and it is important
because the court is where

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.600
America's thorniest
questions go to be resolved.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.640
They haven't been resolved
in the executive branch

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.040
and the legislative
branch and so the court

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.370
has to take them up and that is where

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.330
the court goes back to
those first principles.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.090
Again, why we study American history.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.570
What exactly was the
outline for how the country

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.730
is supposed to behave and are
we staying within that outline

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.310
and those series of ideals?

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.318
It goes back to the very
beginning ingredients

00:00:43.318 --> 00:00:44.370
of America.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.730
So, the court is a test always
of whether what we're doing

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.660
now is in keeping with
what we were supposed to do

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.744
at the founding of the country.

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:54.610
The reason it has become
so important recently

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.010
is that the court ends up
doing a lot more than it was

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.340
ever supposed to do because of weakness

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.910
in the executive branch
and the legislative branch

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.250
and so a lot of people are
now looking to the court

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.690
to solve problems that
should actually be handled

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.977
by the people's representatives.

00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:11.496
The judges are not elected.

00:01:11.496 --> 00:01:13.879
They are in there for
life at the Supreme Court

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.320
through the process of
the president with advice

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.540
and consent by the Senate
but they are not elected

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.410
and this was supposed to
be a republic in which

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.790
the elected representatives
were the ones making the laws.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.400
But we've shifted away from that

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.410
and so the court is now making decisions

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.636
that can affect people's
lives and a generation

00:01:29.636 --> 00:01:34.280
and not be changed as easily
as say a piece of legislation

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.220
which can be vetoed, amended,
superseded by another piece

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.390
of legislation.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.960
It's really permanent
changes in the American life.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480
- So my understanding is
that the Supreme Court

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.889
should be above politics.

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:49.140
To what degree is that actually the case?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.090
- Well the Supreme Court had lots of...

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.970
There have been times
where the Supreme Court

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.450
when Andrew Jackson was president

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.590
he tried to use the Supreme
Court to do what he wanted

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.542
it to do and Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:02.540
tried to change the
functioning of the court

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.884
because it kept knocking
down all the things

00:02:03.884 --> 00:02:05.710
he wanted to do.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.970
We've had moments where
there have been these spasms

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.640
where presidents have
tried to get the court

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.723
to do what they wanted.

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:13.750
But in general, it was
the American tradition

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.680
that the justices were
supposed to be picked

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.060
if they were of good character

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.050
and if they were of sound legal mind.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.784
If they had views on the manners related

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:26.620
to the Constitution that
were sort of sound legally.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.242
But their politics weren't
supposed to be so important.

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:33.328
What has happened is like so
much in modern American life

00:02:33.328 --> 00:02:36.260
is there has been an
intertwining of politics

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.580
and the legal profession
so that now when presidents

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.282
run for office they say,

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:45.005
elect me so that I can put
in our kinds of judges.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.516
Which means that the
kind of judge you pick

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:50.355
helps you with your
voters and if your voters

00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:52.688
want a very specific kind
of ideological judge,

00:02:52.688 --> 00:02:55.640
then the more ideological
the judge that you pick,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.560
the greater your voters
will be happy about you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.995
and that'll keep you in office.

00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:02.840
And that is true of the
senators advising and consenting

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.590
on these decisions and
true of the presidents

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.470
who pick them.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.427
Well that means that the
people who go into the office

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:10.280
into the Supreme Court I should say

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.050
end up being more
political than in the past.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.276
There was a period where
when an American president

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:16.660
would pick a justice,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.170
that justice very often
would rule in a way that was

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.285
totally the opposite of what the members

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.350
of that president's party wanted.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.650
It happened repeatedly in American life

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.510
and that was a symbol people thought

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.820
of the idea that these
issues before the court

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.350
were being weighed on their merits

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.090
and had nothing to do
with the ideological views

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.490
of the judge weighing them.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.580
Now, where you sit on a particular issue

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.330
is often determined by where
you came from politically.
