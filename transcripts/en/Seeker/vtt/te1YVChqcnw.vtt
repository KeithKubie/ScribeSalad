00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.319
If you come in contact with asbestos, you
just gotta deal with it as-best-os you can.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.469
Hey there, guys, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.450
You may have heard of asbestos as this hazardous
material that can be found in old homes and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.450
buildings.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.320
It’s been used commercially in North America
for over 100 years, but now, in 2016, the

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.420
EPA is evaluating the material as a “high
priority risk” with the potential to ban

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.670
it entirely.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.230
So what the heck is this stuff and why is
it so dangerous?

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.260
Ok first, I’m guessing you, like me, have
no idea what asbestos actually is -- other

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.890
than a scary carcinogen, right?

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.719
Asbestos was first identified in ancient Greece
by one of Aristotle’s students in 300 BCE.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.780
He noted it looked like rotten wood and had
remarkable resistance to fire, even when doused

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.399
with oil!

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.370
Asbestos isn’t a chemical or human-made
substance, it’s stone -- actually it’s

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.870
a group of six naturally-occurring silicate
minerals found in rock and soil in 900 different

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.270
regions of the US alone.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.220
Asbestos is a stronger than steel, soft, fire-resistant
mineral, that doesn’t biodegrade, decompose,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.050
dissolve in water, or evaporate.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.760
No wonder asbestos is in everything, it’s
a frickin’ wonder-material!

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.630
But not all asbestos’ are created equal:
amosite is ‘brown’ asbestos, crocidolite

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.530
is ‘blue’ asbestos, and chrysotile is
‘white’ asbestos.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.920
The other three types come in a variety of
colors and are actinolite, anthophyllite and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.920
tremolite.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.060
According to Scientific American, the “strongest
and stiffest” are brown, blue and the other

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.610
three, but the white asbestos is “softer
and more flexible.”

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.820
Because of that flexibility, the white asbestos
is used in 95 percent of asbestos products!

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.910
Even though it looks like wood or fibers,
again, asbestos is technically a mineral!

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.630
It’s made of chains of silicon and oxygen
atoms with other elements (calcium, iron,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.720
magnesium) incorporated in, which change its
properties slightly.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.259
Because of these amazing properties, the asbestos
family of minerals have been used in heat-resistant

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.719
fabrics, paints and plastics, paper products,
car brakes and clutches, and in building materials

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.489
such as roofing, siding, flooring and insulation.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.159
And this is where we get to the problems...

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.879
While asbestos is basically indestructible
under normal circumstances, human bodies are

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.879
not.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.659
If asbestos crumbles and gets into the air
it breaks into tiny, thin threads, which are

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.400
still indestructible, just smaller now…

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.819
If those threads become air or waterborne,
they can get swallowed or lodged in the lungs,

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.819
causing problems.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.889
This is why people who work with asbestos-containing
products -- say, in building construction

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:43.889
-- run risks.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.209
They’re dealing with a high concentration
of the material, and are more likely to get

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.390
it in their body.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.620
You’d expect that inhaling fibers would
cause symptoms like coughing, sneezing, or

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.349
itching, but -- and this is the scary bit
-- asbestos inhalation doesn’t really have

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.349
any symptoms!

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.010
It doesn’t dissolve, melt or evaporate,
and minerals don’t have odor!

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.060
So you can’t see, feel or taste asbestos
fibers.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.220
This is why people who work with asbestos
have to take special care and use protective

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.220
equipment.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.769
You don’t want this stuff in your body.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.970
According to OSHA, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, asbestos exposure

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.629
is a hazard for about 1.3 million construction
workers in the U.S.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.260
The EPA describes asbestos as a “known carcinogen”
– that is, a chemical that can cause cancer

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.510
after exposure.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.389
The health effects from these indestructible
fibers entering the body include several types

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.999
of lung cancer, mesothelioma -- a rare form
of cancer that develops in the lining of the

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.669
lungs -- and asbestosis – a serious, long-term
disease of the lungs.

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.349
According to a meta-analysis from the journal
American Family Physician, there are approximately

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.780
200,000 cases in the US of asbestosis annually,
and over 6000 deaths from asbestosis, lung

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.499
cancer and mesothelioma combined related to
asbestos exposure.

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:01.959
We’ve been regulating asbestos in the United
States since the 1970s.We check for it in

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.859
“drinking water, schools, some consumer
products, and workplace air.”

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.209
A few uses of asbestos are even banned under
existing regulations – like certain paper

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.379
products and spray-on materials.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.620
But even if the EPA decides to ban it entirely,
there will still be asbestos in places like

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.620
old buildings.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.650
It’s incredible that this naturally-occurring
ancient material has been used so many things

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.660
over the centuries and it turns out it was
killing us the whole time.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.160
We just have to keep looking for it as-best-os
we can.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160
I had to.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160
I HAD TO!

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.940
If this doesn’t cement the myth that just
because something is “natural” means it’s

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.990
safe or good for you, I don’t know what
will.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.120
I mean, what’s really difference between
natural and artificial flavors, for example?
