00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.100
Wow, this is looking great.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.852
I think you both did a great job
in version one, I mean point one.

00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:06.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,
yeah actually it was super easy.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.770
It was just a matter of
installing the SDK and

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.530
getting her up to sync the Firebase.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.680
&gt;&gt; Well,
you've also done your homework, and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.040
Firebase seems to be a great choice
considering your requirements.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.830
&gt;&gt; That is true.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.910
And you know what,
we've been doing so much work,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.550
I think it's time for a break.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.850
I could really use some sleep, and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.282
there's actually some shows
I've wanted to catch up on.

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:24.070
&gt;&gt; Hey [CROSSTALK].

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.870
&gt;&gt; So yeah, we downloaded the app, and I
got some friends to download it too, and

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.390
we're really confused.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.620
&gt;&gt; Category keeps overriding
the name of my shopping list.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.700
&gt;&gt; Okay,
well could this wait until tomorrow?

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.060
&gt;&gt; No.
No it cannot wait because

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.870
Jeff has been trying to order toilet
paper since, I don't know, an hour ago?

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.040
So you need to fix it.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.680
No, no, excuse me.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.280
Fix it!

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.000
Fix it!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.840
Fix it!

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.690
Fix it!

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.290
Fix it!

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.910
Fix it!
Fix it!

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.950
Fix it! Fix it! &gt;&gt; Alright I'll fix it!

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.690
&gt;&gt; So, on to version point two.
