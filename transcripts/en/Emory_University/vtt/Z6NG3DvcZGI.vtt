00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.550
[Ambulance siren] That was the day that I gave up. That was the day that I cried Uncle.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:22.690
That was the turning point for me. That was when I realized, oh, February 2009 is going to be my new life.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.780
[music]

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.150
When I tell you that no one could be
more surprised than I was to end up in an emergency room,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.290
due to a self-inflicted drug overdose, trying to kill myself.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.260
I mean that, that's an understatement. I was the most surprised.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.600
There was no reason in the world for me to want to die.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.220
I had everything and yet I woke up every morning wishing I was dead.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.000
I was officially diagnosed with depression, serious depression when I was in my late thirties early forties.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.500
I had a doctor, a psychiatrist, who was prescribing this drug and then this drug and then this drug.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.180
I called it the medication
merry-go-round. I would try this medication and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.850
I'd be on it for the two,
three, four weeks whatever it was.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.040
I go back to him and say I not only do I not feel better I feel worse.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.000
I didn't know that the drug had stopped working. I did not know that I had developed a

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.959
resistance to it because I had been on
it for so long.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.340
My sister Maria happened to be in a doctor's office going through a local magazine and there was a full-page ad -

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.520
"Treat your depression without medication." It was a miracle. I look at it as a miracle.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.360
We devised a way to use my
experience in

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.420
what kind of electromagnetic coil would be best at actually stimulating focal parts of the brain

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:09.620
and we were able to design this thing right here, which is our very first prototype.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:26.640
This allows transcranial magnetic stimulation with about a quarter of the
power and an eight of the heat that was previously required.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.640
And is still required for all magnetic stimulators that don't use this particular technology.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.640
And it's that electrical stimulation based on the magnetic pulse that then wakes up the brain.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.920
When those neurons start talking to each other because they've been awakened

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.600
they start delivering the neurotransmitters that you need to feel happy.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.000
I really l knew I was feeling better when I caught myself laughing. We were out with some friends and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.700
I went "Oh I just laughed" that was huge considering how low I had been just six weeks before.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.000
My life is redefined. It's almost like the reinvention of Martha.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:23.200
And that's a great feeling. That's a great feeling, it's like having a second chance to be alive.
