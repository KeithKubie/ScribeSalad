00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.880
In the seminal March 2011 blog post, the rise and

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.520
fall of HL7, Australian standards guru,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.100
Graham Greaves said that, complicated standards can be pushed for a while, but

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.140
ultimately markets reject them. He then goes on to essentially say that,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.160
RIM is doomed because it is too complex. No single model will work in

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.930
all domains. It's internally inconsistent, which is often true of

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.850
extremely complex constructs, and ultimately it's too expensive to implement.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.260
He pointed to JSON web services, Java, Java script object notation is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.790
a light weight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.920
write. It's also easy for machines to parse and generate. The result,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.550
some three years later, is FHIR, Fast Health Interoperability Resources.
