00:00:00.243 --> 00:00:02.683
- So, let's say that we have a round table

00:00:02.683 --> 00:00:05.083
and we have three chairs
around that round table.

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:06.903
This is one chair right over here,

00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:08.443
this is another chair,

00:00:08.443 --> 00:00:10.543
and that is another chair.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.103
We can number the chairs;

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:13.203
that is chair one,

00:00:13.203 --> 00:00:14.483
that is chair two,

00:00:14.483 --> 00:00:16.023
and that is chair three.

00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:17.943
Now let's assume that
there are three people

00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:20.993
who want to sit in these three chairs,

00:00:20.993 --> 00:00:22.869
so there is Person A,

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.469
there is Person B,

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.229
and there is Person C.

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:29.049
What we want to do is we want to count

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.549
the number of ways that these three people

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:33.249
can sit in these three chairs.

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:34.669
What do I mean by that?

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:39.289
Well, if A sits in chair
one, B sits in chair three,

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.822
and C sits in chair two, that is one

00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:44.762
scenario right over there.

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:47.702
So this is one of the possible scenarios,

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:50.622
A in seat one, C in seat
two, B in seat three.

00:00:50.622 --> 00:00:54.421
Another scenario could be B in seat one,

00:00:56.235 --> 00:01:00.402
maybe C still sits in seat
two, C still sits there,

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:03.282
and now A would be in seat three.

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.361
So this is one scenario and two scenarios.

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:07.142
My question to you is how many

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:09.122
scenarios are there like this?

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:10.362
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.399
and try to think through it.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.847
I'm assuming you've had a go at it,

00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:15.947
now let's work through it together.

00:01:15.947 --> 00:01:17.467
I want to do it very systematically

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:21.042
so that we don't forget
any of the scenarios.

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:22.314
The way I'm going to
do it is, I'm going to

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.494
create three blanks that
represent each of the chairs.

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:26.134
So here, it's in a circle,
but we could just say

00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:29.174
that blank is chair one,
that's the blank for chair two,

00:01:29.174 --> 00:01:31.794
and that is the blank for chair three.

00:01:31.794 --> 00:01:34.089
I'm going to start with seat
one, and I'm going to say,

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:35.814
"Well, what are the different scenarios?"

00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:38.194
A could sit there, B could
sit there, C could sit there.

00:01:38.194 --> 00:01:40.614
Then for each of those, figure
out who could sit in seat two

00:01:40.614 --> 00:01:41.754
and then for each of those,

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:43.974
figure out who could sit in seat three.

00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:45.174
So let's do that.

00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:49.961
First, what are the scenarios
of who could sit in seat one?

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.316
Maybe I'll write it this way,

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:56.189
maybe I'll do seat one.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.658
So right now, we're only
going to fill seat one.

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:03.016
Well A could sit in seat one,

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:07.644
in which case we haven't filled
seat two or seat three yet.

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:09.442
So that's two or three.

00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:12.322
B could sit in seat one,
and we haven't figured out

00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:16.077
who sits in seat two or seat three yet.

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:18.882
Then we could have C sitting in seat one,

00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:21.214
and we still have to figure
out who's going to sit

00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:24.278
in seat two and seat three.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.071
For each of these, let's figure out who

00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:27.971
could be sitting in seat two.

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:32.611
So, seats one and two.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.132
For this one right over here,

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:41.194
we have A in seat one for sure.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.520
We could either have
B sitting in seat two,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.080
in which case, I'll leave this
blank although you can use

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.660
a little bit of deductive
reasoning to figure out

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.500
who's going to be sitting in seat three.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.080
So I'll leave seat three blank.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.640
Or, you could have C sitting in seat two.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.620
We still haven't figured out
who's sitting in seat three,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.920
although once again, a little bit

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.900
of deductive reasoning might tell us.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.994
So these are the scenarios
where A is in seat one.

00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:09.370
Now what about when B is in seat one?

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.804
We could put A in seat two, and we still

00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:14.984
need to figure out who's in seat three.

00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:17.984
Or, we could put C in seat two,

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:19.104
and we still need to figure out

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:22.224
who's going to be in seat three.

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:26.464
Finally, let's look at C,
where C is in seat one.

00:03:26.464 --> 00:03:31.464
You could either put A in seat two or

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.757
you could put B in seat two.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.384
Now let's fill out all three of the seats.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:42.863
So seats one, two,

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:44.304
and three.

00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:47.024
For this scenario right over here,

00:03:47.024 --> 00:03:49.204
there's only one option that
you could put in seat three,

00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:52.177
the only person who hasn't
sat down yet is person C.

00:03:52.177 --> 00:03:55.070
So this will be A, B, C.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.854
And what would this be?

00:03:55.854 --> 00:03:57.180
The only person who hasn't sat down

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.916
in this scenario yet to fill this chair,

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:00.336
the only option for this chair,

00:04:00.336 --> 00:04:01.776
there's only one option here,

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:03.576
it's going to be person B.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.236
It's A, C, B.

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:09.436
This one is going to be B, A, C.

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:11.016
C's the only person who could sit there,

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.836
A is the only person who could sit there.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:14.776
B, C, A.

00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:17.656
And then here, B is the only person

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.216
who could sit in seat three.

00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:20.676
And here A is the only person

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:22.616
who could sit in seat three.

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.136
How many scenarios do we have?

00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:28.346
We have one, two, three, four,

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:31.234
five, and six.

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:32.476
And six is our answer.

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:34.396
That's the number of
scenarios that you could have

00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:37.469
the different people sitting
in the different chairs.

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:38.767
Now, I know what you're thinking,

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.456
"Okay Sal, this was a
scenario with three people

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:43.839
"and three chairs and I
might've been able just do this

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:45.499
"even if I didn't do it systematically.

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:49.439
"But what if I have many many more chairs?

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.439
"What if I had 60 chairs?"

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.919
Well, the number of scenarios
would get fairly large.

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.059
What if I had five people and five chairs?

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.519
Even this method right over here

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:01.859
would take up a lot of paper space,

00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:03.099
or a lot of screen space.

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.423
What do we do in that scenario?

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.202
And the realization here is just

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:09.708
thinking about what happened here.

00:05:10.707 --> 00:05:14.902
How many people could sit in seat one?

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:17.333
If we're going seat by seat,

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:18.913
how many possibilities were there

00:05:18.913 --> 00:05:20.453
to put in seat one?

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:21.993
If you're seating in order,

00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:25.779
if you haven't filled
any of the seats yet,

00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:31.097
right at the beginning,
there's three possible people

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:33.097
who could sit in seat one.

00:05:33.097 --> 00:05:35.101
You see it right over here, one

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.726
two, three, because there's
three possible people.

00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:42.954
For each of those, how many
people could sit in seat two?

00:05:42.954 --> 00:05:45.414
For each of them, let's
say the scenario where A

00:05:45.414 --> 00:05:48.114
is sitting in seat one,
there's two possibilities

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.464
for who could sit in seat two.

00:05:51.109 --> 00:05:52.728
Let me do this in a different color.

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.968
So this, right over here.

00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:59.968
For each of these three,
there's two possibilities

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:03.468
of who could sit in seat two.

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:05.728
If A is sitting in seat
one, you could have

00:06:05.728 --> 00:06:07.488
either B or C in seat two.

00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:08.968
If B is sitting in seat one, you have

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.868
either A or C for seat two.

00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:14.288
So for each of these three,
you have two possibilities

00:06:14.288 --> 00:06:16.532
of who could sit in seat two.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.024
So you have six possibilities
where you're filling in

00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:23.304
three times two, or you're filling in

00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:26.464
the scenarios for seats one and two.

00:06:26.464 --> 00:06:28.224
And then for each of those,

00:06:28.224 --> 00:06:33.224
how many scenarios are
who can sit in seat three?

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.667
For each of those, there was only

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:42.472
one possibility for who could sit

00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.544
in seat three.

00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:47.944
We see it right there, that's because

00:06:47.944 --> 00:06:50.684
there's only one person left
who hasn't sat down yet.

00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:52.784
So how many total possibilities are there?

00:06:52.784 --> 00:06:57.784
Well, three times two
times one is equal to six.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:00.383
And so if we were to do that
same exact thought exercise,

00:07:00.383 --> 00:07:03.262
with say, five seats, let's
go through that exercise.

00:07:03.262 --> 00:07:04.863
It's interesting.

00:07:04.863 --> 00:07:09.840
So if we have one, two, three, four, five.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.673
So this is five seats with
five people sitting down,

00:07:12.673 --> 00:07:14.373
and we want to figure out
how many scenarios are there

00:07:14.373 --> 00:07:17.189
for all the different people
and all the different seats.

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:19.129
For the first seat, there's five

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:21.569
different people who could sit in it.

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:23.938
For each of those scenarios,
there's four people

00:07:23.938 --> 00:07:27.695
who haven't sat down yet who
could sit in the second seat.

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:30.399
For each of those scenarios,
there's going to be

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:32.179
three people who haven't sat down yet,

00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:33.869
so those are the people who
could sit in the third seat

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:36.159
if we're filling out
the seats in this order.

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.939
For each of all of these scenarios,

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:40.979
there's two people left
who haven't sat down yet,

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.919
who could sit in the fourth seat.

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:44.659
And then for all of these scenarios,

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:46.639
there's only one person
left who hasn't sat down

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.826
who would have to sit in the fifth seat.

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:50.784
If you had this exact
same thing, but instead of

00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:52.524
three chairs you had five chairs,

00:07:52.524 --> 00:07:54.024
the number of scenarios would be

00:07:54.024 --> 00:07:57.804
five times four times
three times two times one.

00:07:57.804 --> 00:08:00.864
Which is what, 20 times six,

00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:03.819
which is equal to 120 scenarios.

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:07.894
And so you see that the
scenarios grow fairly quickly.

00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:10.028
And if you're wondering,
"Hey, this is kind of a neat

00:08:10.028 --> 00:08:12.268
mathematical thing. Three
times two times one."

00:08:12.268 --> 00:08:15.148
Or five times four times
three times two times one.

00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:17.128
If you start with a number
and you multiply that number

00:08:17.128 --> 00:08:20.028
times number one less than that

00:08:20.028 --> 00:08:22.388
all the way down to getting to one,

00:08:22.388 --> 00:08:25.618
that seems like neat kind of
fun mathematical operation.

00:08:25.618 --> 00:08:27.838
And lucky for you, or
maybe unlucky for you,

00:08:27.838 --> 00:08:29.318
because this might have
been your chance at fame,

00:08:29.318 --> 00:08:31.721
this operation has already been defined.

00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:35.663
It's called the factorial operation.

00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:37.159
So this thing right over here,

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.195
this is the same thing as three factorial.

00:08:41.195 --> 00:08:42.936
You write this little exclamation mark.

00:08:42.936 --> 00:08:45.616
This right over here,
this is the same thing

00:08:45.616 --> 00:08:47.296
as five factorial.

00:08:47.296 --> 00:08:50.636
In general, if I said six factorial,

00:08:50.636 --> 00:08:53.076
that would be equal to six times five

00:08:53.076 --> 00:08:57.816
times four times three
times two times one.

00:08:57.816 --> 00:09:00.049
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
