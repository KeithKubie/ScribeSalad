what the what the broader categories
 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.820
what the what the broader categories
will entail when you start thinking

will entail when you start thinking
 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.100
will entail when you start thinking
about other backward castes in India or

about other backward castes in India or

you're on some schedule of
underrepresented minorities but I'd like

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430
underrepresented minorities but I'd like
 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.520
underrepresented minorities but I'd like
to bracket that out for the initial

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530
to bracket that out for the initial
 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.170
to bracket that out for the initial
question and so Italy I'd like to ask

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180
question and so Italy I'd like to ask
 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.120
question and so Italy I'd like to ask
you perhaps first just to reflect a

from both mark and and forethought and
 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:04:02.060
from both mark and and forethought and
and just try to clarify the divergence

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070
 
 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.380

which is that is very very stimulating
 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.040
which is that is very very stimulating
because I think it's it's resonating

because I think it's it's resonating
 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.560
because I think it's it's resonating

know what it is and how it

disconnected from the history it becomes

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:36.790
disconnected from the history it becomes
 

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.079
disconnected from the history it becomes
kind of crazy because you you say and

the issue of emancipation on the cheap
that's a very powerful argument and

00:09:50.869 --> 00:09:50.879
that's a very powerful argument and
 

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:53.549
that's a very powerful argument and
often made in the context of the

yeah this question of diversity is

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:48.520
yeah this question of diversity is
 

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.350
yeah this question of diversity is
interesting because it seemed to me on

the American case diversity is window

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.370
the American case diversity is window

diversity that's the kind of prospective

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:23.589
diversity that's the kind of prospective
 

00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:27.400
diversity that's the kind of prospective
forward-looking we really want a society

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:27.410
forward-looking we really want a society
 

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:32.380
forward-looking we really want a society
in which the officer corps looks like

in which the officer corps looks like
the troops so it's okay to have

the troops so it's okay to have
 

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.440
the troops so it's okay to have
diversity because it'll produce that

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:38.450
diversity because it'll produce that
 

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:44.880
diversity because it'll produce that
kind of social lubrication as a result

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:44.890
kind of social lubrication as a result
 

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:51.630
kind of social lubrication as a result
but in fact you know so we we get this

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:51.640
but in fact you know so we we get this
 

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.890
but in fact you know so we we get this
diversity and of course diversity and

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:56.900
diversity and of course diversity and
 

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.040
diversity and of course diversity and
one other feature of the American system

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.050
one other feature of the American system
 

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.010
one other feature of the American system
has to be put in in contrast with the

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:03.020
has to be put in in contrast with the
 

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.930
has to be put in in contrast with the
Indian system we who can be a

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:07.940
Indian system we who can be a
 

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.900
Indian system we who can be a
beneficiary of this where we just use

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:10.910
beneficiary of this where we just use
 

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:16.380
beneficiary of this where we just use
kind of intuition and self declaration

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:16.390
kind of intuition and self declaration
 

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.510
kind of intuition and self declaration
as opposed to the Indian system where we

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:19.520
as opposed to the Indian system where we
 

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.490
as opposed to the Indian system where we
have a measured official determination

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:21.500
have a measured official determination
 

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.180
have a measured official determination
of the eligibility of groups and we have

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:25.190
of the eligibility of groups and we have
 

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.630
of the eligibility of groups and we have
basically these publicly assigned

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:27.640
basically these publicly assigned
 

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.019
basically these publicly assigned
identities of eligibility which in some

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:32.029
identities of eligibility which in some
 

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:40.860
identities of eligibility which in some
sense creates or aggravates the problem

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:40.870
 
 

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.570
 
as we defined it this notion of

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:43.580
as we defined it this notion of
 

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.670
as we defined it this notion of
compulsory identities but so in the

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680
compulsory identities but so in the
 

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.430
compulsory identities but so in the
American system its immunity we end up

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440
American system its immunity we end up
 

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.940
American system its immunity we end up

diversity diversities great we're not

diversity but it'll go away in 25 years

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:13.910
diversity but it'll go away in 25 years
 

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.420
diversity but it'll go away in 25 years
because basically the blacks will be

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:16.430
because basically the blacks will be
 

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.110
because basically the blacks will be
will be integrated and what about other

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120
will be integrated and what about other
 

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.360
will be integrated and what about other
forms of diversity what about you know

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:22.370
forms of diversity what about you know
 

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.130

in 25 years surely it's gonna be some

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:24.140
in 25 years surely it's gonna be some

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:30.790
look attractive for policy purposes so
 

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.730
look attractive for policy purposes so
so in the u.s. as I say diversity is

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:33.740
so in the u.s. as I say diversity is
 

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.300
so in the u.s. as I say diversity is
kind of window dressing but very

the society to integrate across racial
ethnic lines so that must be something

ethnic lines so that must be something
 

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:43.220
ethnic lines so that must be something
really hard to do and it must be

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:43.230
really hard to do and it must be
 

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.960
