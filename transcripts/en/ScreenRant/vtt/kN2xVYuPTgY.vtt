00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.090
Television has been evolving ever since Americans
first welcomed TVs into their living room.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.510
Today there's more money to be made on the
small screen than ever before.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.560
Whether it's on HBO, Netflix or any other
platform, there's something out there for

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.410
everyone, no matter what their taste.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.340
Nailing down which shows have been most influential
in television's development is pretty tough;

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.480
there's so much TV to choose from that we
could write multiple top tens and they'd all

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.890
be unique.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:38.089
But we're always up for a challenge, so here
are our picks for the ten most influential

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.080
TV shows of all time.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080
The Wire

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.900
Before Boyd Crowder toed the line between
being a good guy and a total heel, before

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.079
Game of Thrones shocked audiences by taking
Sean Bean�s head, and before Walter White

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.480
made ruthless meth dealing cool, there was
The Wire, a show where main characters were

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.820
never safe and amorality ruled.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.899
Sure, The Wire has been influenced by other
entries on this list, but the show reminded

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.790
viewers that great TV could exist outside
of network stations.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.430
Although it owes a debt to its predecessors,
this police drama was groundbreaking on its

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.430
own.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.439
Even casual fans probably can�t hear �The
Farmer in the Dell� without looking over

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.530
their shoulders.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.620
Law &amp; Order

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.910
Law &amp; Order aired between 1990 and 2010.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.080
During that time it spawned four spin-offs
and immortalizing actors like Jerry Orbach,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.530
Jesse L. Martin, Mariska Hargitay, and Sam
Waterston.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.060
So if you detect shades of the iconic series
while watching, say, The Shield, or The Practice,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.890
it�s probably not an accident.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.240
The original Law &amp; Order is the best of the
brand, but the show�s �ripped from the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.310
headlines� realism has had a massive role
in molding police and courtroom dramas.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.310
Lost

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.570
Five years after it ended, some of its viewers
are still Lost.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.900
But if the story�s lingering questions and
unsolved mysteries still drive debate about

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.260
the show's quality, then there�s no denying
the impact it had on television during and

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.659
after its six season run.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.149
Consider shows like Flashforward, Person of
Interest, and Fringe - each of them has benefitted

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.530
in some way from Lost�s massive popularity.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.189
The series also took J.J. Abrams� �mystery�
box approach to storytelling and brought it

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.610
to new heights.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.750
Audiences would continue to see in films like
Cloverfield and Star Trek Into Darkness - it's

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.270
not a stretch to think that these movies might
not exist without the success of Lost.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.109
Star Trek: The Next Generation

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.850
Speaking of Star Trek, how much do you love
your tablet?

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.010
Gene Roddenberry beat Steve Jobs to that idea
by several decades.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.390
So next time you load up Candy Crush on your
Android or iPad, just remember to give credit

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.390
where it's due.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.730
More importantly, Star Trek: The Next Generation
carved a foothold for sci-fi shows at a time

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.320
when the genre was in a slump.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.829
It helped geek culture get break into the
mainstream and paved the way for shows like

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.840
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The X-Files, and
even Lost.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.450
Who knows, we might not have comic book blockbusters
like The Avengers if Star Trek hadn't made

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.260
it cool to be a nerd in the 80s and 90s.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.449
The X-Files

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:54.220
The X-Files might seem more like a benefactor
of Star Trek: The Next Generation�s influence

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.060
than an influence in itself.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.750
But The X-Files brought things a step further.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.220
It introduced niche concepts to a wide audience,
and made aliens, werewolves, and ghosts interesting

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.950
for people who otherwise didn't care about
the paranormal.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.870
The X-Files was also one of the earliest shows
to use the Internet to engage with fans.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.110
It's also where Breaking Bad creator Vince
Gilligan started his career.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.540
Plus, without the adventures of Scully and
Mulder, we�d probably be missing out on

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.630
shows like Supernatural and Bones.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.630
Seinfeld

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.910
Seinfeld took what people knew about sitcoms
and completely turned it inside out.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.140
The show that gave us Festivus, Pigman and
The Soup Nazi is somehow still relatable to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.160
our day-to-day lives.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.200
Seinfeld meddled with the sitcom�s traditional
A-plot/B-plot structure.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.290
It introduced audiences to the unlikeable
jerk as protagonists, it didn�t use multi-camera

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.669
set-ups, and it turned self-referentialism
into art.

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.570
From Girls to It�s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
to The Big Bang Theory, Seinfeld has been

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.820
copied but never cloned.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.180
Not too shabby for a show about nothing.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.350
Saturday Night Live

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.040
Saturday Night Live is a comic institution,
one that's been making names for four decades.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.040
Adam Sandler, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Tina
Fey, Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040
Eddie Murphy, Seth Meyers, Chris Rock, and
the list goes on.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.480
SNL�s influence expands beyond the stage,
too.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.520
A world without SNL would probably mean a
world without The Daily Show and The Colbert

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.520
Report.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.541
The show�s format has also been ripped off
by Mad TV, All That, and Mr. Show, and its

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:12.030
humor is echoed in Tina Fey�s 30 Rock.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.370
The Simpsons

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.790
The Simpsons has shaped just about every cartoon
that has aired since it started in 1989.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.540
Sure, cartoons were around before The Simpsons,
and people would have still made them without

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.010
The Simpsons, but Springfield�s first family
changed the game by showed that cartoons didn�t

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.570
just have to be for kids.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.970
Without The Simpsons there's no Family Guy
or American Dad, (and pretty much everything

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.150
Seth MacFarlane has ever done), as well as
South Park, King of the Hill, and The Critic

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.370
(which had a crossover with The Simpsons back
in 1995).

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.060
Live-action shows like Arrested Development
can also trace influence to Matt Groening�s

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.540
TV landmark.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.020
I Love Lucy

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.391
Seinfeld may have influenced the sitcoms of
today, but I Love Lucy gave birth to the sitcom

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.780
way back in the 1950s.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.451
Small things we take for granted - like reruns,
continuously running storylines, or the multi-cam

00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:03.320
set-up - didn�t exist until I Love Lucy
conjured them into being with a knowing wink.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.420
The show is also a major feminist milestone,
which is admirable because it aired during

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.870
a time when most viewers expected women to
be stay at home wives and mothers.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.860
At a glance I Love Lucy endorses those social
norms, but Lucy Ricardo speaks up and lets

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.960
her dreams be known to her husband, Ricky,
and defies him from one episode to the next.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.410
I Love Lucy may look dated today, but it was
totally progressive in its era.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.750
The Sopranos

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.150
There are a number of creative types who have
contributed to the renaissance we're seeing

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.590
on TV today, but one name rises above the
rest.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.270
David Chase was the architect of The Sopranos
back in the late 90s and he emerged as a champion

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.080
for bold, risky television.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.180
In the grand scheme of the TV history, The
Sopranos is a fairly young series, but it�s

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.770
already iconic and completely essential.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.430
Take away The Sopranos, and say goodbye to
HBO and other premium cable channels.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.390
It�s possible that the show�s influence
is so strong that competitors like Showtime

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:05.730
may not have produced Homeland and Shameless
without it.
