foundation we set up or I set up you you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180
foundation we set up or I set up you you
 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.850
foundation we set up or I set up you you
had to make a bet the way you think you

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860
had to make a bet the way you think you
 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.280
had to make a bet the way you think you
could really make a contribution but you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290
could really make a contribution but you
 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.660
could really make a contribution but you
could really build a depth understanding

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670
could really build a depth understanding
 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.430
could really build a depth understanding
so we were very clear from the day one

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440
so we were very clear from the day one
 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.070
so we were very clear from the day one
that we had to have a focus to is it had

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080
that we had to have a focus to is it had
 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.870
that we had to have a focus to is it had
to be a cause which was relevant to the

to be a cause which was relevant to the
country in terms of need a critical

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340
country in terms of need a critical
 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.850
country in terms of need a critical
course in terms of need were you saw a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860
course in terms of need were you saw a
 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.890
course in terms of need were you saw a
gap between what could be and what is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900
gap between what could be and what is
 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.520
gap between what could be and what is
and three it should be an area where it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530
and three it should be an area where it
 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.469
and three it should be an area where it
should have an access beyond just a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479
should have an access beyond just a
 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.109

specific educating of a child we

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119
specific educating of a child we
 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.699
specific educating of a child we
concluded that if we could educate

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709
concluded that if we could educate
 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.040
concluded that if we could educate
children better in our country you would

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050
children better in our country you would
 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.800
children better in our country you would
have better citizens but importantly we

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
have better citizens but importantly we
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.810
have better citizens but importantly we
also realized that if you educate the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820
also realized that if you educate the
 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.449
also realized that if you educate the
girl child when she grows up and starts

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459
girl child when she grows up and starts
 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.910
girl child when she grows up and starts
a family she has a smaller family which

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920
a family she has a smaller family which
 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.940
a family she has a smaller family which
is a refuge requirement in terms of the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950
is a refuge requirement in terms of the
 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.920
is a refuge requirement in terms of the
growth of our population which is more

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930
growth of our population which is more
 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.350
growth of our population which is more
manageable and three again if you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
manageable and three again if you
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.540
manageable and three again if you
educate the girl child when she grows up

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550
educate the girl child when she grows up
 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.120
educate the girl child when she grows up
and she starts a family or looks after a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
and she starts a family or looks after a
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.680
and she starts a family or looks after a
household she has much higher

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690
household she has much higher
 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.290
