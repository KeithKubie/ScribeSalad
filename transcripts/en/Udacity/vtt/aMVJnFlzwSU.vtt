00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.745
So, here is the resources directory from
a sample project created in an Android

00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:05.273
studio.

00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:09.724
There are some predefined
drawable folders for

00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:16.410
different screen densities such as mdpi,
hdpi, xhdpi, and xxhdpi.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.521
And if you remember that's 160,

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.106
240, 320, and 480.

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:28.260
Additionally, there's a drawable
folder with no qualifier.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.680
This is useful for
things like XML shapes.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.260
There's also a folder called
Drawable-nodpi which you can put in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.269
images that shouldn't scale based on
density, things like background images.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.219
If you remember from Android
fundamentals, there are also qualifiers

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.119
for user locale, screen width,
API level, and more.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:50.969
These can be applied to
any type of resource,

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.019
whether it'd be graphic assets,
layouts, or text strings and

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.850
style definitions that you would
put in your values folder.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.440
So you could customize a layout for
screens that are 600dp or wider.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.244
Or you could provide styles that
only apply to Lollipop devices,

00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:12.022
that's devices with API level 21 or
higher.

00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:15.823
And if you wanted to customize graphics
assets for specific languages,

00:01:15.823 --> 00:01:17.142
you could do that, too.

00:01:17.142 --> 00:01:22.050
Just remember to also specify
the density for those assets.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.100
Check the instructor's notes for
a link to developers.android.com and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.860
a listing of the accepted
resource identifiers.
