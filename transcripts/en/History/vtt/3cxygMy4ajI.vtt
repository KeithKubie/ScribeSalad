00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.710
All right bladesmiths,
there will be a strength test,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.040
a sharpness test.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.120
And up first, Doug
Marcaida's kill test.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.710
Doug.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.330
Bladesmiths, a Hanzo
katana's first duty is to kill.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.580
All right, Mike,
and you're up first.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.420
Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.750
Let's do this.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.210
[rock music playing]

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.750
Yes.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.330
Mike, your edge
is razor sharp.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.620
But more importantly,
there's bone on your edge,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.460
but your edge did not
roll, did not chip,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.710
and your blade stayed true.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.540
Overall, sir, your
blade will kill.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.380
Thank you.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.460
Tristan, you ready?

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.120
Yes, sir.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.960
Let's do this.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.920
[rock music playing]

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.750
Tah!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.420
All right, Tristan, the balance
of your blade is very good.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.330
It's light.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.420
It's fast.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.670
It's easily maneuverable.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.920
But when steel meets the skull,
there were some problems.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.790
Your blade took a serious bend.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.000
Also, on the edge right
here, it took some chipping.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But overall looking
at the dummy,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.920
I think your weapon
will definitely kill.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.540
Thank you.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.880
Gentlemen, the second
duty of a Hanzo katana

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.670
is that it is to be sharp.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.960
It is said that the Hanzo katana
is as sharp as a thousand razor

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.670
blades.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.040
Now, a sharp blade should cut
cleanly through tatami mats.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.210
A dull blade will crush,
bend, or get hung up.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.500
A dull blade is
not a Hanzo katana.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.040
Mike, you're up first.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.880
You ready for this?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.540
Yes, I'm ready.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.380
Let's do this.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.710
[rock music playing]

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.420
Your blade, sir, is sharp.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.000
It cut cleanly through the
thickest of our tatami mats.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.500
But on the backhand slice, it
did not cut completely though.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.080
Overall, sir, your
sword will cut.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.920
Thank you.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.880
Tristan, your turn.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880
You ready?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.830
Ready as I'll ever be, sir.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.750
Let's do this.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210
[gong]

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.000
[rock music playing]

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.250
[sighs]

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.120
Well, Tristan,
your edge is sharp.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.290
It can cut through tatami mats.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.920
My concern is the
strength of your blade.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.920
It picked up another bend.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.620
Now you have two
bends on your blade,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.790
especially right here
close to the guard.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.880
Tristan, this
Hollywood competition

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.250
has been exciting and dramatic.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.790
You've been at the epicenter
of all of that drama.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.710
Nobody is questioning the
strength of your character.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.120
However, the strength
of your blade

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.580
is such that we can no
longer continue to test it.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.250
And for that reason,
I have to ask

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.920
you to please leave the forge.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.620
Yes, sir.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.880
Good job.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.790
Guess I just
couldn't slip through.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.120
Second place isn't
bad for somebody

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.790
who's never done this before.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.500
Mike, you were an unstoppable
force in this competition,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.120
and your Hattori Hanzo
thousand-layer katana is

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.330
absolutely deadly, earning you
the title of "Forged in Fire"

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.750
champion and a
check for $10,000.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.120
Good job, brother.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.750
I came here to
show myself that I

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.460
can make a blade
worthy of undergoing

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.000
this type of punishment.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I am "Forged in Fire"
champion, and it feels awesome.
