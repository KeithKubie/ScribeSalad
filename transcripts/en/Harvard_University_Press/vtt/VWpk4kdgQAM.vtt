00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.980
In our cultural imagination about the Revolution, we have this idea that there has to have been

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.900
something democratic and republican about it.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.040
That it's a kind of republican and democratic revolt against the Ancien RÃ©gime

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.620
and monarchical power, and that is so powerful in our historical imagination.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.540
But these people--that is, not all of them, but a great many of them, and

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.930
certainly a great many of the most important ones--took themselves to be waging a rebellion

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.510
in favor of royal power. That is, they wanted more monarchy, rather than less.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.280
Their view was that Parliament was illicitly usurping the just prerogatives of the Crown,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.020
and that was their complaint. They took themselves to be waging a rebellion against a tyrannical legislature.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:52.720
By the time you get to the Declaration,
in July of '76, first of all, a number of things have changed on the ground.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.400
Word arrives in British America of the text of the King's speech in which he

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.820
he declares the colonies to be in rebellion, removes them from the royal protection.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.340
And, at this moment, there's a kind of trauma. So many British Americans

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.960
were putting all of their faith in the King, and looking to him to sort of revivify the English constitution,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.399
defend their liberties. And, in a sense, one of the ironies of the Declaration--

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.399
since it's so often taken as this great statement of American anti-monarchism at this point--

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.980
is that, in a way, it's the final and most eloquent testimony to the power of this

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.660
sort of "neo-Stuart" theory of the empire.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.500
The word "Parliament" doesn't appear in the Declaration of Independence.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.340
The Declaration focuses on the King because in the constitutional and sort of juridical imagination

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.120
of the patriots at this period, it's only the King who wields legitimate authority over America.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.180
Once the debate is over--that is, once independence comes--

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.920
the very same people who get into print most prominently in the 1770s,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.540
defending this heavily royalist conception of the British monarchy, and the imperial constitution,

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.730
and the royal prerogative, don't change their minds. And exactly this same cast of characters

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.060
are defending sweeping executive power and become the chief advocates for the new constitution--

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.880
and it's chief architects--in the 1780s. And they themselves highlighted the continuity in their thought:

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.960
they're going to create a monarch of a kind, who is not a King, but who is given more prerogative power

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.460
than any English monarch had wielded since the defeat of the royalist cause.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.660
We tend to think of the presidency as sort of "monarchy lite," but in the context of the 18th century--

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.420
as people understood perfectly well at the time--it was the reverse: it was "monarchy plus."

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:01.160
That is, it was taking all of these prerogative powers that no English monarch had wielded for generations,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.400
and locating them, assigning them, to this new chief magistrate.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.060
