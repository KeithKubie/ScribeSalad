00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.310
I always had a passion for
understanding the Earth system.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.759
So I always read
about it on my own.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.300
When you watch the
Discovery Channel,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.682
and you see people on these
big expeditions and stuff,

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.140
and you always
think that it almost

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.970
feels only like a dream to you.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.910
She actually got
back just this summer

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.070
from deploying our floats
into the southern ocean

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.360
on a cruise between Sydney,
Australia and Papeete, Tahiti.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.760
And I'll tell you, the float
was bigger than she was,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.010
but she muscled it
into the water anyway.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.380
Totally awesome.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.480
I'm so proud of them,
I can't tell you.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.570
It's been so rewarding to be
part of these big projects

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.000
studying our ocean and studying
our planet, that as a kid,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.210
I used to just dream
about, in a sense,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.030
of being part of those things.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.490
And it's been really rewarding
working with a Joellen,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.780
because with her
connections, she was

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.310
able to get me on that ship.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.470
So having that
experience-- being

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.580
out on a boat for 46 days
in the middle of nowhere,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.660
12 hours a day, through
sun, through storms,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.210
through everything,
experiencing the ocean

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.270
and studying it--
it's just extremely

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.310
rewarding and exciting
to be a part of.
