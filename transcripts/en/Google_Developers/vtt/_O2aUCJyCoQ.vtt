WESLEY CHUN:
Greetings, developers.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.360
As you know, images are a
necessity in any presentation.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.000
But if you stop to think about
it, text is also important.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Because there's less text in a
slide deck compared to images,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.942
any text that you do
have has higher impact.

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:19.400
Hi, this is Wesley Chun, your
friendly neighborhood G Suite

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.540
developer advocate.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.240
Today I'll be showing you how to
format that very important text

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.280
using the Google Slides API.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.620
One, perhaps surprising,
thing about Google Slides

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.770
is that reading is
different from writing text.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.050
What I mean by that is
when you read slides,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.810
you see how the text
is formatted and stored

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.770
internally.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.380
But when you write text, you
just provide the raw copy

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.820
and where to write it to.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.110
Make sense?

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.520
Furthermore, writing text is
different from formatting it.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.110
When you format text,
you need to know

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.820
something about its
internal structure

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.980
as well as styling
requests, neither of which

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.470
were really required when
you're just writing it.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.860
In this sense, formatting
text is more like reading it.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.910
Think of it this way.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.030
Reading isn't going to be what
you can do the most with text

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.050
in slide decks.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.320
Rather, you focus on
writing and formatting it.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.750
And those are designed
to be similar operations

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.630
that you would do in the
Slides user interface.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.520
When you enter or
write text, you're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.390
just typing without formatting.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.020
And that's something you
would do typically afterwards.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.462
All right, let's see
how to do all three.

00:01:20.462 --> 00:01:22.170
Writing text is the
most straightforward,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.660
so we'll start with that.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.570
To insert text, send
and insert text requests

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.970
to the presentation's
.batch update method,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.180
providing both the raw text plus
the object to write that text

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.560
into.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.600
In addition to text
boxes, you can write text

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.720
into any shape,
even the weird ones.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.310
Where else can you
write text into?

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.320
Table cells.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.090
Well, to do that, you must
provide the text like normal

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.050
but also specify
the cell location,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.110
meaning row and column.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.930
And whether you write into
a shape or a table cell,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.000
the insertion index
defaults to zero,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.120
unless you want that text
inserted into another location.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.420
And if so, you need
to provide that index.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.610
What else can you do with
text besides writing it?

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.400
Well, you can delete text,
perform a global search

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.570
and replace.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.580
But you can also
update text formatting

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.521
as well as update the
bullet style for paragraphs.

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:12.020
Delete and search
and replace should

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.500
be fairly straightforward.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500
So today's video is all
about text formatting,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.337
so we'll focus on
the latter pair.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.920
Before we get started
with formatting,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.215
you need to know something
about the structure of text

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:22.670
in a presentation.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.890
While writing text doesn't
expose you to this,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.570
reading will.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.390
If you read a slide
using presentations.get

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.800
a peek at your
slides will reveal

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.130
something that may look
like this for a text box.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.770
The text elements include
both a paragraph marker,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.930
like bullet glyphs and
alignment, as well as

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.930
the actual text copy
and current styling.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.170
Formatting text involves using
the update tech style request,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.450
where you pass in the ID
of the shape containing

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.450
the affected text, the
styling changes to make,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.460
which range of text
should be updated,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.640
and which field should be
affected by this request.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.730
Adding bullets is similar,
using the createParagraphBullets

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.980
request.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.270
We'll take a look at both
request types in our code

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.076
sample.

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:06.450
Now, be sure to have the latest
client library installed,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.420
whether it's in Python or
in your favorite language.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.660
Also make sure to have created
a project in the dev console

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.610
with the Slides API enabled.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.730
We recommend you also review
the text structure and styling

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.129
concept guide for background
before proceeding.

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.920
If you're all set,
let's go to the computer

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.200
and look at some
formatting code.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.150
We'll start with
lines 1 through 13,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.730
which are your standard imports
and boilerplate authorization

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.190
code, except for what we
need for this application,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.950
meaning the read-write
scope for slides on line 7

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.920
and creation of the service
endpoint on line 13.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.220
Lines 15 to 21 is where we
create a brand new slide

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.490
deck with presentations.create.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.530
From the API response, grab
the presentation ID along

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.810
with the IDs for the
title and subtitle,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.510
text boxes on the front page.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.160
Most commands are
sent to the API

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.860
by calling
presentations.batchupdate.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.000
And lines 23 to 31 are where
we build and send the requests

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.970
to create a new slide
with the main point layout

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.270
and also add the main
title and subtitle text.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.600
Since createSlide was the
first command in the array,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.960
grab the new slide ID
at index 0 on line 31,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.050
ignoring the responses for
the insert text commands.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.140
Main point layout slides
have one giant text box.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.460
And on lines 33 to 36 we
use presentations.pages.get

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.872
to fetch that ID.

00:04:24.872 --> 00:04:26.580
This is the command
that you'd use to get

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.230
all the objects on any slide.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.200
And since there's only one thing
on this slide, the text box,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.320
grab it at index 0 on line 36.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.540
Lines 38 to 44 is where
we start putting together

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.110
the text formatting commands,
starting with inserting six

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.690
paragraphs into the text box.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.780
The main point text box
default font size is 48.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.860
And on lines 45 to 51,
we shrink it down to 32.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.850
A text range of all means to
shrink the entire text box.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.970
In future requests, we'll use
more specific text ranges,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.800
starting with bolding
the first word

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.110
in the first paragraph
which is at index 0

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.690
through 3 on lines 52 to 58.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.090
Note, the end index is excluded.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.590
That's why it's 4.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.660
Bolding is done by
setting its style

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.960
and using fields to only affect
the bold style and nothing

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.530
else, meaning leave the font
color, type, and size alone.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.250
Lines 59 to 65 is identical
to the bold request

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.400
but italicize the first word in
the second paragraph instead,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.680
which is at indexes 7 to 10.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.800
66 to 72 is where we
change the first word

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.190
in the last paragraph to a
mono-spaced font, specifically

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.390
Courier New.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.710
Lines 73 to 77 add bullets
to begin all paragraphs

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.720
in the entire text range.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.690
The last few lines just
send the commands to the API

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.720
and lets the user know
that everything's done.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.090
Let's run it and
see what we get.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.950
We'll see the output as
the API requests are made.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.520
And then we're going to
confirm, after it's done,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.690
that the new slide deck
was created-- ta-da.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.500
You see it appear here
in the Drive folder,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.680
where we'll open it up.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.320
There's the title slide.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.690
And boom, here's our fancy
formatted second slide.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.880
Wasn't that awesome?

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.820
Now you know how to read,
write, and format text

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.710
in Google Slides presentations.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.480
All it takes is knowing
the right request

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.090
to send to the API,
like the text formatting

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.590
ones you see here.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.850
Where can you go now?

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.040
Well, if you're brand
new to the Slides API,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.380
check out the overview
introducing you to the concepts

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.760
you need to know.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.980
One of the keys to
successfully using the API

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.290
is to understand its requests.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.270
The common operations
and API samples

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.655
docs pages are a great resource
to gaining this knowledge.

00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:37.030
And if you want to dive straight
into the reference docs,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.190
the last link will
take you there.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.590
Now, we can all agree that
presentations are generally

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.260
focused on imparting
ideas through images.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.450
Since there's less
text, any that you do

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.620
have must be more meaningful.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.190
Well, thanks for joining us
into this intro to text format

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.080
and with Google Slides API.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.450
Now you can format that
all-important text,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.847
increasing its impact
in your presentations.

00:06:57.847 --> 00:06:59.680

This is Wesley Chun from Google.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.656
And we'll see you
around in the G Suite.

00:07:07.976 --> 00:07:09.110
Hey, everyone.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.100
Thanks for watching.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.440
Check out these related videos.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.710
And we'll see you next time.
