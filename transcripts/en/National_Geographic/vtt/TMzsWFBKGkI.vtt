00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:03.569
<i> We called this talk
 "The Making of Meru"</i>

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.073
<i> to try to give you
 guys some insight on how</i>

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.908
<i> a story like this,
 you know</i>

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:12.311
<i>a climb like this of rather
epic, historic proportions</i>

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.082 line:0%
can be translated into a
film for a general audience

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.684 line:0%
that may have absolutely
no knowledge of climbing.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:22.155
I started working
on this project

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.024
<i>not really thinking about
making a feature documentary.</i>

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:28.694 line:0%
It was really just about
shooting for posterity.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.464
<i>And when I finally had a chance</i>

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:35.001
<i> to watch what Jimmy had
 sent me, I was just</i>

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.471
struck this material, I'd never
seen anything like it before.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.106
<i> And what was so special
 about this material</i>

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:44.710
<i>is unique to Jimmy and Renan
and their particular skill-set</i>

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.712
<i> where they are
 professional climbers</i>

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:49.249
<i>and also professional shooters.</i>

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.384
<i> And it was just...</i>

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:56.389
<i>like, how visceral the footage
was, how authentic it was</i>

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.358
<i> really moved me.</i>

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.794
<i> The shooting on it
 was certainly</i>

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:04.763
<i> one of the obvious
 great challenges.</i>

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.700
<i> Some expeditions are
really based on the production</i>

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.635
<i> where the
 production kind of</i>

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.704
<i> almost finances or
 funds the trip</i>

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:16.409
<i>and it's really about shooting
and coming back with a story.</i>

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.212
<i>This climb was the opposite.</i>

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:23.182
This climb was about the climb,
it wasn't about the shooting.

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:26.252
And you approach it
very differently.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.687
We had, you know,
400 yaks and

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.190
a huge team when we went
to Everest to shoot

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.491
"The Wildest Dream".

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:35.428
And on this climb
it was Renan and I

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.465
shouldering each a small
camera, and so...

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:43.302
<i> it really made it kind
of the ultimate challenge</i>

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:47.806
<i>as kind of a filmmaker for...
expedition shooting, so...</i>

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.743
<i> there's a ton of
 shots that we missed</i>

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:53.846
<i> and I try not to dwell
 on those too much but</i>

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:55.448
( audience laughter )

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:56.749
<i> And, you know</i>

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.651
<i> in the documentary world
 if you didn't get it</i>

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.386
<i> it didn't happen, so...</i>

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.855
<i> you know, then you're
 juggling that pressure.</i>

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.391
<i> I mean, just a zillion
details here that, you know</i>

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.260
they're not backing
up their footage

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.029
they're bringing a
finite amount of cards

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.364
up on the mountain, alright

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:12.264
they have no batt--

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.467
like no way to charge
their batteries.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.670
And so, weight is a real issue

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.005
but I can't, you know,
as a documentary filmmaker

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.743
I can't conceive of not being
able to back-up my footage.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:26.645
And not-- and having a
finite amount of tape.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:29.382
So, it just charges these shots

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:31.817
I mean--
it's a lot of pressure

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:33.052
and that's one of
the things that makes

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.988
the footage just so special.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.557
A lot of the rules of
shooting go out the window.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.326
Like, you're supposed to have a
head and a tail to every shot.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.229
You know, so that there's
five seconds in front of it

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.730
in the beginning of the shot

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.899
and there's five or ten seconds
at the end of the shot

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.034
so the editor has
some space to cut.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.670
But our shots don't
have heads and tails.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.640
And when you watch it,
you know the...

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.542
it all-- 'cause you have
to hold your breath

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:57.677
when you're shooting up there

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.345
and it's really hard to
hold your breath up there.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.347
So, all the heads and
tails go like this...

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.782
( inhales deeply )

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.750
( audience laughter )

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.552
And then the end of
the shot is like...

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:07.520
( exhales )

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.654
( audience laughter )

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:11.457
And they're like only 15
seconds long, this is no joke.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:12.691
I mean,
we'd sit in the edit room

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:14.193
we'd be like there must be more.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:15.695
( audience laughter )

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.996
There must be more.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.631
You know, like, we... it...

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.199
I don't know, it was...

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.036
It posed this, you had these
like kind of jewels of footage

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:27.407
yet with some very real-like
narrative constraints around it

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.275
where there just
wasn't that much.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.710
No, it was classic because we'd
be sitting in the editing room

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.679
and everybody would be
glued to the screen

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.348
and we'd be watching this clip

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:36.916
and it'd be like this great,
great clip

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.519
and everybody is excited
and then it would end

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:42.088
and then everybody
would look at me.

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:43.589
( audience laughter )

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:47.660
And I'd be like, "Well, let
me explain something to you.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.997
We're at 20,000 feet, I'm
like trying to stack the rope

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:52.965
because Conrad's basically
starting to get to the point

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.500
where like,
"You're still shooting?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.202
You should be stacking the rope.

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:59.004
You should be
re-racking the gear."

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.074
But that's hard to
explain to your editor

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.308
when you're trying
to make a film.
