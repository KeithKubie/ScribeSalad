1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,640
It's so, you know, you know,
you do Jujitsu, it's fun.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,450
So everybody wants to just slap hands,
punching knuckles and start rolling. Yeah,

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,530
it's fun. It's fun. It's like a fun game
you're doing. It's a good release. Yeah.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,060
But the best way to get better
at it is to constantly drill.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,920
And then you develop these pathways that
are just ingrained in your subconscious.

6
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,200
And so when you're in
that half guard position,

7
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:25,290
you immediately go for that under
hook immediately. You know the path,

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,680
you know where to go instead of ad
libbing and thinking while you're in the

9
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,520
middle of a role.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,600
And when you see guys that come
from camps where they don't drill,

11
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,520
they only do like one technique
at the beginning of the class,

12
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,810
you'll notice a technical deficiency as
opposed to like someone who comes from

13
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:43,500
Hixson school or someone who comes from
a school that's very technical or you

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,740
know, the Mendez brothers or
something. You know, it's just,

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,150
it's so important to look at this,
look at the sport,

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,480
whether it's MMA or kickboxing or Jujitsu,
whatever it is,

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,090
but to look at it like a,
like a puzzle,

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,830
like you're trying to figure out what's
the best way to solve this and you know

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,600
what Duane is done for you.

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,290
It's been pretty remarkable as far as
like giving you footwork skills and tools

21
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,760
to move around and angles and I,
you know,

22
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:13,920
I've watched you guys dry
drill and train together.

23
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,620
I mean it's really amazing stuff.
Yeah.

24
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,680
Stuff that we think is simple and then
we'd go and teach it to the gym and

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,840
they're like, wait, what? Can you
guys do that like 10 more times?

26
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:24,480
When you see that again, it's
like, oh right. All right.

27
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:27,450
So we've just been doing like the full
work I've created with Dwayne the,

28
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:29,520
he wasn't a full word guy when he fought.

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
He was trained that crunchies are
natives and then like he's the one that's

30
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:35,310
creating all these angles with me and
now we've created a whole new style.

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,080
It's so funny that he saw that kind of
while he was fighting and then after he

32
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,770
was fighting, he's implementing and on
new fighters and didn't do it himself.

33
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,270
And he laughs about it. Yeah. He,

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,420
he wishes he probably would
have had someone like himself.

35
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:52,730
Coach him obviously walked in for
sure. Yeah, everybody does. Yeah.

36
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,160
He's a fucking wizard man. Yes. Cause he
didn't stop thinking about it either to,

37
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,990
he's like the same Kalvia for strike.

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,460
I'ms I'm telling you like I have all
the best coaches in the world around me.

39
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,500
Like he's like same Kalvia
of striking and MMA. Um,

40
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,800
and I'm trying to convince him to come
to southern California and started

41
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:11,430
professional fight team so that we can
help recreate what we do for everyone

42
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,470
because trying to get them to move out
here, but he loves Colorado. He does.

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,280
But he also loves being the best
coach in the world. Any anyhow,

44
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,230
so I'm hoping that I can convince him
enough that he, he'll do that. You know,

45
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:25,710
closely think you are to convince them.
I think I'm close.

46
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,720
[inaudible] I know you're, listen brother,
I know you want to come to California.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,680
I've never seen anybody with this
detailed, um, uh, an instruction manual,

48
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:38,040
like the way he breaks down his
system, no matter for striking. I mean,

49
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,910
it's really remarkable. Even when
he comes into here to talk to you,

50
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,550
he'll have a system that you need to
tell him what he wants to talk about,

51
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,220
what he wants to do.
Like the guy doesn't stop thinking he is,

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,880
he's on top of his stuff. He's OCD in
a good way. Yeah. And the best way,

53
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,880
the best way. Absolutely. Well, it's like
you were saying about being competitive.

54
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,680
I mean,
I think it's you,

55
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,440
the idea that you're going to be this
balance chilled out person and still be a

56
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:01,930
fucking world.
Smasher good luck with that.

57
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,450
I'm the farthest thing from relaxed and
chill, you know, I tried to learn it now,

58
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,060
but yeah, but when you're
training and when you look you,

59
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,180
there's a mindset that's required to
beat the best guys and it's not the same

60
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,670
mindset that's required
to get good to get,

61
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,550
you could get good and be a chilled out,
relaxed person.

62
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,730
Like say you want to be a black belt
in Jujitsu, that's totally possible.

63
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,550
You can be really good people
and go, Hey, look at Mike Mann.

64
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,550
Mike has got a great triangle. Watch
them roll. Wow, he's really good.

65
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,480
But if Mike wants to be the motherfucker
have motherfuckers, you better be crazy.

66
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,310
You know,
you better be God damn crazy.

67
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:36,430
You better be like Mike Tyson when he
was young and be those Michael Jordan's

68
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:39,640
yet talking about, they're always thinking
about it. [inaudible] Jones Jr yes.

69
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,120
All of those guys. You've got to be
a fucking crazy person. Absolutely.

70
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,990
Everyone's Roy Jones Jr
played a professional
basketball game the day of his

71
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,900
fight. Played a guy named basketball
games do and he's just an athlete. Yeah.

72
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,140
Yeah. I mean, I just don't think
there's any other way, you know? I mean,

73
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:59,830
I think if you're going to win a race,
you're going to red line the engine.
