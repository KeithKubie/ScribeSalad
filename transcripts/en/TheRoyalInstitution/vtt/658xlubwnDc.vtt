00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.750
Thank you to all of
you for coming along.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.300
Now as Tom mentioned, I'm
researcher at the London School

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.460
of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine where

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.440
I specialise in mathematical
models of infectious disease.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.400
So on the face of it, my job
couldn't be further really

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.410
from the world of
casinos and playing

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.060
cards and plastic chips.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.180
But really science
and gambling have

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.381
incredibly intertwined
relationship,

00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:33.630
a really longstanding history.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.110
And that's what I want to
talk about this evening.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.850
And seeing as I'm
talking about gambling,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.270
I thought I would start with an
example of how not to gamble.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.500
So this is a story--

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.166
story from a few years ago.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.790
And as you can probably
notice, there's

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.090
two large flaws with
this lady's strategy.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.680
The first is it's
completely illegal.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.102
And the second is it
clearly doesn't work.

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:01.560
And the reason I
wanted to show you

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.140
this is I think when
we talk about people

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.117
taming chance and
beating the system,

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:09.450
typically these are two themes
that crop up quite a lot.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.570
You either have them doing
something a bit dodgy.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.220
Or you have them
presenting a system

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.510
which clearly isn't going to
do something very successful.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.170
And what I want
to do this evening

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.510
is take a look at
a third approach.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.570
Take a look at some of the
ways in which mathematicians

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.150
or scientists have
taken on games of chance

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.071
and used their techniques to
get an edge over the house.

00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:32.070
I also want to look at
how the ideas have flowed

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.194
the other way, how actually
games and gambling have

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.880
inspired many
ideas which are now

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.342
fundamental to modern
maths and science.

00:01:40.342 --> 00:01:42.300
And really lotteries, I
think, are a good place

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.750
to start, because for me, it
was a story about lotteries

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.230
that first got me interested
in the mathematics of betting.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.270
As I'm sure any of you
who've played the lottery

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.228
or have thought about
playing lottery will know

00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:55.320
it's incredibly
difficult to win.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.000
But actually, even
the way we measure

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.240
how difficult it is to win is
a fairly recent development.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.630
Although maths is-- has
been around for millennia.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.480
The idea of how
we quantify luck,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.759
how we quantify random events,
is a relatively recent one.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.189
It was one that was developed
in the 16th century.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.730
And it was actually
in Veneto, Italy.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.940
There was a Italian
called Gerolamo Cardano.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.680
He was a physician.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.130
As a doctor, he was the first to
describe the clinical symptoms

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.810
of typhoid.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.830
He was also a gambler.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.665
And as a gambler, he was the
first to describe such games

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:29.290
mathematically.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.500
And he actually outlined
what's known as a sample space.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.426
So this is the--

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.550
all of the combinations of
events that could occur.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.250
And obviously, if you're only
interested in one of those,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.420
that gives you a sense of
how difficult it is to win.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.410
Now for the UK National
Lottery as it stands,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.280
you have to pick six numbers
from a possible set of 59.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.240
So this results in just over 45
million possible combinations

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.797
of you-- of numbers you could
pick if you bought a card.

00:02:53.797 --> 00:02:55.380
Clearly this makes
life very difficult

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.957
for you to win the jackpot.

00:02:56.957 --> 00:02:59.040
But there is a way that
you can guarantee you will

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.780
win the lottery this weekend.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.620
And that is quite simply to
buy up every single combination

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.320
of numbers.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.260
Now that might sound
a little bit absurd.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.810
But let's just run
with it for a moment.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.600
As I said, there's 45
million combinations

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.890
of tickets for the UK lottery.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.924
So if you were to buy up every
single possible combination

00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:18.840
and line them up end-to-end,
it would actually

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.966
stretch from London to Dubai.

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:23.590
What's more, each
ticket cost 2 pounds.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.160
So if you really want to win
the jackpot this weekend,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.690
it's going to cost about 90
million pounds to achieve.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.570
Clearly that's not
a feasible strategy.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.330
But not all lotteries
are the same.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.730
In the 1990s, for example,
the Irish National Lottery

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.260
had a much smaller
sample space--

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.810
a much smaller possible
combination of numbers

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.660
that could come up.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.430
In fact, there were about
1.94 million combinations.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.260
Each ticket costs 50p.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.110
So as a result, it would cost
you less than a million pounds

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.720
to buy up every
single combination.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.830
And actually a syndicate
headed up by an accountant

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.430
got thinking about this.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.250
And clearly most weeks, this
is a pretty poor investment,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.180
because the jackpot would be
maybe a few hundred thousand.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.804
And if you're spending
almost a million

00:04:02.804 --> 00:04:04.470
to win a few hundred
thousand, doesn't

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.940
take much to spot that's
a pretty bad investment.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.150
But if a rollover
were to come around,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.400
maybe this could be plausible.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.990
And actually rather
than stretching it

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.631
to Dubai, if you lined
up all of these tickets

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:17.089
and the combinations
end-to-end, it

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.309
would actually stretch
from London to Plymouth.

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.350
So you've got something
that's a bit more doable.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.510
And what they started to do is
collect together these tickets

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.154
and fill each one out by
hand to get every single one

00:04:28.154 --> 00:04:29.070
of these combinations.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.945
And then they waited.

00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:32.280
They waited for about six
months until the May Bank

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.740
Holiday in 1992 when the
rollover hit 2.2 million.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.240
And they put their
plan into action.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.656
They took all these
tickets they'd

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:41.640
filled out, started taking them
to shops, and buying them up.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.855
And in many cases this
raised some attention.

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:46.230
So shops that would usually
sale maybe a thousand tickets

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.495
in a week were suddenly
selling 15,000.

00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:52.950
The Lottery perhaps expectantly,
frowned upon this a little bit

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.285
and tried to stop them.

00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:57.300
And as a result, when the
lottery draw came around,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.000
they'd only bought 80% of
the possible combinations

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.610
of tickets.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.943
So there's still an element
of luck as to whether they'd

00:05:02.943 --> 00:05:04.050
win the jackpot.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.372
Fortunately for them,
that jackpot's winning set

00:05:07.372 --> 00:05:08.955
of numbers was within
the combinations

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:09.910
that they bought up.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.590
So they won that week.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.475
Unfortunately, there were
two other winners that week.

00:05:15.475 --> 00:05:16.850
So they had to
split the jackpot.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.950
But when you added up all
those lower tier prizes

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.590
that they match five numbers,
four numbers as well,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.415
they walked away with a
profit of 300,000 pounds.

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:26.290
Now for me, years ago
when I heard the story,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.873
that was just a
fantastic illustration

00:05:27.873 --> 00:05:31.570
of how you can take a pretty
simple mathematical insight,

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.030
a good dose of
audacity and hard work,

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.750
and convert it into
something that's profitable.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.780
And this isn't the only
instance that people have

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.630
targeted these kind of games.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.690
For the UK lottery,
the draw is random.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.050
So really the only way
you can guarantee a win

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.780
is to use this brute force
approach by simply buying up

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.920
all of the combinations.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.200
But not all lotteries
are the same.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.240
Take scratchcards, for example.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.240
On the face of it, scratchcards
are completely random.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.570
If you think about it, they
can't be completely random.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.510
Because if you're
producing scratchcards,

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.077
and you just randomly
generate which

00:06:06.077 --> 00:06:07.660
cards are going to
be winners, there's

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.030
a chance that by
sheer chance you will

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.510
produce too many winning cards.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.560
If you're a company
making scratchcards,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.860
you want some way of
controlling and limiting

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.540
which prizes go out.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.420
As statisticians will call it,
you need controlled randomness.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.614
You want the prizes to be fairly
uniformly, evenly distributed

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:23.530
amongst the occasions.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.590
But you don't want
the generation

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.590
to be completely random.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.180
And actually in
2003, a statistician

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.317
called Mohan Srivastava was
thinking about scratchcards.

00:06:33.317 --> 00:06:34.900
He'd been given some
as a joke present

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.660
and was wondering on this
idea of controlled randomness.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.180
And he realised there must
be some way for the lottery

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.420
to identify which cards
were winners without having

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.770
to scratch them off.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.140
On each card there were
a series of digits.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.140
And some of these would
appear two times, three times.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.280
But some numbers and symbols
only appeared once on the card.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.910
And actually if these unique
numbers appeared in a row,

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.536
that card was always a winner.

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:00.910
And he went and
bought more cards

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.260
and tested out his strategy.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.900
And every single time, the cards
that had these numbers in a row

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.524
were guaranteed winners.

00:07:07.524 --> 00:07:09.190
Now what would you
do in this situation?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.747
You've essentially
cracked scratchcards.

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:13.330
You've got a system
which can identify

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.038
the winning ones and
the not winning ones

00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:16.150
just by looking at them.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.990
Would you go out and buy tonnes?

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.170
What would you do?

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.200
Well, think back to that slide
that I showed you at the start.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.020
Winning scratchcards
are remarkably rare.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.240
And actually what Mohan
did, rather than just

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.280
going on a huge
scratchcard buying spree,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.629
was work out how long it would
take him to buy up enough cards

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:32.920
and guarantee himself a winner.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.350
And he was a statistician
working on geological problems

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.067
earning pretty decent money.

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:39.400
And he realised that actually,
although he had a winning

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.100
lottery strategy, it was
better off just to stick in his

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.660
existing job.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.580
So what he did was he
rang up the lottery

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.930
and told them that
there was a hidden code

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.930
on their scratchcards,
and he had deciphered it,

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.380
and he knew how to win.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.100
The lottery, of course,
didn't take him seriously.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.450
So what he did was actually
collected the scratchcards.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.750
And he identified some winning
ones, some losing ones,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.541
divided them into two
piles and posted them

00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:02.522
by courier to lottery.

00:08:02.522 --> 00:08:04.730
That evening he got a phone
call from lottery saying,

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:05.688
we need to have a chat.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.470
And really the story
is representative

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.740
of a lot of areas of gambling.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.240
Often it's not
professional gamblers

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.320
who come up with
these strategies that

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.329
beat the system.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.870
And often people
who beat the system,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.430
don't become
professional gamblers.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.320
For a lot of these
people, gambling

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.850
is almost a
playground for ideas.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.914
It's a way of testing out
problem solving and skills that

00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:27.830
actually would apply to
many other industries.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.510
People who have
tried these problems

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.490
are moving into academia,
into finance, into business.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.049
And as I mentioned with Cardano,
this isn't a new phenomenon.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.498
Really throughout history,
many of the great thinkers

00:08:38.498 --> 00:08:40.039
and mathematicians
have used gambling

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.770
as a way of refining
their ideas.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.750
In around 1900, a
French mathematician

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.670
called Henri Poincare was
particularly interested

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.170
in gambling.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.520
Now Poincare was one of the--

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.103
what's know as the
last universalists.

00:08:51.103 --> 00:08:53.660
As a mathematician, he
was one of the last people

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.272
to specialise in almost
every area of the subject

00:08:56.272 --> 00:08:57.230
as existed at the time.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.510
It hadn't expanded
to the point where

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.190
it was as large as it is today.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.940
And one of the things
he was interested in

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.770
was predictability.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.070
And to him, unexpected
events, unexpected outcomes

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.180
were the result of ignorance.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.890
He thought if something
is unexpected,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.350
it's because we're
ignorant of the causes.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.680
And he classed these
problems by what he called

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.960
the three levels of ignorance.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.484
The top level was
a situation where

00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:21.650
we know what the rules are,
we have the information,

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.441
we just have to do some
basic calculations.

00:09:23.441 --> 00:09:26.060
So if you've got, say,
a school physics exam,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.120
you know what the
physical laws are.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.340
You're given the information.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.452
So in theory, you should be
able to get the right answer.

00:09:32.452 --> 00:09:34.160
If your answer is
surprising, then you've

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.660
done something wrong
in the working.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.820
But it's not a kind of
difficult level of ignorance

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.655
to escape, in theory.

00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:41.780
The second level of ignorance
according to Poincare

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.530
was one where you know
what the rules are,

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.040
but you lack the information
necessary to carry out

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.810
the calculations accurately.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.370
And he used roulette
as an example.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.767
So a roulette table, you start
a ball spinning round and round.

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:55.100
And he observed a very small
change in the initial speed

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.040
of the ball could have a
very dramatic effect on where

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.540
it ends up, because
it's going to be

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.090
circling this table over time.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.570
And nowadays
mathematicians refer

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.620
to this as sensitive dependence
on initial conditions.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.080
And popularly it's known
as the butterfly effect.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.510
There's a talk in the '70s
where a physicist pointed out

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.760
that a butterfly flapping
its wings in Brazil

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.030
could cause or perhaps
prevent a tornado in Texas.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.940
These very small changes,
which Poincare first observed,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.010
could have a very
large effect later on.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.990
And then we'll say that
the results is random.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.823
It's down to chance.

00:10:24.823 --> 00:10:27.832
But really, it's a
problem of information.

00:10:27.832 --> 00:10:29.540
Then comes the third
degree of ignorance.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.920
And this is where we
don't know the rules.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.510
Or perhaps they're
so complex, we'll

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.801
never be able to untangle them.

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:36.630
And in this situation,
all we can do is watch.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.560
Watch over time and try
and gain some understanding

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.636
of what we're observing.

00:10:40.636 --> 00:10:42.260
And it's really this
level of ignorance

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.470
when gamblers started targeting
roulette that they focused on.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.985
They didn't try and untangle
all of these physical laws.

00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:50.360
They just said, well, let's
just watch a load of roulette

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.700
spins at a table and
see if there's a bias.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.850
See if there's something odd
going on with this table.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.350
But this raises the
question of what

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.760
do we actually mean by odd.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.160
What do we mean by biassed?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.530
And while Poincare was thinking
about roulette in France,

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.690
on the other side
of the channel,

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.610
a mathematician called
Karl Pearson was also

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.500
thinking about roulette.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.850
And Pearson was fascinated
by random events.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.950
As he said, we can't have any
true sense of what nature does.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.290
We can only observe and
try and make inferences

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.540
on those observations.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.037
And he's really keen to
collect random data to test out

00:11:23.037 --> 00:11:23.870
these kind of ideas.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.360
On one occasion he spent his
summer holiday flipping a coin

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.746
25,000 times to generate
a data set to analyse.

00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:33.370
And he was also
interested in roulette.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.030
Now fortunately for
him at the time,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.469
the Le Monaco
newspaper would publish

00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:40.010
the results of all
the roulette spins

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.080
in the casinos at Monte Carlo.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.960
Now for Pearson this is
a fantastic data set.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.960
He wants to test out his
ideas about randomness.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.720
You've got all these
previous roulette

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.336
spins to test it out on.

00:11:49.336 --> 00:11:51.710
And he started looking at ways
to understand whether they

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.760
were random or not.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.385
And a roulette table,
of course, you've

00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:56.189
got these black and red numbers.

00:11:56.189 --> 00:11:57.230
And then you've got zero.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.270
If you take out
the zero, over time

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.950
you'd expect the proportion
of black and red to be even.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.950
You'd expect it to
be 50/50 over time.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.680
And when Pearson
looked at the data,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.980
he found that red came
up 50.15% of the time.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.810
This was over
about 16,000 spins.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.501
So according to his calculation,
this wasn't that implausible,

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.000
that actually that
kind of deviation

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.370
from the expected value
is reasonable given

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.290
the kind of data set he had.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.220
But then he continued.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.980
And he looked, for instance,
at how often pairs of numbers

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.940
appear.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.520
Now if you've got a random
process at roulette table,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.386
sometimes you'd expect there to
be a string of the same colour

00:12:31.386 --> 00:12:32.510
appearing purely by chance.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.593
You might get a few reds
coming up-- a few blacks.

00:12:34.593 --> 00:12:38.000
But what Pearson found was that
the number switched too often,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.250
that actually you didn't get
these strings of the same

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.240
colour appearing as often
as you might expect.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.281
They were switching over.

00:12:43.281 --> 00:12:46.210
And to him this was
pretty definitive evidence

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.470
that the tables were corrupt,
that they were biassed.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.800
And as he puts it, if I had
been observing these tables

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.110
since the start of
geological time on Earth,

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.380
I would not have expected to
see a result that extreme.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.960
And he actually suggested that
they close down the casinos

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.470
and donate the
proceeds to science.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.292
As it happened there was
something a little bit more

00:13:05.292 --> 00:13:06.250
down to earth going on.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.290
It turned out that those
journalists from Le Monaco,

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.390
rather than sitting
by the tables

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.806
and recording the
numbers, instead

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:12.970
had been sitting in the
bar and making them up.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.580
But this idea-- think
back to how he phrased it.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.410
It was the probability
of observing

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.740
an event as extreme as
the one I've observed.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.280
This was the first
forays into what's

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.920
known as hypothesis testing.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.820
Nowadays, whether we
work in clinical trials

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.750
or on particle
physics experiments,

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.740
we use the principles that
Pearson honed on these roulette

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.410
tables and coin
tosses to understand

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.105
whether we have enough
evidence to reject or accept

00:13:41.105 --> 00:13:41.980
a certain hypothesis.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.514
So in this case
his hypotheses was

00:13:43.514 --> 00:13:44.680
that the tables were random.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.890
And he had enough evidence to
say that this wasn't the case.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.605
And actually gamblers
have also used these ideas

00:13:50.605 --> 00:13:51.970
throughout Victorian times.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.300
And moving into late
1940s, for example,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.249
two medical students used
these kind of methods to go

00:13:59.249 --> 00:14:00.790
and unlike the lazy
journalists, they

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.250
actually watched the tables this
time, collected all the data

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.270
and found that
there were biases.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.920
These tables bore
down over time.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.930
And certain numbers
or areas would

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.421
appear more often than not.

00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:11.920
And actually they
went around Nevada

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.940
and gambolled at
all these tables.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.770
And the exact figure
was never known.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.900
But they did buy a
yacht and sell around

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.086
the Caribbean for a year-- so
a pretty successful strategy.

00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:21.460
The problem for
gamblers, though,

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.470
is casinos cottoned on
to what they were doing.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.990
And they would make sure the
tables were incredibly well

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.200
maintained and you didn't
have these biases occurring.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.094
But in the '60s and '70s, some
physics students realised that

00:14:32.094 --> 00:14:34.510
this actually leaves you in
the second level of ignorance.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.910
Because if you've got a very
pristine, well-maintained

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.650
roulette table, it's not
a statistics problem.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:39.460
It's a physics one.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.335
As one of them said,
it's kind of like having

00:14:41.335 --> 00:14:42.460
a planet orbiting a point.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.150
You got this ball going around.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.780
In the '70s, a group of students
at University of California,

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.350
Santa Cruz actually started
doing these calculations.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.730
And they looked
at roulette spin.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.105
And they said,
well, to start off

00:14:53.105 --> 00:14:54.910
with, the croupier
will spin the ball.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.640
And it would go around
the edge of the track

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.807
around the rim of the table.

00:14:58.807 --> 00:15:00.723
And often it would go
around a couple of times

00:15:00.723 --> 00:15:02.430
before the croupier
calls no more bets.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.806
In other words,
you have a window

00:15:03.806 --> 00:15:06.138
in which you can collect
information on what the ball is

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:07.400
doing and act on it.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.370
You can place bets
during this period.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.350
Over time it would drop
down onto the track.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.360
And this will spin
freely and eventually hit

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.660
one of these deflectors and
land in one of the pockets.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.240
And what's it-- they actually
did testing out their strategy

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.350
on different tables in their lab
was realised that if you could

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.020
calibrate your models-- if you
could write down the equations

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.640
for the physical system-- you
got the ball going around.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.450
It's slowing down
and then drops down.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.033
If you write down
these equations that

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:33.370
calibrate into a
specific table, then

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.770
in that initial bit
of time, you could

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.057
collect enough information
to improve your prediction

00:15:39.057 --> 00:15:40.390
about where the ball would land.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.150
You'd never get exactly.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.190
But you didn't need to.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.010
You just need to get some idea
of which region of the table

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.764
is going to land in, enough to
get an edge over the casino.

00:15:47.764 --> 00:15:49.180
It's all well and
good, of course,

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.010
doing that in a classroom and
working for all occasions--

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.390
all the equations.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.836
But in a casino, you need
to do it in real time.

00:15:55.836 --> 00:15:57.460
You need to do that
on the casino floor

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.137
as the ball is spinning.

00:15:59.137 --> 00:16:00.970
So what these teams
actually did was come up

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.080
with hidden computers to do
these calculations in person.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.929
Now wearable technology
is, of course,

00:16:05.929 --> 00:16:06.970
all around us these days.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.110
But the first wearable computer
was designed for this purpose

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.740
as it happens.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.240
And because it was
a new technology,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.750
there were, of course,
some drawbacks for this.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.010
They'd often give themselves
electric shocks for example.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.850
And as well as this--
as I mentioned,

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.380
things are very sensitive
to initial conditions.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.921
So if the weather
changed, they would

00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:26.710
need to recalibrate
to the roulette table.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.805
On one occasion they
were actually losing

00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:31.030
a fair bit of money and
couldn't quite work out why.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.613
Until they realised there's an
overweight tourist further down

00:16:33.613 --> 00:16:35.710
leaning on the table
and screwing up all

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.520
of their predictions.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.220
So really these kind of methods
were somewhat imperfect.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.180
In theory they worked very well.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.770
But these kind of stories
have been a bit sporadic.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.277
But it wasn't just
roulette during this period

00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:48.610
that gamblers started targeting.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.600
They also started
targeting other games.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.750
And actually one of the
most successful gamblers

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.496
in the world is a man by
the name of Bill Benter.

00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:58.120
And when he was a student in the
'70s, he came across this sign

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.750
in an Atlantic City casino.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.980
Now to him this sign
meant one thing.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.881
Card counting clearly works.

00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:07.839
And the whole idea of
card counting-- so if you

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.010
have games like blackjack.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.330
You're trying to get to
a certain total playing

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.220
the dealer.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.319
And in blackjack, you try and
get near to 21 but not go over.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.100
So you've got to draw cards and
try and get near this total.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.020
On the face of it,
this is a random game.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.061
The draw is completely
random what will come out.

00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:24.400
But of course, it's not
for a deck of cards.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.069
Because if certain cards
have already come out,

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.410
they can't reappear until
you shuffle the deck.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.030
So if you can
collect information

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.780
on what's already appeared,
this can potentially give you

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.250
an edge over the casino.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.980
It can give you an
advantage against them.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.230
Now again, casinos started
realising what players were

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.396
doing, that they were
tracking what was in the deck.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.160
So they started using
more decks of cards.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.059
Rather than one, they
would use a whole pile.

00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:48.850
And this made it much
harder to card count.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.820
Because if there's multiple
of the same card in the deck,

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.700
it's much more difficult to
keep track of what's come out

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.066
and what hasn't.

00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:57.730
But the casinos
were inadvertently

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.090
handing the gamblers a
very significant advantage,

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.890
because at the time,
casinos typically

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.250
used what's know as
a dovetail shuffle.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.440
So this is probably
familiar to you.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.630
You split the deck in two.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.400
You riffle the cards together.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.230
Now a dovetail shuffle,
if you do it once,

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.072
preserves an enormous amount
of information about the cards.

00:18:15.072 --> 00:18:16.780
So just to give you
an example, let's say

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.350
we have a six pack of cards
in order from ace to king.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.607
If we do a dovetail
shuffle, we split them.

00:18:22.607 --> 00:18:24.690
I've coloured them just
to make life a bit easier.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.065
And then we riffle
them together.

00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:28.514
Now they might not fall
exactly interwoven.

00:18:28.514 --> 00:18:30.430
But you can see here in
two different colours,

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.590
you've got two quite clear
what's known as rising

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.714
sequences of numbers.

00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:34.880
So cards have been shuffled.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.320
But actually, if you know where
they started at each point

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.720
as you go from left to right,
you know there's only one

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.045
of two cards that
could be appearing.

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.920
And actually there's a
number of magic tricks

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.894
that rely on this fact.

00:18:45.894 --> 00:18:48.310
So if you get a deck of cards
and move one and then riffle

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.444
shuffle, you can spot with--

00:18:50.444 --> 00:18:52.360
the moved card-- because
it won't fit into one

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.682
of these rising sequences.

00:18:53.682 --> 00:18:56.140
As mathematicians have shown
that for this kind of shuffle,

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.500
you need to shuffle the deck at
least half a dozen or so times

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.310
to get something that's
as good as random.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.450
And in casinos in that
period, people were actually

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.160
only shuffling them once.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.646
So really if you can
track what's happened,

00:19:08.646 --> 00:19:10.270
you've got a huge
amount of information

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.809
about what's going on.

00:19:12.809 --> 00:19:15.100
And in many cases, they would
actually sneak in pieces.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.936
And again, another opportunity
at confusing casinos--

00:19:17.936 --> 00:19:19.810
to track the cards that
have come previously.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.960
And whereas before card counters
would measure what's come

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.540
and then get a custom
approximation of what's

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.090
left, now they'd actually
at each point in time

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.640
know that there's only one of
two cards that could appear.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.760
So this is a terrific
advantage that they had.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.800
But this poses a challenge,
because how do you capitalise

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.300
on that?

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.160
At each point in
time, let's say,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.190
there's a card
that's advantageous

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.237
and less beneficial.

00:19:45.237 --> 00:19:47.070
How do you make that
decision about how much

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.274
to risk in that situation?

00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:50.690
And what I want to do is just
start with a simple example.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.244
Let's suppose we
have a coin toss.

00:19:52.244 --> 00:19:54.160
And I'm going to offer
you a biassed bet here.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.430
So I'm going to offer you
two to one odds on tails.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.640
So in other words, you
name an amount of money.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.550
If it comes up heads, you
pay me that amount of money.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.030
If it comes up tails,
then I will pay you

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.990
double the amount you named.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.530
So clearly that's a pretty
stupid bet on my part.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.570
I'm giving you an advantage.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.609
But how much would you
be willing to risk?

00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:17.650
After all, it is a coin
toss, and you would still

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.770
have a chance of losing money.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.394
Could I just get a
quick show of hands?

00:20:20.394 --> 00:20:23.470
Who here would be willing to
risk one pound on that bet?

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.776
Show of hands--

00:20:24.776 --> 00:20:26.230
OK, so I think most of you.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.580
Keep your hand out if you be
willing to risk 10 pounds.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.280
OK, how about 100 pounds?

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.490
OK, and 500?

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.470
How many times do
you get to play?

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.620
Once.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.740
OK, so there's a
few people left.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.040
I'm not sure if they're
playing with monopoly money.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.860
But OK, so if you
put your hands down.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.500
That wasn't legally
binding, anyway.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.944
But I waned to give you
a chance to kind of get

00:20:54.944 --> 00:20:56.110
a feeling of measuring risk.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.605
How much are you willing
to risk in that situation?

00:20:57.605 --> 00:20:59.896
And I don't know if you can
see, but actually the hands

00:20:59.896 --> 00:21:02.652
kind of went down a lot between
10 and a hundred pounds.

00:21:02.652 --> 00:21:04.860
But this is quite an important
question for gamblers.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.150
And actually in the
'50s, a physicist

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.607
called John Kelly
started thinking

00:21:08.607 --> 00:21:09.940
about this idea of biassed bets.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.710
Suppose you have
inside information.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.680
And you have some edge over
a book maker or casino.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.360
How do you exploit that?

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.650
In this situation for you,
although I gave all of you

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.280
the exact same bets--
mathematically it's the same

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.340
offer--

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.810
your perception of the value
of that was very different.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:31.120
Some of you valued it at a
pound, some at 10, some at 500.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.710
What's the optimal
thing to do there?

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.209
There's actually this concept
known as utility in economics.

00:21:35.209 --> 00:21:37.060
It's the value of
something changes

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.630
depending on how much money is
in your wallet, for example,

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.130
and how much you're
willing to lose.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.480
And what Kelly did is he
looked at these two contrasting

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.989
aims you have, if you want to
give a good long-term return.

00:21:50.989 --> 00:21:53.030
First you're trying to
make money, because you've

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.032
got a biassed bet.

00:21:54.032 --> 00:21:55.990
But you're also trying
to avoid going bankrupt.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.300
Essentially you're
still tossing a coin.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.300
There's that chance
you're going to lose.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.020
I don't think anyone here would
have bet their house on this.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.650
Maybe you would have.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:03.941
You might have an angry family.

00:22:03.941 --> 00:22:07.871
But in this case, you want to
somehow exploit it, but also

00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:08.620
limit your losses.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.494
And what Kelly did was
come up with this formula.

00:22:11.494 --> 00:22:12.910
So I apologise for
my handwriting.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.370
Basically you've got the odds,
which in this case is two.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.370
You got the probability
you'll win-- this Pwin--

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.786
minus the probability
you'll lose.

00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:22.540
And this is the optimal
fraction of your money

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.422
to bet for a given edge over
somebody in a wager situation.

00:22:27.422 --> 00:22:28.630
So the bet I just showed you.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.710
The odds were two.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.890
The probability you'll win is a
half, because it's a coin toss.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.280
Probability you'll
lose is also a half.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.655
So if you stick
these numbers in,

00:22:34.655 --> 00:22:36.670
you get the following
kind of equation.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.280
A little bit of arithmetic--
you can end up with a quarter.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.610
So in this situation, if you
want to maximise your long-term

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.000
growth of money, it's optimal
to risk about a quarter

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.682
of your income.

00:22:46.682 --> 00:22:48.640
Just have a think back
to when you were raising

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.225
hands, whether that
was the course of--

00:22:51.225 --> 00:22:52.600
were you taking
advantage or not?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.210
Now some of you might think,
OK, that's all well and good.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:56.651
You showed me a formula.

00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:57.400
Let's test it out.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.899
Now I could have, of course,
adopt the Karl Pearson approach

00:22:59.899 --> 00:23:02.620
and spend the next half an
hour or so tossing coins

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.880
to convince you.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.760
That's a bit boring.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.593
So what I thought I'd
do instead is show you

00:23:06.593 --> 00:23:08.020
some simulations
of if we adopted

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.394
different strategies, what
kind of outcomes we would get.

00:23:10.394 --> 00:23:12.396
So here along the
vertical is your bankroll.

00:23:12.396 --> 00:23:14.770
I'm going to assume that you
start with a hundred pounds.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.817
And along the bottom
is the coin flips.

00:23:16.817 --> 00:23:18.400
So we're going to
play this bet again,

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.034
and again, and
again, and see what

00:23:20.034 --> 00:23:21.200
you'd end up with over time.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.572
Now you might have thought a
quarter of my money, that's

00:23:24.572 --> 00:23:25.280
not taking risks.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.410
So I want to go big.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.825
You might say, well, I want
to bet 80% of my money.

00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:31.720
And in this case, if we just
do one random simulation, what

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.940
might happen is you'll
get a couple of big wins

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.540
at the start.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.279
You're approaching
a thousand pounds.

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.070
Lose a load of money--
win a load of money.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.730
It's exciting.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.300
And then lose all your
money and go bankrupt--

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.130
Less exciting.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.230
If you adopt this
optimal Kelly strategy

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.360
and bet 25%, what will happen
is it will take longer.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.177
You'll grow a bit
slow over time.

00:23:52.177 --> 00:23:53.260
But you won't go bankrupt.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.676
And actually in
the long term, you

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:56.093
will get something
that takes off.

00:23:56.093 --> 00:23:58.551
You might say actually, that's
still a bit too much for me.

00:23:58.551 --> 00:23:59.950
I'm going to bet
10% of my income

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.544
on each one of these wages.

00:24:02.544 --> 00:24:04.210
And in this case, if
you do it randomly,

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.540
it'll take a long time to grow.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.290
So you won't go bankrupt.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.090
But it will take much more
time to bet your money.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.939
And you notice this
kind of increases quite

00:24:11.939 --> 00:24:12.730
steeply at the end.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.771
And that's because you're
reinvesting your money.

00:24:14.771 --> 00:24:17.690
It's this kind of compound
interest effect over time.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.690
Again, this is just
one simulation.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:20.500
It's a coin toss.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.541
It's a bit of randomness.

00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:23.710
So what we could do is
simulate it, say, 10 times.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.622
Instead of this
one instance here,

00:24:25.622 --> 00:24:27.080
do each one of
these 10 times over.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.379
And in the case
where you bet 80%,

00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:31.170
you're going to end up
with something which

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.370
nine of these you go
bankrupt, one of them

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.300
you do make a bit of money.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.960
But in most of these cases,
you'll run out of your income

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.460
pretty quickly.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.490
If you bet 25%,
this optimal amount,

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.136
then again, it
grows a bit slower.

00:24:44.136 --> 00:24:45.760
But you don't go
bankrupt at any point.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.880
And you will eventually
grow your income.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.650
And then again, this 10% is
just a much slower growth.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.580
So it takes much, much
more time to build this up

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.621
over the series of bets.

00:24:56.621 --> 00:24:58.120
And this is the
strategy that people

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.300
use playing blackjack--
playing a lot these games

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.430
to manage their bankroll.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.810
And actually the concept of
utility and money management

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.226
is obviously
important in finance.

00:25:07.226 --> 00:25:09.340
But it underpins the
entire insurance industry,

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.740
because whether we
insure something or not

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.900
depends on how we
value it, whether we're

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.600
willing to risk the fact that
we could lose it and cost us out

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.210
of a lot of money, or whether
we take those small premiums.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.125
That would depend on
the value of the item.

00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:25.482
But implementing this strategy,
of course, for card counters

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:26.440
can still be a problem.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.290
As one card counter I talked
to said, learning to card count

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:30.105
is easy.

00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:32.866
Learning to get away with
it is very difficult.

00:25:32.866 --> 00:25:34.740
And many of these people
who were successful,

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.386
people like Bill Benter soon
became pretty well known

00:25:37.386 --> 00:25:38.760
in the world of
casinos and found

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.490
themselves banned from all
the way around the world.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.940
So they turned their
attention to a bigger game,

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.550
a much larger place to wager.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.130
Now, this is Happy Valley
Racecourse in Hong Kong.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:51.734
If you've ever been
Wednesday night,

00:25:51.734 --> 00:25:53.400
this is kind of where
all the action is.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.170
On a typical race day, about
$150 million are wagered.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.800
Gambling is an enormous part
of what's going on here.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.315
One of the appeals for this for
gamblers is a fairly small--

00:26:04.315 --> 00:26:07.260
well, firstly it's-- they're
pretty convinced it's an honest

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:07.829
operation.

00:26:07.829 --> 00:26:09.870
And it's a small pool of
horses, about a thousand

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.703
horses that run again,
and again, and again.

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:14.730
So you can generate lots
of data to look at and try

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.370
and interpret which horse
might have a good chance.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.950
But to do that, of
course, you need

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.180
some way of converting data
into a measure of performance.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.180
Which horse is the best?

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.920
Which horse is going to win?

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.150
And to use this, teams turned
to an idea that was first

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.280
conjured up by this man.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.160
This is Francis Galton, a
Victorian scientist and cousin

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.170
actually of Charles Darwin.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.840
And as you can see, they shared
some passions particularly

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.317
for cravats and short sideburns.

00:26:42.317 --> 00:26:43.650
But there were some differences.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.651
Darwin actually was meticulous
in shaping his research.

00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:48.150
So even the theory
of evolution, you

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.500
can see many of his
fingerprints over this.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.450
Now Galton liked to think of
himself more as an explorer.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.030
He would dabble in anthropology,
and psychology, and biology,

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.580
and economics, and
then start it off a bit

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.880
and then leave it and wander
off to something else.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.775
And one of the things he was
interested in was inheritance.

00:27:04.775 --> 00:27:06.150
And he actually
on some occasions

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.850
would send his friends seeds and
get them to grow them for him.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.160
It's kind of an early
crowdsourcing approach--

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.910
and get them to report back.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.340
And one of the things he'd
notice is that if you grew

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.324
a season and had the
subsequent generation,

00:27:18.324 --> 00:27:19.740
if those were for
instance taller,

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.948
you wouldn't expect the next
generation to be taller,

00:27:21.948 --> 00:27:24.480
and taller, and taller-- that
over time you'd get a feature

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.820
which he referred to as
regression to mediocrity--

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.412
that over time these
kind of features

00:27:28.412 --> 00:27:29.370
would somehow converge.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.680
And the influence of
the older lineages

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.879
might kind of smooth
over variation.

00:27:33.879 --> 00:27:36.420
He wanted to understand this in
a slightly more rigorous way.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.400
And it was actually
a horse trainer

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.260
who presented him
with a figure, which

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.619
allowed him to frame this idea.

00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:42.660
And it was the following.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.380
It was a diagram.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.600
It was a square
which represented

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.760
the characteristics of a horse.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.971
And this trainer had
proposed that about half

00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:52.470
of the characteristics
are explained

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.678
by the mother and the father.

00:27:53.678 --> 00:27:55.670
So you have a couple
of squares for those.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.390
And then of the remaining
characteristics,

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.820
maybe a quarter is explained
by the four grandparents.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.700
And then another
chunk is explained

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.629
by the great
grandparents and so on.

00:28:05.629 --> 00:28:07.170
And this idea was
one of the founders

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.040
of what's known as regression
theory in statistics.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.220
It's the idea that we can
take a number of factors

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.700
and work out how it
influences the characteristics

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.430
of a certain object or system.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.867
And we could have a similar
approach in horse racing.

00:28:19.867 --> 00:28:21.450
We could say, well,
let's just suppose

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.350
this box is the
performance of the horse.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.350
And we have lots of
different bits of past data.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.230
And we could say, well, maybe
each one of these bits of data

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:32.200
explains some amount of
the horse's performance.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.450
Of course, this is a bit
simplistic, really, isn't it.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:38.820
Because just like with the
characteristics of inheritance

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.742
where, for instance,
some of the variation

00:28:40.742 --> 00:28:42.450
is explained by the
parents that are also

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.182
going to be shared
with the grandparents,

00:28:44.182 --> 00:28:46.140
the characteristics of
a horse-- these features

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.015
are going to overlap.

00:28:47.015 --> 00:28:48.995
Some of these will
explain multiple aspects.

00:28:48.995 --> 00:28:50.370
So these kind of
things are going

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.120
to be a bit more jumbled up.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.120
And what's more, we might
not be able to explain

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.490
all of the horse's performance.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.490
There might be some chunk
which we still can't explain.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.740
And really the aim from a
statistical point of view is

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.920
to try and minimise
this unknown quantity.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.100
And there's actually-- in the
'80s, Bill Benter visiting

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.750
a library in Nevada
came across a paper

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.750
by two researchers called Ruth
Bolton and Randall Chapman.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.890
They work in marketing.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.240
They still do actually.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.000
And they had essentially
outlined this method

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.700
for horse races, this
approach of converting data

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.460
into some kind of
measure of performance

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.280
that you could use
to make predictions.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.590
And as Bill said,
it was the idea

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.594
that sowed a multibillion
pound industry-- an incredibly

00:29:31.594 --> 00:29:32.760
important piece of research.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.380
And actually for Ruth
Bolton, it was the only paper

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.588
she wrote about horse racing.

00:29:35.588 --> 00:29:36.840
It's during her PhD.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.730
And it was really kind
of a side project.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.612
But this had a huge
impact on this industry.

00:29:41.612 --> 00:29:44.070
And on doing the analysis of
those early syndicates in Hong

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.460
Kong, certain things would
come out as more important.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.750
For example, in one of their
early bits of research,

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.750
the number of races
a horse had run

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.200
would tell you a lot about
how it's going to do.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.730
And it's tempting to come
up with a story for that.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.616
We say, well, if
it's run more races,

00:29:58.616 --> 00:30:00.240
then it's going to
be more experienced.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.948
And then that's going
to give it a better

00:30:01.948 --> 00:30:03.972
performance in the next race.

00:30:03.972 --> 00:30:05.430
But they actually
avoid doing that,

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.680
because really they
know it's a jumble,

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.350
that all of these things are
going to overlap and explain

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.920
one thing.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.580
And it's not clear that just
because something is important,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.810
it has a direct explanation.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.460
This quite common
problem in statistics

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.481
is known as this idea that
correlation doesn't always

00:30:20.481 --> 00:30:21.105
mean causation.

00:30:21.105 --> 00:30:23.940
Just to give an example,
here we have along the bottom

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.110
is the wine spend per year
at the Cambridge colleges.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.920
On the vertical is
the exam results.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.450
So as you--

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.075
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:32.075 --> 00:30:34.200
As you can see, there's a
pretty strong correlation

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.529
between colleges that spend more
on wine have better results.

00:30:37.529 --> 00:30:39.445
And this isn't the only
thing that's happened.

00:30:39.445 --> 00:30:41.430
Actually it turns
out that countries

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.560
that have a higher per
capita spend on chocolate

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.469
typically win more Nobel Prizes.

00:30:47.469 --> 00:30:50.010
As lovely as it would be that
eating chocolate would make you

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.080
a Nobel Prize winner
and drinking wine

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.050
would make you better at
exams, there's clearly

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:55.050
something else going on.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.730
There's some underlying
feature which

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.260
explains all of these things.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.080
And really these
syndicates therefore

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.340
don't try and untangle it.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.048
And actually one of
the remarkable things

00:31:04.048 --> 00:31:06.900
is they have no desire
to be pundits and experts

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.154
on this kind of field.

00:31:08.154 --> 00:31:10.320
For them the question is
what horse is going to win,

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.860
not why is that
horse going to win.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.450
So it's almost this going
back to the idea of ignorance.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:16.260
They're embracing
their ignorance.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.676
And they're saying,
I don't really

00:31:17.676 --> 00:31:20.010
mind that I can't explain
exactly how it's going.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.690
I just want a
method that is going

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.310
to give me good predictions.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:27.750
Now starting off by measuring
performance is one good thing.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.630
But actually when you have
multiple horses racing,

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:34.290
you can get some slightly
unexpected results occurring.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.670
So just an example,
a very simple one,

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.220
let's suppose we
have two horses.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.139
We have one which half
the time does well,

00:31:41.139 --> 00:31:42.180
half the time does badly.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.162
On the day, you don't know
which it's going to be.

00:31:45.162 --> 00:31:46.620
And you have the
second horse which

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.570
is a bastion of reliability.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:52.080
Every single race, exactly
the same performance.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.202
Now on average over
lots and lots of races,

00:31:55.202 --> 00:31:56.910
they've got the same
kind of performance,

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.100
because the top one on
average that will cancel out.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.600
And in a race, it will
be essentially a 50-50,

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.232
because it completely
depends in a race

00:32:05.232 --> 00:32:06.690
whether the top
horse number one is

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.060
having a good day or a bad day.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.285
So these two horses
race against each other.

00:32:10.285 --> 00:32:11.410
It's basically a coin toss.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.830
It's a 50/50 chance, because
if the top horse is having

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.180
a good day, he's going to win.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.230
If he's having a bad
day, he's going to lose.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.090
That's kind of intuitive.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.990
But if you add a third
horse into the mix,

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.370
something a bit strange happens.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.203
So let's suppose we
have a third horse here,

00:32:25.203 --> 00:32:27.540
which some days
performed slightly

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.670
better than the middle
horse, some days performed

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:30.410
slightly worse.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.580
So again on average,
all these horses

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.440
have the same performance.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.560
Now by the same kind of logic,
the top horse here again

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.100
has a 50% chance of winning,
because half the time he

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.520
will come out front and half
the time he'll come out last.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.960
So he still has a 50%
chance of winning.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.680
Of the two horses that remain,
if the top horse doesn't win,

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.150
we can apply the same logic.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.010
Of these two horses
on the bottom,

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.240
if the horse number
three has a good day,

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.520
he's going to come out on top.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.353
And if he has a bad
day, he's going to lose.

00:32:58.353 --> 00:33:00.240
So if the top horse
doesn't win, you

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.340
spit the probabilities
between the two horses

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.420
remaining, because
you can't decide.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.390
Now just take a look at
what's going on here.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.360
All these horses on average
have identical performance.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.396
But it's the variability
that's different.

00:33:11.396 --> 00:33:13.020
And actually the top
horse because it's

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.570
most variable in
this kind of race

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.195
has a larger chance of winning.

00:33:18.195 --> 00:33:20.070
You can actually apply
the same kind of logic

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.903
to other situations.

00:33:20.903 --> 00:33:23.404
So say we have an election,
which the first past

00:33:23.404 --> 00:33:24.070
the post system.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.220
So the person who gets
the most votes wins.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.625
If you have three
people who on average

00:33:28.625 --> 00:33:30.500
you'd expect to get the
same amount of votes,

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.250
is actually the most
polarising candidate,

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.920
the kind of all or nothing one,
which has the best strategy,

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.532
because they've got
the largest chance

00:33:36.532 --> 00:33:37.740
of winning in this situation.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.660
If you want to push the
example a bit further,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.870
you could look at job interviews
or maybe even dating, if you've

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.990
got lots of different suitors.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.700
In this situation,
it makes most sense

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.170
to adopt this all or nothing
kind of Marmite strategy,

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.822
if the objective is to come out
first against multiple people.

00:33:54.822 --> 00:33:57.030
This isn't a problem if
there's only two in the race.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:58.410
But as soon as you have
multiple competitors,

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.630
you get this kind of
weird dynamic coming out.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.790
And really the mathematics
of games and these kind

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.790
of features have been
interest to mathematicians

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:08.370
for a long time.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.960
Actually the origins
of game theory,

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.800
the origins of mathematics of
games originated with poker.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.130
In the 1920s, a researcher
John Von Neumann--

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.130
brilliant mathematician.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.963
He was the youngest
professor in the history

00:34:19.963 --> 00:34:22.110
of the University of Berlin--

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.570
wasn't so good at poker, though.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.320
On the face of it,
poker is a perfect game

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.445
for a mathematician, right?

00:34:26.445 --> 00:34:29.295
It's the probability
you get a certain hand--

00:34:29.295 --> 00:34:31.420
the probability your opponent
gets a different one.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.960
But von Neumann realised that
there's more to it than that.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.150
He said real life
consists of bluffing--

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.060
of little tactics of
deception-- of asking

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.980
myself what does the other
man suppose I'm going to do.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.334
And he wanted to study
that kind of feedback

00:34:43.334 --> 00:34:45.000
between what you
think, what they think,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.730
and they think you think.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.480
And he looked at very
simplified forms of poker.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.949
And one situation he
looked at was two players.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:53.670
They each get dealt
a single card.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.217
And then they put some money
in the pot at the start.

00:34:56.217 --> 00:34:57.550
And first player has the choice.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.580
So they can either just stick
with their bets, in which case

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.770
they just turn over their
cards and compare them.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.040
Or they can raise the stakes.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.498
And then it's up
to the second pair

00:35:04.498 --> 00:35:07.110
to decide whether they
meet that bet or not.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.580
So two players, one card,
money in the middle.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.170
What von Neumann found is
that in these kind of games,

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.200
you've got almost a tug of war,
because each player is trying

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.350
to maximise their gain
while simultaneously trying

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.910
to minimise their
opponent's gain.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.640
If you play a game like poker,
anything your opponent wins

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.570
comes out of your pocket.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.320
So you're trying to
maximise what you get,

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.800
while at the same time trying
to minimise what they get.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.133
Which means that there's this
kind of equilibrium point.

00:35:30.133 --> 00:35:35.022
There's a point at which the
two conflicting forces balance.

00:35:35.022 --> 00:35:36.980
And this situation--
analysing it for the game.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.010
He found that this situation
in which no player would

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.610
benefit by changing their
strategy-- this balance point.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.729
For the first
player, the strategy

00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:48.020
was as follows, that if they
got a very high card, then

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.246
they should raise the stakes.

00:35:49.246 --> 00:35:50.370
Intuitive just makes sense.

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.880
If you have a good card,
you might as well bet on it.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.117
If they had a middling card,
it didn't make sense for them

00:35:57.117 --> 00:35:57.950
to raise the stakes.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.090
They didn't have a
great chance of winning.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.380
But they still had some chance.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.330
So in other words,
they should just

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.890
stick with their existing bet.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.910
But when von Neumann
looked at what

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.580
happened when you got
the lowest kind of cards,

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.039
he found that it doesn't make
sense to stick with your bet,

00:36:10.039 --> 00:36:11.496
because if you turn
over the cards,

00:36:11.496 --> 00:36:12.920
you're probably going to lose.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.510
Instead you should
up the stakes.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.210
So in other words,
you should bluff.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.300
And actually up to
this point gamblers

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.630
had often-- poker players
had often bluffed in games.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.460
But it was always
seen as a quirk

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.860
of human psychology, a
kind of innate trickery

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.910
that humans came up with.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.650
But here was von
Neumann showing that it

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.270
was a mathematical necessity.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.610
In other words, he
proved that bluffing

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.930
is a necessary part of life.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.440
And this idea was
fundamental to game theory,

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.389
that you can have these
strategies put together.

00:36:39.389 --> 00:36:40.930
In this very simple
version of poker,

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:43.800
though, there's almost a list
of fixed rules we can follow.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.140
So in other words, if
you get high or low card,

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.015
you raise the stakes.

00:36:46.015 --> 00:36:48.950
If you get a middling card,
you stick with what you've got.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.847
And in any game where you've
got all the information in front

00:36:51.847 --> 00:36:53.430
of you-- so other
games for instance--

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.730
things like noughts and
crosses, checkers, chess--

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:58.390
all of the games in theory
have a fixed set of rules.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:59.600
It's known as pure strategy.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.060
So you follow these
exact rules, and you'll

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.054
get the optimal result.

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.470
So if someone
noughts and crosses,

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.179
I think most people can work out
when they are younger that they

00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:08.470
realise there's a set of moves.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.095
And if they always
do that, they always

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:12.695
get the results that's
the best possible.

00:37:12.695 --> 00:37:15.260
But of course, not all
games are like this.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.830
A good example is
rock, paper, scissors.

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:19.825
So it might be admirably
consistent of you

00:37:19.825 --> 00:37:21.940
to always pick the same one.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.080
But if your opponent
spots what you're doing,

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.710
they can take advantage of that.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.530
So it's not the kind
of optimal strategy

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.300
if you're trying to make
your opponent's decisions as

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.140
difficult as possible.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.550
And these kind of games, that's
what you're trying to do.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.130
You're trying to
make your opponent

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.754
indifferent to
changing, because you've

00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:37.010
got that tug of war going on.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.680
So if they can gain more by
adopting a different strategy,

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.450
you haven't got the
optimal approach.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:42.950
And in rock, paper,
scissors, if you

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:44.991
want to make your opponent's
choices as difficult

00:37:44.991 --> 00:37:47.535
as possible, what you can just
simply do is pick randomly.

00:37:47.535 --> 00:37:51.704
If you pick completely
random options amongst those,

00:37:51.704 --> 00:37:53.120
then in the long
run your opponent

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.100
won't be able to make
any money off you.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.109
So this is kind of the
optimal thing to do.

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:59.150
And rock, paper, scissors,
there's three options.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.050
It's not too hard to work
out that picking randomly

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.080
will make your opponent's
decisions difficult.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.320
But games like poker
are far more complex.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.732
You have a whole
array of choices

00:38:08.732 --> 00:38:10.190
that you can make
through the game.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.773
So it's not something
you can actually

00:38:11.773 --> 00:38:13.690
write down with pen and paper.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:15.440
And fortunately we can
turn to a technique

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.410
that one of John von
Neumann's colleagues devised.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.530
And this was a mathematician
called Stanislaw Ulam.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.120
And unlike many
mathematicians, he

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.490
wasn't a big fan of working
through loads of equations.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.573
On one occasion he was
working a blackboard trying

00:38:27.573 --> 00:38:29.115
to solve a quadratic,
got to the end,

00:38:29.115 --> 00:38:30.739
and was just so
frustrated and annoyed,

00:38:30.739 --> 00:38:31.820
he went home for the day.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.190
So really kind of
wasn't his thing

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.120
to kind of crunch
through all this algebra.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.860
He was once playing
handheld, which

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.356
is a version of solitaire.

00:38:40.356 --> 00:38:42.230
And he wondered what
the probability would be

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.580
if he just laid out the cards.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.010
What's the probability
he'd have a situation where

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.300
he could win that game--

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.267
the cards would fall
in a favourable way.

00:38:49.267 --> 00:38:51.350
He started looking at
calculations and realised it

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.200
was just a lot of effort.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.750
So instead he thought,
well, what if I just

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.100
lay out the cards a few
times and see what happens.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.130
In other words, what
if I just simulate

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:02.470
this process a few times and get
some sense of how likely it is.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.720
At the time, Ulam and von
Neumann were working on the US

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.010
nuclear programme at Los Alamos
working on neutron collisions.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.720
Part of the project
was a hydrogen bomb.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.370
And again these are
random processes

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.650
where you couldn't neatly
write down the formulas

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.491
and solve them.

00:39:16.491 --> 00:39:18.740
And they realised that this
method would be incredibly

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.619
powerful for that.

00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:22.160
Being a government programme,
they needed a code name for it.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.290
So they called it the
Monte Carlo method,

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.270
because Ulam had a heavy
gambling uncle at the time.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.030
And the Monte Carlo
method has become

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.930
a fundamental part of science.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.340
I mean in my line of work
where we try and look

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.630
at disease outbreaks, you have
something like Ebola or Zika,

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.750
that's an incredibly
complex set of interactions.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.510
It's not something you can write
down with pen and paper neatly.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.000
And so we use these
simulation-based approaches

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.990
simulating these
random processes

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.776
to understand these systems.

00:39:44.776 --> 00:39:46.400
It also appears now
as a sports betting

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.850
when you're trying to understand
how these very complex team

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:51.320
interactions work.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.330
And it also applies to poker.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:56.540
Teams have used this kind of
approach for games of poker

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.630
where you can't neatly
solve the equations.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.350
You can use a
simulation-based approach

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.050
to get the computers to learn.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.125
And actually Allen Turing one
of the fathers of computing,

00:40:06.125 --> 00:40:08.750
when he was first thinking about
this idea of machine learning,

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.370
said that actually
if you're trying

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.495
to build intelligent machine,
it doesn't make sense

00:40:12.495 --> 00:40:13.600
to build the adult mind.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.710
You don't want to try and build
the finished product with all

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.918
the knowledge that was there.

00:40:16.918 --> 00:40:19.570
It makes much more sense
to build the child's mind

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:20.300
and let it learn.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.330
Let it work out how to
play these kinds of games.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.920
And this is what
these poker teams do.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.300
They create these
algorithms that can learn.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.340
And actually the way
in which they learn

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.587
is perhaps a bit surprising,
because what they do

00:40:31.587 --> 00:40:33.170
is they get these
algorithms over time

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.090
to employ what's known
as regret minimisation.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:36.770
So as they play
these games billions

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.920
of times against each other,
at each point when they've

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.020
made a decision, they
look back and say,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.490
could I improve that if I'd
done something differently.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.810
So at each point they have an
artificial measure of regret

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.917
for each decision they make.

00:40:49.917 --> 00:40:51.500
And actually there's
a lot of evidence

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.140
from some neurological--
neuroscience studies--

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.024
that that ability to have regret
is quite important in learning

00:40:58.024 --> 00:40:58.690
games of chance.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:40:59.540
There's been studies
of people who

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.290
have damage to the bit
of the brain that's

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.314
responsible for
regret-- this ability

00:41:03.314 --> 00:41:04.730
to look backward
and ask how would

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.470
I feel if I'd done
something differently.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.659
And these people
often are perfectly

00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:09.950
capable of playing logic games.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.116
If they have to sort cards,
absolutely fine at that.

00:41:12.116 --> 00:41:14.360
If there's any element
of risk to the game

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.890
and they have to learn how
to play the optimal strategy,

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.365
that's something they
really struggle with.

00:41:19.365 --> 00:41:20.990
And actually a lot
of economic theories

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.090
developed not around
looking back but around

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.410
what's known as
expectation maximisation.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.730
So in other words,
you look forward.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.770
And you say, if I did
this, could I make money?

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:29.790
If I did this,
could I make more?

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.200
But really from these artificial
intelligence approaches,

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.390
it seems that it's
much more powerful

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.240
to look back and employ
that power of regret

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.280
as you go to look
back on your decisions

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.360
as you take these risks.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.450
And in fact these teams have
employed these algorithms

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.390
and got these computer bots to
play each other so many times

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:51.640
that last year they announced
that poker is solved.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.040
To be specific, for two-player
poker where the stakes have

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.550
a limit, these bots have
played each other so many times

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.980
that they've come up
with a strategy which

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.120
will not be expected to
lose money in the long run.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.750
So even if you're playing
a perfect opponent,

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.380
this bot would not lose
money over the course

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.230
of a very long game.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.300
Interestingly, actually
a lot of the players

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.110
who came up with
this system, or a lot

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.811
of the computer
scientists, aren't

00:42:18.811 --> 00:42:20.060
very good at poker themselves.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.680
By their own admission,
they're not poker players.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.570
So this is kind of a remarkable
illustration of the power

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.740
of these algorithms.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.990
You can have people
who aren't particularly

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:28.940
good at poker creating
poker bots that

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.945
can beat any human arguably.

00:42:32.945 --> 00:42:34.320
This is a remarkable
achievement.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.480
But there is, of
course, a downside

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.150
of this in that you're assuming
that your opponent is perfect.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.604
If you're looking for
this optimal strategy,

00:42:40.604 --> 00:42:42.770
that's inherently defensive,
because you're assuming

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.514
that your opponent's perfect.

00:42:44.514 --> 00:42:46.430
And you're almost giving
them too much credit.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:47.971
Because if you got
a flawed opponent,

00:42:47.971 --> 00:42:49.700
and you're coming up
with a strategy that

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.940
assumes they're perfect, you're
potentially not exploiting them

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.637
as much as you could.

00:42:54.637 --> 00:42:56.720
And just to give an example
of these kind of flaws

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.670
that could occur, let's go
back to rock, paper, scissors.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.140
What I'd like you
all to do is just

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.772
turn to the person
next to you and play

00:43:01.772 --> 00:43:03.980
a couple of games of rock,
paper, scissors with them,

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.962
please.

00:43:04.962 --> 00:43:08.399
[BACKGROUND CONVERSATIONS]

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.920
OK, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.900
OK, I can see there's
a couple at back trying

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.107
to play the best of
seven or something.

00:43:32.107 --> 00:43:33.940
What I'd to do, can I
just have a quick show

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.800
of hands of who opened
with rock there?

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.180
OK, a fair few-- who
opened with scissors?

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.300
Quite-- and who
opened with paper?

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.054
OK, not so many
actually for paper.

00:43:47.054 --> 00:43:48.970
So typically in these
kind of big competitions

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:50.511
where people play
lots of times, it's

00:43:50.511 --> 00:43:54.550
novices that open
with rock, often men.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.380
Scissors tends to
be the most popular

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.080
for people who play
a lot of these games.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.070
And paper is not always
chosen so common.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.460
Also think about what happened
between the first game

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.490
and the second game you played.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:08.050
Because in one fairly
large study of rock,

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.610
paper, scissors,
what happened was

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:11.500
people who when the
first round typically

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.550
stick with the same
move for the second go.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.230
So it's this old--

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.150
the military adage of
generals always fought--

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.520
always fight the last war,
especially if they won it.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.330
So it's the idea
that if you won,

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:23.800
you just stick with what's safe.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.720
People who lost,
however, will often

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.490
switch to the move that would
have beaten the one they lost.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.310
So if they lost to
rock, they'll often

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.020
swap to paper on the next go.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.380
So it doesn't always happen.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:37.945
But in these large competitions,
these kind of patterns emerge.

00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:40.070
So although the optimal
thing to do in rock, paper,

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.170
scissors is to behave completely
randomly, people don't.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.920
They fall into these
predictable patterns.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.460
And there was actually a story
a few years ago in Japan.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.200
An electronics firm
wanted to auction off

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.757
their art collection.

00:44:51.757 --> 00:44:53.590
And they approached
Christie's and Sotheby's

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.736
to hold the auction.

00:44:54.736 --> 00:44:56.360
They were obviously
both keen to do it.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.000
And so the head of
the electronics firm

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.374
decided the fairest
way to settle

00:44:59.374 --> 00:45:02.260
it would be with a game
of rock, paper, scissors.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.610
Now Sotheby's thought
that's perfectly random.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:07.150
That's nice.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:08.350
That's fine.

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:10.810
Christie's however,
the CEO in Japan

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.759
had a young daughter,
a 7-year-old who played

00:45:12.759 --> 00:45:14.050
relentlessly in the playground.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.980
So he got his daughter to
teach him a bit of rock, paper,

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.314
scissors strategy.

00:45:18.314 --> 00:45:20.230
And they walked in sure
enough to the boredom,

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:21.938
Sotheby's treating it
like a random gain,

00:45:21.938 --> 00:45:23.425
Christie's with a strategy.

00:45:23.425 --> 00:45:25.510
Christie's walked
out the winner.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:28.247
So in this kind of case,
exploiting those patterns

00:45:28.247 --> 00:45:30.580
and those kind of predictability
and knowledge of what's

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.097
happened before can
extremely valuable.

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:34.680
But there are some
challenges to that.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.400
And particularly if you
are playing computers,

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.400
one of the challenges
from a human point of view

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.830
is the limitation of our memory.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.205
So just to illustrate this
point, what I'd like to do now

00:45:42.205 --> 00:45:45.100
is to just all of you try and
memorise that number for me.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.600
So I'll give you a
couple of moments

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.850
to have a quick look at it.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.050
OK, right.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.540
Who fancies having a go
at trying to recite it?

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.040
Any volunteers?

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:55.877
Yes, sir?

00:45:55.877 --> 00:46:00.650
6, 1, 0, 2, 6, 0,
1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:01.830
Very, very close, sir.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.667
Does any one want
to have another go?

00:46:04.667 --> 00:46:05.750
What was your name, sorry?

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:06.250
Gavin.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:06.830
Gavin.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:07.880
So Gavin got very close.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.463
Any one want to try
and build on that?

00:46:09.463 --> 00:46:10.490
Yes.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.990
Yes?

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:14.547
610, 216, 1,000, 91.

00:46:14.547 --> 00:46:15.380
So what's your name?

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:15.665
Steve.

00:46:15.665 --> 00:46:16.220
Steve.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.636
Steve-- round of applause for
Steve, ladies and gentlemen.

00:46:18.636 --> 00:46:20.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.432
Now Steve did something
quite clever there--

00:46:23.432 --> 00:46:24.640
don't know if you spotted it.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.681
I'll explain what he did.

00:46:25.681 --> 00:46:28.100
So I asked you to
memorise 10 digits.

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.850
And that was actually
a bit devious of me,

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.640
because in a lot of
psychological studies,

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.730
people presented with numbers
can typically memorise

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.060
about seven and recite them.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.746
Sorry?

00:46:38.746 --> 00:46:39.660
12.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.350
12 digits?

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:40.970
Yes.

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:41.470
In what?

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.970
Up there.

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:43.870
You said 10.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:44.910
Oh, sorry.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:45.517
Yeah, OK.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.143
I do have a PhD in
maths, I assure you.

00:46:50.143 --> 00:46:52.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.410
OK, so actually I
made it even harder.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:55.660
I was crueller than I thought.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.420
I do apologise.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.560
And so typically
people can remember--

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.560
like a local telephone
number they can remember.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.864
Two, they struggle with.

00:47:03.864 --> 00:47:06.280
But what, actually, Steve did
when he recited the numbers,

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.560
he didn't recite
those individually.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.670
He said 610, 260, 1,000, 91.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.350
So actually what he did, he
bunched the numbers together.

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:16.480
He wasn't reciting ten
bits of information.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.610
He was chunking
it into a smaller

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:21.384
amount, which puts it
below that threshold

00:47:21.384 --> 00:47:22.300
that you can memorise.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.950
And actually in other countries,
so France for instance,

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:26.380
if you go, their
telephone numbers

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.120
tend to be paired together.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.790
Which actually makes it easier
to remember the numbers,

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.710
because it's much easier
for you to remember

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:37.100
these chunks of numbers rather
than just a single sequence.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.770
I can actually guarantee
that all of you

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.560
will remember this number
when you go home tonight.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.070
And that's actually if you
split it apart, and add

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.960
in some punctuation,
and then flip it around,

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.570
that's just the time
and date of this talk.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.270
So all of you now
will know that number

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.311
and be able to recite it.

00:47:50.311 --> 00:47:52.690
And the reason is you've gone
from 10 bits of seemingly

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:54.130
arbitrary information
down to one

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.920
that clearly has
some meaning to you.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.570
And this ability to
chunk is something

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.974
that card counters employ,
because clearly memorising

00:48:00.974 --> 00:48:02.890
a whole deck of cards
is incredibly difficult.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:05.140
So what they do is they use
what's known as bucketing.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.630
They will group into say,
low cards, medium cards,

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:08.382
high cards.

00:48:08.382 --> 00:48:10.590
And then rather than having
to memorise a whole deck,

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.970
they only have these
three buckets to remember.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.350
And what's more, it's kind
of a memoryless properties.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.975
They don't have to
remember everything.

00:48:16.975 --> 00:48:19.640
They can just keep the
tallies of these three values.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.348
Of course there are
some people out there

00:48:21.348 --> 00:48:23.980
that can memorise
vast numbers of cards.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.530
The top memory champions can
memorise about a thousand

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:27.310
cards in an hour--

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:28.810
a thousand playing
cards in an hour.

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:29.832
That's remarkable.

00:48:29.832 --> 00:48:31.540
And the way they do
that is they actually

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.306
attach characters to the cards.

00:48:33.306 --> 00:48:34.930
This will make them
people and objects.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.820
And they attach a story to that.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.000
And similarly while you
will all remember this,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.350
because you're not
remembering a number.

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.430
You're remembering an event.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:43.804
You're remembering
a single thing

00:48:43.804 --> 00:48:45.430
which is much more memorable.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.890
And that's really
kind of how humans

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:51.340
can get around this idea of
the limitation of memory.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.420
But there are some disadvantages
to learning about your opponent

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.080
and remembering
things and trying

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.520
to take advantage of them.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.020
And that's if your
opponent's incredibly smart,

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.459
they could teach you the
wrong image of themselves.

00:49:04.459 --> 00:49:07.000
So it's what's known as the get
taught and exploited problem.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.583
If you're playing
poker, for instance,

00:49:08.583 --> 00:49:10.810
your opponent could
pretend to be very passive

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.490
and pretend to be very timid.

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.911
And then once you learned
that notion of how they play,

00:49:14.911 --> 00:49:17.535
they could actually switch their
behaviour and exploit the fact

00:49:17.535 --> 00:49:21.376
that you've learned the
incorrect perception of them.

00:49:21.376 --> 00:49:22.750
It's not just
poker this happens.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.550
A couple of months
ago, you may have

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:28.960
seen it, a Microsoft launch of a
bot for Twitter to learn from--

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.377
I see you can see
where this is going--

00:49:31.377 --> 00:49:32.460
to try and learn language.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.543
And the idea was to have
conversations and improve

00:49:34.543 --> 00:49:36.992
its ability to learn.

00:49:36.992 --> 00:49:38.950
Twitter users unfortunately
decided to teach it

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:42.710
some unfortunate tricks.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.440
What actually happened
within 24 hours,

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.856
it had to be taken down, because
it was coming out with so

00:49:46.856 --> 00:49:48.329
many horrendous opinions.

00:49:48.329 --> 00:49:49.870
I think that's an
example of you have

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:51.900
quite an intelligent algorithm.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.420
But if it's being fed
the wrong image of what

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.610
it should be doing, it can
actually veer off track

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.244
very quickly.

00:49:59.244 --> 00:50:00.660
And this point of
here I've talked

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.200
about poker bots who have
played billions of games

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.241
to refine their strategy.

00:50:03.241 --> 00:50:04.895
I've talked about
these language bots.

00:50:04.895 --> 00:50:08.200
But in many situations, these
bots aren't very complicated.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.830
In finance, for example,
programmes are designed to be

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:12.400
fast.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.620
If you're trading-- if you
want to get a trade off,

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.040
you need to do that quickly.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.900
So having that huge
amount of complexity,

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.890
and nuance, and rationality
in your algorithm

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.060
isn't going to do the job.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.130
You really want to strip it
down as simple as possible.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:25.921
In many cases, these
high speed algorithms,

00:50:25.921 --> 00:50:27.850
you might just have
a few lines of code.

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:30.645
And there's one economics
researcher I talked to put it,

00:50:30.645 --> 00:50:32.020
when you're at
ten lines of code,

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.894
you're not even at insect
level intelligence.

00:50:33.894 --> 00:50:36.840
You've got no rationality
and no nuance in there.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.040
You're just trying
to execute the trades

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.560
as quickly as possible.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.370
In some situations this means
that you can run into trouble.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:46.610
There's a case
recently in Norway,

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.310
where two traders had
noticed that a US stock

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.150
broker had an algorithm that was
feeding trades at the market.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:54.610
And the algorithm
would always react

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.300
to a trade in the same way.

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.220
In other words, if
you traded with it,

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.053
it would change its
price by the same amount

00:50:59.053 --> 00:51:01.180
no matter how big
that trade was.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.850
So what these
people in Norway did

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.656
was teach the
algorithm what to do.

00:51:05.656 --> 00:51:07.030
So it made lots
of little trades.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.850
So it would move its price
up and then make a big trade

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:11.320
and profit from the difference.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.320
Now this ended up in court.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.720
These two traders were charged
with market manipulation

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.750
and handed suspended sentences.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.240
But then there's a
Robin Hood reputation

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.800
in the media for them in Norway.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.270
And it went to appeal.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:27.700
And their appeal
lawyer made the point

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:31.240
of if they had been trading
against a stupid human who

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.652
was doing this, that
wouldn't be a problem.

00:51:33.652 --> 00:51:35.110
The issue is that
they were trading

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:37.450
at a stupid algorithm
presumably created

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:40.725
by a human that hadn't been
thinking what they were doing.

00:51:40.725 --> 00:51:42.100
And how should
this be different?

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.141
How should the notion of
skill and responsibility

00:51:44.141 --> 00:51:46.262
be different because
as a kind of one step

00:51:46.262 --> 00:51:47.220
away for the algorithm?

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.080
And actually this
argument held in court.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.000
And in this situation,
they were actually--

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.432
this sentence was revoked.

00:51:55.432 --> 00:51:57.015
And this isn't the
first it's instance

00:51:57.015 --> 00:52:00.061
a very simple algorithm
would fall into trouble.

00:52:00.061 --> 00:52:02.530
A similar point actually--

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:06.259
a US stock broker was
introducing a new algorithm

00:52:06.259 --> 00:52:07.550
to feed orders into the market.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.040
So you have a lot of
orders from clients

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:09.940
coming into the stock broker.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.356
And it would want
to feed them in.

00:52:11.356 --> 00:52:13.257
They had eight
servers doing this.

00:52:13.257 --> 00:52:15.340
What they had is a counter
actually to keep track,

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.680
because obviously if you got
lots of orders coming in,

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.430
and you're sending
them out to the market,

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.090
you want to keep track of
how many you've completed.

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:24.020
You don't want to
accidentally make too many.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.020
And they had one of these
counts at each server.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.090
And then they updated
their software.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.270
But by all accounts, they
didn't add the counter

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:32.892
to the eighth server.

00:52:32.892 --> 00:52:35.350
So there are seven servers that
knew what they were doing--

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.170
the eighth one that was
kind of doing its own thing.

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:40.000
And when this went
live, what happened

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.791
was the seven were
behaving as they should.

00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:45.266
The eighth just peppered the
market with high speed trades.

00:52:45.266 --> 00:52:46.932
And actually by the
time they worked out

00:52:46.932 --> 00:52:48.460
what was happening
and shut it down,

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.630
in 45 minutes it had
lost about $450 million.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:56.830
So that's a $170,000 a second
for this runaway algorithm,

00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:59.530
because it was acting
so fast and so much

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:01.586
beyond what humans
could control.

00:53:01.586 --> 00:53:02.960
And you might call
that bad luck.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.290
You might call that
error in skill.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:10.539
And I think those cases around
these kind of games and chance

00:53:10.539 --> 00:53:11.830
events are developing actually.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:13.830
In the US in recent
years, there's

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:18.130
been a big crackdown on
poker, particularly online.

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.381
And as well in 2012,
there was a crackdown

00:53:20.381 --> 00:53:22.255
on New York on poker
rooms on a gentleman who

00:53:22.255 --> 00:53:25.000
was running a poker room
that was taken to court

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.700
and charged with operating
a gambling operation.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:32.250
Now many casino games in federal
law are defined as gambling.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.490
But poker isn't one of them.

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.260
So actually whether
it was gambling or not

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.577
was up for debate.

00:53:36.577 --> 00:53:38.910
And in federal law, gambling
is defined as anything that

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:40.462
is predominantly due to chance.

00:53:40.462 --> 00:53:42.670
So any game that's predominantly
the result of chance

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:45.844
is defined as gambling.

00:53:45.844 --> 00:53:48.010
So what happened is this
entire legal case rested on

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:50.650
is poker a game of chance
or a game of skill.

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:53.610
And they got economists
coming in-- mathematicians.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:56.009
And they made the point that
on a single game of poker,

00:53:56.009 --> 00:53:57.550
of course there's
an element of luck,

00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:58.633
because you got this deal.

00:53:58.633 --> 00:54:00.389
But then equally in
baseball, if someone's

00:54:00.389 --> 00:54:01.930
pitching a single
ball, there's going

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.690
to be an element
of chance involved.

00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:06.740
But over the course
of a poker game,

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.100
typically the more
skillful players won.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.500
And this was the first time
actually that a US court

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.979
had ruled on whether
poker is a game of chance

00:54:13.979 --> 00:54:14.770
or a game of skill.

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:17.920
And they ruled that it
was a game of skill.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.900
There's a footnote
to this story.

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.880
The following year when it went
to the State Appeals Court.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.630
Now in New York
state law, gambling

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:28.777
is defined as anything that has
a material element of chance.

00:54:28.777 --> 00:54:31.360
So if you think about this, this
is a much narrower definition

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:31.930
of gambling.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:33.287
It's not predominantly chance.

00:54:33.287 --> 00:54:34.870
It's anything with
a material element,

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.160
which clearly poker does have.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.900
And under this condition
it's defined as gambling.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.080
And this debate is ongoing.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.913
If you look fancy sports
in the US and a lot

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:44.926
of these systems where--

00:54:44.926 --> 00:54:46.300
do we have something
that's luck.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.590
Do we have something
that's skill?

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:49.360
Where do we-- do we
actually define these things

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:49.860
as gambling?

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.622
I think there's
often a temptation

00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:53.830
in fact with these situations
to put things in boxes.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.850
We like to say there's
a box with luck,

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:57.175
and there's a box with skill.

00:54:57.175 --> 00:54:59.050
I think typically if
we're good at something,

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:00.430
it goes in the box on the right.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:03.595
If we're bad at something, it
goes in the box on the left.

00:55:03.595 --> 00:55:04.720
And that's really tempting.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.370
But I don't think it's a
realistic notion necessarily.

00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:11.169
I think particularly
through the history

00:55:11.169 --> 00:55:13.085
of how people have tackled
games like roulette

00:55:13.085 --> 00:55:15.300
and with lotteries is
much more of a spectrum.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.020
And actually games
that we might think

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.960
are the archetype of luck,
things like roulette,

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.270
actually if you have
a skillful approach

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:24.010
you can tame that chance.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:27.190
And you can convert it into
some element of a game of skill.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.080
And even games
that we might think

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.080
are incredibly, almost
solely the work of skill,

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.300
games like chess can have
surprising results of chance.

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.610
In the '90s, famously, IBM's
Deep Blue chess computer

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.510
played Gary Kasparov.

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:44.350
And during the match in
one of the early games,

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:46.660
there was a situation
where Deep Blue made

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:51.190
a move that was so unexpected
and almost so subtle

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.284
that it threw
Kasparov off a bit--

00:55:53.284 --> 00:55:54.700
all accounts
convinced him that he

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.450
was playing something
that was just simply

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.557
beyond what he was--

00:55:58.557 --> 00:56:00.390
ever seen before-- just
something completely

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.682
beyond his capability.

00:56:02.682 --> 00:56:04.390
It turned out actually
that what happened

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.931
there is Deep Blue had run into
a situation where it couldn't

00:56:06.931 --> 00:56:08.145
identify the best move.

00:56:08.145 --> 00:56:09.520
And in that
situation it had been

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.620
programmed to pick randomly.

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.610
So this set of games that
is one of the landmarks

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:18.730
in artificial intelligence
over humans in a game

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:21.340
that is thought
to be purely skill

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:26.470
was actually really shaped
by this chance event.

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:30.760
And I think these kind of
illustrations show why gambling

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.010
and why these games of
chance are so important.

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.350
Because really
whatever your views

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:38.860
are of casinos and
bookmakers, gambling

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:40.500
is an inherent part of life.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.520
Betting is an inherent
part of what we do,

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.210
whether it's in health in
prediction on this side--

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:46.370
whether it's in business--
whether in finance.

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.620
We have to make decisions
with hidden information.

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.330
We have to deal
with uncertainty.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:53.830
We have to balance the
risks against the rewards.

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:57.697
I think that's why historically
so many researchers have

00:56:57.697 --> 00:56:59.780
been interested in gambling
and continue to do so.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:03.650
Because really if you want to
understand luck, and decision

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:07.400
making, and risk, then
arguably there's no way better

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.271
to start than with a bet.

00:57:09.271 --> 00:57:09.770
Thank you.

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:12.572
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:17.200
What your view of where
investing in the stock market

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.910
might fall between
luck and skill,

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:22.560
should I pay somebody a
2% fee for their skill

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.250
at investing my money?

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:27.960
Or should I just rely
on buying the market?
