00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.460
From a distance, it can all seem very silly.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.580
These people have gone to Lourdes, in the foothills of the Pyrenees,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.800
in the hope that the Virgin Mary might cure them of cancer and heart disease.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.720
These people have gone to Medjugorje in Bosnia Herzegovina

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.640
to pray they might get a chance to talk to dead beloved relatives.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.940
And these people are praying at the Western Wailing Wall of the old Jewish Temple in Jeruselam

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.680
and leaving all sort of notes for God to read in the cracks between the stones.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.640
No wonder some Atheists just think the whole of religion is ludicrous,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.500
and they aren't bothered about saying so very directly.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.060
But that's the wrong way to look at religion.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.420
What religion teaches us isn't about what's true,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.820
but about what many of us here on earth desperately want to be true,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.960
for some pretty understandable reasons.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.180
At one point in the bible, Jesus goes into the house of a man called Jarus,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.060
whose 12-year-old daughter has just died.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.160
Everyone is weeping and lamenting. But Jesus calmly says that she's not dead, she's just asleep.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.260
"Little girl, I say to you get up!" He says.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.300
We shouldn't laugh or dismiss the whole thing as nonsense.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.340
When your child is very sick, you may well end up believing in miracles.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.900
Because at the end of the day, under immense psychological pressures,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.920
you love your child more than you care about the laws of physics and biology.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.780
And when your loved ones do die, it can take a very robust mind indeed

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.440
not to imagine, late at night when the sadness becomes overwhelming,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.920
that somehow your parent, or child, or friend, is somewhere still around and in a better place than they were.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.020
And that they might be able to see us as we go about our daily lives

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.340
and forgive us and understand what we, perhaps, never found a way to say to them.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.020
And when you're in a complete mess, and all you want to do is cry in shame,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.340
you might well start to long for someone who could understand. Someone wise and forgiving,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.680
with kindly sympathetic eyes who wont judge and will be patient and kindly, like an ideal mother.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.280
Science may very rightly deny the existence of the Virgin Mary, let alone paradise and miracles.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.160
But these beliefs shouldn't just be interpreted as pieces of stupidity.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.400
They are signs of extreme emotional distress and desperation,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.820
which should rightly elicit in us understanding and sympathy.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.180
Religious beliefs are, of course, technically false.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.580
But they're coming from a very tender and vulnerable place, which needs our empathy.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.480
Of course Atheists are technically right. But there's no point getting maddened by the apparent irrationality of the religious.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.440
We have to understand it and appreciate the intensity of the longings that lead some of us to believe in fantasies against all odds.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.700
Because reality is just sometimes unbearably painful.
