WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.070
Take around fat and carbon take around and then we can throw all that garbage

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.080
into a Meta analysis.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.130
And the one thing I'm pretty confident as they did a poor job because the one

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.650
study I looked up,
the one with the biggest effect,

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.710
they mistook kilojoules for kilocalories.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.100
So they reported that 400 kilocalories decrease in energy expenditure on the low

7
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.330
fat diet one was a 400 kilo joule,
which is,
what's that factor?
You know,

8
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:31.820
these numbers,
uh,
0.8 0.18 or something.

9
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.660
Several of the other studies where Jim Hill Studies,
we've talked about Jim Hill,

10
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:38.680
the biggest studies where Jim Hill and the way we approached it,

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.960
the not for profit.
Let's say.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.380
You've got to understand what the question is and you've got to design an

13
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.880
experiment to get the right answer.
So when Stephen Dismiss this

14
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.040
<v 1>Harvard three names for him now deference to follow Dna,</v>

15
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.250
this DNA,
right?
Dr Ganek stepped up named Stephanie.

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.420
It's really easy to have fun.
I can do it,
do it.
I just don't get names.
Um,

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.520
my name's Joe.
I Gary that I know.
I do the um,

18
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.550
<v 0>Stephan,
uh,</v>

19
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.640
ultimately rejected this study about a $12 million study that was done at

20
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:20.690
Harvard based on Kevin Hall.
So these are two names.

21
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:25.691
It's about three people out there who are convinced that everything people like

22
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:28.670
me are saying is wrong or not everything but most of it.

23
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.550
And they keep coming up over and over again and they would.

24
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.730
So Kevin Hall claims that he has refuted the carbohydrate insulin model in his

25
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:41.330
studies.
So I want to study comes out supporting it.

26
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:45.170
He works to find out why that studies wrong.
We all did the same thing.

27
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.440
I did the same thing right here with the coolness study explaining why I don't

28
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.780
find that meaningful.
But anyway,
that's the thing.

29
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.650
The goal was to do the right study cause ultimately you got to remember what's

30
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:57.470
on the line here.
We have obesity and diabetes epidemics.

31
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.640
I mean tragic shit is going on out there.
I mean people,

32
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.630
you know these are ruining lives.
There are overwhelming the healthcare system.

33
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.340
And the argument I made is that for the past 50 years,
basically people,

34
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:15.341
I've thought a lot like Stephanie is thinking now doctor g and a and that there

35
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:21.260
appears to be another story that could be true and what we have to do is find

36
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:23.130
out if it is true because people are dying now and out

37
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.830
<v 1>their stuff.
Okay.
Um,</v>

38
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.920
the first thing I want to say is that this alternative explanation that Gary is

39
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:36.090
talking about has already been investigated intensively including studies that

40
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.130
were funded by his own organization.

41
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.300
Nusi two out of the three studies that have been published on that,

42
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.500
we're clear reputations of the hypothesis and no,
no,
no.

43
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:50.080
I'm gone responded here.
No,
no.
I know you've got to represent the studies.

44
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.480
Correct.
Gary,
Gary,
Gary,

45
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.740
I representing them according to your beliefs is not representing them
correctly.

46
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:56.574
Okay.

47
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.700
Now I've noticed a remarkable correlation between studies undermining your

48
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.180
beliefs and you thinking those studies are garbage and we should talk about uh,

49
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.870
Jim Hill and his studies a little bit because you know,
to me just saying,

50
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.860
this guy has a conflict of interest and then insinuating that that makes the

51
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.700
study bad if you can't actually find a problem with the study itself.

52
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.290
These were very rigorous studies.

53
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:23.830
If you cannot point out specific problem with the study,

54
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.540
it was designed with an assumption.

55
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.050
It was designed based on the assumption it was supposed,

56
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:30.430
it wasn't design how Gary wanted it to be designed.

57
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.290
If you cannot find a problem with that study,

58
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.050
then you can't just dismiss it by making these insinuations that the person had

59
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:45.220
a conflict of interest.
Okay.
I now into the problem though.
That's great.

60
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.510
Gary now [inaudible] on it at the time.
All right.

61
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:53.830
You're going to be able to respond in a moment.
Now the Cuna,

62
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.020
I think we should really get back to this issue,

63
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:01.021
this nonindustrial culture because the primary basis for Gary's book,

64
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:03.010
the case against sugar,

65
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.040
the primary observation that underlies Gary's belief on this is this

66
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.930
observational correlational thing that cultures,

67
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.230
when sugar gets into these cultures,

68
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.210
they become that and that is the common thread and in obesity and so what I'm

69
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:27.211
doing is I'm pointing out a culture where sugar came in and it did not make them

70
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:31.360
fat and that's one of three cultures.
I haven't even looked that hard.
Okay.

71
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.950
These are just three cultures that I came across is probably a bunch more that

72
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.750
are eating high levels of sugar,

73
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.990
but they're eight and are not welcome them into our hobbies.
And I think,

74
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.610
and again,
Joe explanation is right on point.

75
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.910
There's a lot of other things going on in these cultures and it's more

76
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:51.370
complicated than just sugar.
That's exactly my point.

77
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.670
Now I want to talk about the Cuban economic crisis.

78
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:59.671
This is reference number 22 from a 1989 through 1995 the Cuban economy collapsed

79
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.810
and the price of food went way up.
The price of gasoline went way up,

80
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.650
and so people started focusing on these really cheap foods.

81
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.920
Cuba was a major sugar producer at the time.
I don't know if they still are,

82
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.480
and so the intake of sugar went way up and take a refined carbohydrate,

83
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:27.481
went way up the Diet became a 77% carbohydrate,

84
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.740
primarily white rice and sugar,

85
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.400
28% sugar of their total calorie intake.

86
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.380
So that's like double what Americans eat.

87
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.810
Now their calorie intake went down and because of the lack of gasoline,

88
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:44.500
people got really physically active because they had to walk everywhere.

89
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.620
So now again,
if this is,

90
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:52.300
this is a situation where we can test Gary's hypothesis.

91
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.760
If Gary is right and calories don't matter,

92
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.890
only refined carbohydrate and sugar matter,

93
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.160
obesity should have gone through the roof in this population over that period of

94
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.994
time.

95
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.560
What you actually see is that the prevalence of obesity declined by half.

96
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.530
So there was a 50% decline.

97
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.800
It went from 14% to 7% over the period of this increase in sugar intake,

98
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.730
increase in refined carbohydrate intake.
And you might think,

99
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:21.830
well these people are just starving like crazy.

100
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.230
And that's why obesity rate went down.
Well,

101
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:28.340
we actually have evidence on the rate of underweight as well.

102
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.570
And so we can check on that.

103
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.440
The rate of underweight increased only slightly went from 8% to 10%.

104
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.920
And so we know these people weren't just totally starving.
Um,

105
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.250
and what happened then was as the Diet rebounded,

106
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:47.870
as the economy rebounded in the diet rebounded and their diets shifted away from

107
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:51.740
these refined carbohydrates and sugar and back to the normal diet that was

108
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:55.760
higher in,
uh,
in fats and lower in carbohydrate,
lower in sugar,

109
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.450
the obesity rate went right back up as soon as they went back to their normal

110
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:04.010
diet.
And so I find this,
cause there were,
there were not walking as much.
Yeah,

111
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:07.370
I was the exercise and also just their diet became richer again.
I mean,

112
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:10.070
if you're eating a diet that's a very poor diet,

113
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.890
eating white rice and sugar,
I mean it,

114
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.070
it's not like if that's most of what if you're sitting there and on your plate

115
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.600
is a white rice and sugar,

116
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.440
you're not going to be eating a ton of that and getting fat as opposed to eating

117
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:28.180
a rich or diet with more varied foods.
And so,
um,

118
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.600
this is a case where you have an entire country testing Gary's hypothesis and

119
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:37.250
finding that basically the opposite of what his hypothesis predicts.

120
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.003
Yeah.

121
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.050
<v 0>Uh,
let's go with the,
when he was refuting the studies and you want to go,</v>

122
00:07:43.051 --> 00:07:46.350
but this was a level of this course I didn't really want to get into because

123
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:48.360
that's the study that I'm going to have to read and he's right.

124
00:07:48.361 --> 00:07:50.610
I'm going to read it to try and figure out what the problem is.

125
00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:55.050
I remember looking at that study and thinking there wasn't the kind of data

126
00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:57.810
you're citing.
Maybe there's multiple studies put together,

127
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.110
but the one study I looked at,
the kind of data you're citing wasn't in there.

128
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.430
That this is again a preferences are on my website.
So have at it.

129
00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:10.200
No I will but we'll be off the air by then.
Um,
the beginning of his,

130
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.610
when he started talking it was referencing some studies and you had a problem

131
00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:19.380
with that.
Well they did this whole,
it's a game.
People plan again.

132
00:08:19.381 --> 00:08:22.170
It's why basically in my book I try not to get into,

133
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.230
he said she said studies cause you never know how well they did.

134
00:08:25.231 --> 00:08:29.700
I think we both agree that there's a reproducibility crisis in science.

135
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.330
Some huge proportion of the studies are just wrong.

136
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.450
Whether their experiments or observations,

137
00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:38.520
people sometimes aren't very good at what they do.

138
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.840
And so anyone in either business,
you have to,
Steven likes to say,

139
00:08:42.841 --> 00:08:45.270
I have no evidence,
Stephan dammit.

140
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.720
But simultaneously people accuse me of writing a 600 page book with 150 pages of

141
00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:53.460
references that was too long to read.

142
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.660
So there's clearly evidence this observation in this hypothesis.

143
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.670
My issue with Stephen

144
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.430
is that he speaks as though he knows what this authority.

145
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:06.300
And so again,

146
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:10.170
I would like to just read a little bit from your book because as I was prepping

147
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.260
<v 1>was for you do that though.
The,
he was referencing steady Cuban situation.</v>

148
00:09:15.261 --> 00:09:17.740
I don't know what the reality is.
Before that,
when,

149
00:09:17.741 --> 00:09:19.010
when you first started talking,

150
00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:23.690
he was referencing things that you are stating that he was saying.

151
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:25.850
What were you saying?
That uh,
the,
the,

152
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.770
the organization that supports him actually refuted.

153
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:32.740
So that was jam health study.
Yes.
The,
uh,

154
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.850
the new studies.

155
00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:36.980
And now we're talking about the nuisance today on the first two of which,

156
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.170
and we can get,
we can get into detail on this,
on how those refuted Gary's,
uh,

157
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:41.991
beliefs.

158
00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:45.290
And I would say Gary is about the only person who thinks that they did not

159
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:46.190
refute his beliefs.

160
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.720
The scientific community is pretty unanimous and respond,
but,

161
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.920
but could you please say what was,
what would the study stayed them yet?
Gary,

162
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.910
let me do it before he did.
The first study is

163
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.250
<v 0>as a pilot study that,
uh,</v>

164
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.860
depends what you look at to depend whether or not it refuted your beliefs.

165
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:08.930
So there again,
you have to understand this world.

166
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.930
There are researchers who believe one thing,

167
00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:16.680
Kevin Hall at Nih tends to believe that obesity is an energy balance problem and

168
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.850
people get fat because I ate too much.
I hope I'm doing Kevin Justice.
Um,

169
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.300
and then there's David Ludwig and his colleagues at Harvard who tend to believe

170
00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:31.301
what I believe and we funded them both to do studies and Kevin Hall study.

171
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.510
Uh,
if you believe what Kevin Re,

172
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.440
if you believe Kevin interpreted it correctly,
uh,

173
00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:42.380
was not supportive of this model,

174
00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:47.060
that carbohydrates are ultimately driving insulin and insulin is driving up fat

175
00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:50.540
accumulation.
And then the David Ludwig study,
uh,

176
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.550
reported the opposite and,

177
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:58.551
and David has criticized Kevin Study and Kevin has criticized David study and

178
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:01.760
this,
it's the nature of science.
This is what you're doing.
Science.

179
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:05.660
You're doing an experiment.
People critique it.
Ideally you do another one.

180
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.470
Kevin has decided while Kevin is doing another one,

181
00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:11.150
I think he's asking the wrong questions,

182
00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:14.680
but what I just saw the other day that he's doing another experiment.
Um,

183
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.690
today the middle study was a tree living diet study where,
uh,

184
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.390
done by Christopher Gardner at Stanford University.

185
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:28.391
And the idea was a original idea was 600 people randomized to either a very low

186
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:34.010
carbohydrate diet or a very low fat diet.

187
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:38.930
And we funded it in part because we hoped that Christopher would be able to get

188
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.680
people to almost a ketogenic diet on that low carb side.

189
00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:47.540
And Dean Ornish who promotes a low fat diet always complained that the low fat

190
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:52.040
diet wasn't fat enough.
So hopefully they'd be able to separate out these two.

191
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.350
Um,
at the end of the trial,

192
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.670
they got pretty lousy adherence.

193
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.460
A low carb was about 25 to 28% carb,

194
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:08.320
which is by no means a low integrated,
pretty typical in free living.

195
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:12.940
Studies in the low fat was about equal.
Um,
what they did,
which it's funny,

196
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:16.210
we realize this on one side,
but not the other.
Um,

197
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.850
they told the low carb group not to eat sugars and refined grains,

198
00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:26.740
which are by my hypothesis,
the most fattening carbohydrates.

199
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.770
And they also told the low fat group to naughty refined sugars and refined

200
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:33.424
grains.

201
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.640
So they basically removed the most fattening parts of the Diet from both arms of

202
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:39.821
the study.
It's funny,

203
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:42.550
we knew that we're going to do it with the low carb group cause you have to,

204
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.670
and my colleagues actually knew they were going to do it with the low fat group.

205
00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:47.170
I didn't know that.
When I found out,

206
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:50.290
I was stunned because now you're testing two diets.

207
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.540
Neither one of them have sugar or white bread.

208
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.200
So now you see similar weight loss with relatively poor compliance.

209
00:12:58.681 --> 00:13:01.070
Why would they do that?
That doesn't make any sense with the,
uh,

210
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.960
well their argument and we,
we talked to Chris for a lot of his argument.

211
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:09.670
He was afraid there were two things on,
he wanted to die to be healthy.
Okay.

212
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.700
So a healthy diet in 2015 has become a diet that doesn't have sugar and white

213
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:16.240
bread in it.

214
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.070
So he wasn't going to promote sugar and white bread to one died or they know,
um,

215
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.370
I take some long as the period of time where they're studying these people.

216
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.950
They were on the die.
They were supposed to be on the Diet for a year.
Okay,

217
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:29.320
that makes sense then.
Yeah.
So that's the question is again,

218
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:30.910
would you expect to see a difference?

219
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:35.911
I can send you an email I wrote to my new see colleagues in 2015 I could read it

220
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.880
when I found out about this low fat thing saying this is insane.

221
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:44.560
He's removed the,
the,
they're both groups are carbohydrate restricted.

222
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.450
So you could think of it as a low fat carbohydrate restricted diet and a high

223
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:53.050
fat carbohydrate restricted diet.
And then he kind of got the same answer,

224
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:57.400
which could be for any reason whatsoever.
There's a paper,
uh,

225
00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:59.680
I don't know if I can,
well,
I'm not going to talk about,

226
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:03.730
it's bad enough talking about ambiguous studies that have been published without

227
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:08.470
getting into on publish research.
But so people see this,
the New York Times,

228
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:12.490
for instance,
the two stories on it,
one of them said it's not about calories,

229
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:14.920
it's about the quality,
the sugar.

230
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:18.550
And they're fine grain because both groups restricted sugar and refined grains

231
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:19.390
and lost weight.

232
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.710
The other and that was written by a reporter who tends to believe what we

233
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:26.080
believe.
And the other article said,

234
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:29.860
it's all about the calories because both groups ended up on average eating 500

235
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:31.360
calories each at the end up.

236
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.240
From a scientific perspective being a poorly done study,

237
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:38.140
even though we funded it,
I'm not,
it's just,
it didn't answer the question.

238
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:42.370
You said 500 calories each fight and your carriage calories calorie,

239
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.270
that's actually self reported.
So it's not,
it's not particularly meaningful.

240
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.540
So again,
these are,
I don't like using,

241
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.790
it's a complicated study because it's low in sugar.

242
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.880
Well I want to tell us a free living.
Yeah,
so both sides are low in sugar.

243
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:57.950
Both sides are not eating processed.

244
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.510
They were two full differences in total carbohydrate intake.
Okay.

245
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:07.511
So even though they were both not eating as much refined carbohydrate,

246
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.770
they were still two full differences or greater over the period of that study in

247
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:15.400
total carbohydrate intake.
If you believed.
Now,

248
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.420
frequency questionnaires that you just said,

249
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:21.650
we don't know whether we have a way you could be talking about vegetables,

250
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:23.950
you could be talking about fruits.
Well,

251
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.620
these are healthy carbohydrates that they had primarily in this study.

252
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.820
Now we agree that that study can be interpreted from virtually any way you want

253
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:36.380
it,
especially because it was a free 11.
Definitely don't agree with that.
Um,
now,

254
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.950
now what we will agree on,
I'll agree with you on this,

255
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.090
is that refined carbohydrates and sugar are the most fattening type of

256
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:47.600
carbohydrate that we can agree on.
My God,
we came to an agreement.

257
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.520
But the question then the question is why is it because people eat too much of,

258
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.920
here's the thing.
If you,
if you believe Gary's hypothesis now,

259
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.250
any kind of carbohydrate increases insulin levels.

260
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.820
Some do it more than others are fine carbohydrates do it more.

261
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.860
Any kind of carbohydrate increases insulin levels relative to fat.
Okay?

262
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:12.310
And so if that is true and these groups and that matters for fat loss,

263
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.430
these groups had to fold differences in carbohydrate intake,

264
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.610
even though it was predominantly healthy carbs,
you would,

265
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.810
should a seen something,

266
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:24.140
you shouldn't have seen the exact same amount of weight loss in these two
groups,

267
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:28.760
right?
Right.
But they're not high in sugar.
Your argument is always,

268
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.560
well that's the other part of the argument,

269
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:33.710
which is you take away the sugar and that was the problem with one of the

270
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:37.670
problems with the attic.
Yeah.
The argument I make in and stuff,

271
00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:41.060
it's completely right and I'm defending my hypothesis.
Okay,

272
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:45.090
I see a study that that he does the same thing.
He did it here.
We all do it.

273
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:46.820
Do you see a study that disagrees with you?

274
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:51.800
You find the reason why to not believe it in every study ever done has plenty of

275
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:53.510
reasons not to do and not to believe it.

276
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:57.080
That's why independent replication is something you always wanted to get another

277
00:16:57.081 --> 00:17:00.560
group to do the study.
Ideally a third group,
people come in,

278
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:04.400
they criticize the study,
then you do it again and again and again.

279
00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:06.890
And so you know what I was trying,
when we,

280
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:09.320
even when we started the nutrition science initiative,

281
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:11.090
that choice that was a nonprofit,

282
00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:15.020
the choice of the word initiative was to get nutrition researchers to an effect

283
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.380
s stop using these garbage,

284
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:22.880
poorly designed studies to come to conclusions because they like or dislike the

285
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:23.840
interpretation,

286
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.910
but try to get them to think the way harder scientists would and developing

287
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:31.460
studies that ask precisely the right question.

288
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.120
And then so even the pilot study that was interpreted as not supporting this

289
00:17:39.531 --> 00:17:40.790
hypothesis,
and again,

290
00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:44.390
you could argue that for an hour and nobody's going to care.

291
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.110
That study was not randomized.
So a non randomized study,

292
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:51.630
you can't infer causality.
It's that's why it was a pilot study.

293
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:55.170
One of the many reasons it was a pilot study of the people who think this

294
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:59.400
carbohydrate model.
So when we talk about the carbohydrate insulin model,

295
00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:04.230
it means carbohydrates are fattening.
That's the basis of it.
Bread,
pasta,

296
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:09.231
potato and sugar may be the thing that's necessary to add to the Diet to make

297
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:12.360
all these carbs fattening.
Cause sugar.

298
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:14.490
As we talked about this a year and a half ago,

299
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:18.420
the fructose molecule is metabolized in the liver.

300
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:23.380
It's linked to fat accumulation in the liver,
which is linked to insulin.

301
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.260
I like the way you're squeezing your stomach fat.

302
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:29.330
What we're talking about that I got to work out,
dude.
Um,

303
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.130
the uh,
just bored,
you know,

304
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.150
for these experiments to be done right there,

305
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.480
they have to be tested right and he can't use poor.

306
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:42.290
It's poorly designed experiments of poorly,
you know,

307
00:18:42.291 --> 00:18:43.680
in every experiment ever done.

308
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:47.920
And so what we've tried to do is keep working towards better experiments.

309
00:18:47.921 --> 00:18:52.380
There's now a new version of the Ludwick experiment being done at the Arnold

310
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:52.650
Foundation.

311
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.650
Lauren John Arnold funded to the tune of I think $13 million and whatever that

312
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:04.860
study finds Kevin Hall,
we'll probably find the reason,

313
00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:06.910
look in it and find a reason to question it.

314
00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:11.070
And ideally they would be working together so that you come up with the

315
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:15.540
criticisms before you've spent $13 million.
But this is how science works.

316
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.470
My job was to tell a good story is Stephanie would say,

317
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:23.370
and I believe people who read the books can judge whether they're good enough.

318
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.640
Am I convincing in arguing that you add sugar to counter evidence to everything?

319
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.980
There wasn't counter evidence wouldn't require a journalist to come along in 20

320
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.521
whatever it is,

321
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:39.120
19 lip to make these arguments ask you this because this is something that

322
00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:41.610
you've admitted to something you said rather.

323
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.480
Why are sugary carbohydrates the most fattening?

324
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.690
Well,
if this hypothesis is correct,

325
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:56.691
I think you would say that they trigger food reward or they are,

326
00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.210
wait,
wait,
let me just finish on it.

327
00:19:59.211 --> 00:20:03.480
I would say the counter argument is that they create a hormone,

328
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:08.250
a million in the body that that over response to insulin and insulin.

329
00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:13.251
What we have in said is if you look in a textbook for fat metabolism and fatty,

330
00:20:14.411 --> 00:20:16.860
yet you know what causes fat storage?

331
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.950
Insulin is the hormone that primarily regulates fat storage in your fat cells.

332
00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:27.210
So the idea is you raise insulin and the sugar because of this half of it being

333
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:31.770
fructose and that mostly being metabolized in the small intestine in the liver

334
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:37.230
seems may indeed cause insulin resistance.
And if it does you over respondents.

335
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:39.570
And so one is a peripheral explanation,

336
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.740
not that people don't love it and they don't want to,
you know,
over consume it,

337
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:46.800
whatever that means.
And the other is a central explanation.

338
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.390
<v 1>Yeah.
So I mean sugar is a factor that makes us want to eat foods,
right?</v>

339
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.990
I mean this is one of the many food properties I would love to talk about this

340
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:58.630
more.
That caused dopamine release in the brain.

341
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.960
And dopamine is a chemical that sets our motivational levels to do certain

342
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:04.954
behaviors.

343
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.280
So the reason we become addicted to drugs is that they go in the brain and they

344
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:13.920
stimulate dopamine release and that reinforces drug seeking behaviors.
Right?

345
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.930
But this is just causing you to consume more.
Correct.

346
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.090
But you're saying that the actual amount,

347
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.690
let's say if you have the same amount of carbohydrates that are sugary

348
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:26.460
carbohydrates versus the same amount that our vegetable,
carbohydrates,

349
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.650
sugary carbohydrates are going to be more fattening?
No,
no,

350
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:31.630
I didn't say it was independently of calories.

351
00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:34.060
It's still entirely dependent on calories.
Yeah,
correct.

352
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.630
And we have randomized controlled trials,
um,
demonstrating this.

353
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.170
So if you look at the randomized there,
by the way,
we're not,

354
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.140
we're not operating in an evidence vacuum.

355
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:48.280
There's tons of randomized controlled trials and sugar.
These random,

356
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.030
these randomized controlled studies,
are they short term?
Um,

357
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.750
it depends.
Well,
it depends on how you define short term.

358
00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:58.660
They're not lasting years and years and years isn't the issue though.

359
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:02.440
Longterm chronic effects like that seems to be possibly,

360
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:06.490
but let me put it this way.
You know,
if you believe that insulin is the,
cause,

361
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:11.620
the effect of insulin on fat cells happens almost immediately.

362
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.300
So Insulin,

363
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:18.670
I'm not aware of any mechanism of insulin on fat cells that takes more than a

364
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.410
few hours to occur.
And so if you believe that insulin causes obesity,

365
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:24.940
this should be happening immediately.

366
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:28.440
You shouldn't have to wait months and months for this to occur.
No,

367
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.950
that doesn't make any sense at all.
No,
it does make sense.
That makes sense.

368
00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:36.430
It makes sense.
You eat,
you eat carbohydrates sense to you.
Well,
because again,

369
00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:40.930
he's,
he's kind of making this up as he goes along.
So the idea is

370
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:46.630
we'll explain why it doesn't make sense without insulting.
That's possible.

371
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.800
Has he not been insulting me ever?
I might just biased.
Uh,
I realized that I,

372
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.660
it's everything was perspective but necessarily saying he's insulting your

373
00:22:55.661 --> 00:23:00.040
stories,
not you personally,
but what,
what,
what do you,
what,

374
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.920
why doesn't it make sense to,
okay.
So the idea is

375
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:09.370
when you're in someone's elevated,
you're storing fat,
right?
Uh,

376
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.920
it depends on what you mean by that.
That's not,

377
00:23:11.921 --> 00:23:14.170
see you do a little bit of Bait and switch here.

378
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.250
That's an end to just answer the question.
If it's a clarify.
Well,

379
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:20.380
it depends on what do you mean by store?
I mean,

380
00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:23.920
your fat cells are accumulating fat.
When insulin is elevated,

381
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.060
you mean accumulate?
Like,
like w next day you'll have to fat.

382
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.450
It inhibits,
uh,
uh,
yeah,
that's incorrect.

383
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.990
It stimulates light bulb protein lipase and it inhibits hormone incentives.

384
00:23:35.991 --> 00:23:38.830
We should,
we should talk about this because that's incorrect.

385
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.070
It's in the textbooks.
No.
Yeah,
we'll talk about what's in the textbook.

386
00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:45.050
Don't worry Gary.
They,
Jesus.
Um,

387
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.910
okay so you don't believe it but just give me your position and I'll let him

388
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:54.380
refute it.
I it's here but just say it.
Just want to show it.
Okay.

389
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.480
Cause again,
you're going to say it's not in here.

390
00:23:56.481 --> 00:24:00.540
So I have the same textbook and then we'll let Joe here.

391
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.620
Suppression of Fat Mobilization by Insulin and there's another graph that is a

392
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.240
stimulation of fat mobilization.

393
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:14.130
Congratulations to all of you people that are listening to this [inaudible]

394
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.030
hanging in there.
I know we're in the weeds scientific.

395
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.340
Let me just say this is going to take a long time.

396
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:22.310
So we agree on the molecular mechanisms.
Okay.

397
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.530
We agree on the molecular mechanisms,

398
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:27.980
the impact of insulin on enzymes and fat cells.

399
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.490
What we disagree about is the implications of that.

400
00:24:31.491 --> 00:24:35.570
And I think that's what we should talk about because nowhere in that textbook

401
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.840
does it say that insulin regulates the total size of body fat stores like that.

402
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.410
That is something that you both have added onto that mechanism.

403
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.160
Would you like to now a conversation I had with the author of,
no,

404
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.030
not right now actually.
So,
um,
the now the,

405
00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.120
let me tell you about the conversation.
Actually,
let me,
I should explain.

406
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.670
We talked for three hours.
Can you stop interrupting me please?
Okay,

407
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.060
now,
um,
let me explain.

408
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:13.090
So insulin essentially does have effects on enzymes that cause fat cells to take

409
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:18.980
up more fat and to release less fat.
So that's the part that you're right about.

410
00:25:18.981 --> 00:25:23.981
That's what that textbook talks about right now that does not mean,

411
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.560
that does not imply that insulin causes fat storage as in the accumulation of

412
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:32.300
fat from day to day.
And let me explain why that is.

413
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:37.750
So insulin is basically a traffic cop that allows your body to burn the fuel

414
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.680
that you just consumed.

415
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.330
So when you eat a diet that's high in carbohydrate and low in fat,

416
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.610
your insulin goes up,
your body restricts the fat from going out of fat cells.

417
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:51.620
It turns that down,
not off but down.

418
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.150
It causes less fat to come out of your fat cells and then your body's burning

419
00:25:56.151 --> 00:25:58.580
carbs.
That's what you just state right now.

420
00:25:58.581 --> 00:26:01.670
If you eat a diet that's high in fat and lower in carbohydrate,

421
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.650
you secrete less insulin.

422
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.980
Those effects don't occur on your fat cells and that allows your body to burn

423
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.720
the fat that you just ate.
But at the end of the day,

424
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.200
the amount of fat that you have in your body is the amount that you,

425
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:19.400
eight minus the amount that you burned.
That's what the terms,
the amount,

426
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:20.480
this is just arithmetic,

427
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:22.790
right amount that you eight minus the amount that you burned.

428
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.650
And if you eat a low fat diet,

429
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:26.540
you're not eating much and you're not burning much.

430
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:31.190
You're in the same place as if you're eating a diet where you're eating a lot of

431
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:33.500
fat,
um,
and burning a lot of fat.

432
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:37.820
And the way we know that's true is because varying the amount of carbohydrate

433
00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:40.430
and fat in the Diet makes no difference to buy.
