00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:11.020
What if I told you there were trillions
of tiny bacteria all around you?

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.499
It's true.

00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:16.598
Microorganisms called bacteria
were some of the first life forms

00:00:16.622 --> 00:00:17.764
to appear on Earth.

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:20.833
Though they consist of only a single cell,

00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:25.426
their total biomass is greater than
that of all plants and animals combined.

00:00:26.668 --> 00:00:28.618
And they live virtually everywhere:

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:30.995
on the ground, in the water,

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.531
on your kitchen table, on your skin,

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:35.210
even inside you.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:38.252
Don't reach for the panic button just yet.

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:42.072
Although you have 10 times
more bacterial cells inside you

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:43.993
than your body has human cells,

00:00:44.018 --> 00:00:48.081
many of these bacteria
are harmless or even beneficial,

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:50.246
helping digestion and immunity.

00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:54.871
But there are a few bad apples
that can cause harmful infections,

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:57.942
from minor inconveniences
to deadly epidemics.

00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:04.120
Fortunately, there are amazing medicines
designed to fight bacterial infections.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:08.020
Synthesized from chemicals or
occurring naturally in things like mold,

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:11.091
these antibiotics kill
or neutralize bacteria

00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:13.951
by interrupting cell wall synthesis

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:18.031
or interfering with vital processes
like protein synthesis,

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:20.369
all while leaving human cells unharmed.

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:24.430
The deployment of antibiotics
over the course of the 20th century

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:27.950
has rendered many previously
dangerous diseases easily treatable.

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:30.847
But today, more and more
of our antibiotics

00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:32.963
are becoming less effective.

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:35.564
Did something go wrong
to make them stop working?

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:40.423
The problem is not with the antibiotics
but the bacteria they were made to fight,

00:01:40.447 --> 00:01:43.797
and the reason lies in Darwin's theory
of natural selection.

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:46.238
Just like any other organisms,

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:49.596
individual bacteria
can undergo random mutations.

00:01:49.937 --> 00:01:53.211
Many of these mutations
are harmful or useless,

00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:56.584
but every now and then,
one comes along that gives its organism

00:01:56.608 --> 00:01:58.211
an edge in survival.

00:01:58.488 --> 00:01:59.870
And for a bacterium,

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:02.911
a mutation making it resistant
to a certain antibiotic

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.364
gives quite the edge.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.976
As the non-resistant bacteria
are killed off,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.350
which happens especially quickly
in antibiotic-rich environments,

00:02:11.374 --> 00:02:12.474
like hospitals,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.715
there is more room and resources
for the resistant ones to thrive,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.573
passing along only the mutated genes
that help them do so.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:21.905
Reproduction
isn't the only way to do this.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.572
Some can release their DNA upon death
to be picked up by other bacteria,

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:29.158
while others use a method
called conjugation,

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:32.107
connecting through pili
to share their genes.

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.833
Over time, the resistant
genes proliferate,

00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:37.837
creating entire strains
of resistant super bacteria.

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:42.561
So how much time do we have
before these superbugs take over?

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.823
Well, in some bacteria,
it's already happened.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.352
For instance, some strands
of staphylococcus aureus,

00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:54.157
which causes everything from
skin infections to pneumonia and sepsis,

00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.209
have developed into MRSA,

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:59.100
becoming resistant
to beta-lactam antibiotics,

00:02:59.124 --> 00:03:01.581
like penicillin, methicillin,
and oxacillin.

00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:07.377
Thanks to a gene that replaces the protein
beta-lactams normally target and bind to,

00:03:07.401 --> 00:03:10.836
MRSA can keep making
its cell walls unimpeded.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.885
Other super bacteria, like salmonella,

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.055
even sometimes produce enzymes
like beta-lactams

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.678
that break down antibiotic attackers
before they can do any damage,

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:23.415
and E. coli, a diverse group of bacteria

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.827
that contains strains that cause
diarrhea and kidney failure,

00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:28.963
can prevent the function of antibiotics,

00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:31.381
like quinolones, by actively
booting any invaders

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:33.214
that manage to enter the cell.

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:36.368
But there is good news.

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:39.587
Scientists are working to stay
one step ahead of the bacteria,

00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:41.705
and although development
of new antibiotics

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.373
has slowed in recent years,

00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:47.626
the World Health Organization has made it
a priority to develop novel treatments.

00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:51.249
Other scientists are investigating
alternate solutions,

00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:54.912
such as phage therapy
or using vaccines to prevent infections.

00:03:55.784 --> 00:03:59.597
Most importantly, curbing the excessive
and unnecessary use of antibiotics,

00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:02.660
such as for minor infections
that can resolve on their own,

00:04:02.684 --> 00:04:06.320
as well as changing medical practice
to prevent hospital infections,

00:04:06.344 --> 00:04:07.717
can have a major impact

00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:10.265
by keeping more
non-resistant bacteria alive

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.320
as competition for resistant strains.

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:16.815
In the war against super bacteria,
deescalation may sometimes work better

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.935
than an evolutionary arms race.
