Rafael: Hello, my name as Rafael Ramirez and
I'm a Senior Research Fellow at Oxford in

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.200
Futures, I also chair the Global Agenda Council
on Strategic Foresight and I'm there with

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.639
my colleague John from Singapore. I've been
asked to comment on whether China will pull

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.820
us out of the economic crisis. Part of the
problem is, who is us? Certainly in China

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.030
they don't seem to have very much of an economic
crisis. I just landed here from India, wherein

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.599
the growth is going off [ INAUDIBLE ]. So
if us is Europe, then we don't seem to count

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.530
for very much. If us is the West, we do seem
to count for something. I found it impossible

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.329
to fly directly from Mumbai to Beijing, no
direct flights. So the flights from Mumbai

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.160
and from Beijing seem to go to the west, but
not to each other. And I think one of the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.080
big challenges is the kind of relationships
that China and India have in relationship

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.780
to each other. There will be more people in
India in 2019 than China if current trends

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.690
continue. So India will matter as much as
as China in the mid- to long-term. And I know

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.920
from a scenario planning that it is very difficult
to think about the long-term when you are

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.130
caught in the midst of a termoil as we have
been in in Europe and the United States in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.420
the last 24 and 12 months. I think that the
question is what kind of role will China and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.880
India have in relation to each other and how
that plays out going forward and we should

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.170
think in 10 and 20 year terms horizons rather
than three year term horizon.
