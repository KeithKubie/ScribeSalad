00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.350
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, this is Crash Course
Economics, and today, we need to have a little

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.780
talk about a subject that most people try
to avoid. Death. We’re all going to die.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.300
Now, I know from our demographic analytics
that most of you are young, and you’re statistically

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.789
likely to live quite a bit longer. But it’s
still going to happen someday. And how and

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.980
when we die has some significant economic
impacts. So let’s all listen to the Crash Course song,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.740
watch the credits, have a small existential crisis, and then we’ll get down to the economics of death.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:39.760
[Theme Music]

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.200
Let me start by pointing out that my co-host
Jacob isn’t dead. He’s in Canada where

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.610
he’s writing a textbook and making econ
videos for his YouTube channel, ACDC Leadership.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.480
And probably still wearing ACDC belt buckles
everyday.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.470
Now, a couple of disclaimers. One: This is
not Crash Course philosophy. We’re not gonna

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.860
get into the moral issues surrounding death.
We don’t know what happens to you after

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.829
you die, although we will talk a little about
what happens to your money after you die.

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.509
Two: we’re going to focus on how death and
dying impact the economy of the United States.

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.399
And it’s not because we’re American exceptionalists
or something, it’s because we read and write

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.560
in English, and information on the US is readily
available to us.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.569
We know that attitudes and practices around
death differ throughout the world, but most

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.149
of our conversation is going to focus on death
in America.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.749
And no, Stan, not death to America. We focused
on that in World History.

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:36.269
All right, a little good news: on the whole, throughout the world, life expectancy at birth has been increasing.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:41.679
According to the United Nations, the global
average life expectancy has risen from 65

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:49.439
years for people born between 1990 and 1995,
to 70 years for those born between 2010 and 2015.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.240
But there are still some pretty big disparities.
People born in Africa have a life expectancy

00:01:54.249 --> 00:02:00.139
at birth that's 12 years less than the global
average, and 21 years less than the number

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:03.259
for those who live in North America. So that’s
not great.

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.479
In the United States, life expectancy has
changed dramatically in the last 50 years.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.380
Americans live longer than they used to, and
more and more of them die of natural causes.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.240
Accidents and murder and violent death in
general are way down. People are living longer.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.700
The Pew Research foundation reports that by
2010 in the United States, 31 percent of deaths

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.420
were among those aged 85 and older. This was
a huge change from 1968, when 12.5 percent

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.860
of people who died were in that age range.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.860
It’s not all roses though, I mean, this
is still an episode about dying.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.200
When we look at this data by income level,
the numbers look a little different.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.340
A recent study found that income levels affect
life expectancy. A lot.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.300
In 2010, an upper income man in the US was
expected to live to age 89. The same lower

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.600
income man would live to 76. And this
shortened lifespan has a big economic impact.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.240
In effect, the rich receive a lot more government
benefits over the course of their lives.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.240
That 89 year old upper-income man would collect an average of $522,000 dollars in government benefits during his life...

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.470
...while the lower-income man would only collect
an average of $391,000 dollars.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.270
So how do our on average longer lives
affect the economy?

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.160
Well, economic thought about this stuff varies.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.660
Some economists argue that increased lifespans are,
in a very basic sense, good for the economy.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.440
When people live longer, they have more years to consume stuff, contributing to economic growth.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.860
On the other hand, long life tends to come
with more health problems, and memory-related

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.460
illnesses have become much more prevalent.
In 1968, the Centers for Disease Control and

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.460
Prevention documented 293 deaths from
dementia, senility, and Alzheimer’s.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.620
In 2010, those illnesses accounted
for more than 180,000 deaths.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.680
The CDC also reports, five million Americans
suffered from Alzheimer’s and dementia in

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.940
2013, and that number was projected to
rise as high as 13.8 million by 2050.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.980
People with Alzheimer’s can live for a long time with the disease, and they need a lot of care, which is expensive.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.340
The cost of caring for patients with Alzhemier’s
and dementia was 200 billion dollars in 2012.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.240
And those costs could rise as high as a trillion
dollars by 2050. That's a lot of money.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.060
As you’ll recall from our Economics of Healthcare episode, the US already has the highest per capita

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.080
healthcare spending in the world, and end of life care accounts for a huge part of that spending.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.980
In 2012, 50 billion dollars of Medicare spending covered care for patients during the last 2 months of their lives.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.700
And that doesn’t account for the costs that families
absorb caring for dying family members at home.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.480
Medicare doesn’t cover all the costs of home health care, and direct care from family members often results in lost wages.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.310
It’s also worth asking exactly what we’re
buying with all this money. Surveys indicate

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.500
that the vast majority of people would prefer
to die at home, but more than 70 percent of

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.060
Americans die in nursing homes or hospitals.
Patients often end up receiving a tremendous

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.800
amount of care at the end of their lives.
The question we need to ask ourselves is whether

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.760
that intense and expensive level of care improves
life, or simply prolongs suffering.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.340
The answers to those questions tend to be mixed, and here we stray into the thorny territory of medical ethics.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:38.240
Studies indicate that many doctors and patients
are uncomfortable with the idea of having cost-of-care factor into end-of-life-decisions.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.140
No one wants to be denied a course of treatment
based on budget concerns.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.120
One widely agreeable option for cutting costs
in end-of-life care has grown out of a movement

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.260
meant to improve the quality of people’s
end-of-life experience.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.900
Hospice and palliative care treat patients’
symptoms and manage their pain as they die,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.480
rather than performing more and more procedures
in an attempt to prolong life.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.740
In 1982, the United States passed a law that
allowed Medicare to cover hospice benefits

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.060
for patients with terminal illnesses.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.500
While studies indicate that expanded access
to hospice and palliative care do work to

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.810
lower end-of-life costs, they’re by no means
a single solution to rising expenditures.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.290
For now though, let’s put aside the complex
mysteries of American health care costs and

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.380
agree that dying is expensive.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.390
And we haven’t even started counting what
it costs to actually be dead.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.710
Once we get beyond the costs associated with dying, we’re still left with the cost of disposing of our bodies.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.360
Let’s talk about what happens to you when you die,
and how much is costs, in the Thought Bubble.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.620
According to the National Funeral Directors
Association, the median price for a funeral

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:53.370
with viewing and burial in the United States
was $7,181 in 2014. The median price of a

00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:01.180
cremation and funeral was $6,078. And while the
two seem comparable, the costs of burial are

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:08.440
quite a bit higher, as that $7,181 doesn’t
include a burial plot or headstone.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.000
That $7,181 DOES include a bunch of stuff
though. Your funeral starts with something

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:20.710
called the basic non-declinable service fee,
which should run about $2000. That means for

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.930
a funeral professional to even look at your
body, it’s going to be two grand, and if

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.780
you want any sort of funeral, you’ll need
to pay up.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.699
The rest of the costs of a funeral are declinable,
but if you want a public funeral, you’re

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.380
probably going to want to pay them. Let’s
add it up. The median price of transporting

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:45.020
a body from the hospital or home to the funeral
facility is $310. Embalming will run you $635.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.880
Other preparation of the body, like makeup
and dressing is about $250.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.620
Use of the funeral home facilities and staff
for viewing and ceremony; that’ll be around $915.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.640
The median hearse rental is $318.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:07.460
Printing up memorial cards runs $155, and
the median price of a metal casket is $2395.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.979
Add a headstone and burial plot (which like
all real estate can vary widely in price,

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:16.440
depending on what kind of neighbors you want),
with everything included, the price of a funeral

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.400
in the US can run as high as $15,000 dollars
or more.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.850
Thanks, Thought Bubble. All this is to say
that dying in the United States is really,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:30.360
really expensive, even after you’re dead.
And funeral costs can be hard to absorb, especially

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.120
when combined with the massive doctor and
hospital bills that can be a side-effect of dying.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.320
If you’re lucky enough to die at an advanced
age, as most people in the US do, Social Security

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.560
does pay out a 255-dollar death benefit,
but that’s not going to cover your costs.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.260
That won’t even get you embalmed.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.560
So, what can we do to reduce some of the costs
of dying? The government does take a role

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.880
in reducing the cost of death. The Federal Trade Commission regulates the funeral industry, and

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:02.540
has very strict rules about what a funeral provider can and can’t charge for, and which charges are required.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.500
And a lot of changes to Medicare in recent
decades have looked at ways to cut costs,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:11.570
from paying for hospice care to reimbursing
doctors for discussing death with their patients.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:17.150
Which takes us very nicely to what we as individuals
can do to reduce some of some of those costs.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.500
Make a plan! Study after study recommend that
the best strategy to manage expenses for end

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:28.270
of life care and funeral costs is planning.
Doctors, funeral directors, and all manner

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:33.890
of experts advise us to put an advance directive
in place, write a will, make a plan for your

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.730
assets, and get some life insurance.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.320
The problem is, mortality is a difficult thing
to think about.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:45.400
To quote one 17th-century Frenchman: “One
cannot look directly at either the sun or death.”

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.040
Which is to say, people just don’t like
contemplating their own death. According to

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:55.040
the Pew Research Foundation, in 2013, only
37 percent of Americans reported that they

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.060
had given a “great deal of thought” to
their end of life wishes for medical care.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.380
And only 33 percent had put their wishes in
writing.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.959
But, when it comes to medical costs of dying,
putting advance directives in place with doctors

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:12.100
and loved ones can be very effective. If you
don’t want doctors to go to extreme and

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.910
extremely expensive measures to preserve your
life at all costs, make sure everybody knows

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.850
about it. When you’re not in a position
to make these decisions for yourself, you

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.130
want to be sure that whoever’s making the
decisions knows what you want.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.490
And when it comes to funerals, some of those
costs can be dealt with before you’re dead.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.770
Life insurance is readily available in the
United States, and is a pretty straightforward

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:38.060
way to insure that your loved ones at least
aren’t stuck with the bills for burying you.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.060
And What happens to your debt when you die?
Do your relatives have to pay it? Well it

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.680
all depends on the type of debt and the state
that you live in. If you die owing credit

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.040
card debt, and your estate doesn’t have
the money to pay it off—in many circumstances

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.160
your family won’t be legally obligated to
pay it back. The creditor is just out the money.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.200
But that doesn’t stop debt collectors from
trying to get families to pay up. If you find

00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:04.830
yourself being asked to pay off a dead relatives
debt—it’s worth investigating the state

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.310
law to find out if you REALLY have an obligation
to do so.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.420
If you make it through all the end-of-life
costs and you’re still solvent, you’re

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.980
also going to need a plan for your assets.
We don’t have time to get into the realm

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.270
of financial planning and estate taxes, but
the good news is, if you’ve made it this

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.250
far, you’re probably a good planner, or
have at least gotten some good advice.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.600
The least you can do is have a will in place
to guide the distribution of your assets.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.399
A good financial planner can let you in on
all ways you can move your money to the heirs

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:35.599
you really love, while avoiding expenses like
probate court and estate taxes.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.900
The fact is nobody likes to think about death.
But get over it. There are huge economic reasons,

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.330
on both the societal level and on the personal
level to face up to it. While a cost-effective

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.000
death is good for society, it may be small
comfort to your family. But if everything

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.940
is taken care of in advance, your family can focus on grieving, rather than straightening out your finances.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.980
