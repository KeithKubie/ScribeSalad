00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.120
I’m Keerti and I’m representing Octathorpe.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.780
Our game “Hitwicket Superstar”

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.700
is a unique strategy-based cricket game

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.620
where the user is the owner of a team.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.520
After we came back from the indie games accelerator,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.500
we’ve successfully migrated our entire server

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.200
to the Google’s cloud platform.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.680
We started using the firebase tool

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.300
for conducting several AB tests,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.980
trying to know our users deeper,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.540
their behaviour, their patterns.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.080
I think the program has really helped us

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.660
improve on a lot of fronts,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.460
be it in terns of tech, data analysis,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.040
predicting user’s behaviour,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.840
and implementing some really interesting

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.260
gameplay concepts.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.000
There has been an excellent network of mentors,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.140
fellow developers and the Play Store team

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.780
to help you get all the help, support

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.900
and guidance that you would need

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.960
in making your game.
