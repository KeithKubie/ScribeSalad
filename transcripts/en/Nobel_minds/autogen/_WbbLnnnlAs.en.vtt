00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:11.559
[Yan Shuang Lindblom] Firstly, congratulations
... what was your feeling when you received

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.650
the news of being awarded the Nobel Prize
in Literature?

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:26.560
[Mo Yan] I feel so surprised ... when I heard
this, because I considered the Nobel Prize

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.520
in Literature to be far away from me.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.260
[YSL] Many of Nobelprize.org's visitors are
high school students, which of your books

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.780
would be a good starting point for a young
person or newcomer to your work?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:01:01.660
[MY] I hope readers start with my book Life
and Death are Wearing Me Out which was published

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.149
in Sweden this year.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.450
Then read the others, such as Red Sorghum,
Big Breasts and Wide Hips and so on.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.470
I recommend Life and Death are Wearing Me
Out first because this book reflects my writing

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.570
style relatively comprehensively, and also
my exploration on the art of novel.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.390
[YSL] As a young man, what inspired you to
become a writer?

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.130
[MY] I started to read books when I was a
child.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:43.490
This triggered my strong interest in literature
after reading more and more books.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:57.210
I felt I had many words to express, I thought
the strongest and most unconstrained way was

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.229
through literature, so I started to write.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:12.980
Of course, I also had a desire to prove myself,
and a wish to change my destiny.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.510
[YSL] Could you introduce us to your creative
works?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:26.340
[MY] Right now I recommended my book Life
and Death are Wearing Me Out.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.740
Firstly this book deals with major issues
from Chinese history and reality, such as

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.050
the land issues, the farmers' issues.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.140
Secondly, in this book I have used the oriental
surreal wording.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:03:04.840
In this novel, the human and the animal can
switch freely, can observe the changes that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.120
Chinese society and history have underwent
in the last 50 years, through the eyes of

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120
the animal.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.280
In addition, I made many attempts in my use
of language to try the most free style and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.200
most unconstrained way to describe my ideas
from the heart.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:45.810
So I think this book is a relatively perfect
and uniform combination between attention

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.620
to reality and the exploration of creative
style.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:12.040
[YSL] I read that you wrote Life and Death
are Wearing me Out in 43 days, what drove

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.700
you to write so fast?

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.470
How do you find the writing process?

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:33.040
[MY] How I could write the novel Life and
Death are Wearing Me Out so quickly?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.470
Firstly, this book is based on reality.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:49.860
When I was of the ages 6 and 7, there was
a farmer who lived nearby our school.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:05:00.970
He did the counterwork against the whole society,
against the "people's communes", and the "collectivization

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:11.870
" individually, he was insisting to the last.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:22.720
At that time a person like him was considered
to be very extreme, he was considered as monster,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.230
people carried out beatings and abuse towards
him.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.920
He made huge sacrifices in order to insist
upon his own opinion.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:47.560
His family, including his son and daughter,
parted way from him and were separated from

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.510
him, but he still would not yield.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:01.520
Later on, history proved that he had been
right.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.360
After I embarked on writing the novel, I felt
this guy would go into it sooner or later,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.130
so this book was written very quickly.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:22.730
I spent only 43 days writing the draft, but
in fact the novel's characters had already

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.260
existed in my mind for many decades.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.920
The thinking was very adequate, so the writing
was fast.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:47.470
[YSL] How are you going to celebrate and are
you coming to Sweden for the award ceremony?

00:06:47.470 --> 00:07:09.190
[MY] I think I will be with my family tomorrow
and eat dumplings, because I hope we can eat

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.190
dumplings together.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:27.030
I will also certainly come to Sweden on 10
December for the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:33.720
Thanks very much!

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:47.710
And see you in Sweden!
