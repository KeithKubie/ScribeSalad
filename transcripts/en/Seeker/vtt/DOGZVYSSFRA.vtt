00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:02.960
We are hooked on meat.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.680
We chop, slice, and sink our teeth into it,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.520
it’s rooted in our genes and culture,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.280
and globally speaking, appetites are on the rise.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.240
The average amount of meat consumed per person has nearly doubled in the past 50 years.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.060
And this demand is putting an incredible amount of pressure on the world’s resources.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.200
Is there a way to feed everyone and help the
planet at the same time?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.560
Scientists think they might have found something in a new supplement plucked from the ocean.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.160
Here at UC Davis’s Beef Barn, a team of
scientists and students are mixing together

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.550
molasses and a special kind of seaweed.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.060
They’ll sprinkle it over the cow's meals, like a nutritional boost.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.940
We're using for low dose about a quarter of
a percent.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.500
In our high dose is half a percent.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.850
It may not seem like much, but this dash of
seaweed is part of a new diet that could help

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.400
curb greenhouse gas emissions in cows.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.500
Livestock are responsible for about 14 and
a half percent of the greenhouse gas emissions.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.270
And cattle are far and away the biggest contributors.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.640
Usually when you hear about methane from cattle
you think about cow farts and it's actually

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.400
the complete opposite.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.940
Methane from cattle mostly comes from the burps.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.020
But methane does not stay too long in the atmosphere, it actually gets destroyed

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.399
in about ten to twelve years.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.140
However, it does have a global warming potential

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.359
and traps heat within our atmosphere at about

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.889
28 times greater than carbon dioxide.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.319
But the world’s 1.5 billion cows really
can’t help themselves, it’s in their biology.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.940
A majority of the methane that comes from the animal itself is actually through enteric fermentation.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.820
There’s microbial populations within their
stomach and these microbial populations

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.020
are actually degrading the feed and producing byproducts that the cows either absorb

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.120
into nutrients, or other microbes actually ingest them and create other byproducts.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.920
Methane is one of these byproducts.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.380
Greenhouse gas emissions are very much related
to the quality of diet, the more forage,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.220
the more fiber, you get proportionately more methane emissions.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.620
And that’s why this seaweed, Asparagopsis, is so intriguing

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.380
to an international community of scientists.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.500
It was first found in Australia.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.660
Some of this Asparagopsis was introduced into a Petri dish with the bacteria from the cow guts.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.240
They could actually prevent methane from being
produced.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.209
It struck me that this is something that could
also work quite well in real animals.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.240
Asparagopsis has an active ingredient called
bromoform.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.280
It basically acts as an inhibitor to an enzyme that's required by the microbes

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.340
to convert hydrogen into methane.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.340
It disrupts that process so that methane is not formed.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.140
Once the cows finish their dinner, the team will calculate their emissions to see if the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.540
seaweed is doing the trick.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.739
We use a machine called green feed.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.849
When an animal walks in it reads their ear
tag, it drops down feed, and they get to stay

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.569
there and eat feed.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.480
Usually they barrel in there, but these young
steers were a bit camera shy.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.900
The machine will take their sample of the
breath and will then automatically analyze it.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.800
You can actually monitor it in real time.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.739
And their first study with dairy cows netted
some promising results.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.060
What we saw was a reduction of up to
60 percent when we feed 1 percent

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.440
of seaweed to the cows.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.240
What we've seen so far is the amount of methane
that can be reduced is proportional to the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.060
amount of bromoform that the seaweed contains.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.740
This second study with beef steers will be
looking into the overall health of the animal.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.060
These animals will be eating seaweed for approximately 200 days.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.730
We'll be able to capture that, if there's any long term benefits to feeding seaweed.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.260
If it increases any weight gain, we'll be able to see that as well.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.880
And another big question on everyone’s mind:

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.320
we will have taste panels.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.940
They will tell us if they can pick up differences in meat quality from steers

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.340
that have been fed seaweed and those that were not fed seaweed.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.060
So while they're trying to understand how Asparagopsis will affect cow health and wellbeing,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.960
we're trying to understand how to influence Asparagopsis' health and wellbeing.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.720
Dr. Jennifer Smith is a marine biologist at
UC San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.740
She’s working with the UC Davis team to
see how we can cultivate seaweed responsibly,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.800
so this potential solution doesn’t
become a whole new problem.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.620
Asparagopsis taxiformis is incredibly beautiful red seaweed.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.230
It produces a lot of really unique chemical
compounds, and some of these chemical compounds

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.530
have been found to be really valuable.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.960
Just because we find that it could, potentially,
mitigate methane production in cows

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.640
doesn't mean that tomorrow we're ready to mass produce Asparagopsis.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.180
I knew, given the complexity of this seaweed's life cycle, that it was gonna take a bit of research.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.440
When you look at Asparagopsis growing in the wild, you often see these large, pink, feathery,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.340
iridescent, beautiful plants, and that is
one of the stages of Asparagopsis

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.860
that eventually grow into another phase, and that phase looks a little bit like

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.360
a pink cotton ball.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.980
It's a filamentous, very delicate phase.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.480
To date, nobody has really completed the life cycle of Asparagopsis in cultivation.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.351
In my laboratory at Scripps, we're manipulating things like light, temperature, and nutrient

00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:52.710
concentrations to explore growth rates and
chemical composition of the tissue.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.630
If you can alter light or temperature and
you can get a doubling of growth, that's going to

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.400
be really important for thinking about scaling up cultivation.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.100
Like the UC Davis team, this research
project is at very early stages.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.020
There's so much to be done, and it's such
an exciting time.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.620
Ultimately, what we need to know is how fast can we grow Asparagopsis,

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.100
how much space do we need,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.920
how much resources do we need,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.220
how can we scale this to make it viable as a supplement on a global scale.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.120
We don't want to have a cultivation facility
that requires a ton of electricity and power

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.640
in order to grow the seaweed, because we're trying to, ultimately,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.960
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce our carbon footprint.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.280
There's hope that if this proves out, all
cows around the world could have this supplement

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.560
added to their diets.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.880
It'd be a small tweak with big ramifications.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.240
I think every sector, including the animal agriculture sector, needs to find ways to reduce their

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.060
overall greenhouse gas emissions.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.430
We have to be working towards a more sustainable system. It could be complementary to other

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.560
things that would help in reducing emissions.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.540
And so if feeding seaweed at a cost effective way that doesn't negatively affect these animals,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.820
I think it's a viable way for us to actually meet those standards.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.000
