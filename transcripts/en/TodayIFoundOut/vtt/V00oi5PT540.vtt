00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.809
Although the task of determining how many
people attend something as large as say, a

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.380
political rally or a protest may seem like
a daunting, almost impossible undertaking

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.080
to do with any accuracy, with some basic information,
it’s actually not that difficult to get

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.560
reasonably accurate results.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.860
The most well-known method of estimating the
size of a given crowd is simply called “The

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.520
Jacobs’ Method” as an ode to its inventor,
Herbert Jacobs.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.810
Jacobs spent a few decades working for the
Milwaukee Journal before retiring into teaching

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.090
journalism at the University of California,
Berkeley in the 1960s.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.030
He thought up his very simple crowd size estimate
method after observing numerous Vietnam War

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.600
protests outside of his office window.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.370
Jacobs noticed that the area the students
stood on had a repeating grid-like pattern,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.829
meaning he could very easily count how many
students occupied a certain amount of space

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.900
by counting how many students on average seemed
to be able to stand inside a section of the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.900
grid.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.360
By doing this, he soon noticed some patterns.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.150
For example, Jacobs found that in the most
densely packed crowds, each person took up

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.710
approximately 2.5 square feet.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
We should note that this is the absolute upper
limit of a how dense a crowd can safely get,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.090
as in, you simply couldn’t fit more people
into a crowd this dense without someone being

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.810
trampled or worse, which is probably why most,
including some scholarly articles on the subject

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.670
we read, simply refer to it as “mosh-pit
density”.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.200
In a dense, but more manageable crowd, Jacobs
observed that participants had a comparably

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.799
more roomy 4.5 square feet whilst those in
a “light” crowd had a positively breezy

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.610
10 square feet to themselves.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.241
In any event, once he had the approximate
average number of students in each grid, he

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:57.950
could then easily calculate the number of
grids in an area occupied at a given density,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.560
and quite quickly come up with a very good
estimate of how many people were in a given

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560
crowd.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.810
Thus, the now Gold Standard, and remarkably
simple, “Jacobs’ Method” was born.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.090
This may sound like an overly simple solution
but the truth is, it’s strikingly accurate

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.730
when done by non-biased observers, and modern
technology has only made it easier.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.140
For instance, tools like Google Earth have
made learning the exact size and area of a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.709
location, as well as dividing an area into
grids, an almost trivial feat for just about

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.709
anyone.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.379
And thanks to ubiquitous media coverage, any
large gathering of people is going to have

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.560
video or photographic footage (if not just
scanning the Tweetosphere for people in the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.629
crowd who may have gotten a good shot and
posted it online).

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.299
So breaking things down from there is relatively
trivial.

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.451
Of course, one could get really fancy and
take a photo of an entire crowd and use a

00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:52.739
bit of custom designed image processing software
to programmatically count the people in a

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.400
crowd for a more exact number, but the extra
level of accuracy here over the properly executed

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.580
Jacobs’ Method isn’t really typically
that much, nor all that necessary.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.809
Of course, when giving estimations, sometimes
the news media or the organisers of an event

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:09.720
do like to fudge the numbers a bit.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.799
Perhaps the most famous example is that of
the Million Man March- a mass gathering of

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.029
African Americans (mostly men) that took place
in 1995.

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:22.510
As you can probably guess from the name of
the march, event organisers afterwards were

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.569
very insistent that at least a million men
had attended, with estimates going as high

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.639
as two million.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.909
However, the National Parks Service disagreed
and offered up a much lower, but still extremely

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.959
significant figure of around 400,000 individuals.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.370
But when something is called the Million Man
March, 400,000 seems a bit of a letdown, even

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.519
though it’s logically very much not; getting
400,000 people (about 1.2% of all African

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.840
Americans in the United States at the time)
to show up at such an event in Washington

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.829
DC is really quite a feat.

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.690
Nevertheless, the NPS’s estimate incensed
a key player behind the march, Louis Farrakhan,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.189
so much so that he threatened to sue the NPS.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.430
As a direct result of the brouhaha that followed,
the NPS is now banned by congress from estimating

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.930
the size of crowds in Washington, at least
publicly.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.919
As they noted, if the President asks them
for how big a crowd was, they’re happy to

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.930
crunch the numbers given footage of the crowd.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.220
They just aren’t technically supposed to
use tax payer dollars in this way anymore,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.510
so wouldn’t share that information with
the media who, of course, could quite easily

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.660
come up with their own estimates.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.250
So how many people actually attended the Million
Man March?

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.920
While an exact figure is impossible to discern,
most researchers are in agreement that the

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.690
original estimation of the NPS is pretty accurate.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.300
For example, in 2004 a pair of researchers,
Clark McPhail and John D. McCarthy, worked

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.730
out that in the location of the gathering
there would have been space for a maximum

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.950
of 1,048,206 people assuming that every inch
of the crowd was as densely packed as safely

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.180
possible at 2.5 square feet per person.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.780
In the end, from the pictures available of
the gathering, they determined that the NPS’s

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.820
estimate of about 400,000 was quite accurate.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.280
This isn’t a one-off case either; research
has shown that the estimates of event organizers

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.750
are consistently higher than those of the
police, who tend to give more accurate predictions

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.500
given the events generally take place in gathering
spaces that are well documented in case of

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.650
emergency, in terms of how many people they
can safely hold.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.700
Of course, event organizers (and sometimes
the media) can have something to gain by overstating

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.640
how large a crowd is, while the police and
other official agencies generally do not.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.140
That said, there are certainly examples out
there of official agencies intentionally adjusting

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.910
announced crowd sizes for one reason or another
just like organisers love to do.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.000
Luckily, there’s a simple method of accurately
estimating the size of a crowd that’s free

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.760
from bias, and these days can be easily done
even just by some guy sitting at home in his

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.320
PJs surfing the web half way across the world
from where the event is actually happening,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.560
which is more than a little amazing.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:17.620
Don’t you think?
