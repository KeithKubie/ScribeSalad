works a lot like your printer that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
works a lot like your printer that
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359
works a lot like your printer that
prints ink on a page but instead of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
prints ink on a page but instead of
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280
