much more difficult than and they would
have expected because of changes in the

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:50.030
have expected because of changes in the
 

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:51.550
have expected because of changes in the
value of the collateral that they have

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:51.560
value of the collateral that they have
 

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.490
value of the collateral that they have
and unexpected changes in the mortgage

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:54.500
and unexpected changes in the mortgage
 

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.390
and unexpected changes in the mortgage
underwriting standards by lenders at the

00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400
underwriting standards by lenders at the
 

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.320
underwriting standards by lenders at the
same time I think it's true that the

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:01.330
same time I think it's true that the
 

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:04.270
same time I think it's true that the
degree of mortgage relief provided thus

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280
degree of mortgage relief provided thus
 

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.730
degree of mortgage relief provided thus
far has been fairly modest and the main

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:06.740
far has been fairly modest and the main
 

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:08.589
far has been fairly modest and the main
program that's been instituted by the

00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599
program that's been instituted by the
 

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:10.630
program that's been instituted by the
administration the Home Affordable

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640

Refinance Program has refinance less

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000
Refinance Program has refinance less
 

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.970
Refinance Program has refinance less
than I think a million mortgages which

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:15.980
than I think a million mortgages which
 

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.620
than I think a million mortgages which
is a lot less than the three to four

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:17.630
is a lot less than the three to four
 

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:19.210
is a lot less than the three to four
million that had been the announced goal

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:19.220
million that had been the announced goal
 

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.849
million that had been the announced goal
of the program and I think even a

00:56:21.849 --> 00:56:21.859
of the program and I think even a
 

00:56:21.859 --> 00:56:23.320
of the program and I think even a
smaller fraction of the number of

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:23.330
smaller fraction of the number of
 

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:25.810
smaller fraction of the number of
borrowers who are probably at risk of

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:25.820
borrowers who are probably at risk of
 

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.210
borrowers who are probably at risk of
being unable to pay mortgages and so I

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:28.220
being unable to pay mortgages and so I
 

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:29.440
being unable to pay mortgages and so I
guess the question I'd like to address

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:29.450
guess the question I'd like to address
 

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:31.960
guess the question I'd like to address
to both of you is whether the next

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:31.970
to both of you is whether the next
 

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:34.089
to both of you is whether the next
administration should be doing more and

00:56:34.089 --> 00:56:34.099
administration should be doing more and
 

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:36.430
administration should be doing more and
in what way something different than

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:36.440
in what way something different than
 

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.050
in what way something different than
what we've already done of this problem

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:38.060
what we've already done of this problem
 

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:40.510
what we've already done of this problem
okay Jeff I think you should start great

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520
okay Jeff I think you should start great
 

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.170
okay Jeff I think you should start great
what have you done wrong so funny so

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:43.180
what have you done wrong so funny so
 

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:45.730
what have you done wrong so funny so
there are two problems that need to be

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:45.740
there are two problems that need to be
 

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:49.480
there are two problems that need to be
solved in terms of helping families with

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:49.490
solved in terms of helping families with
 

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:51.880
solved in terms of helping families with
their mortgages the first is that there

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:51.890
their mortgages the first is that there
 

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:53.260
their mortgages the first is that there
are families who can't afford to pay

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:53.270
are families who can't afford to pay
 

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.720
are families who can't afford to pay
their mortgages given the terms of their

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:55.730
their mortgages given the terms of their
 

00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:59.530
their mortgages given the terms of their
current mortgage and for closing is not

00:56:59.530 --> 00:56:59.540
current mortgage and for closing is not
 

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.710
current mortgage and for closing is not
a good solution because it imposed a lot

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720
a good solution because it imposed a lot
 

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.000
a good solution because it imposed a lot
of costs on the families and a lot of

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.010
of costs on the families and a lot of
 

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:06.099
of costs on the families and a lot of
costs on the banks as well and in most

00:57:06.099 --> 00:57:06.109
costs on the banks as well and in most
 

00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:07.510
costs on the banks as well and in most
cases if you can restructure the

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520
cases if you can restructure the
 

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.510
cases if you can restructure the
mortgage you can end up letting the

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520
mortgage you can end up letting the
 

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.770
mortgage you can end up letting the
family stay in its home and it's a

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:11.780
family stay in its home and it's a
 

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.720
family stay in its home and it's a
better outcome both for the lenders and

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:13.730
better outcome both for the lenders and
 

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.579
better outcome both for the lenders and
for the family so the first challenge is

00:57:15.579 --> 00:57:15.589
for the family so the first challenge is
 

00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:17.170
for the family so the first challenge is
how do you do that the second challenge

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:17.180
how do you do that the second challenge
 

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.480
how do you do that the second challenge
is we have millions of homeowners who

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:19.490
is we have millions of homeowners who
 

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.490
is we have millions of homeowners who
are paying their mortgages on time all

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:21.500
are paying their mortgages on time all
 

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.520
are paying their mortgages on time all
the time regularly but who have interest

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:24.530
the time regularly but who have interest
 

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:25.870
the time regularly but who have interest

percent and would like to refinance

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:27.950
percent and would like to refinance
 

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:30.640

today's current rates but they're not

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:30.650
today's current rates but they're not
 

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:33.670
today's current rates but they're not
able to because the banks aren't

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680
able to because the banks aren't
 

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.050
able to because the banks aren't
offering them the opportunity to do that

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:35.060
offering them the opportunity to do that
 

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:38.410
offering them the opportunity to do that
so the president has aggressively worked

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:38.420
so the president has aggressively worked
 

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.470
so the president has aggressively worked
on both of these problems and I think

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480
on both of these problems and I think
 

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.599
on both of these problems and I think

that that would have caused seven or
