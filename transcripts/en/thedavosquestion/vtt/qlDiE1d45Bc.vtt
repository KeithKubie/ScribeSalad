00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
&gt;&gt; So I'm Will Swope. I run sustainability
for Intel. And the question I want to address

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.660
is dealing with the economy verse dealing
with the environment. And my simple message

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.380
in return is, we should never let this crisis
go to waste. As in a personal level here are

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.430
things we can do. We can do two less, two
less degrees of heat, two less degrees of

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.480
cooling. Two less car trips a week. We can
do one less. One less meal of meat a week.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.570
One more conservation effort a week. And there's
one more thing we can do more of. Which is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.280
think through how we deal with recycling and
think through how we deal with an energy audit.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.560
Now, at the big level, at the collective level.
There are issues that we have to go deal with.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.150
We have to deal with the economics of the
two places in the world that can absorb carbon

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.010
dioxide. Which is the ocean and the rainforest.
We don't really have either of those worked

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:11.390
out today. And we need to change the language,
the way we describe energy sources. They're

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.860
not alternative energy sources, they're sustainable
energy sources. These may sound simplistic,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.290
but the fact of the matter is that if each
individual can make the kind of changes we're

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.100
talking about and help the collective make
the macro arguments that we talked about,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.390
the world will be a better place.
