00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.330
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.870
Good afternoon once again, once again.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.470
To the Friday app review.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.790
Hopefully this time coming to you with slightly
fewer video artifacts than ten minutes ago.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.530
So like I said, today we're gonna have a look
at some notes ads, uh, notes apps, in the

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.530
time we have remaining.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.500
But we're gonna kick off by talking to Paul
Carff, inventor of the KegDroid, and find

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.100
out a little bit more about that product.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.210
So you wanna tell us a little bit about Kegdroid
Paul?

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.250
&gt;&gt;Paul: Sure guys.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.769
Thanks for having me here.

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.470
And for the opportunity to share this wonderful
little toy that we have.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.430
Back in January we were at CES.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.220
At the consumer electronics show in Vegas.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.270
And as some of what developers do, sitting
around a table hugging some drinks.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.350
Sort of talking and brainstorming.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.480
We had this idea, we have fun with using our
Android technology and one of my favorite

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.970
pastimes is brewing and drinking beer.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: Nice.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.670
&gt;&gt;Paul: So I, in my garage, kind of pulled
together some parts and pieces and started

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.670
tinkering with it.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.190
And actually had the idea of building an actual
Android model.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.230
To dispense my beer.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.600
And of course it wouldn't be enough just to
do that, I wanted it do it automatically.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.090
&gt;&gt;Paul: So that's kind of what inspired it.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.090
&gt;&gt;Fred: that's great.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.179
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright, so tell us a little bit about
the setup.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:24.220
So we can see that there's, I think a Motorola
Xoom on the front of the KegDroid there.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.140
So, how does that work?

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.880
What does that bring to the equation?

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.480
&gt;&gt;Paul: Well, the idea is that you wanna let
people know what beer is available.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.600
And so what I've done with the Xoom here is,
it kind of acts as a kiosk mode.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.880
So it will tell you what beers are available
and that's how you interact with the device.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.119
So the first thing you do is, we currently
are using an NFC reader that's connected to

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.619
an arduino that's inside the body of the Android.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.670
And then you have the Android tablet.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.990
What you see now is a big banner on here,
telling you to scan your badge.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.990
&gt;&gt;Fred: OK.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.390
&gt;&gt;Paul: and what that's telling you to do
is, you need to have an NFC badge of some

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.590
kind.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.959
You can use the standard sticker kind that
just has a tag number on it.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.450
Or what we're having fun doing is using our
Android phones that have the NFC built into

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.450
it.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.140
So as long as I unlock my phone and hold it
over the scanner, you'll see that it unlocks

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.140
the tab button.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.140
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ah, nice.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.140
&gt;&gt;Paul: And now you can interact with is.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.140
&gt;&gt;Fred: so the tablet talks to the arduino,
using ADK?

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.140
Right?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.140
&gt;&gt;Paul: Using ADK, absolutely.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.140
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.140
OK.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.140
&gt;&gt;Reto: Perfect.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.860
And so what happens when you, when you actually
select a beer, one of the two options.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.860
What happens then?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.980
Does that still get controlled by the Xoom
and the ADK?

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.530
&gt;&gt;Paul: So now that you're, at this point
you're interacting with the Android application

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.080
and on the Xoom, and when you tap on one of
the beers that are available, you get a drop

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.080
down menu.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.690
And you can pick either the size of beer,
or the size of pour.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.680
By default I have these set up for a two,
an eight, and a 12 ounce pour.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.010
You can cancel your interaction and it resets
it.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.960
Or you've actually selected the beer size
that you want, and then when you select pour,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.000
that actually opens up, that sends a message
to the arduino, that then tells the, it actually

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.830
resets the flow meter and it opens up a solenoid
valve to start the pour.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very nice.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.560
So it's a totally automated process at that
point.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.640
You just scan your badge, put your glass underneath
the spigot, and wait for delicious beer.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.090
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yeah, and I think it's better than
talking about it, maybe I should show you.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.090
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.090
I think you should.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.580
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, I think you need a couple more
testers.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.600
For this program.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs]

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.840
&gt;&gt;Paul: And I will say that DevRellers are
totally wonderful.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.760
Because I have no end of having, when I need
testing done, they're always there to step

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760
up to the plate.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] You are able to find volunteers.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760
That's surprising.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.680
People are often so reluctant to test apps.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
But.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.560
&gt;&gt;Paul: This one here gets good, lots of good
testing.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.280
And we've made a lot of good changes and we
now know that we have a lot more changes to

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.280
make.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very cool.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.280
&gt;&gt;Paul: But let's go ahead and show you what
this looks like.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, let's check it out.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
&gt;&gt;Paul: when you're actually pouring a beer.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.680
So I'm gonna go ahead and open up the tap.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.310
We just keep these closed that way that nobody
accidentally goes by and does anything.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.460
But when you open the tap, nothing happens
because it's waiting for the solenoid valve.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.120
So I'm gonna pick my eight ounce pour.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.440
And I'm just holding my glass here and I'll
start pouring.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.970
And what you're going to see is a dialog pops
up and it actually shows you the progress

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.629
of the pour.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:25.639
It's calibrated so if you do a two ounce pour,
the dialog does a full glass for two ounces.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.469
If you pick 12 ounces, it'll flow according
to your 12 ounce pour so it's fairly accurate.

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:35.969
So I hit pour, and it starts pouring the beer,
you see the dialog going.

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.889
And then when it's done, it shuts off the
valve.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.860
So the flow stops, the dialog disappears,
the system resets, and it's ready for the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.710
next person to scan their badge and enjoy
their beer.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very nice.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.710
&gt;&gt;Fred: Great.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.189
&gt;&gt;Reto: So that's a pretty awesome use of
all the technology.

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:57.830
Have you thought about what the next steps
might be, apart from different beers, of course?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.060
&gt;&gt;Paul: yeah, actually, this is set up for
two beers on one device.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.190
And what happens now if you think about it,
you have two taps, but you can only do one

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.190
at a time.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.160
So if you actually have a professional system,
you know each tap should be independent and

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.160
work that way.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.370
And right now it only, you can do one at a
time.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.930
So we're looking at, and also this kiosk mode
and this interaction here, to me is kind of

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.930
limiting.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.930
It's a very closed system.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.930
I'll put it this way.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.930
It's kind of all enclosed.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.639
What I do actually do at this moment is when
I complete the transaction I collect the data,

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.550
from, I know which Android you were on.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.220
I know which beer you picked and I know how
much beer you poured.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.930
That gets sent back to an app engine app.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.330
And I actually collect that data and for Google
IO at the after-hours party, we had three

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.520
of these units with all automated like this.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.150
And I was collecting the statistics and I
can actually map out on the floor where each

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.150
Android was.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.180
I had an app that would just highlight where
each Android, KegDroid was at.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.960
And then how much, how many beers had been
poured.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.240
How many gallons had been poured.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: Wow, excellent.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.669
&gt;&gt;Paul: so it was just some fun statistics.

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.620
So we want to, kind of expand that even more
now, where maybe you have an app on your phone,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.240
through a registration process you get authorized
to actually talk to the Android.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.430
Or get a beer from the Android.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.330
And then when you order from it you can find
out what beers are on tap all through your

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.330
phone.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.669
And then you kind of smooth the transition
process here at some point.

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.419
Which gives you a scalable system because
we have one of these in our Mountain View

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:32.419
office here.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:33.689
We could have one of them in our London office.

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:38.330
And if you go out there, and you're authorized
to drink from that KegDroid, you just order

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.270
it from your app and walk up to it and get
your beer.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.270
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very nice.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.680
So you could end up having quite a sophisticated
system.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.979
Depending on obviously the distribution of
KegDroids.

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:52.819
But you could have your favorite beers and
be alerted when there's a place nearby where

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.129
a KegDroid is, has exactly what you wanna
drink on tap.

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:56.129
&gt;&gt;Paul: exactly.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:57.129
&gt;&gt;Fred: Distributive system right there.

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.770
&gt;&gt;Paul: It would be kind of fun, too, that,
let's say you're not a normal user of it,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.479
but maybe one of your friends can give you
a free beer token.

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:06.479
&gt;&gt;Reto: um-hum.

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.330
&gt;&gt;Paul: That says "Hey, you can have a beer
from this KegDroid when you happen to come

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.330
by."

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.080
&gt;&gt;Fred: I thought we had all you can drink
in this office.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.550
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a dangerous system.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.629
I think everything needs to be approved by
Billy, right?

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:17.629
He gives you a beer token.

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:18.629
&gt;&gt;Paul: Well, there you go.

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:22.669
We could actually say that the KegDroid doesn't
open up office hours until four pm.

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:24.770
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's probably a very wise idea.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.770
[laughs]

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.770
&gt;&gt;Fred: There you go.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.770
There you go.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: But Billy will never approve that.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.770
Why don't you try Nan?

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.770
[laughter]

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.490
By the way, Paul, I smell a Kickstarter project
right now.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.490
&gt;&gt;Paul: MMMMmmm.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: This is true.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.160
It wouldn't be the first Android Kickstarter
project, that's for sure.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.639
&gt;&gt;Fred: Hey Paul, to date how many gallons
of beers have been served?

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.639
&gt;&gt;Paul: Well

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:44.639
&gt;&gt;Fred: Do you have any insight?

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.020
&gt;&gt;Paul: Well I'll tell you what I know from
IO.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.979
We had at least 670 pours.

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:53.080
The network there, as many of you guys know,
who have gone to Google IO, the network is

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080
not always that great.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs]

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.500
&gt;&gt;Paul: So I think I missed a number of transactions
but you know, at least 670 beers.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.529
And everybody was selecting the 12 ounce pours.

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:00.810
So you can calculate how many gallons of beer.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.810
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.810
Wow.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.810
Very cool.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, wait, wait.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.949
Oh, I mean this is a review show.

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:09.340
So I feel like I need to dive into this a
little more.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.340
Are you saying that?

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.340
&gt;&gt;Paul: Absolutely.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.699
&gt;&gt;Reto: If you don't have internet connectivity
then you lose those transactions?

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.590
&gt;&gt;Paul: In the current design yes.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.999
And that's going to be one of the first changes
I make.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:19.999
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.590
&gt;&gt;Paul: What I'm gonna do for the next round
is we'll have all the transactions recorded

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.919
locally on the database and then have a service
running in the background synchronizing that

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:29.360
database to app [ indistinct ]

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.509
In face I have a Google IO talk which can
give you some hints as to exactly how you

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:35.509
could do that.

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:36.509
&gt;&gt;Fred: [laughs]

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:37.509
&gt;&gt;Paul: Really?

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:38.509
I'll have to [indistinct]

00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:39.789
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.089
I see.

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:42.899
My mic is being disrespectful.

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:46.339
Give me one moment.

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.060
[mic sounds]

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.639
Hopefully that's a lot better?

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:51.639
Excellent.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:55.420
We've got big Ian Lewis behind the producer
controls today.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.870
Making sure that we don't sound or look terrible.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.720
Or at least not more so than we normally would.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.759
&gt;&gt;Ian: I resent that adjective.

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:02.759
[laughter]

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:04.759
&gt;&gt;Reto: nonetheless.

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:05.759
OK.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:12.070
Paul, so I guess, thank you, for giving us
that, taking the time.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.460
And making the sacrifice of having to pour
and drink that beer before four o'clock.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.200
I know that's a tough life.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.940
&gt;&gt;Paul: I would tell you, rest assured that
no beer was harmed in the testing.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.680
There was a lot of water that went through
this system so that we didn't waste it.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.680
&gt;&gt;Fred: It worked.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.680
&gt;&gt;Paul: But when it came down to it.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: What, I feel as part of the Friday
review, I would be remiss if I didn't ask

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.910
what are the two beers you have, or one or
two beers that you have on tap today?

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.240
&gt;&gt;Paul: Well currently what we have on tap
is, what I'm drinking here now is Dogfish

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.490
Head 90 minute IPA.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.170
And the other beer we have on tap is from
21st Amendment.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.220
It is Monk's blood.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.220
&gt;&gt;Fred: Very nice choice.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.860
&gt;&gt;Paul: which is a very interesting Belgian
ale.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.990
Strong Belgian ale.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.269
Looks almost like a Porter but not quite.

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:55.490
It's very spicy.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.490
Very interesting.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:02.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know, Paul, we don't usually encourage
people to disturb us here in the studio when

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.610
we're recording.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.670
But if you do happen to be passing by, you
know, don't be afraid to knock.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.910
And deliver us something.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.910
[laughter]

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.680
&gt;&gt;Paul: I'll see if, we'll see what happens.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs]

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.889
&gt;&gt;Fred: We'd like to be your testers.

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:16.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: We'd look forward to it.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.370
But, thanks Paul.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.880
We should probably move on, 'cause we lost
a bit of time at the beginning.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.880
&gt;&gt;Paul: Alright.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.880
Cheers guys.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880
Thank you.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: So.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.880
Ah, thank you.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880
And congrats.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.880
&gt;&gt;Fred: Thanks Paul.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880
Excellent.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.880
So that was KegDroid.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.880
&gt;&gt;Fred: Ready for, ready for some note-taking
time?

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's have a look at some note-taking
apps.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880
But before we get too deeply into the apps
themselves I just wanna do a little bit of

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.880
housekeeping this week.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.470
So I wanna do things a little bit different.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.440
So as many of you know, we've sort of been
experimenting with the formats of all of our

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440
shows.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.959
Particularly the Friday reviews, both apps
and games.

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:47.490
And so what we're trying to do, so the point
behind what we're doing here is to try and

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.440
come up with ways to be able to share with
developers some tips that we come across when

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.610
we look at different apps.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.509
So a big part of what we do on a daily basis
is check out people's apps.

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:00.560
Provide feedback and give them some assistance
to help make them better.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.149
So the Friday review is really about trying
to take that and share that with you guys.

00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:09.471
So when we're picking apps, we're looking
for things which both are really good, which

00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:11.750
show a great example of how to do things.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.899
But also apps which do some things wrong.

00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:17.329
Specifically so that you guys can learn from
those mistakes and we can sort of tell you

00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:22.400
guys all in one go and then hopefully a lot
of apps will be able to benefit from that.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.060
So to try and make that process a little bit
more streamlined, we've always sort of used

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.880
the voting within Moderator as something of
a guide to get an idea of what people want,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.490
rather than a strict ordering of the apps
that we're gonna look at.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.490
&gt;&gt;Fred: Hmm.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.089
&gt;&gt;Reto: we're gonna take that a little bit
further now and we're gonna try and do these

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:42.160
themed shows every weeks.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.339
This week we're looking at notes.

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:45.190
Next week we're looking at news apps.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.610
The week after that, podcasting apps.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.339
And I think the next schedule beyond that
is what was it?

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:52.471
Do you remember what we decided on?

00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:53.910
&gt;&gt;Fred: I don't, but we'll see.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.910
&gt;&gt;Reto: Do you remember Ian?

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.910
&gt;&gt;Fred: We'll find out.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: Um.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.220
Yeah I believe it's news, followed by recipes,
then podcast.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.670
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh yes.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.670
Recipes.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.089
&gt;&gt;Reto: Podcast was last.

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:04.089
OK, so yes, recipes.

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:05.089
&gt;&gt;Fred: Recipes.

00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:06.089
Lifestyle applications.

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:07.089
[dog barking in background]
&gt;&gt;Reto: so if you have an app in any of those

00:12:07.089 --> 00:12:08.089
three categories, go to the Moderator page.

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:13.670
We will have links to it on the event and
in the Google plus stream after this.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.500
Follow Android Developers for the links.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.500
And put them in there.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.650
And we will look at the votes.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.290
But to be perfectly honest.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.700
We're gonna take a quick look at all of those
apps and try and find the ones which are the

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.060
most interesting or which do interesting things.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.220
Or even just things which we find we can use
as examples for everything else.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.220
So by all means vote, but don’t' be offended
if we don't pick all of the apps specifically

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.899
based on those vote results.

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:37.899
Alright, so.

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:38.899
&gt;&gt;Fred: Alright.

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:39.899
&gt;&gt;Reto: Enough housekeeping.

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:40.899
So let's look at some apps.

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:42.430
Oh, what have we got?

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.120
So we've got three note taking apps which
hopefully we'll get a chance to look at.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120
Notes.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.760
Let's see, you can probably read it here.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.760
Notes.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760
Notes N Share.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.760
Note.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.760
And Papyrus.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.139
So let's get started with Notes N Share.

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:02.339
Open that up on the phone.

00:13:02.339 --> 00:13:03.339
Alright.

00:13:03.339 --> 00:13:04.339
Alright.

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:05.339
Perfect.

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:06.940
Actually go, oops, a little bit further over.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.940
Excellent.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.940
&gt;&gt;Fred: Perfect.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.899
&gt;&gt;Reto: OK, so this is an app which is using
sort of, a non-standard style if you will.

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:18.029
So It looks like they've gone with sort of
your standard notebook like, could be a Moleskine

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:22.569
or something like that, where you've got your
grid on the background.

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:24.600
And able to take notes on top.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.490
And so the entire UI is based around that.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.590
Now, the, there's two things I wanna highlight
here right off the bat.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.730
Is that you've got your own sort of custom
header here for notes n share.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.410
But there's still the application title bar
on top of that.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.250
And so, to me, I think that that sort of detracts
from it.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.279
So you've kind of got this full screen experience.

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:47.000
You've got this really custom UI.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.060
Go all the way.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.529
There's not need to have that extra title
bar on top.

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:54.620
So right off the back I would say to hide
that.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.079
Same with the menu button.

00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:57.079
Oooh.

00:13:57.079 --> 00:13:58.079
It's a menu button of shame.

00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:59.079
&gt;&gt;Fred: Uh-oh

00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:00.079
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let me just scroll this up here.

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:03.060
So you've got a menu button but it doesn't
do anything.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.149
So, I would, oh, hello.

00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:09.570
Here we have some of Paul's work.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.570
&gt;&gt;Fred: Beer.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.570
Some, conduct some testing.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.319
&gt;&gt;Reto: We can do some taste testing here.

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:15.879
It's a bit of Friday games review on the Friday
review.

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:16.879
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's right.

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:18.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: So we at least need to test.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.100
So cheers.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.600
&gt;&gt;Fred: Cheers, Reto.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600
Cheers, Ian.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600
Hm.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600
Pretty good.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's not bad.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.100
Perfect.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.100
OK.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.100
So, moving on.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.750
So we've got a menu button of shame.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.750
Remove the menu button of shame.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.750
Please.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.750
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.750
There.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.750
&gt;&gt;Reto: It doesn't do anything so it doesn't
need to be onscreen.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.750
&gt;&gt;Fred: And removing it is really easy.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.819
You just need to set the target SDK level
to anything above 11.

00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:40.819
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:14:40.819 --> 00:14:41.819
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yup.

00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:42.819
&gt;&gt;Reto: and so nothing else will change.

00:14:42.819 --> 00:14:43.819
You won't lose anything else.

00:14:43.819 --> 00:14:45.500
And particularly for this app.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.129
It has to be 15?

00:14:47.129 --> 00:14:48.129
&gt;&gt;Fred: 15

00:14:48.129 --> 00:14:49.129
&gt;&gt;Reto: Interesting.

00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:50.129
You'd have to set it at 15.

00:14:50.129 --> 00:14:51.129
&gt;&gt;Fred: It has to be 15 now.

00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:52.129
&gt;&gt;Reto: alright.

00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:53.129
&gt;&gt;Fred: 15.

00:14:53.129 --> 00:14:54.129
15 it is.

00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:55.129
&gt;&gt;Reto: 15 it is.

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:56.129
And in fact, this is a good tip.

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:57.689
For the most part, you'll be wanting to test
all your apps against the latest framework

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:58.689
release.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:01.580
And the target APK, the target API should
always be the latest release.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.580
Which is in fact 16.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.580
These days.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.262
So as soon as something like, as soon as a
new release comes out, you should really make

00:15:07.262 --> 00:15:13.160
it a matter of priority to, you know, open
up Eclipse or IntelliJ or whatever you're

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.939
using to do your development.

00:15:14.939 --> 00:15:15.939
And test it out.

00:15:15.939 --> 00:15:20.089
Change the target SDK level to the maximum.

00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:21.320
And see what changes.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.480
Ideally nothing should.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.819
For the most part things should just continue
to work the same that they did.

00:15:25.819 --> 00:15:29.579
Once you have that confidence, then you can
release it that way.

00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:32.709
And then you have to take advantage of things
like the more native look and feel.

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:36.029
And everything will look and behave the way
it should on new devices.

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:40.000
So these days in particular, we really wanna
see people have a great experience on the

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.519
Nexus 7.

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:44.080
And so we want you to target that latest SDK
version.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.009
And you lose things like legacy menu buttons
and other things like that.

00:15:48.009 --> 00:15:49.009
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:51.089
Better in general make your apps look more
modern.

00:15:51.089 --> 00:15:52.089
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:15:52.089 --> 00:15:53.089
Exactly.

00:15:53.089 --> 00:15:54.089
It's nice, right?

00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:55.510
You want your apps to, how good is that?

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.220
You change one number in your manifest file?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.259
And suddenly your app looks cleaner and fresher,
more modern.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.259
So.

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:02.259
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:03.259
&gt;&gt;Reto: Kind of a no brainer.

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:08.182
&gt;&gt;Fred: and the other thing I wanna point
out is the button that's right above the button

00:16:08.182 --> 00:16:09.182
of shame.

00:16:09.182 --> 00:16:10.182
It's

00:16:10.182 --> 00:16:11.182
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ah.

00:16:11.182 --> 00:16:12.182
It's my button of hate.

00:16:12.182 --> 00:16:13.182
[laughs]

00:16:13.182 --> 00:16:14.182
&gt;&gt;Fred: It spells e-x-i-t.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.182
Exit.

00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:16.182
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ah, the exit button.

00:16:16.182 --> 00:16:17.182
Let me see what the exit button does.

00:16:17.182 --> 00:16:18.182
Interesting.

00:16:18.182 --> 00:16:21.120
Now, let me see, what does the back button
do?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.649
Now you see how those do exactly the same
thing?

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:25.670
One of them is unnecessary.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.670
&gt;&gt;Fred: Why bother?

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: and you can only get rid of one of
these buttons.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.370
So now if you could choose between the exit
and the back button.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.360
That may be some sort of decision you have
to make.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.949
But you can't make that choice, right.

00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:35.690
The back button will always be there.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.149
The exit button is entirely redundant.

00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:41.509
I have a very long blog post in which I rant
about this for several pages.

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:43.310
If you're interested you can check that out.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:48.050
But for the most part what it really all boils
down to is that there is no need to have an

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.050
exit button.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.820
Now, there's a lot of people which will argue
with me.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.430
They will point out all the reasons why as
a user they wanna have an exit button.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.870
And I understand where you're coming from.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:04.280
The thing to remember is, it's totally ambiguous,
because you as a user have no idea what the

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.640
developer has done to implement that exit
button.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.890
So maybe it does what you want.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:14.530
Maybe it turns off all the services, removes
all of the alarms and exits the app.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.490
Or, more likely, all it's gonna do is call
finish.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.319
And calling finish is exactly what happens
when you hit the back button on your main

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.319
activity.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.520
So it's effectively doing the same thing.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.829
And the difference here as a user is, you
don't know what.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:28.960
It's an ambiguous button.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.140
It doesn't have any clear directive to know
what's actually happening.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.710
So I'm gonna stop ranting before I go on.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:36.760
No exit buttons.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.610
Alright, so let's have a look at some of the
functionality.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.610
So.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.610
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's take some notes.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: yeah.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.610
Indeed.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.610
But again, I'm gonna interrupt myself.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.830
So half of these things these three button
buttons, are kind of unnecessary to have on

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.830
the main screen.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.669
So right here, like, I've opened this up for
the first time and I have three, six, what

00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:56.669
is that nine?

00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:59.260
Eight or nine different options.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.960
All of which I have to read and understand
before I

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960
&gt;&gt;Fred: Looks pretty crowded, right?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.960
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.030
It's like, oh I wanna, I downloaded an app.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.460
I just want to take some notes.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.419
And now I need to read all of those buttons
to see which one of those is gonna let me

00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:10.419
do that.

00:18:10.419 --> 00:18:13.529
You know, text notes, hand notes, audio notes,
my diary, to do list.

00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:15.500
&gt;&gt;Fred: especially for things such as about,
or help.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.620
Chances are you're gonna use it once in the
lifetimes of the application.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.620
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.620
Exactly.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.080
&gt;&gt;Fred: So your point is, Reto, is to hide
those buttons.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080
Somewhere.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.080
I like that.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080
Hide those buttons.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.080
Yeah.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.080
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: Put them behind the menu.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.400
You know, you can have, you can have your
own sort of action bar sort of scenario here.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.430
So you've got your own custom header up at
the top . and I like that.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.360
But it would be nice to have a menu button.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360
Sort of overflow menu.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.360
&gt;&gt;Fred: Definitely.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sort of over on the right there.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.360
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: And you can hide all this stuff.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.360
At least the bottom two.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.360
Well.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.360
The second bottom two.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360
[laughs]

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.360
&gt;&gt;Fred: I'd say, remove the exit button.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360
&gt;&gt;Fred: Probably hide about and help.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360
&gt;&gt;Fred: on your mobile phone

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.360
Exactly.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.360
Exactly.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.360
So OK, so let's have a look.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.590
So, OK, one thing I do wanna point out is
right away is that so these custom controls,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.250
but you can see here they've actually implemented
the button behavior properly.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.480
I'm a big fan of this, right.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480
So there are states.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: so there are states.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.480
&gt;&gt;Fred: Differentiations.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: So you can see when it's pressed and
what thing you've pressed.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.750
This is fantastic.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.190
A lot of people building custom controls forget
to implement those state indicators.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.740
And it makes a huge difference.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.760
So yeah.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.770
This is good.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:19.770
I'm a fan of this.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.770
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.770
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright, text notes.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.820
&gt;&gt;Fred: By the way, I wonder if they implemented
in a focused state.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.820
Or not.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.620
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a good question, I can't

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.730
&gt;&gt;Fred: We don't have a device to verify that.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: So that's a good point, actually,
that Fred makes.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.020
Is that one of the things that you wanna make
sure you do if you are doing states, is have

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.020
the focused state.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.779
So if you're never getting through it using
a D pad or

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:38.990
&gt;&gt;Fred: Or Google TV

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, or Google TV.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.420
&gt;&gt;Fred: So there are essentially three states.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.420
Natural, normal?

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.420
Are we calling it normal?

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.650
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, I think so.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.860
&gt;&gt;Fred: Normal, focused, and you know, pressed.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.110
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.429
So make sure you do all of them so that, and
that helps for accessibility as well.

00:19:53.429 --> 00:19:55.260
So it's really a good idea.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.850
Alright, so we're in the notes.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.720
And we can just start typing.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:06.770
So again we're using this, no, I can't talk
and type at the same time.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.770
Alright.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.770
Nice.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.820
So you can see here, move this down slightly.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.950
We're just basically using this notepad paradigm.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.480
So things look like a notepad.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.480
Which is interesting.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.440
I think there's a little debate over whether
or not that's sort of the best approach on

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440
mobile.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.860
But it's in keeping with the style of the
rest of their app, right?

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.299
And it doesn't seem to be slowing things down.

00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:27.799
So, I'd say that's reasonable.

00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:31.730
Again, I'd say this title bar here, is somewhat
redundant.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.380
You may wanna have some sort of action bar
so that you can return to home.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.620
Or have the overflow menu.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.740
But generally speaking just having the standard
one makes it look out of place.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.740
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.740
Definitely.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.740
And you probably wanna stick your logo in
the action bar.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.740
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.820
&gt;&gt;Fred: To preserve your brand identity so
that you're gonna know, hey, they may have

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.909
three or four different note taking apps on
their phone.

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:54.250
And that, you know, you can help yourself
stand out a little bit.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.250
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.299
You know, let people know who you are.

00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:58.320
So you take the opportunity to brand yourself
a little.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320
So, OK.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.580
So now we have a menu button that is not shameful.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.929
In that it actually does something.

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:04.929
&gt;&gt;Fred: [laughs]

00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:08.190
&gt;&gt;Reto: But it is a little shameful in the
way that it does it.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:13.730
So first off check out the design guide on
the developer at Android.com/design site.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.500
And it'll tell you what the right way to build
icons for your menu are.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.500
Spoilers.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.500
They are grayscale.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.820
They are flat.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:29.320
So all of these which have colors and sort
of non sort of flat styling, look weird.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.570
Like to me this just looks wrong.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:35.020
[laughs] 'Cause they're too big and they're
the wrong color and for some reason all of

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.970
the writing is in caps which I can't really
understand why.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:40.970
So yeah.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.820
I mean all of this is summarized in the developer
design site.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.680
So basically just check that out.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.630
And you'll wanna modify these so that they're
consistent.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:52.370
Anything which is part of the system framework,
so bringing up menus or action bars or anything

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.380
like that.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.690
You want it to look like the system does.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.260
You don't want to break users out of this
thing where now I'm looking at this going

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.919
"Oh wait, that doesn't look like I expected."

00:22:02.919 --> 00:22:03.919
Save button.

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:04.919
Should be redundant.

00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:09.090
So you should build in something here to make
sure that you can never lose data.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.720
So I don't wanna have to hit menu save every
time I change something to make sure I don't

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.200
lose it if my phone turns off or if I exit
the app or something.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.309
&gt;&gt;Fred: Or if you get a phone call.

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:17.789
&gt;&gt;Reto: Or if I get a phone call.

00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:18.789
Exactly.

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:21.840
&gt;&gt;Fred: it would totally suck if you lose
your content.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.840
That way.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.840
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's right.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.840
So if every time I typed something.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.840
I mean this in particular.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.840
You're talking about text.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.840
&gt;&gt;Fred: Mm-hm.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.840
&gt;&gt;Reto: so it's not a huge amount of data.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.850
You're not gonna have sort of a huge lag from
having to save things.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:33.850
So yeah.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.909
Definitely make "save" happen automatically.

00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:37.909
Let's have a look.

00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:39.010
We've got more so, again,

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.409
&gt;&gt;Fred: More text only icons.

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:43.860
&gt;&gt;Reto: Every time you see things in caps,
it's like shouting.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.390
It's the same as email, right?

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.720
So stop shouting at me.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.520
So we've got text, speech,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.520
&gt;&gt;Fred: [mumbling]

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.929
&gt;&gt;Reto: share, share loads the standard share
intent which is nice.

00:22:53.929 --> 00:22:54.929
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's great.

00:22:54.929 --> 00:22:55.929
That's great.

00:22:55.929 --> 00:22:56.929
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:22:56.929 --> 00:22:57.929
Let's have a look, we'll go back.

00:22:57.929 --> 00:23:01.260
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's go back without explicitly hitting
save and see what happens after this screen.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a good idea.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.260
Alright.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.260
So we're gonna go back out of this.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.130
So, are you sure you wanna quit without saving
your text not.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.130
No.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.740
&gt;&gt;Fred: That just disrupts the work.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.740
I mean.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.890
&gt;&gt;Reto: I just wanna hit back and go back.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:17.260
So this should be like, at the first point,
I'd say why don't you just let me save it

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.260
here?

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.260
Like do you wanna save?

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.260
&gt;&gt;Fred: It's implicit.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: Or do you wanna quit?

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.260
&gt;&gt;Fred: Or have it implicit I would say.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: Even.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.260
No, even, yeah, that's exactly right Fred.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.260
Like have it implicit.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.520
I hate dialogs almost as much as I hate exit
buttons.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.880
So I don't wanna have this dialog asking me
to make a decisions.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.559
I just, the reason I came back because I'm
about to get into the car and drive off.

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:37.160
I don't want to have to decide on this dialog.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.160
So make it go away.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.529
And save it automatically.

00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:40.720
Even before hit exit.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.500
I hit, look,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.690
&gt;&gt;Fred: Sure.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.330
&gt;&gt;Reto: The back button should always do something.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.059
So that should at this point dismiss this
dialog.

00:23:49.059 --> 00:23:52.649
Hitting back and having nothing change is
just not right at all.

00:23:52.649 --> 00:23:53.779
So I'm gonna say yes.

00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:56.289
Let's have a quick look through these.

00:23:56.289 --> 00:23:58.820
'cause we've spent far too much time on this
already.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.700
So this looks like drawing.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.980
Which is nice.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.230
It would be nice if this supported multitouch.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.559
Which it doesn't right now.

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:08.980
So that's something to consider.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.760
So, again, same general feedback as last time.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.840
Although this time you've got the camera,
try and refocus.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.690
But you've got the text here, for the menu
items here is lower case except if you go

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.331
into more and then it's upper.

00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:24.331
Well, no, it's correct here.

00:24:24.331 --> 00:24:27.570
&gt;&gt;Fred: But from the other menu, from the
previous thing, it was all caps.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: so this is the right approach.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:33.480
But again, you've got some issues with the
actual icons.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.890
And again, with the saving as well.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.419
Audio notes I'm gonna presume is going to
let us record something.

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:41.929
OK, so we're gonna record something here.

00:24:41.929 --> 00:24:42.990
Hit stop.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.990
Play.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.720
[app plays back Reto's last sentence]

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.360
Don't know if you guys could here that but
it played it back so that's nice.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.799
Again here we have some inconsistency.

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:54.690
So you're using sort of the standard buttons
where as with everything else you've got your

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.779
own custom UI.

00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:59.059
So I'd modify this to try and use that same
approach.

00:24:59.059 --> 00:25:00.059
And same here.

00:25:00.059 --> 00:25:01.059
You've got save and open on screen.

00:25:01.059 --> 00:25:05.600
And the other items they're in the menu so
again, sort of choose one way and go with

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600
that.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.760
Menu button of shame.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.700
Ah, alright so, quick look through these.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.240
So you've got diary which is just a specific
and to-do list which look like they're sort

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.280
of specific implementations.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.140
Alright, we're gonna have a look at the other
ones as well.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.630
'cause we do wanna do more than one app.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.630
So that was interesting.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:27.490
So the general feel there was try and build
a notes app which looks like your notepad

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.429
that you would have in paper.

00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:32.080
Now I have a gap here, and sorry, Ian.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yea, Reto, I just wanted to let
you know that I now have a camera, too.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:39.730
And I

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.730
&gt;&gt;Reto: Awesome

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:46.000
&gt;&gt;Ian: and also that on the live stream there's
several people commenting that not only is

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.690
the focus on our little overhead webcam really
annoying,

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.110
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, glare probably

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: You have some reflections.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.789
It would help if you moved it to the middle.

00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:58.760
But it would help actually even more if you
could switch over to your tablet if any of

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.200
these support tablet, especially since we
love tablet so much.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.580
&gt;&gt;Reto: that's a good point.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: and then we could get a really clean
picture.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.010
&gt;&gt;Reto: Nice, we shall do exactly that.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.570
And now that you are on camera, people can
decide for themselves whether the previously

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.279
stated adjective is appropriate or not.

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:14.279
[laughter]

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:15.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's not true

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.700
[laughter]

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.700
&gt;&gt;Fred: awesome.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: OK.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.700
Thank you for that feed back.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.159
OK, so I have a gap here in the middle.

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:25.010
And that is for an app called ToteNotes.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:29.000
Which we were gonna take a look at but I couldn’t
because it was not supported by any of the

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.230
devices that I currently use.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.950
Now that is a fairly strong comment.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.990
Because I own a lot of devices.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.809
But I think the only device which I could
find on the list which I have ever used was

00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:42.929
the T Mobile Galaxy Nexus.

00:26:42.929 --> 00:26:47.299
All of the tablets, the Verizon version of
the Galaxy Nexus wasn't supported.

00:26:47.299 --> 00:26:53.130
So I'm not sure exactly what you guys are
doing to filter which apps are available.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.299
But I think you've gone a little bit far.

00:26:55.299 --> 00:27:00.090
So generally speaking, this is something which
we try and encourage people to find out, to

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.809
try and make sure that that list of devices
where your app isn't available is as small

00:27:04.809 --> 00:27:05.809
as possible.

00:27:05.809 --> 00:27:09.170
Or, to put it in slightly more positive terms,
make your app as available on as many different

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.419
devices as you can.

00:27:10.419 --> 00:27:12.610
So look at the permissions.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:17.260
Look at the implied users feature, which,
first permissions you're gonna use.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.649
And make sure that that's not blocking out
too much of your potential audience.

00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:21.649
Alright.

00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:25.850
&gt;&gt;Fred: Except for, just wanna add that if
the developer of Tote Notes is online, feel

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.850
free to join us.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.519
I'd be very curious to find out the motivation
behind that.

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:30.519
&gt;&gt;Reto: yeah absolutely.

00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:31.519
Let us know.

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:32.519
If you're even aware of this.

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:33.519
&gt;&gt;Fred: Mm-hmm.

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:34.740
&gt;&gt;Reto: Or if you're just like "I don't get
many downloads and I don't know why."

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.740
Um, OK

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.290
&gt;&gt;Fred: or you have too many downloads and
you wanna severely limit.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.290
&gt;&gt;Reto: [chuckles] Exactly.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.870
&gt;&gt;Ian: Um, this might be a good time to mention
two other things.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:47.309
Reto, your radio should be on the table, so
we get every now and then you'll gesticulate

00:27:47.309 --> 00:27:49.049
and we'll get a little bit of audio.

00:27:49.049 --> 00:27:51.169
&gt;&gt;Reto: Every once in a while I'll gesticulate.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:53.420
I gesticulate more often than not.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.420
You guys just can't see it.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.649
Because it's all happening off camera.

00:27:55.649 --> 00:27:59.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: the other thing is, our on air sign
needs to be tilted a little bit so it's not

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.670
reflecting.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.670
Uh.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:02.670
Yeah.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, wow, I can get it completely right
if I work hard.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:06.710
There you go.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.169
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wow, it's, it's, yeah, yeah, you got
it.

00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:09.169
There you go.

00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:10.570
Gotta work on it, but there you go.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:11.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs]

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:12.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: It hurts.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.570
&gt;&gt;Fred: [unintelligible] from you.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:14.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: We are so professional it's unbelievable.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: It is truly unbelievable.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:16.570
How professional we are.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.570
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yes.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.659
A team of production staff here.

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:22.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: Some interns are gonna get fired.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.100
Unfortunately we don't have any interns working
on this, so that's gonna make it a hard choices

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.100
as to who it's gonna be.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.100
Let's have a look.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.309
What have we got next on your home screen.

00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:31.309
Is it Note?

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:33.190
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, let's switch to the tablet.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.419
&gt;&gt;Reto: Fire up Note.

00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:35.590
&gt;&gt;Fred: Note.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.760
Let's go.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.669
Alright, it pops up a keyboard immediately.

00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:44.581
And it's got an overall light theme with the
action bar

00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:45.581
&gt;&gt;Reto: So this is a

00:28:45.581 --> 00:28:48.600
&gt;&gt;Fred: With a text typing area that you can
input your text.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yep.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600
Very sparse.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.600
Very sparse.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.779
Kind of the opposite approach to that last
app, in there.

00:28:52.779 --> 00:28:53.779
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah.

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:57.429
&gt;&gt;Reto: There's nothing on screen and even
the action bar is sort of light gray backgrounds

00:28:57.429 --> 00:28:58.640
around white.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.460
&gt;&gt;Fred: so I'm gonna start typing something.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.500
Um.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.410
Dismiss my keyboard, type something by

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.760
&gt;&gt;Reto: This is my test.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.409
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh, OK, this is my test.

00:29:08.409 --> 00:29:16.640
And on the right hand side of the action bar
there are a few menu items but based on the

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.130
design of the menu items, they are kind of,
they lack the contrast.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.320
It's not apparent to me that oh, you have
a plus sign and a folder icon.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.019
I would recommend increasing the contrast
of these icons.

00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:29.019
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:31.100
&gt;&gt;Fred: possibly based on the design guidelines.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mm.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.240
I like the fact that you've tried to keep
it as unobtrusive as possible.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.940
And you obviously used low contrast for that
reason.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.809
But if it is an action, if it is something
you want people to do, I think maybe a little

00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:42.809
bit more

00:29:42.809 --> 00:29:43.809
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:29:43.809 --> 00:29:44.809
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let me have a look.

00:29:44.809 --> 00:29:45.809
I wanna check one thing so.

00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:46.809
Ah, good.

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:47.950
So they've got the proper hints.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.090
&gt;&gt;Fred: They have the accessibility.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.090
&gt;&gt;Reto: Accessibility hints, nice.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.010
&gt;&gt;Fred: Or imagine if I turn on voice, what
it would talk to me?

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: I would expect so, yeah.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.480
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's pretty awesome.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.480
Good job.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] So nicely done.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480
Huh?

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480
&gt;&gt;Fred: So there's an overflow menu.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.120
I think they appropriately hid "about" and
"export" menu items.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.340
In the overflow menu.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.601
&gt;&gt;Reto: So there's something I noticed when
you first loaded it up, it said that you had

00:30:09.601 --> 00:30:11.639
to hit this to save.

00:30:11.639 --> 00:30:16.640
So, and this is my, so you have to save it
once and then it will auto save.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.940
So that's, interesting.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.720
There's two problems I have with that.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.019
First of all, that's not what this icon does.

00:30:23.019 --> 00:30:27.220
So if you look at sort of again, app design
guidelines for navigation, this button should

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.460
take you to the home of the app.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.580
&gt;&gt;Fred: The home of the application, yeah.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.580
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:36.450
And once you're home, you shouldn't, that
basically that button should then become inactive.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.540
It shouldn’t do anything.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.660
It certainly shouldn't pop up a dialog.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:45.299
&gt;&gt;Fred: So, say if it's associated with the
"save" action, it should really belong to

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:51.500
the right hand side of the action bar, where
you know, where typically people put you know,

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.080
any action related items.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: yeah.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.220
&gt;&gt;Fred: Or action items.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.220
&gt;&gt;Reto: Indeed.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.190
[laughs] I'd go a step further and say that
what you probably wanna do is, let's see,

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.350
do we have touch enabled?

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.350
We do.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.190
So I would make this a touch target for clicking.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.940
So that you click on that and it may actually
work.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.690
No, so you click on that.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.250
And that will let you modify the title.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.250
Saving.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.250
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.250
Yeah.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.250
&gt;&gt;Reto: Saving should just happen.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.250
So this is the same as the previous app.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:17.250
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.389
&gt;&gt;Reto: You shouldn't have to explicitly do
something in order to start saving your work.

00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:19.830
It should just start saving it straight away.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:25.399
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, initially this text or string
should probably say "Untitled" or something.

00:31:25.399 --> 00:31:27.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: Untitled one, untitled two.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.360
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: Same way that text pad or notepad
works in Mac.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.100
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.100
Definitely.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.100
Definitely.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.070
And change this to your app icon which brings
you to, back to the home screen.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.899
&gt;&gt;Reto: So what happens, so, I guess if we
hit plus.

00:31:39.899 --> 00:31:43.710
&gt;&gt;Fred: Sorry, I just hit back and then it
brought me back to

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:44.780
&gt;&gt;Reto: and then it exited out.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.419
Because I was wondering, I was looking at
this

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:47.419
&gt;&gt;Fred: not exit button.

00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:48.419
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sorry.

00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:50.769
[laughs] So I was looking at this and I was
wondering to myself, OK, how do I get a list

00:31:50.769 --> 00:31:51.769
of all of my notes?

00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:56.309
'Cause I know plus is gonna let me add a new
note.

00:31:56.309 --> 00:31:58.470
Um, so now I have two notes.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.150
So how do I view them?

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:04.429
I'm guessing maybe "folder" so yeah, hitting
the folder button shows me a list.

00:32:04.429 --> 00:32:08.610
Now, particularly on tablets, I feel like
that should be something which we can have

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:09.610
on the side.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.820
So we have a list of all of our notes and
then a list view on the side.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.820
And then whichever one we're currently working
on appearing next to it.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.820
Rather than having almost two separate screens.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.100
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right, time to read up on fragments
on Android.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.100
Absolutely.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.100
Yeah.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.519
Now as far as how you would do that for a
phone, I would probably have this as your

00:32:24.519 --> 00:32:25.519
home screen.

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:30.070
So I like the idea of the first time you open
it when you have no notes, of opening it to

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.800
sort of that screen where you can start typing
straight away.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.440
Once you have multiple notes, it would be
nice to be able to return to a home screen

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.290
which had that list so that you're able to
choose from and for me, intuitively hitting

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.529
back from any particular note should take
you to that list of notes.

00:32:43.529 --> 00:32:44.529
&gt;&gt;Fred: yeah, definitely.

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:48.590
Now on the folder screen I would say the implementation
of this button,

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.590
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mm-hum.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:50.590
&gt;&gt;Fred: is appropriate.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.590
&gt;&gt;Reto: Humm.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.919
&gt;&gt;Fred: Because you have an up affordance
where you bring it back to the sort of, but

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:57.990
hierarchically, this should be in the home
screen.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: that's kind of the other way around.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.159
&gt;&gt;Fred: And if you go back up, it doesn't
really make sense.

00:33:01.159 --> 00:33:02.159
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] Exactly.

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:05.080
&gt;&gt;Fred: Because supposedly this is the topmost
level of your application.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.140
&gt;&gt;Reto: Right.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.140
Indeed.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.549
So I think what we would suggest is that you
switch these around.

00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:14.049
So that when you're in a particular note,
you have the up affordance over here.

00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:17.970
And then once you hit back then you just have
this which becomes your home screen.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:18.970
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:19.970
Right.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.519
&gt;&gt;Reto: So it would be interesting to know
why you went the way you did.

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:25.559
But that's, I think that's our general guidance
in terms of navigation.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:30.500
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, also I would go back to the
note editing screen and I would say, looking

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.929
at this folder icon, intuitively doesn’t
really tell me that, OK, it would bring me

00:33:35.929 --> 00:33:37.519
to the list of notes.

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.519
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:43.149
&gt;&gt;Fred: Rather, I thought when I first looked
at it, it would open up previous note.

00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:47.169
A previous note rather than this thing of
all available notes.

00:33:47.169 --> 00:33:48.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's interesting.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.690
See I saw it and thought to myself, this will
let me tag or file this note in a particular

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:53.690
folder.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:54.690
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh, right.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:55.690
Yeah.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:56.690
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, ambiguity is not your friend.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:57.690
Alright, let's move on real quick.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.549
Lets' have a look at the next app which is
Papyrus.

00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:01.549
Which I think you were having a

00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:02.549
&gt;&gt;Fred: Papyrus.

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:03.549
&gt;&gt;Reto: Look at earlier today.

00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:04.679
&gt;&gt;Fred: Alright, let's read through it.

00:34:04.679 --> 00:34:06.450
Have you read through the license agreements?

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.450
&gt;&gt;Fred: Click accept?

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:09.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yes.

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:10.450
&gt;&gt;Fred: Cool?

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:11.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yes.

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:12.870
&gt;&gt;Ian: [shouting] No, we don't want to accept
that!

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:13.870
&gt;&gt;Reto: Uh, what?

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:14.870
Oh.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:15.870
&gt;&gt;Fred: Ian, what?

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:16.870
[laughter]

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:17.870
&gt;&gt;Reto: Just bar the door, don't let that
legal guy in.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:21.210
&gt;&gt;Fred: Do we have any lawyers in this room?

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.210
Um.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:23.290
So yeah, I mean, you're

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:24.290
&gt;&gt;Reto: This is interesting.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.280
&gt;&gt;Fred: At first launch you're greeted by
"Welcome to Papyrus."

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.300
And a bunch of overlaid instructions.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:35.020
Which tends to be a pretty popular way of
showing to your users you know, how do we,

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.840
how exactly to use your apps.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.940
Although, a lot of the icons illustrated here,
are sort of make sense.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:42.940
To me.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.940
Right.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hm.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.940
Pretty intuitive.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:46.940
But it's nice to have that.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.940
&gt;&gt;Fred: So you have [indistinct] very intuitive.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: That guide right off the bat.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.940
&gt;&gt;Fred: I think that's great.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.030
So you can just slide through it.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.319
So you can change colors.

00:34:52.319 --> 00:34:53.490
Do the erase.

00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:54.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: Nice.

00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:55.490
&gt;&gt;Fred: Tool picker.

00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:56.490
Color.

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:57.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: So the only, this is all quite nice.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.190
The only thing which I would say here is it
would be nice to be able to skip this entirely.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.190
&gt;&gt;Fred: Good point.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.221
&gt;&gt;Reto: So it's like, I've used this before,
I've installed it on a different device so

00:35:05.221 --> 00:35:06.520
I don't need to go through it tall.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.790
SO having a close or dismiss button next to,
you know.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:10.790
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: At every stage.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:12.790
I think might be quite nice.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:15.390
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, it's got like five to six different
steps.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.390
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.390
&gt;&gt;Fred: So it would be good.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.390
So what's new?

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.390
&gt;&gt;Reto: What's new?

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.390
So this is interesting.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.030
So I see where you're coming from here.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:26.940
But I think this, even on a tablet but any
sort of mobile device, it's kind of annoying.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.730
Like I know you guys have worked really hard
to build these new features.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:35.210
But it's just another button that I have to
press before I can start using the app.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.210
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:41.490
And chances are, in Google Play, you have
a place where you can put what's new.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.490
&gt;&gt;Fred: So use that.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:44.490
Take advantage of that.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.390
So by all means, have it as an overflow button
item or something.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:51.010
But you'll notice here that we just wanna
get to this app so that we can you know, talk

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.460
a little bit about it in the two minutes we
have remaining.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.940
And I think so far we've had to swipe or press
like seven or eight times.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.589
I don't have an active pen.

00:35:59.589 --> 00:36:04.099
So this is the layout that we were talking
about before hand with sort of your tablet

00:36:04.099 --> 00:36:07.420
layout with your list on the left and your
items on the right.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:12.020
&gt;&gt;Fred: Three top level items where you can
get notebook.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.710
So notebook is a collection of notes.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: Notes.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.160
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's how I, understand it.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: OK.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.109
So they've used sort of the more traditional,
well not more traditional, but like the first

00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:23.040
app we looked at, sort of this notepad styling.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.010
So that we can start typing.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.010
&gt;&gt;Fred: See, does it draw?

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.870
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, this is a draw.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.610
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh, [indistinct] So you just draw
stuff.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.610
Whoa.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:32.610
It's using two fingers.

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:33.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh that's interesting.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:34.610
It's letting you zoom and pan.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:35.610
&gt;&gt;Fred: Zoom.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.610
Yep.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.610
Yep.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:38.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: that's interesting.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.610
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's good.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:40.610
Let's get a different color.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:41.610
Draw something else.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.610
Cool.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:43.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: Now I think, I have a vague recollection.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.790
Let's see, zoom in.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.074
If I go [pause] No, OK.

00:36:48.074 --> 00:36:50.850
I thought maybe it was gonna do some fancy
recognition.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:51.850
&gt;&gt;Fred: [indistinct]

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:52.850
&gt;&gt;Reto: But no.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:53.850
Well, [indistinct].

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:54.850
Exactly.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.850
&gt;&gt;Fred: yeah, exactly.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:56.850
Alright.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.850
[laughter]

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:00.210
&gt;&gt;Fred: So as far as title of the notes, I
think this app has implemented what we just

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.210
suggested.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.810
&gt;&gt;Fred: Where initially here, there's no name
associated with this note.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:12.560
Where if you type on it, you can type, you
can input the name of the note.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.690
I don't know if I spelled it wrong.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.760
Or spelled it right.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760
OK?

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.830
&gt;&gt;Reto: OK, yes.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:22.510
So what have we got on the menu?

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.510
Share, page settings.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.579
So we're gonna quickly check to see if share
works the way we want it to work.

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:26.920
It does.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.920
Excellent.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.930
&gt;&gt;Fred: Awesome.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:31.210
And they have the up affordance here.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:34.599
Which brings you back to the main screen of
the application.

00:37:34.599 --> 00:37:36.339
But the screen shot, with a screen shot

00:37:36.339 --> 00:37:37.339
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's quite nice.

00:37:37.339 --> 00:37:38.339
&gt;&gt;Fred: [inaudible]

00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:40.089
&gt;&gt;Reto: So we can just start things which
show up in the start list.

00:37:40.089 --> 00:37:42.119
So that's, that's all pretty good.

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:46.790
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, I'd like to compliment also,
the developer has implemented dragging.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:47.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh nice.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.790
&gt;&gt;Fred: Drag and drop.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:49.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: nice bit of drag and drop.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.321
&gt;&gt;Fred: With your notes, to

00:37:51.321 --> 00:37:54.140
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh that's very nice.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:58.220
&gt;&gt;Fred: So drag and drop was first introduced
I believe in Honeycomb, yeah?

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.359
&gt;&gt;Reto: I'd say.

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:02.240
&gt;&gt;Fred: But so far I haven't seen a lot of
apps taking advantage of it.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.240
So, if you're watching

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, this is nice.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.240
So thank you nicely done

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240
&gt;&gt;Fred: You can see them using it.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright, we are, we are running out
of time.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:12.490
And I wanna make sure we have enough time
for Dan and Ian to get prepared for the Friday

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.970
review of games.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:21.720
I think the last thing I would like to mention
about this app is I think the

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.720
[brief musical tones]

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.079
The, uh, the only real problems, I like the
layout.

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:26.079
I like the start.

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:27.079
I like the navigation.

00:38:27.079 --> 00:38:31.250
The only real problem I had is that to get
started, to get that first note written, I

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.270
had to keep tapping a hundred different things,
you know.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.270
I had to get through the tutorial.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.570
I had to get through what's new, I had to
say I didn't have an active sync pen.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:41.880
Had to then hit new notebook, which I had
to give a name to.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880
Then hit new note.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.050
Which I had to give a name to.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:48.099
So by the time we actually get to typing something
the first time, I'm bored and I just wanna

00:38:48.099 --> 00:38:49.099
go and do something else.

00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:51.609
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right, what you're saying is that
there are impatient users out there.

00:38:51.609 --> 00:38:52.609
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, that's me.

00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:53.750
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right, me too.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:54.750
&gt;&gt;Reto: Right.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:55.750
I'm representative.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.750
&gt;&gt;Fred: Me too.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:00.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: In fact, the notebook I have on my
computer is always the simplest one available

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.700
on the system.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.750
Notepad, text pad, I just wanna be able to
hit the icon, have it start really, really

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.220
quickly, and start typing something and not
even have to hit "save".

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.160
So that's kind of the experience that I'm
looking for.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.930
Now all of the other things here, are a great
bonus.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.380
But you wanna have the ability to just write
something really, really quickly.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.850
But I don't know, what do you think?

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:23.770
So in summary, I think this is probably my
favorite of the three we've looked at, yeah?

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.770
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh yeah.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:25.770
Definitely.

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:26.770
Yeah.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:27.770
Same.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:28.770
&gt;&gt;Reto: very cool, so nicely done, Papyrus.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:29.770
Good piece of work.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.770
And to the other two apps as well.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.790
Definitely no shame there.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.970
So it's nice implementations and certainly
some different approaches.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.510
But hopefully some of the advice we've given
will help you to tighten it up a little bit

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.040
and create something even better.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.040
&gt;&gt;Fred: Alright.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: Anything you wanna add?

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.450
&gt;&gt;Fred: No, that's all.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:46.580
&gt;&gt;Reto: Well good, perfect.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.610
So next week we're gonna be looking at news
apps.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:54.329
So if you have an app that delivers the news,
please put it into the Moderator page, and

00:39:54.329 --> 00:39:59.300
we will go through and handpick a selection
which we think would be interesting to look

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.300
at and talk about.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.300
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's great.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.800
&gt;&gt;Reto: So we'll sign off for today.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800
Oh, Ian.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:09.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: well, I was just gonna say, why don't
you tell the people at home what they can

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.460
do to put their apps in the Moderator?

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.070
&gt;&gt;Reto: What they can do?

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.070
Oh, of course.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.569
Thank you Ian.

00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:17.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: How do they do it?

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very discreet.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.119
So once you find the link and you go to the
appropriate Moderator page and you find the

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:26.569
appropriate category which is going to be
by week, what I want you to do then is put

00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:28.250
in a brief description of your app.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:32.923
But most importantly, and I think this is
what Ian was very subtly alluding to, we need

00:40:32.923 --> 00:40:37.690
to have a link to the app in, placed in the
Google Play Store.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.569
And we also would like you to include a link
to your Google plus profile.

00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:45.880
So that can be the one of the developers,
designers, or if you've got a plus page, for

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.609
your app, so much the better.

00:40:47.609 --> 00:40:51.300
We wanna try and make sure that the developers
of all of these apps get a chance to join

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.480
us in these hangouts and discuss their apps
and receive that feedback one to one.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.270
So we need a way to be able to get in touch
and schedule those hangouts with you.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.270
&gt;&gt;Fred: that's right.

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: those Moderator pages are open now.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:06.400
And they will close the Wednesday before the
Friday review so that we have a couple days

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.990
to look at the apps before we review them.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.990
&gt;&gt;Fred: Good point.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: Terrific.

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.200
Thank you very much Ian.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.270
Alright, so there's gonna be more of Ian in
just a few minutes.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:18.430
So we're gonna sign off and we'll see you
next week, next Friday at one o'clock when

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.430
we're looking at news apps.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:20.430
&gt;&gt;Fred: Alright.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:21.430
See you next time.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.437
&gt;&gt;Reto: So thank you for joining us.
