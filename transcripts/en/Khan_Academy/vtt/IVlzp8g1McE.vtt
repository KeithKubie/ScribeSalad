00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.554
- [Narrator] So I have two,
different random variables here.

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:06.370
And what I wanna do is think about

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.404
what type of random variables they are.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:10.803
So this first random variable, x,

00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:12.818
is equal to the number of sixes

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:15.235
after 12 rolls of a fair die.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.308
Well this looks pretty much like

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:20.424
a binomial random variable.

00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:21.969
In fact, I'm pretty confident it is

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.515
a binomial random variable and we

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:25.822
can just go down the checklist.

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:27.612
The outcome of each trial can be

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.572
a success or failure.

00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:32.655
So, trial outcome success or failure.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.831
It's either gonna go either way.

00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:44.068
The result of each trial is independent

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:45.192
from the other one.

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:47.557
Whether I get a six on the third trial

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:48.775
is independent of whether I got

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:51.147
a six on the first or the second trial.

00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:53.351
So result, let me write this,

00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:55.841
trial, I'll just do a shorthand trial,

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:58.591
results independent, independent,

00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:03.539
that's an important condition.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.797
Let's see, there are a
fixed number of trials.

00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:09.714
Fixed number of trials.

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:15.925
In this case we're gonna have 12 trials.

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:17.701
And then the last one is, we have

00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:20.457
the same probability on each trial.

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:22.707
Same probability of success

00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:26.090
probability on each trial.

00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:33.553
So yes indeed, this met
all of the conditions

00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:37.470
for being a binomial,
binomial random variable.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.355
And this was all just a little

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:45.687
bit of review about things that

00:01:45.687 --> 00:01:48.030
we have talked about in other videos.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.771
But what about this thing
in the salmon color?

00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:51.944
The random variable y.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:54.480
So this says the number of rolls

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.230
until we get a six on a fair die.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.703
So this one strikes us as
a little bit different.

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:03.433
But let's see where it
is actually different.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:06.855
So, does it meet that the trial outcomes

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:10.665
that there's a clear success
or failure for each trial?

00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:12.328
Well yeah, we're just gonna keep rolling.

00:02:12.328 --> 00:02:14.474
So each time we roll, it's a trial.

00:02:14.474 --> 00:02:16.092
And success is when we get a six.

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:18.406
Failure is when we don't get a six.

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.113
So the outcome of each trial can

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:23.520
be classified as either
a success or a failure.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.846
So it meets, maybe I'll put the checks

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:29.011
right over here, it meets
this first constraint.

00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.612
Are the results of each trial independent?

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:34.857
Well whether I get a six on the first roll

00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:36.971
or the second roll, or the third roll,

00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.134
or the fourth roll, or the third roll,

00:02:39.134 --> 00:02:41.341
the probabilities shouldn't be dependent

00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:45.181
on whether I did or didn't
get a six on a previous roll.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:47.598
So, we have the independents.

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:49.866
And we also have the same probability

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:51.137
of success on each trial.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.161
In every case it's a 1/6 probability that

00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.935
I get a six, so this stays constant.

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:58.557
And I skipped this third
condition for a reason.

00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:02.832
Because we clearly don't have
a fixed number of trials.

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:07.558
Over here we could roll 50
times until we get a six.

00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:08.609
The probability that we'd have

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.424
to roll 50 times is very low.

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:12.227
But we might have to roll 500 times

00:03:12.227 --> 00:03:13.619
in order to get a six.

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.694
In fact, think about what
the minimum value of y is

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:19.576
and what the maximum value of y is.

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:23.743
So the minimum value that
this random variable can take,

00:03:24.992 --> 00:03:27.704
I'll just call it min y, is equal to what?

00:03:27.704 --> 00:03:29.263
Well, it's gonna take at least one roll.

00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:31.064
So that's the minimum value.

00:03:31.064 --> 00:03:34.309
But what is the maximum value for y?

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.468
And I'll let you think about that.

00:03:36.468 --> 00:03:39.198
I'll assumed you thought about
it, if you paused the video.

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:41.024
Well, there is no max value.

00:03:41.024 --> 00:03:42.677
You can't say, "Oh it's a billion."

00:03:42.677 --> 00:03:44.401
Because there's some probability

00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:46.862
that it might take a
billion and one rolls.

00:03:46.862 --> 00:03:49.413
It is a very, very, very,
very, very, very small

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:51.977
probability, but there's some probability.

00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:55.786
It could take a Google
rolls, a Google plex rolls.

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:58.321
So you can imagine where this is going.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.020
So this type of random variable,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.393
where it meets a lot of the constraints

00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:05.043
of a binomial random variable.

00:04:05.043 --> 00:04:08.025
Each trial has a clear
success or failure outcome.

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:10.740
The probability of success
on each trial is constant.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.158
The trial results are
independent of each other.

00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:16.215
But we don't have a
fixed number of trials.

00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:17.746
In fact, it's a situation, we're saying,

00:04:17.746 --> 00:04:19.906
"How many trials do we need to get,

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:23.459
"to we need to have until we get success?"

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:25.458
Maybe that's a general way of framing

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:27.378
this type of random variable.

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:29.878
How many trials until success?

00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:40.892
While the binomial random variable was,

00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:44.142
how many trials, or how many successes,

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.905
I should say, how many successes in

00:04:52.748 --> 00:04:54.748
finite number of trials?

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.863
So if you see this general form

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:02.226
and it meets these conditions, you can

00:05:02.226 --> 00:05:05.026
feel good it's a binomial random variable.

00:05:05.026 --> 00:05:07.207
But if we're meeting this condition,

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:09.532
clear success or failure outcome,

00:05:09.532 --> 00:05:12.170
independent trials, constant probability,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.790
but we're not talking about the successes

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.470
in a finite number of trials.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.426
We're talking about how
many trials until success?

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:20.438
Then this type of random variable

00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:23.605
is called a geometric random variable.

00:05:28.736 --> 00:05:30.922
And we will see why, in future videos

00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:32.839
it is called geometric.

00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:35.902
Because the math that involves

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:38.331
the probabilities of various outcomes

00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:41.044
looks a lot like geometric growth,

00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:43.103
or geometric sequences and series

00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:45.563
that we look at in other
types of mathematics.

00:05:45.563 --> 00:05:46.930
And in case I forgot to mention,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.280
the reason why they're called binomial

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.153
random variables is because when you

00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:52.825
think about the probabilities
of different outcomes,

00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:55.137
you have these things called
binomial coefficients,

00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:56.993
based on combinatorics.

00:05:56.993 --> 00:05:58.899
And those come out of things like

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:01.048
Pascal's Triangle and when you take

00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:03.881
a binomial to ever increasing powers.

00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:06.135
So that's where those words come from.

00:06:06.135 --> 00:06:07.602
But in the next few videos, the important

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:10.092
thing is to recognize the
difference between the two.

00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:11.306
And then we're gonna start thinking

00:06:11.306 --> 00:06:14.743
about how do we deal with
geometric random variables.
