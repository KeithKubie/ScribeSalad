00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.600
The Brontosaurus was a dinosaur we all loved.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.910
Then we were told it wasn’t real.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.220
Now it’s back.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.460
What’s going on???

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.480
Hello Everyone, Crystal here with more DNews!

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.289
What picture pops into your head when I say
the word “dinosaur”?

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.520
If you’re like me it’s either
Brontosaurus, Triceratops, or Tyrannosaurus

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.520
rex.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.000
It doesn’t matter that now I know better,
no amount of scientific training can make

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.179
me un-see The Land Before Time.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.009
But Littlefoot wasn’t the beginning of our
cultural love-affair with Brontosaurus.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.399
Everyone’s favorite dinosaur that wasn’t
Brontosaurus excelsus thundered onto the scene

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.329
in 1879 when paleontologist Othneil Charles
Marsh published a paper titled “Notice of

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.320
New Jurassic Reptiles” and Brontosaurus
(basically due to an excellent PR team) quickly

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.020
became the pattern card for our idea of these
giant lizards.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.020
But Marsh had discovered many similar fossils
and Brontosaurus’s problems began around

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.879
1903 when a more in-depth analysis of Marsh’s
collection by another paleontologist, revealed

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.091
that the differences between Brontosaurus
and the earlier-named Apatosaurus were too

00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.130
slight for the two to be more than different
species.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.780
Remember the biological taxonomy Kingdom,
Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.690
Well Apatosaurus became the common genus and
what we know as the Brontosaurus was demoted

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.220
to Apatosaurus excelsus.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.410
But the name Brontosaurus refused to fade
into the mists!

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.700
It was so beloved it took more than 50 years
for museums to consistently present the dinosaur

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.020
under its correct classification and use of
the name in pop culture and childrens books

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.500
persisted almost until present day -- because
science literacy is not really a thing in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500
this country

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.920
Speaking of museums, you may have heard a
rumor that the existence of Brontosaurus was

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.270
a simple case of mistaken identity when a
Camarasaurus head was incorrectly matched

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.990
to an Apatosaurus body, but this isn’t really
true.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.450
Yes, at one time we thought the Apatosaurus
skull looked similar to Camarasaurus but identification

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.490
of Brontosaurus as a genus had nothing to
do with the mix and match.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.320
In fact, we didn’t know what the skull of
Apatosaurus looked like until the late 70s

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.560
when a fossil discovered in the early 1900s
was confirmed to belong to Apatosaurus.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
So what happened?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.840
Just when we were accepting that Brontosaurus
was a thing of the past (*rim shot*) the name

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.420
Brontosaurus has returned!!!

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.060
Well, this is how science works.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.710
It’s a process, and new technologies and
insights can render previous ways of thinking

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.710
obsolete.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.520
Also, when it comes to naming really old organisms
scientists are constantly refining their approach.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.020
In this case, an international team of scientists
performed one of the most extensive specimen-based

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.780
phylogenetic analysis of sauropod dinosaurs!

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.510
The specimens were scored for 477 morphological
characters.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.630
The paper, published in the journal PeerJ
contains a provocative statement: “Of particular

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.110
note is that the famous genus Brontosaurus
is considered valid by our quantitative approach.”

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.040
Now, this issue is by no means settled, other
researchers in the field have to agree, and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.530
that hasn’t happened yet.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.270
One of the most important aspects of science
is reproducibility.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.870
If your colleagues can’t reproduce your
experiment and results, and draw the same

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.810
conclusion, your “finding” remains just
“opinion” and *that* isn’t very scientific.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.230
But we have hope!

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.440
And while experts like my friend Brian Switek
warn that our old idea of Brontosaurus, as

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.590
a large, dumb, water loving animal will never
again see the light of day.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.130
A lighter, more streamlined, version may once
again take pride of place in our museum halls

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.130
and textbooks.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.130
What do you think?

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.510
Should Brontosaurus return?
