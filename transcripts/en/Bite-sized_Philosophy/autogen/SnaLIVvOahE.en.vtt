00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 align:start position:0%
the Kaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.930 align:start position:0%
the Kaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
and<00:00:03.200><c> so</c><00:00:04.200><c> and</c><00:00:04.920><c> that's</c><00:00:05.220><c> very</c><00:00:05.490><c> interesting</c>

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
and so and that's very interesting
 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.670 align:start position:0%
and so and that's very interesting

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 align:start position:0%
you can assume that it's that it doesn't
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550 align:start position:0%
you can assume that it's that it doesn't

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter same thing all right so
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter same thing all right so
here's<00:00:27.180><c> the</c><00:00:27.359><c> kicker</c><00:00:27.570><c> there's</c><00:00:27.900><c> one</c><00:00:28.080><c> more</c><00:00:28.260><c> class</c>

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 align:start position:0%
here's the kicker there's one more class
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.790 align:start position:0%
here's the kicker there's one more class
of<00:00:29.640><c> things</c><00:00:30.000><c> that</c><00:00:30.300><c> you</c><00:00:30.449><c> can</c><00:00:30.630><c> run</c><00:00:30.810><c> into</c><00:00:31.170><c> along</c>

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
of things that you can run into along
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.069 align:start position:0%
of things that you can run into along
the<00:00:32.160><c> way</c><00:00:32.279><c> and</c><00:00:32.550><c> this</c><00:00:33.329><c> is</c><00:00:33.510><c> where</c><00:00:33.690><c> the</c><00:00:33.780><c> chaos</c>

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
the way and this is where the chaos
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.590 align:start position:0%
the way and this is where the chaos
breaks<00:00:34.410><c> through</c><00:00:34.710><c> so</c><00:00:35.640><c> let's</c><00:00:35.850><c> say</c><00:00:41.600><c> you're</c>

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
breaks through so let's say you're
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
breaks through so let's say you're
moving<00:00:42.899><c> from</c><00:00:42.989><c> point</c><00:00:43.200><c> A</c><00:00:43.379><c> to</c><00:00:43.440><c> point</c><00:00:43.530><c> B</c><00:00:43.800><c> and</c>

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 align:start position:0%
moving from point A to point B and
 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.540 align:start position:0%
moving from point A to point B and
something<00:00:45.930><c> that</c><00:00:46.050><c> you</c><00:00:46.170><c> don't</c><00:00:46.350><c> expect</c>

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 align:start position:0%
something that you don't expect
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
something that you don't expect
Oh<00:00:47.700><c> curves</c><00:00:48.440><c> and</c><00:00:49.440><c> it</c><00:00:49.710><c> gets</c><00:00:49.860><c> in</c><00:00:50.010><c> the</c><00:00:50.100><c> way</c><00:00:50.219><c> so</c>

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 align:start position:0%
Oh curves and it gets in the way so
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.350 align:start position:0%
Oh curves and it gets in the way so
let's<00:00:51.890><c> say</c><00:00:52.890><c> that</c><00:00:53.100><c> you're</c><00:00:53.910><c> living</c><00:00:54.090><c> with</c>
