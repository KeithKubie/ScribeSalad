[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.570
CRISTIN FRODELLA: I'm very
excited to welcome back

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.380
one of those incredible
women, Anjali Kumar.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.410
So many of you may
remember Anjali as one

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.530
of our fearless lawyers,
a senior counsel who

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.560
worked on projects from
Google X to YouTube.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.020
But many more of you
may remember Anjali

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.260
for hosting the At
Google speaker series,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.820
bringing in incredible chefs
like Anthony Bourdain, Jacques

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.740
Pepin, Marcus Samuelsson.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.960
I hope you got some
really good secret recipes

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.500
from all these folks.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.300
ANJALI KUMAR: I got a lot of
really great reservations,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.120
I will tell you.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.950
I still milk that.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.470
Yeah.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.550
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Nice.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.040
And to entertainers
like Questlove,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.400
who you might remember from her
series "Lunchtime at Google--"

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.340
ANJALI KUMAR:
Short-lived, but so fun.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.740
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
--which was delightful.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.880
Anjali, like most of us, knows
that most people's hearts live

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.610
in their stomach,
and so you're always

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.870
having people who can
talk to us about food.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.570
So after leaving
Google, Anjali went

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.120
to be Founding General
Counsel and Founding

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.790
Head of Social Innovation
at Warby Parker,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.930
and most recently was the Chief
People Officer at Cheddar.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.140
And throughout these jobs,
Anjali was also pretty busy

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.130
starting a family with
her beloved husband, Atul.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.410
In 2010, she had
a daughter, Zia,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.660
and it was right around
then that she started

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.980
to think about religion.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.420
And as a new mom myself, I
can totally relate to the fact

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.670
that there's nothing like
having a baby to make

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.770
you peek your head up
around out of your bubble

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.840
and say, how do I explain
the mysteries of life?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.670
So Anjali's here
today to tell us

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.090
a little bit about how she
turned over every rock in what

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.630
seemed like every corner
of the world's religions

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.160
and spiritual groups and sects
in her incredibly delightful

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.860
book, "Stalking God.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.170
So without further
ado, please help

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.950
me give a warm welcome
back to Anjali Kumar.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.180
ANJALI KUMAR: Thank you.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.630
Thank you so much for having me.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.090
It is such a thrill to be here.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.280
And to actually not know
everybody in the audience

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.350
means that more
Googlers showed up

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.542
than just my team,
which is so meaningful.

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:15.955
Thank you.

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:18.170
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
So Anjali, tell

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.210
us a little bit about yourself.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.520
Like what was life like
growing up for you?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.420
Where'd you grow up?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.520
How did you kind of
get to this place

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.320
where you were asking
all these questions?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.190
ANJALI KUMAR: Sure.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.020
So I was born in
Brooklyn, actually,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.700
but raised outside of Chicago.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.710
Go Brooklyn.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.300
Woo-hoo for Brooklyn.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.130
And raised outside of
Chicago by Indian parents.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.970
Jain is my religion,
so it's sort

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.060
of a small, very minority
religion, at least outside

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.750
of India, but raised
culturally Hindu, and also went

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.549
to Catholic school.

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.840
You might get a sense of why
I wrote this book when you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.131
start hearing things like that.

00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.790
There are a lot of religion and
a lot of traditions around me.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.590
And for me, it was
really cultural,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.256
and it was just something that I
never really thought much about

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.090
or questioned because
it was so seamlessly

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.360
interwoven into our lives and
I just never felt the need

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.990
to ask the big questions.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.641
And as you said, it was when my
daughter, Zia, was born, which

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:10.890
happened when I was at Google.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.580
Not physically at Google, but--

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.300
oh.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.799
Hold on.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.040
We're having a mic issue.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.730
Oh, keep going.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.620
OK so it was while I
was employed at Google.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.290
I had my daughter Zia
about eight years ago,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.740
almost nine years ago.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.149
And it was in a
conversation with my dad

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:29.940
when he said to me soon
after she was born,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.230
he was like oh, you should
take her to the temple.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.070
There's a Jain
temple out in Queens

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.950
and you should take her there
to show her what we believe.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.794
And I was like,
what do we believe?

00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:39.460
I was like, huh.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.649
That's a really
interesting question.

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:42.940
I was like, what do we believe?

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.860
Wait, did I miss something?

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.930
Because I was into
the traditions

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.570
and I wanted to do all the
right things and like, you know,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.742
check off all the traditional
boxes, but I was like,

00:03:49.742 --> 00:03:51.200
I don't really know
what I believe,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.280
and I just had never
thought about it.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.270
So I decided to start
researching because I realized

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.730
at some point, there would
be this set of questions

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.470
that my daughter would
inevitably ask me.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.220
Like what happens when you die?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.080
Is there a god?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.190
How do you find happiness?

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.777
What's the meaning of life?

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:07.610
Things that I could not
Google an answer to.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.840
Literally that was the
start of the journey.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.570
And so I started doing
research and I was like, well

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.611
what do I really believe?

00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:14.116
And maybe I'll go
see this healer

00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:15.240
and go do this other thing.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.970
And it started as
a very quiet thing

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.440
because I worked at
Google and I was like,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.023
everyone's going to
think I'm bananas.

00:04:20.023 --> 00:04:22.300
And I worked at Google
in the legal department,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.230
so the last thing you
want is your lawyer

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.110
going off and doing
all this crazy stuff.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.540
But then as I started telling
people, and especially

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.446
colleagues at
Google, they really

00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:34.320
surprised me because
they started being like,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.820
oh, have you checked
out this thing?

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.660
And like, I know this healer
downtown or I saw this shaman

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.416
or I've tried
ayahuasca or whatever.

00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:41.290
And I was like, what?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.581
I was like, everybody's doing
this stuff except for me?

00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:46.430
So like I'm the only one
who hasn't been searching,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.817
and that's what started
the whole thing.

00:04:49.817 --> 00:04:51.650
CRISTIN FRODELLA: While
I was thinking about

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.150
like what can I
talk with you about,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.910
I was looking at emails
that we had exchanged,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.060
and there is one titled Amma.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.897
And you and I are both
friends with Gopi, who--

00:05:01.897 --> 00:05:03.980
ANJALI KUMAR: Googler
extraordinaire [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.430
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Yes.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.096
If you guys don't
know Gopi, you should,

00:05:06.096 --> 00:05:08.530
but he started
the Yoglers group,

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.660
and he teaches yoga
out in California

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.310
amongst the many
other things that he

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.350
does including being Googler.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.460
And he turned a lot
of us on to Amma.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.420
who is sort of
the hugging saint.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.026
And I know you wrote
about Amma in your book.

00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:26.650
Can you tell us a
little bit about her?

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.441
ANJALI KUMAR: Sure.

00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:29.260
She's actually my
opening chapter,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.480
and it was through a
conversation with Gopi

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.610
where he was like, oh, I
follow this woman, Amma.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.770
She goes around the world
literally hugging people.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.520
That's her job.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.460
That's what she does.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.470
It sounds like kind
of a weird job,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.490
but she makes a lot
of money doing this.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.647
And so she goes around
the world giving hugs.

00:05:44.647 --> 00:05:46.480
And she was coming just
to midtown Manhattan

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.479
and it was July 4th
weekend many summers ago,

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.770
so I was like, all right,
I'm going to go check it out.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.510
And I jump in a
cab and I go there,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.800
and it was so interesting.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.700
It was like lines out the
door, thousands and thousands

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.520
of people.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.120
I stood in line for probably
over four hours waiting

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.780
for a hug, and then had this
experience of like settling in.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.917
It was like an over-familiar
auntie, you know,

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:08.250
if you've ever experienced that.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.910
You're kind of like, this
is getting uncomfortable.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.990
Like, can you let
go of the grip?

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.370
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
She wouldn't let go?

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.820
ANJALI KUMAR: She
wouldn't let go,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.630
but then suddenly, you're
like peeled off of her

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.110
and like thrown off to the--

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.120
just like a puppy,
like just thrown off.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.180
And it was deeply
unsatisfying for me

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.690
personally, but so
satisfying to so many people

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.240
there who were in tears
having hugs from her

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.340
and who are really
deep followers,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.310
and I think that also
helped me sort of go

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.560
into all of these experiences
with a really open mind,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.934
being like, you know, just
because it's not right for me,

00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:40.180
there might be something
that I can take from it

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.670
and then continue on
the journey to find

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.060
what really resonates for me.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.910
But then I really
respect the fact

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.180
that Gopi and other friends
of mine really believe in her

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.920
and really follow
her around the world

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.450
and go every summer
to get a hug from her.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.790
I have not gone back, but
there's great food when you go.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.130
And so if you're
not into the hug,

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.680
there's amazing vegetarian food
in the basement of the hall.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.260
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Nice.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.850
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.900
There's always
something redeeming

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.055
in all of these things.

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:07.721
CRISTIN FRODELLA: So
speaking of belief,

00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:09.055
your husband is a doctor, right?

00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:09.845
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:11.380
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
As a scientist,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.285
what did he think
about all this?

00:07:13.285 --> 00:07:14.095
ANJALI KUMAR: He
thinks I'm bananas.

00:07:14.095 --> 00:07:14.360
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
What was his response?

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.693
ANJALI KUMAR: What do you think?

00:07:15.693 --> 00:07:17.900
He is the most patient
man in the universe.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.930
So he is an interventional
cardiologist,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.820
like he is a
Superman of science.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.680
And I think for him, again,
so much of spirituality,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.180
religion has just been cultural
for him so he doesn't really

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.805
think about it.

00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:31.540
He doesn't waver
around these questions.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.980
He sort of goes through
the motions of religion.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.000
He's Hindu, was raised Hindu,
and I think, if pressed,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.040
would call himself Hindu.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.080
But he definitely--
there were moments

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.660
when I was doing the
research where he was like,

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.637
you're not going to do
that, like that's crazy.

00:07:46.637 --> 00:07:48.220
Or when I would come
back from things,

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.330
he was like, oh my word.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.540
Like the chanting, the
tantric sound healing,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.402
I think that definitely
tested our relationship.

00:07:55.402 --> 00:07:56.860
But he's got a good
sense of humor,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.802
so he mostly went along with it.

00:07:58.802 --> 00:07:59.760
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Nice.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.190
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.900
He did not come with
me on anything though.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.650
CRISTIN FRODELLA: None of them?

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.160
ANJALI KUMAR: No, just one.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.930
He did the meditation with me.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:05.644
He learned TM.

00:08:05.644 --> 00:08:07.060
He didn't do the
vipassana, but he

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.010
did a transcendental
meditation course with me.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.830
But I found out
later from him it

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.467
was because I had told him
about all of these athletes that

00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:16.300
did it, professional
athletes that he really

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.770
respected and admired.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.070
So he was like, oh really?

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.330
Like that's kind of cool?

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.630
It's like, you're not
a football player.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.120
Like when do you think this
is going to come in handy?

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.540
But he was really into like the
mental toughness aspect of it.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.498
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Yeah.

00:08:26.498 --> 00:08:29.009
I really want to do it
because of David Lynch.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:29.800
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.460
That's where I learned.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.210
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
I feel like it's

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.110
going to let me write
some sort of crazy thing.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.240
ANJALI KUMAR: It's going
to let you write a book.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:34.840
I'm telling you.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.110
Yeah.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.010
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Maybe.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.992
ANJALI KUMAR: I caught
the big fish through that.

00:08:37.992 --> 00:08:38.900
CRISTIN FRODELLA: You did?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.164
Nice.

00:08:39.164 --> 00:08:40.122
ANJALI KUMAR: For sure.

00:08:40.122 --> 00:08:42.549
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Which
is a book by David Lynch.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:50.910
So after you went
to Amma, what was

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.240
sort of like your next step?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.480
Like you're like, OK.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.320
I did this here.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.280
I'm in New York City.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.054
This doesn't work for me.

00:08:58.054 --> 00:08:59.970
I know you started
traveling around the world.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.250
You mentioned that your
husband didn't go with you,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.130
but I know your sister
went with you to Brazil

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:05.922
to see John of God.

00:09:05.922 --> 00:09:06.671
ANJALI KUMAR: Yes.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.150
CRISTIN FRODELLA: And so I
thought the John of God story

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.330
was particularly a little crazy.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.690
ANJALI KUMAR: So John of God--

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.640
my sister does not
appear in the chapter,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.710
because the narrative
just worked better

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.110
without her in it, but
she was there with me.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.680
John of God is a healer.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.287
A medium is what
they consider him,

00:09:26.287 --> 00:09:28.120
so there's a lot of
people around the world,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.060
including Oprah,
who really believe

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.430
that he can cure
all that ails you,

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.410
whether physical,
emotional, spiritual.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.500
And so people will
go down to see him

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.209
in this small town in the middle
of Brazil and get healing.

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:42.750
You sort of just
pass in front of him

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.000
and you meditate for days
and that kind of thing,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.930
and he scans, I guess, your
auric field and then heals you.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.930
I don't fully know how it
works because it's definitely

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.509
out there.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.050
But people really believe in
him and really believe that he--

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.820
CRISTIN FRODELLA: But he
does surgery on people.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.320
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.020
That's crazy.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.170
That stuff is-- yeah, he does
surgery without anesthesia.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.730
Sometimes there's
cutting, and he

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.350
claims that he cuts because
the people need to see the cut,

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.600
like the patient
needs to see the cut,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.210
but not because it's
actually required.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.360
But there are people
who say that they

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.884
have been cured of cancer
and a lot of other things

00:10:17.884 --> 00:10:19.050
by going to see John of God.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.130
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Did
you see any surgeries

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:20.700
while you were there?

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.280
ANJALI KUMAR: I saw some cutting
and some eyeball scraping.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.470
It was really out
there, and it ended up

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.340
becoming a real anchor
for me in the narrative

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.340
of this particular book.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.200
So it's one of
the first chapters

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.920
of the book of going down
to seeing him and, you know,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.150
what happens there.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.580
And then when the
conclusion comes,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.530
it sort of ties
the whole thing up

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:48.630
of what I found on this very
long journey because of things

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.376
that happened related to him
but not directly from him.

00:10:52.376 --> 00:10:54.250
CRISTIN FRODELLA: So
tell me more about that.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.600
What do you mean?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.391
ANJALI KUMAR: Sure.

00:10:55.391 --> 00:10:58.950
So when you go to see John of
God, you can also make wishes,

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.870
so you go down with
your three intentions.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.380
It's sort of like wishing
through a genie in a bottle.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.900
And what you can also
do is bring photographs

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.840
of other people who would like
to be seen by John of God who

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.360
can't make the trip,
so you can save them

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.750
the airfare down to Brazil, and
he will scan the photographs

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.250
and apparently do
distance healing.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.520
So I guess if you believe
that he can heal you

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.400
by looking at you, it's
probably not that much of a leap

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.040
to think that he could also
heal other people by scanning

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.030
a photograph.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.120
So when I was going down, I
started offering to people,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.929
including some
colleagues at Google,

00:11:32.929 --> 00:11:34.470
that I could take
their pictures down

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.680
and that I could also take their
wishes down if they wanted.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.690
And then I started
telling random people

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.169
because I'm super
chatty, and so I

00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:42.960
was telling like the
guy at the coffee shop

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.910
and like the lady at Whole Foods
and all these other people.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.230
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Did you
have like a stack of photos

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.710
with you?

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.501
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:50.397
So I ended up getting
bombarded with e-mails,

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:52.230
like to the point where
it was really crazy.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.360
Like I just-- so
many emails, and I

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.920
had to go run and get a
bunch of photos printed

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.210
at the local Duane
Reade and whatever.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.110
And so I went down
with all these wishes

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.270
and all these photographs.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.200
And it wasn't until I was kind
of researching the entire book

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.290
and working on the conclusion
that I went back and actually

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.945
read the emails
with a fresh eye.

00:12:12.945 --> 00:12:17.220
And I noticed a few things
in common amongst the emails.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.732
And you know, there were
some things that were not

00:12:19.732 --> 00:12:21.690
necessarily as interesting,
like people gave me

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.300
very specific instructions
on how they could be reached.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.780
It was like, just in
case this shit's real--

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.590
oh, sorry.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.900
Just in case this
is real, I want

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.130
to make sure my wish is
going to the right person.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.920
So they gave me
like full addresses,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.347
apartment numbers, like
where they could be reached.

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:38.430
And then the other thing--

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.150
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
Like Santa Claus.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.570
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.320
It was like don't
let them screw it up.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.778
If this is going
to be real, I want

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:45.510
to make sure the wishes are
coming, like the good stuff is

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.520
coming to my house.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.040
The second thing that
I saw in these wishes

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.650
is that everybody was
asking for the same things,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.410
and it was health,
happiness, and love,

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.600
and it was in that order.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.270
And then the third thing
is that they all ended,

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.530
every single email
ended in the same way,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.936
and they all said,
please don't tell anyone.

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:07.605
Which I thought [INAUDIBLE]
I'm telling all of you,

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:09.150
which is nice of me.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.500
I also told a bunch
people at TED.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.980
I did it on the stage and
I wrote it in my book,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.600
so I told everybody,
but I think it's

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.870
because it's really important.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.800
It's important for us to know
that we, at the end of the day,

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.600
mostly all want the same things.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.190
So at the end of
the day, despite all

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.731
of our differences
and all the things

00:13:24.731 --> 00:13:27.060
that we might be searching
for that are different,

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.730
all the political divides,
the religious divides,

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.085
every other philosophical
divide in this divisive time,

00:13:34.085 --> 00:13:35.820
that at the end of
the day, we really all

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.885
want the same things.

00:13:37.885 --> 00:13:40.840
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
It reminds me of one

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.840
of the things you talk
about in your book, which

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.860
is Burning Man.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.210
So I've been to Burning Man.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.640
And when you go, you
have the opportunity

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.239
to write on the wall of the--

00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:50.280
ANJALI KUMAR: The temple.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.750
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
--of the temple,

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.290
something usually like a
letter to someone who's

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.500
passed or wishes
or whatever, and I

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.555
found that to be really moving.

00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:02.930
Can you tell us a little bit
about your experience there?

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.410
I know there's somebody
in the audience

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.220
here you went to
Burning Man with.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:05.640
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.720
I met him at Burning Man.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.428
We didn't even know
each other at Google,

00:14:08.428 --> 00:14:10.237
and we were in the same camp.

00:14:10.237 --> 00:14:12.570
I feel like everybody at
Google has gone to Burning Man.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.694
Isn't it a job requirement?

00:14:13.694 --> 00:14:15.120
There's nodding heads.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.360
So if you can imagine me, as a
lawyer, going into Burning Man,

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.664
like a reasonably uptight
person going to Burning Man,

00:14:23.664 --> 00:14:25.830
you can just do the math
of what that experience was

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:26.550
like for me.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.190
It was really
uncomfortable at first.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.290
And I went and I was like,
I feel so out of place

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.880
and I don't know
what I am doing here

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.410
and I don't have clothes to
radically self express myself,

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.420
like I had to borrow this
outfit from somebody.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.920
Like I don't--

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.850
I worked in tech.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.270
CRISTIN FRODELLA: You
didn't have costumes?

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.160
ANJALI KUMAR: No, I
did not have costumes.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.680
I don't have a lot of
feathers in my wardrobe.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.502
You know, like I don't have
stuff to wear at Burning Man.

00:14:49.502 --> 00:14:51.210
No one's going to see
me in a bikini top.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.418
Like it's just not happening.

00:14:52.418 --> 00:14:53.760
I've had a child, not happening.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.570
So going there was really
out of my comfort zone

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.430
to put myself in that situation,
and I ended up loving it

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.490
after a couple of days.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.280
Like once I kind
of got in my groove

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.490
and got over myself
and got over the dust

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.087
and got over the
general lack of--

00:15:10.087 --> 00:15:11.170
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Dryness.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.770
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah, just
the dryness and the lack

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.650
of sanitary conditions
around bathrooms.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.950
Once I got over that,
I really enjoyed it.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:25.320
And I feel like you
really-- that cliche

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.330
of what you need out
of that experience

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.052
is truly what you get, and I
think that was true for me.

00:15:30.052 --> 00:15:31.510
I got a lot of rest
at Burning Man.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.560
I think I was the only
person who came back

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.670
reasonably well-rested,
which also just tells you

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.390
what a nerd I am.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.950
Because I was like,
oh, 11 o'clock,

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:38.580
I'm going to go to sleep.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.560
Like I just was like not
the person staying up

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.101
until 5:00 in the morning and
like doing drugs in the desert.

00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.834
Like I was just like, no, I'm
just going to go read a book

00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:47.750
and like, you know, sleep
in the healing dome.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.010
Like I was really
taking it easy.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.670
But I engaged with it in a way
that was comfortable for me,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.220
and I think I got out
of it what I needed to.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.460
And the temple, I think, was
a particularly powerful thing

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.180
for me as well.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.425
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Did
you write something?

00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:01.980
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.480
I left a lot of
wishes for friends.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.020
Again, I think part of the
journey and the way I've

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.000
kind of justified
indulging in this journey

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.160
was taking people
along with me virtually

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.091
or mentally wherever I could.

00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:16.590
So going to Burning Man, it's
like, who else has got a wish?

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.256
Like, I'll put it in
the temple for you.

00:16:18.256 --> 00:16:23.250
And so writing those for
people was a really emotionally

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.900
cathartic experience in a way
that I was really surprised by,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.290
like people who are
mourning friends and loved

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.490
ones including a
Googler who had died

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.960
in the Nepal earthquake, who
you all probably remember,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.960
who is a friend of mine and
a friend of a lot of friends

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.170
in common.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.360
And so just being able to bear
witness to that and to kind

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.810
of mark that for his
mom and for his friends

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.060
was really meaningful.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.136
So I think, again, I got
out of it what I needed to.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.760
And it's my favorite chapter in
the book, so there's also that.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.850
CRISTIN FRODELLA: So
speaking of the book, when

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.000
I was reading it, every
night I would sort of

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.090
come home and be like, yeah,
I wonder what wacky story

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.670
I'm going to hear tonight.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.339
And it's sort of like
hanging out with you

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.359
and getting to hear all
of your best stories.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:15.550
So what do you think of all
of these wacky adventures?

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.310
Like what's the craziest
thing that you saw?

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.810
ANJALI KUMAR: I would
say the tantric sound

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.560
healing was probably one of
the more out their experiences.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.422
My dad read the book when
the galleys came out,

00:17:30.422 --> 00:17:32.130
and he was just like,
he couldn't look me

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.463
in the eye for a couple of days.

00:17:33.463 --> 00:17:36.160
Like he was just like,
what on earth are you up to

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.410
and can you go back to Google?

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.230
Are they still hiring?

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.880
Can you go back?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.750
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Do
you feel comfortable

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:40.950
telling these guys about it?

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.991
ANJALI KUMAR: Sure, yeah.

00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:44.141
So the experience was--

00:17:44.141 --> 00:17:46.140
I actually went after a
Google sales conference,

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.260
because we had a sales
conference out in California.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.330
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Did you
go with Google salespeople?

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.270
ANJALI KUMAR: No, nobody
from Google joined me.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.394
I should have asked people.

00:17:52.394 --> 00:17:54.900
I did not invite anyone
on that particular trip.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.810
But a friend of mine
who is a screenwriter

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.690
was going to this thing down
in Southern California, right

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.300
outside of LA in Santa Barbara,
and she told me about it.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.080
And so I went to meet her
after Google sales conference

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.090
because I was already
on the west coast.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.340
So a lot of the things, it
sounds like a very indulgent--

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.798
like oh, I'm like privileged
and flying all over the world.

00:18:12.798 --> 00:18:14.730
But I really did tack
a lot of the things

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.500
that I did onto work travel.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.780
Not just Google work travel,
but just like generally,

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.000
because I'm a mom
and I have a budget

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.150
and I'm a working person.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.910
And so trying to coordinate
these things into real life

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.910
was part of the challenge
and part of the reason

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.390
the book took so
long, the research.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.021
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
How long did it take?

00:18:32.021 --> 00:18:33.270
ANJALI KUMAR: I worked on it--

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.460
I probably researched--

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.350
I started it when
Zia was about one.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.076
She's turning nine in February.

00:18:40.076 --> 00:18:41.700
I mean, probably like
six, seven years.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.241
I mean, I've researched
and writing--

00:18:43.241 --> 00:18:44.940
not constantly
obviously, but yeah.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.052
Over the course of six
years, six, seven years.

00:18:47.052 --> 00:18:48.010
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Yeah.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.020
It's a full-time thing.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.300
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:58.240
And so basically, you lie
on the ground, and this guy,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.320
he's like a 65,
70-year old Indian man

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.460
who is not my husband.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.400
He lies on top of you.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.124
There's a sheet between you
so it's weirdly not sexual.

00:19:09.124 --> 00:19:10.290
I mean, not for me at least.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.770
So he lies on top of
you, and then he chants.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.020
I can't believe I'm telling
this story at Google.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.750
He chants into
your chakra points.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.997
So if you know where
your chakras are,

00:19:20.997 --> 00:19:23.080
you can use your imagination
of what that entails.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.150
But he sounds into your head,
and then like your throat, then

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.650
your boobs.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.220
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
All the way down.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.850
ANJALI KUMAR: All the way down.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:30.110
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Got it.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.735
ANJALI KUMAR: He goes
all the way down,

00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:34.880
and it was super bizarre,
I mean, as you can imagine.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.200
So he's doing this, and it
goes on for like 45 minutes.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.850
It's a really--
yeah, like you're

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.110
committed to this experience.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.470
And then it's a group
activity because there's

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.410
people who are not
all doing it with him,

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.850
but they're all sitting around
you as this is happening.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.210
So I mean, it's just-- it was--

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.740
that just wrote itself.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.287
Like I don't know how you
don't write about that

00:19:55.287 --> 00:19:57.120
and share that experience
with people if you

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.590
have experienced it yourself.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.310
But it was crazy.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.700
But it was also oddly relaxing.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.640
It was like having noise
canceling headphones on

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.510
or being surrounded by like bees
but they're not stinging you,

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.929
like just the humming.

00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:10.970
I know it sounds strange.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.762
It was actually
kind of delightful.

00:20:12.762 --> 00:20:14.220
I haven't gone
back, but I probably

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.480
should because it was--

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.055
there were people
who really enjoyed it

00:20:18.055 --> 00:20:18.930
much more than I did.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.096
CRISTIN FRODELLA: You'll
have to give me his number.

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.200
ANJALI KUMAR: I will.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.420
He's on Facebook.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.720
He follows me on Facebook.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.700
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Awesome.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.260
So speaking of group
activities, one

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.100
of the things you talk about
is going to this Wiccan potluck

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.054
dinner.

00:20:36.054 --> 00:20:37.720
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.950
Because I found those--

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.610
so when I think about
Wicca, I'm kind of like,

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.620
these are witches, and
you know, I don't really

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.530
know what that means and
it sounds a little dark.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.410
But that chapter was
super lighthearted

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.019
and the women seemed
really lovely.

00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:51.810
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:52.860
Everybody was amazing.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.830
That was actually
one of the chapters

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.770
that I think really
challenged my own, I guess,

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.020
unconscious bias
against witches.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.670
I didn't know I had it,
but it was the one thing--

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.170
I know.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.880
I'm sorry if anyone
in here is a Wiccan.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.820
Like I'm fully converted,
like I'm in it.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.944
I really respect what you do.

00:21:11.944 --> 00:21:13.860
That was the one thing
that my editor actually

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.920
encouraged me to do.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.700
So everything else was
basically researched and planned

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.070
of what I was doing or I had
already done the research,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.680
and my editor was
like, you know, the gap

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.780
that you have in this is Wicca.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.660
And I was like, why?

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.979
Like I had this really
childlike preconception

00:21:30.979 --> 00:21:32.520
of what it would
mean to be a Wiccan.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.020
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
Black pointy hats?

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.440
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah,
black pointy hats.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.064
You know, my kid
watches Disney movies.

00:21:36.064 --> 00:21:39.210
Like that's what I was
picturing, which is so--

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.162
you know, it's such
an unconscious bias.

00:21:41.162 --> 00:21:43.620
I didn't even realize that I
had this bias against witches.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.150
But I was like, I
don't want to do that.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:45.870
It's kind of scary.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.190
Like, I don't want to do that.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.054
And then she kind of
kept encouraging me.

00:21:49.054 --> 00:21:50.970
She was like, I feel
like that's the one thing

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.992
that people do when
they first step out

00:21:52.992 --> 00:21:55.450
of traditional religion, that
a lot of people explore that.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.220
And I was like, all right, fine.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.504
So I started researching it.

00:21:57.504 --> 00:21:58.920
And as I researched
more and more,

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.878
I was like, this is
actually super interesting,

00:22:00.878 --> 00:22:04.500
because there's no
like rulebook, right?

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.360
Like it really is a
choose what you want--

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.050
CRISTIN FRODELLA: A la carte.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.633
ANJALI KUMAR:
--religion and practice.

00:22:08.633 --> 00:22:10.980
Yeah, in a way that I
think so much of us who

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.190
don't ascribe to a specific
religion or religious tradition

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.967
but still want to find
something in some meaning

00:22:16.967 --> 00:22:19.050
would actually be like,
oh yeah, that makes sense.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.987
Like I believe in eating
seasonally or whatever.

00:22:21.987 --> 00:22:23.320
You know, like I respect nature.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.126
Like I do a lot of the things
that are core principles.

00:22:27.126 --> 00:22:28.500
I believe in being
good to people

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.810
and hoping that that comes back
to me and that kind of thing.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.660
And so I went to a potluck.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.450
It was a Thanksgiving
potluck for--

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.780
but not related to
American Thanksgiving.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.430
It was, I guess,
Wicca Thanksgiving.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.480
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
Is there a Wicca--

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.410
when is Wicca Thanksgiving?

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.826
ANJALI KUMAR: It was right
around my daughter's homecoming

00:22:45.826 --> 00:22:47.610
time, so like it was
probably, I think,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.170
October, September, October.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.000
I think it's done by
the lunar calendar.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.580
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Oh, yeah.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.080
It must be harvest.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.871
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.700
It's like harvest, exactly.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.350
And it was at the LGBT
Center in Manhattan,

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.580
and it was really wonderful.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.320
Like after I got over the sort
of initial awkwardness of just

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.145
dining with strangers, it was
such a wonderful, warm group

00:23:09.145 --> 00:23:09.645
of people.

00:23:09.645 --> 00:23:11.220
And it was really
just people, again,

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.500
searching like the
rest of us, just trying

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.720
to find a community,
trying to find connection.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.340
A lot of people
were new to the city

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.940
and they were just
looking for somebody else

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.400
to have that kind
of moment with,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.050
and it was a really
lovely dinner.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.780
And these witches could cook.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.680
It was good food.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.480
My contributions
were lackluster,

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.640
but theirs were quite delicious.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.905
It was a really special evening.

00:23:34.905 --> 00:23:38.690
CRISTIN FRODELLA: So was there
any time during this, I guess,

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.560
journey where your
curiosity was really

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.360
piqued about a
particular religion,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.340
where you were saying
like, maybe I'll

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.956
actually go in that direction?

00:23:47.956 --> 00:23:49.580
ANJALI KUMAR: You
know, I didn't really

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.650
do traditional religious stuff.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.117
So I mean, Wicca was probably
the most traditional religion

00:23:54.117 --> 00:23:54.825
that I explored--

00:23:54.825 --> 00:23:55.480
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
Spiritualities.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.270
ANJALI KUMAR: --which
kind of gives you an idea.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.769
Yeah.

00:23:56.769 --> 00:24:00.570
So the meditation was
really powerful for me.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.440
I think that's something
that I had started doing when

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.060
I worked at Google, in fact.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.110
CRISTIN FRODELLA: The
TM or the vipassana?

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.470
ANJALI KUMAR: The
TM, the TM part.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.164
And that's a practice
that's really stuck with me

00:24:12.164 --> 00:24:14.330
and that's become almost
like mental hygiene for me,

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.130
like a daily flossing.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.551
Like I just do it
because it feels good.

00:24:18.551 --> 00:24:20.300
And it's not like your
teeth will fall out

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.640
if you don't floss one day, but
you kind of feel icky all day.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.710
It's like that's what I
feel like about meditation.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.140
It's like, if I don't meditate--

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.750
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Do you do 10
minutes in the morning and 10

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.170
minutes at night?

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.580
ANJALI KUMAR: I do 20
minutes in the morning.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.705
I used to be able to do 20
minutes in the afternoon

00:24:30.705 --> 00:24:32.660
when I worked here
because they had

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.100
things like the mother's room.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.220
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
Because Google.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.928
ANJALI KUMAR: And
because Google, I know.

00:24:35.928 --> 00:24:37.490
But then don't
leave Google ever.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.260
You can never do
that kind of stuff

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.790
when you leave this place.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.460
There is no meditation
room at other start-ups,

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.277
like they don't have the space.

00:24:45.277 --> 00:24:47.610
So that practice fell by the
wayside when I left Google.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.940
But when I was here,
it was something

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:55.620
that I did twice a day and
was pretty committed to it.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.140
So that's a practice
that's really stuck for me.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.250
And in terms of the
other things, not really.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.186
Like none of them are
things that I've been like,

00:25:04.186 --> 00:25:06.060
oh, I want to go back
to that again and again

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.860
and I think this is my thing.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.870
But I think I've gotten
to be OK with that.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.320
I sort of got to the end
of the journey, at least

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.260
for the narrative of
this story, and got

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.557
comfortable with just sort
of stopping for a minute.

00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:18.890
CRISTIN FRODELLA: When was that?

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:19.430
What happened?

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.000
What was the turning point?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.833
ANJALI KUMAR: You know,
I did the vipassana.

00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:23.930
I went on the silent
meditation retreat,

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.030
and I think just being
still for that long

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.690
and shutting up for a while
was really good for me,

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.264
and it got me out of my
head and it got me out

00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:34.430
of this sort of frantic
search, and just being like,

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:38.030
you know, you probably know the
answers to a lot of the things,

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.630
at least what's true for
you, if you just quiet

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.450
down a little bit and
stop for a minute,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.370
and so that's what
I ultimately did.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.380
I sort of stopped
the frantic search.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.880
It felt like a
nice, natural ending

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.640
to the story for
this particular book.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:58.100
And I don't have that same kind
of urgency around answering

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.412
these questions, but
I still-- you know,

00:26:01.412 --> 00:26:03.870
people ask me to do stuff all
the time, and I'm like, yeah.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.280
Let's go do that.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.790
I think the curiosity
and the search of it

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.372
is still fun for me so
I, every so often, will

00:26:11.372 --> 00:26:12.330
go do like [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:12.402
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Yeah.

00:26:12.402 --> 00:26:15.027
I'm pretty sure if you asked any
of the people in this audience

00:26:15.027 --> 00:26:18.480
if they wanted to come with you,
including me, yes, they would.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.720
So I have to ask,
what about Zia?

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.520
Like what was the
end result for her?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.070
She must have seen
you doing this.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.403
She knew you published the book.

00:26:26.403 --> 00:26:27.879
Like how did this
impact her life?

00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:28.670
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.560
So she was really little when I
was doing most of the research,

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.700
and so I think she just
thinks I'm sort of kooky

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.447
and like always
off doing things.

00:26:36.447 --> 00:26:39.030
It was concerning when she would
tell her teachers about where

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.830
I was, because you can imagine
in a Manhattan private school,

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.980
they're like, oh, we heard you
weren't talking for a few days,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.109
and is everything OK?

00:26:47.109 --> 00:26:47.900
And I was like, no.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.770
I was at a retreat.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.590
You know, like her kindergarten
teachers were super concerned

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.040
when I came back from
that silent retreat

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.570
because they were just
given a bit of information.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.710
But I think what's been
the most interesting thing,

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.950
for the questions, she
does ask me questions

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.774
that are themed to
the book, and we just

00:27:05.774 --> 00:27:06.940
have conversations about it.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.410
I'm like, what do you
think the answer is?

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:09.800
Like, I don't know what
happens when you die.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.650
What do you think?

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.920
And she actually weirdly
has a very easy relationship

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.940
with the idea of death.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.190
Like that's something
that, since she was little,

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.540
I had told her--

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.640
actually when Dan
Fredinburg died,

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.645
I had told her that
when people die,

00:27:23.645 --> 00:27:25.280
that they become
stars in the sky.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.696
My husband and I
had told her this

00:27:26.696 --> 00:27:29.090
because she had come across
a picture of his mother

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.094
who had passed away
when he was quite young.

00:27:31.094 --> 00:27:32.510
And I don't know
why we said that,

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.070
but that's what we
kind of turned to.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.030
We were like, yeah,
they become stars.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.260
She was like three.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.822
And so when Dan passed away
and she heard me on the phone

00:27:39.822 --> 00:27:41.530
talking to somebody
and getting the news,

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:42.696
she was like, what happened?

00:27:42.696 --> 00:27:46.850
And I said, well a good
friend of our friends

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.920
died in an earthquake.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.999
And she sort of pauses,
and she's like, oh.

00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:52.540
You mean he became
a star in the sky?

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.500
And I was like, oh.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.820
Yeah.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.670
I think he did.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.340
You know, it was just a really--

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.389
like maybe I'm not
screwing this up so badly.

00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:02.930
But it was a really
beautiful moment.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.080
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Yeah.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.300
You also described to me
another beautiful moment

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.880
about the librarian in
your daughter's school

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.909
and I wondered if you
would tell all these--

00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:13.700
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.684
It's not really related
to the spirituality piece,

00:28:16.684 --> 00:28:19.100
but I think just the idea of
all these conversations we're

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.870
having in a place like Google
or just across corporate America

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:27.560
or Hollywood or anywhere around
diversity and inclusiveness.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.360
And one of the things
I did not expect

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.780
was how much having that book
on a shelf would mean to me.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.230
And so the story we were talking
about, when my book came out,

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:42.700
soon after, my daughter's
school librarian sent me a text.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.200
She sent me a picture of the
book in the school library,

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.830
and she was like, we just
got a copy of your book in.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.260
The next time you're in,
could you sign it for us?

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.760
And I just started crying.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.140
And I was so
surprised, like this

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.370
is the most impactful thing.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.780
Like I had done a TED
Talk, and I was like,

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.520
this is the moment
where I was like,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.910
I can't believe that my little
kid will walk into a school

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:04.990
library, to her school library,
and see a story that literally

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.450
reflects her, reflects her
story in some way back to her.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.530
I get like a little choked
up thinking about it.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.440
And it meant so much to
me because growing up

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.650
in this country in the
time that I grew up,

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.320
I did not have that
expectation, and I didn't even

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.400
know it was an option.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.400
Like I didn't know I was
being cut out of a narrative

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.166
or that my narrative didn't
exist on the library shelves

00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:28.540
or in Hollywood
or anything else.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.215
It was just like, oh,
I'm a recent immigrant

00:29:30.215 --> 00:29:32.110
to this country, why
would my story be told?

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.460
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Nobody
would tell your story.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.300
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah,
like, you know, I

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.450
had to watch Bollywood films.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.658
And that's definitely not
my narrative, but you know,

00:29:36.658 --> 00:29:39.730
that's what I would watch to
see somebody who looked like me

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.630
and definitely can dance
like me on the screen.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.860
But it wasn't something
I had an expectation of.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.540
And to know that
she and her friends

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.131
would have that experience
was so, so moving

00:29:50.131 --> 00:29:52.380
and meaningful to me in a
way that I wasn't expecting.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.338
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Yeah.

00:29:53.338 --> 00:29:54.940
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.190
CRISTIN FRODELLA: So what now?

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:57.274
So what are you doing now?

00:29:57.274 --> 00:29:59.398
ANJALI KUMAR: Oh gosh, the
million dollar question.

00:29:59.398 --> 00:30:00.900
I'm trying to come
back to Google.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.000
I've decided that I can just
hide out in the hallways

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.416
and none of you
would even notice.

00:30:04.416 --> 00:30:06.230
Like I could just
stay here forever.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.670
No, I'm kidding.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.710
The book came out a bit
ago, a few months ago,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.610
and so there's been some
great, exciting interest

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.880
around turning it into
television in some way, which

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.840
it would be--

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.242
I mean, talk about like
seeing yourself onscreen.

00:30:21.242 --> 00:30:23.700
Not that I would be in it, but
that other people would be--

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.270
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
Who would play you?

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.372
ANJALI KUMAR: Ooh.

00:30:25.372 --> 00:30:27.580
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Who do
you think would play you?

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.746
ANJALI KUMAR: Julia Roberts.

00:30:29.746 --> 00:30:32.290
No, I'm totally kidding.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.660
I don't know.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.880
I like the idea
of Archie Panjabi.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.250
Do you guys remember her
from "Bend It Like Beckham?"

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.375
She played by the sister
in "Bend It Like Beckham."

00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:44.820
She's super funny and she
was like quick and funny.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.530
I really liked her.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.600
So yeah, maybe her.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.514
And then I told my husband
that Dev Patel should play him.

00:30:53.514 --> 00:30:54.180
I'm just saying.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.440
And he started getting
annoyed with me,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.330
because I kept saying like,
did you see him in "GQ?"

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.413
Like he's suddenly called
the Slumdog Millionaire.

00:30:59.413 --> 00:31:00.670
Like this guy got super cute.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.500
He should play you.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.916
And he's like,
you've got to stop.

00:31:02.916 --> 00:31:04.192
So yeah.

00:31:04.192 --> 00:31:05.650
It was only funny
to me apparently.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:07.470
CRISTIN FRODELLA: I hit
on him in a gym once.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.950
ANJALI KUMAR: You did?

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:08.202
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Yeah.

00:31:08.202 --> 00:31:08.935
It was great.

00:31:08.935 --> 00:31:12.756
ANJALI KUMAR: We'll talk
about that in the after show.

00:31:12.756 --> 00:31:13.430
That's amazing.

00:31:15.544 --> 00:31:17.460
Yeah, so there's some
talk of that which would

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.640
be really, really exciting.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.889
I'm thinking about if I
would write another book.

00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:22.430
I don't know.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.740
I'm doing some writing,
like sort of my first time

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.060
doing different things.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.005
I was just a clown in
the Macy's Day Parade.

00:31:29.005 --> 00:31:29.850
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Oh, you were?

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.110
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah, super fun.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.609
There's definitely
an article there.

00:31:32.609 --> 00:31:35.640
I highly recommend all of
you to do that if you ever

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.540
have the opportunity.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.123
You can volunteer to be a clown
in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day

00:31:39.123 --> 00:31:39.720
Parade.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.130
Didn't know that was a thing.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.390
Super fun, totally crazy.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:47.100
So there's things like
that and I'm exploring.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.730
And then I don't know.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.020
We'll see.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:50.520
I'm excited.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:50.990
Stay tuned.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:52.156
CRISTIN FRODELLA: All right.

00:31:52.156 --> 00:31:52.830
Cool, cool.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.390
Well, before we open
it up to questions,

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.920
I guess I would say,
what advice do you have

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.280
for fellow seekers like me?

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.220
ANJALI KUMAR: I definitely
don't have answers,

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.350
and I really do think
it is about ultimately

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.670
getting still and knowing that
you have them inside of you.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.130
Like that whoever is
telling you that they know,

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.070
they know for them but they
don't necessarily know for you.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.380
That's my gut.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.991
CRISTIN FRODELLA:
That's good advice.

00:32:22.991 --> 00:32:23.490
All right.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:23.970
Thank you.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.690
ANJALI KUMAR: Thank you.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.060
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Will
take some questions

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.560
from folks in the audience?

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.643
ANJALI KUMAR: Yes, please.

00:32:27.643 --> 00:32:29.600
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Anybody
have any questions?

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.850
ANJALI KUMAR: Not all at once.

00:32:37.113 --> 00:32:37.654
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:37.654 --> 00:32:38.140
ANJALI KUMAR: Hi.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:38.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:39.296
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:39.296 --> 00:32:40.380
Thank you so much.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.156
I think it's really interesting,
what you spoke about.

00:32:44.156 --> 00:32:45.530
I definitely would
read the book.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:49.460
But what I'm finding
it difficult to

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.430
is tying all this together.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.520
And if you had to
say something, like

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.050
what should a reader
take away from this book?

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.970
Like is there a
underlying thing.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.770
Like, hey, I did this,
this, this, this,

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.140
and this is what
I would conclude

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.162
or this is what I would say.

00:33:08.162 --> 00:33:09.620
I'm just trying to
figure that out.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.494
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:33:10.494 --> 00:33:11.660
Thank you for your question.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.350
I think the conclusion is really
a bit of a non-conclusion.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.440
It was sort of like, this
is an ongoing journey.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.330
This is something that--
it was very naive of me

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.121
to think that I can
answer within the pages

00:33:22.121 --> 00:33:24.057
of a 250-page book.

00:33:24.057 --> 00:33:25.640
Because if that was
possible, somebody

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.590
would have done it already.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.860
And it was really that
I'll be searching probably

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.150
for the rest of my life
and that I'm OK with that.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.470
And then the story that I
told earlier about John of God

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.390
and about the letters
that I had received,

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.460
that, for me, was
really a conclusion too.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.550
It was just that we're all
seeking the same things.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.710
And so the health, happiness,
and love part of that

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:51.410
gave me a lot of
comfort that ultimately,

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.201
everyone that I know really
wants the same things.

00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:56.450
And if I can focus on that
and on the things that bind

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.090
us together as opposed to the
things that drive us apart,

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:03.020
especially in times like this,
that I might be on the path

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.430
to something.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360
ANJALI KUMAR: Thank you.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.370
AUDIENCE: Hey, Anjali.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.150
Thanks for coming.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.149
ANJALI KUMAR: Hi, Erica.

00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:10.474
Thanks for being here.

00:34:10.474 --> 00:34:15.320
AUDIENCE: So the tech industry
is facing some really massive

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.570
questions around responsibility,
accountability in analog parts

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.739
of society and the way we've--

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.190
yeah, in so many ways, right?

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.283
Sundar was in
Congress yesterday.

00:34:27.283 --> 00:34:29.449
You also mentioned it was
interesting thinking about

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:30.980
how, when you
started this journey,

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.679
you were a little bit
quiet about it at Google.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.736
And so the third part
of this is Jack Dorsey

00:34:36.736 --> 00:34:38.360
posted this tweet
storm a few days ago.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.370
He did a 10-day silent
meditation retreat in Myanmar.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.590
What do you think the
space is or the role

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.800
is for spirituality in tech?

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.650
Why is it not talked about?

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.940
And at the executive
level, do you

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.120
think it's an important
character trait for a leader?

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.295
ANJALI KUMAR: That's such
a great question, which

00:34:58.295 --> 00:34:59.670
I know is not the
response you're

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.545
supposed to give to a
question, but it really

00:35:01.545 --> 00:35:02.900
is a great question.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.682
Why is it not talked about?

00:35:04.682 --> 00:35:06.140
Do you guys watch
"Silicon Valley?"

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.740
I mean, I suppose you
live "Silicon Valley"

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.990
so you don't need to watch it.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.630
So I had missed seasons
of it, and there's

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.862
like season 5 or something
on United Flights,

00:35:14.862 --> 00:35:17.320
and I was watching like one
episode, which you can catch up

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.986
on pretty quickly, but like, you
can figure out what's going on.

00:35:19.986 --> 00:35:23.000
And it was an episode about
one of the developers who

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.150
was going to come onto the
plot for the new internet

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.860
where they find out
that he's Christian.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.110
So it's like he's going to
start a gay dating website,

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.010
and it's like, that's cool.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.551
That's great.

00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:32.510
[INAUDIBLE] knew that.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.230
And then it's like, wait.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.855
He's Christian?

00:35:33.855 --> 00:35:35.330
They're like,
don't tell anybody.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.591
And it becomes this big thing.

00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:38.090
And I thought it
was so fascinating.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.350
So like, that's what
it's like, right?

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.640
It's like the last taboo.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.710
We talk about everything now.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.120
Nothing's off the table.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.911
But for some reason,
the thing that arguably

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:48.410
is one of the most
important things,

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:51.410
like what do you believe about
the things that really matter,

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.390
that really drive
your every day,

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.010
and we can't have
those conversations.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.030
And I don't know why that is.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.300
I was embarrassed to talk
about it because I really

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.120
thought everyone would
think I was nuts,

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.120
and I'm sure people did.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.397
I remember a conversation at one
of the Women at Google events.

00:36:05.397 --> 00:36:06.980
I had just come back
from Brazil and I

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.664
was talking to a very senior
salesperson at Google.

00:36:09.664 --> 00:36:12.080
And I was telling her, and you
could see her backing away.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.474
She was kind of like, all
right, like this woman's crazy.

00:36:15.474 --> 00:36:17.390
And it was just such an
interesting experience

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.490
because I'm not this like
deeply religious person.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:20.989
But the fact that
I even have to say

00:36:20.989 --> 00:36:23.600
that by way of contextualizing,
like don't worry,

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.360
I'm not religious,
like I'm just a seeker

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.870
and I'm doing a lot
of this for fun,

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.245
and I have to make people
comfortable with that, I think,

00:36:30.245 --> 00:36:31.320
is really interesting.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.400
But the thing that I've
also found interesting

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.830
is that since I've written
this book, people come up to me

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.930
and they spill forth
their religious views

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.330
or their spiritual views or
their religious upbringings

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:42.730
like a confessional to me now.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.170
So I know all kinds
of stuff about people.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.550
People in tech, not in tech,
like all over the planet.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.600
And that's been really
interesting to me.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.920
So to me, there seems
to be a clear desire

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.050
to talk about these things
because people really

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.700
do want to get to the
stuff that matters.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.230
And I think until we all start
talking about this stuff,

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.690
nothing's going to change.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:08.090
So is it important for
our senior leadership

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.099
in a place like Google
to talk about that stuff?

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:10.640
I don't know.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.490
I don't want to impose on
Sundar that he should be telling

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.410
everybody if he's Hindu
and if he's practicing

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.535
and if he goes to temple
and if he believes in God.

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:19.380
Like it maybe doesn't matter.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.590
But I think if that is
something that drives him

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.270
and it's a belief
system that informs

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.161
how he leads his company,
I think that's interesting.

00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:28.160
I would want to know that
just out of curiosity.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.260
I think it'd be interesting.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.150
Thank you.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.250
AUDIENCE: Hi, Anjali.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.310
Thank you for coming.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.170
So I, myself, am a
vipassana meditater

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:39.430
and I did the 10-day
course and everything.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:41.110
But I'm new to
New York, and I've

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:43.330
found it to be extremely
difficult in New York

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:47.320
to find like 20 minutes
just to like calm down.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.940
So do you have any advice or
tips on how to meditate daily?

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:50.731
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:53.050
You need to get access to
the mother's room at Google,

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.190
and then go in there.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.050
I'm sort of kidding,
but it's sort of true.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.340
CRISTIN FRODELLA: We actually
have focus rooms now.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.020
ANJALI KUMAR: You
have focus rooms?

00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.250
Ooh.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:37:59.740
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Yes.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.530
We have focus rooms where you're
not supposed to do anything

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.330
except for sit and think.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.860
ANJALI KUMAR: Wow.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.330
I really want to come back.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.290
Don't ever leave.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.060
That is the secret.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.720
Joking aside, I think it's
being really intentional

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.640
about carving out the time
and doing it no matter what.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.570
And I think if you start--
when I did that first TM class,

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.055
I remember they said you
had to do it for two months,

00:38:22.055 --> 00:38:23.680
I think, where they're
like, try to not

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.630
break the habit or the
streak for two months,

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.730
and then it just
became a thing I did.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.590
Where now, I'm not
a morning person,

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.600
and I will wake
up early to do it.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.185
So if you can, I would start
by just waking up early,

00:38:35.185 --> 00:38:37.060
like if it's 20 minutes,
10 minutes, whatever

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.440
your practice is.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.200
And then if you're trying to
find space during the day,

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.362
if you can block off a
meeting, I would do that.

00:38:44.362 --> 00:38:45.820
And I think in a
place like Google,

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.140
people respect it actually.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.280
It's not necessarily
true of other workplaces.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.410
I can tell you that,
because they'll be like,

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.570
we've got a meeting.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.530
This is the only other
time everyone can meet

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:54.730
and they just schedule over it.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.980
But I feel like here, you could
actually carve that space.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.382
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Have you
done "Search Inside Yourself?

00:38:59.382 --> 00:39:00.507
AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:00.507 --> 00:39:02.590
CRISTIN FRODELLA: So there
is a course here called

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.048
"Search Inside Yourself," which
is essentially a meditation

00:39:05.048 --> 00:39:11.910
course started by an ex-Googler
who's an incredible guy, Meng.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.230
Anyway, so "Search Inside
Yourself" is a course here.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.720
And at the end of it, you get
paired up with a fellow SIY

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:24.340
alumni, and the goal is
essentially you have meetings

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.920
together so that you can carve
out the time to meditate.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.940
And if you write to that list,
which is SIY dash alumni--

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.270
I don't know actually if
you'll be able to access it,

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:36.100
but there are tons
of people who I'm

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.470
sure would love to
set up time with you.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:39.384
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:39:39.384 --> 00:39:42.583
Thank you.

00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:43.500
Hi.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.390
So I feel like
maybe the questions

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.764
that you started with in this
book and the questions that

00:39:47.764 --> 00:39:50.430
kind of started this talk
are generally like universal

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.950
among people, and I think
that everyone kind of wonders

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.967
about a lot of these things.

00:39:54.967 --> 00:39:56.550
Thinking about like
myself personally,

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:01.020
I think my instincts, or like
whatever my first movement here

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.322
would be to think
about exploring

00:40:03.322 --> 00:40:05.780
the more major religions and
the more mainstream religions.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.780
And I think that a lot
of the stuff you explored

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.570
would kind of be a
secondary thought.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.910
Can you talk a little bit
more about your decision

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.956
to kind of go that route instead
of the more mainstream religion

00:40:14.956 --> 00:40:15.455
route?

00:40:15.455 --> 00:40:16.246
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:40:16.246 --> 00:40:19.470
It was really because
I'm not a theologian

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.340
and I didn't feel
drawn to any of them,

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:25.674
so I didn't feel like I
could do an adequate job

00:40:25.674 --> 00:40:27.840
of like exploring Christianity
and then a little bit

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.990
of Judaism and then Islam.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.290
It's like, how do you do
that in a meaningful way

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:33.420
with a full-time
job with a new kid?

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.520
And I didn't feel
drawn to any of them,

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.650
because I don't think this
project was necessarily

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.170
a rejection of the
religion I was raised with.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.329
If you asked me now,
what religion are you?

00:40:42.329 --> 00:40:43.620
I'd probably still answer Jain.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.500
I'm Jainish.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.470
Like people are
Jewish, I'm Jainish.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.360
You know, that's
still directionally

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.870
what I feel makes sense for me
because it's so cultural to me.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:56.670
So I think because I tied
religion and culture so much

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.510
together, it would be like
searching for a new culture,

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:02.580
and that wasn't
really the project.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.580
But a lot of people have
asked me that question.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.440
Yeah, it wasn't something that
felt like the right direction.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.784
And so I went in this
kind of other direction.

00:41:11.784 --> 00:41:13.200
But everything
that I searched for

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.910
and all the
experiences that I did

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.954
were very much authentically
what I felt curious about.

00:41:17.954 --> 00:41:20.370
And so it wasn't like, oh,
what will make a funny chapter.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:20.850
It was like, no.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.440
I kind of want to
go to Burning Man

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.315
and I think I want to
do a silent meditation.

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:27.321
Like it was things that
I actually wanted to try.

00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:29.030
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a follow-up question?

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.764
ANJALI KUMAR: Please, yeah.

00:41:30.764 --> 00:41:32.430
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit more

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.290
about the title of
the book, because I

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.190
feel like this may be--

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.580
like, God is something
that I associate maybe more

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:43.265
with mainstream religions than
with other spiritual practices,

00:41:43.265 --> 00:41:45.390
and I'd be interested to
hear kind of your thoughts

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.310
about the connection
between those and God.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.510
ANJALI KUMAR: Sure.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.370
So the original
title of the book

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:54.205
that I sold the proposal on was
actually "From Google to God."

00:41:54.205 --> 00:41:56.580
And I loved it and I thought
it was really a funny title,

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.084
and then my editor, halfway
through my writing process,

00:41:59.084 --> 00:42:00.750
was like, you've got
to change the title

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.180
because it sounds like you
left Google to become a priest.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.140
And I was like, aw.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.720
That's true and that's not
what happens in this book.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.830
But the idea of it
just being a search,

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.020
I wanted some reference
to the tech kind

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.470
of piece of it and the fact that
tech played such a large part

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:20.980
certainly in my personal journey
in just of life and my career,

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.210
but then also in how I was
accessing a lot of these things

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.750
because so much of it started
with an internet search.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.760
You know, that was
part of the narrative.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.350
The stalking
reference, you know,

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:34.389
it's a bit of a provocative
sort of word to use.

00:42:34.389 --> 00:42:36.180
But it's certainly like
a Facebook stalking

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.730
kind of reference of like--
but again, tongue in cheek.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.790
So there was a lot of
thought put into the title,

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.370
and I think it can be
confusing to people.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.110
There's definitely
Amazon reviewers

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.970
who do not like my
book because they're

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:51.311
like, that's not the answer
and Christianity is the answer,

00:42:51.311 --> 00:42:51.810
whatever.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:54.960
There's a couple of very
angry people on Amazon.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.650
And I was like, well, then
it's not for you and I get it.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:01.957
But it was meant to be a
bit tongue in cheek too.

00:43:01.957 --> 00:43:02.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:03.665
ANJALI KUMAR: Thanks.

00:43:05.946 --> 00:43:08.980
AUDIENCE: My first question
was the same as his actually.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.820
My next question is, was
anybody actually healed,

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.597
like that you took to
the Brazilian healer guy,

00:43:15.597 --> 00:43:17.055
like the people's
photos and stuff?

00:43:17.055 --> 00:43:17.860
ANJALI KUMAR: Oh, the follow-up.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.760
AUDIENCE: Like did
anybody ever actually--

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.460
ANJALI KUMAR: Of the photos--

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.200
so I don't think
anyone I brought

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.510
photos of was struggling
with a real medical condition

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:30.310
of the batch that I had.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:33.400
But that said, in follow-ups--

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.220
so John of God also makes a
trip to like Omega Institute

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.700
in upstate New York.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:42.355
And so I had gone last year
before my book came out.

00:43:42.355 --> 00:43:44.980
I drove up there because he was
coming, and I was kind of like,

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.310
I feel like I should show a
picture of my book cover to him

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.800
and have him scan
that and heal it.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.692
I thought it'd be kind of like
a nice tying up for myself.

00:43:52.692 --> 00:43:55.150
I don't know if he did it, but
I left a picture of the book

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:58.510
cover in his basket,
and I did bring

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:01.540
a photograph of a friend who
was just diagnosed with breast

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:06.097
cancer, and she is cancer free.

00:44:06.097 --> 00:44:07.180
I don't think that did it.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.880
I mean, she also had
medical treatment.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.620
But I don't know.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:15.240
If it gives somebody a little
bit of hope, I think that's OK.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:15.920
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.420
Thank you.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.040
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.450
AUDIENCE: Hi, Anjali.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.720
Thank you for coming.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.140
I really enjoyed that,
especially because last night,

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.360
I had like my monthly
existential crisis

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.880
reflecting on like
these sorts of ideas.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.835
And one of the thoughts
that came was--

00:44:33.835 --> 00:44:36.460
and this is actually a follow-up
from a podcast I was listening

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.640
to earlier this week--

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.600
was that this sort of
rationalist mindset, the very

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.620
scientific driven
mindset is fairly modern.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.740
Like it's a byproduct of the
post-industrial revolution

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:48.910
movements.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:53.710
And it's sort of like when
you have that mindset where

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:57.070
you want to critically analyze,
OK, why is this happening,

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.040
I found that, even
doing meditation,

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.620
my first thought
after is like, OK.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.640
I felt something, but
like why did I feel that?

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.100
It has to be some like
neurological process

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:06.940
that's causing this.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.436
Clearly, there has to be a
rational explanation for that.

00:45:09.436 --> 00:45:10.810
So when you're
doing all of these

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:14.140
like very unorthodox
things, did you

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:18.010
find that you needed to suspend
that sort of mindset of like,

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:18.910
OK.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.590
There has to be a
clearly rational way

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:22.060
to explain why
this is happening.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.150
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah, 100%.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:27.760
So when you read my
book, the narrative

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.330
really plays out that way.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.080
There's like this a
very lawyerly part

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:36.100
of me that does the research
and will talk about oxytocin

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.522
release during a hug and
like what that might mean,

00:45:38.522 --> 00:45:40.480
and that's why hugging
Amma could be effective,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.470
because of that.

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:42.850
But then the other side
is kind of like, well

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:43.690
what's the feeling?

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.010
Like she smelled really nice.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.290
Like it was a little sweaty, a
little uncomfortable, but like

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:48.070
it was also nice.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:50.680
And that juxtaposition,
I mean, it was constant.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.250
Like there was a constant
dialogue in my head.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:57.640
It continues to be just the way
I work and navigate the world,

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.740
but that was very,
very hard for me

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.840
and I would keep
flipping back and forth.

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.330
And I do address it
a lot in the book

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.735
because I think so many of us
are in the same position where

00:46:07.735 --> 00:46:10.060
it's like we're raised to
think a very specific way,

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.890
and we're educated
and overeducated

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.540
and sort of repeating
things again

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.339
and again to become
experts at something.

00:46:16.339 --> 00:46:18.130
And then here's this
whole set of questions

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.650
that are truly not Googleable.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:21.790
You will not find a
satisfactory answer.

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.580
You will find people purporting
to know the answers on Google

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.140
to all these questions.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.240
I would challenge
that maybe there are

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.500
incorrect answers on Google.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.630
You need to tweak the algorithm
on these particular things,

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.650
but there are just things
that are unknowable.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:37.260
And so if you start--

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.160
I don't know how you
reconcile those things,

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.540
but I kind of flip
back and forth too.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.890
But then ultimately,
it was like,

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:43.348
I've just got to
suspend disbelief.

00:46:43.348 --> 00:46:47.260
Like I can't try to
explain these things,

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.850
otherwise, I'll just
be stuck in a loop.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.680
AUDIENCE: Just as
a small follow-up,

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.680
when you were actually
having these experiences,

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.760
did you just like push aside any
of the thoughts that are like,

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.042
OK, why is this happening?

00:46:58.042 --> 00:46:58.750
ANJALI KUMAR: No.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.430
I think I did it
really unsuccessfully.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.060
There were moments that I would,
like the tantric sound healing

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.060
being a perfect example.

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.850
There are moments where I
was like, this is so weird.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:07.410
And like my head
was like, oh my god.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.260
I cannot believe--

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.400
I should not be doing this.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.000
My parents, like what
would they think?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.510
Like they're going
to hear about this.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.130
I'm going to write.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.530
I can't write about-- like
I was going on and on.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:15.520
I was like, this is bananas.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.180
I am married.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.070
Like what am I doing?

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.090
You know, it was just like
a loop, a loop, a loop.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:20.330
And then there are moments
where I was kind of like,

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.250
all right, just like relax.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.140
Just breathe into it,
and I was like, oh.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.720
It's kind of nice.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.660
Like this is bizarre,
but also kind

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.560
of not altogether unpleasant.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.894
And then I'd be like, oh my god.

00:47:31.894 --> 00:47:33.851
I can't believe this man
is lying on top of me.

00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:34.770
This is very awkward.

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:36.880
And so it would just be
like a constant thing.

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.160
And that, for me, is
also my meditation cycle,

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.474
is like the monkey mind of the
loop of like, what's going on?

00:47:42.474 --> 00:47:43.390
I have to make dinner.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:44.170
I have to go do this thing.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:45.340
I forgot to pick up
the dry cleaning.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:45.730
Blah, blah, blah.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:46.260
And then I'm like, oh.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:46.890
I'm suppose to be meditating.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.100
I'm like, mantra,
mantra, mantra, mantra.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:48.890
I'm like ah.

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:50.510
And I'm like, crap,
so I fall asleep.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.270
And I just keep going
and it's like constant.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.146
And I feel like that's
the very human journey.

00:47:56.146 --> 00:47:57.520
I don't live in
the woods, right?

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.890
Like I don't live on
a meditation farm.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.000
I live in New York City.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:01.900
I live downtown.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:02.800
I take the subway.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.550
I walk everywhere.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.680
Like it is hectic and I think
that's just part of our life,

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.814
but if you can push that reset
button every day in some way.

00:48:09.814 --> 00:48:12.230
And the fact that you're just
asking the questions I think

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.649
is great.

00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:14.690
AUDIENCE: Well thank you.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:15.752
Appreciate it.

00:48:15.752 --> 00:48:17.500
ANJALI KUMAR: Going
back this way.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:19.290
Nice to see you.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:21.380
Thank you for coming in.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:22.850
How did you know--

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:24.350
it sounds like
you got to a point

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:27.830
where you felt at peace,
that you had searched enough.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.904
You didn't find specific answers
and you were OK with that.

00:48:30.904 --> 00:48:31.820
Can you describe that?

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.153
Because when you're just
talking about the constant loop

00:48:34.153 --> 00:48:36.530
and it's really hard
to break that cycle,

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:39.060
how did you feel
fulfilled on this journey

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.880
and what was that
moment like for you?

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.930
ANJALI KUMAR:
There were a couple

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:43.040
of things that drove that.

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.470
I think one was definitely
the silent meditation

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:48.050
experience of just being
still for that long.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.400
I didn't do a full 10 days.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.440
I tell that story
of why in the book,

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.410
but I did a five-day retreat.

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:58.300
And by the end, I was like, I
think I'm good for a minute.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.156
Like I feel like just
stopping and I just

00:49:00.156 --> 00:49:02.030
need to sit with what
I've already researched

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:05.870
and sort of be in that, and
feel like I have enough data

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:09.920
to inform something
that felt right.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.712
And then also, truthfully,
it was partially

00:49:11.712 --> 00:49:12.794
because I was on deadline.

00:49:12.794 --> 00:49:14.240
I was like, I can't
keep searching

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.910
and I've got to
turn this book in,

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:20.510
and I have to be OK with
not having a conclusion

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:23.520
because I'm not going to in
time for this book to come out.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.400
And so either I can
spend the rest of my life

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.210
writing this book and it'll
be written and published

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:32.630
posthumously, or I can
try to wrap this up and be

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.790
OK with the knowledge
that I will never know

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:36.200
the answer to these questions.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.450
And that's where
I chose to land.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:39.220
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:39.720
Thank you.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.440
One more question.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.300
It sounds like the
impetus of this search

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.470
was more about your
daughter and the questions

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.410
she might have as
she grows older.

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.297
When did you decide,
hey, this is a book,

00:49:51.297 --> 00:49:53.630
and I should probably put
this out there for more people

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:54.650
to absorb?

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:55.430
ANJALI KUMAR: Ooh.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:56.440
That's a good question.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.615
There was a moment where
it was going to be a film,

00:49:58.615 --> 00:50:00.740
and then I realized I did
not want to be in a film,

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.592
and so that was pushed aside.

00:50:04.592 --> 00:50:06.050
But I felt like
there was something

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.570
I wanted to do with it because
it was fun and anyone I would

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:11.930
tell the stories to would be
like, you have to write this

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:12.430
down.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:14.055
These are such funny
stories or they're

00:50:14.055 --> 00:50:17.450
really interesting or whatever,
depending on what story it was.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:20.390
So I started taking better
notes as I would do things.

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:23.270
And then I met an
agent a few years ago,

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:25.020
and he was like, you've
got to write this.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.222
Like, this is a book
I know I can sell it.

00:50:27.222 --> 00:50:28.680
And that's what
ended up happening.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.950
So I never set out
to write a book.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.349
It just sort of--

00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:34.390
and it sounds like such
a jerky thing to be like,

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.848
it just sort of happened, but
that's kind of what happened.

00:50:36.848 --> 00:50:38.920
It felt like, you know,
Jesus took the wheel.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.430
No, I'm just joking.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:44.330
That's inappropriate, but I just
feel like it just sort of just

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.960
played out the way it
was meant to I think.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.804
Yeah.

00:50:48.804 --> 00:50:49.970
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:53.024
How forthcoming were you when
you went and traveled around

00:50:53.024 --> 00:50:54.440
and met with
different-- like when

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.731
you went to the Wiccan potluck.

00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:57.300
Did they ask you
why you were there?

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.050
Did you tell them?

00:50:58.050 --> 00:50:59.589
And if so, what
was the response?

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:00.380
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.170
I was incredibly forthcoming.

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.200
I am a lawyer.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.120
I do not want to
get sued by anybody.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.860
I wasn't trying to dupe anybody.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.680
I was very, very clear that--

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.750
once I decided to
turn it into a book,

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:13.700
I was very clear that
I was writing a book.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.150
And for anybody that
was prior chapters,

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:18.650
I reached out to
people to make sure

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:19.970
that they were OK with
what I was writing,

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:21.720
because everything
in the book was true.

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:24.410
And so any one that,
certainly if I named them,

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:26.660
I gave everyone the opportunity
to change their name

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.510
or to read what I was writing
because I didn't want anyone

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:34.970
to feel made fun of
or kind of sideswiped

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:36.830
from what I was writing,
because it was not

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:40.640
meant to be like a take down of
all these different practices,

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.725
so I was very, very
forthcoming when I did it.

00:51:43.725 --> 00:51:45.850
Thank you from the legal
team of Google for asking.

00:51:48.736 --> 00:51:50.780
AUDIENCE: Were there
any ways in which

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.700
you feel like your
life has been changed

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.560
in either positive
or negative ways

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.936
that you were not expecting
after this experience?

00:51:56.936 --> 00:51:58.560
ANJALI KUMAR: From
the research or just

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.580
from the whole experience?

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.490
AUDIENCE: The research,
writing, anything.

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:01.100
Yeah.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:01.940
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.523
It's opened up in
ways that I wouldn't

00:52:03.523 --> 00:52:04.790
have expected for sure.

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:07.490
I think just what it did was--

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:08.310
one of the habits.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:10.490
I think I learned
working at Google

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:12.870
actually was to be
ready for anything

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:16.015
and to really put myself into
uncomfortable situations.

00:52:16.015 --> 00:52:18.500
Like again, as a lawyer, you're
trained to know something,

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.140
to go really deep on that
issue, to really be the expert.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.566
And working at Google
in the years that I did,

00:52:23.566 --> 00:52:25.190
that was not going
to be the situation.

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:26.480
It was like, here's
a new product.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.590
We're launching
this other thing,

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:29.330
and you just had to
go figure it out.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.300
And working that
muscle here I think

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.250
led to me being
really comfortable

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.770
going into these very
uncomfortable situations

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:38.900
for the research for
this book, and has

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.050
become a theme of both my
career and my personal life

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.316
since then, where it's
been like it's just

00:52:44.316 --> 00:52:45.440
opened up all these things.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.846
Because something like
becoming a clown in the Macy's

00:52:47.846 --> 00:52:49.970
Thanksgiving Day Parade,
like that is not something

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:51.950
I would ever have
thought I would do.

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.900
And I went and I had so
much fun and it was so goofy

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.440
and it was such a
delightful thing to do,

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.605
and I think it's because
I worked at Google

00:53:00.605 --> 00:53:03.230
and then did something like this
that I'm willing to put myself

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:05.965
out there and sort of suck
the marrow out of life

00:53:05.965 --> 00:53:06.834
while I'm here.

00:53:06.834 --> 00:53:08.250
And I think that's
definitely what

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.660
this has taught me, for sure.

00:53:12.754 --> 00:53:15.060
CRISTIN FRODELLA: Thank
you, Anjali, for coming.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.750
And I think if we've
learned anything,

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:19.882
it's that in addition to
wanting love and health

00:53:19.882 --> 00:53:20.840
and what was the other?

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.330
ANJALI KUMAR: Happiness.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:22.663
CRISTIN FRODELLA: And happiness.

00:53:22.663 --> 00:53:24.690
I think also,
everybody kind of wants

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:26.800
to know what's it all about.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.850
So thanks for bringing us
together to talk about that.

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:35.820
And if you haven't read the
book yet, I highly recommend it.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.660
It's so much fun.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.980
It's such a fun journey.

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.350
At the back of the
room, pick up a copy.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.819
And it's nice to see you all.

00:53:41.819 --> 00:53:43.610
ANJALI KUMAR: Thank
you all for being here.

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:44.880
Thank you so much [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.630
[APPLAUSE]
