00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 16.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we're going to take the loop over here--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
With a cost of left turns this high, the left turn over here becomes prohibitively expensive,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we'd rather take a detour on the right side

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and do 3 right turns as opposed to 1 left turn.
