00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.959
To better understand how
we can factor second degree

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.500
expressions like this, I'm going
to go through some examples.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.302
We'll factor this expression and
we'll factor this expression.

00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:10.010
And hopefully it'll
give you a background

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.974
on how you could generally
factor expressions like this.

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:14.390
And to think about
it, let's think

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.370
about what happens if I were
to multiply x plus something

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.790
times x plus something else.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.330
Well, if I were to multiply
this out, what do I get?

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.520
Well, you're going to get
x squared plus ax plus bx,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.730
which is the same thing as
a plus bx plus a times b.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.150
So if you wanted to go
from this form, which

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.922
is what we have in these
two examples, back to this,

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:46.630
you really just have
to think about well,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.940
what's our coefficient
on our x term,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.530
and can I figure out two numbers
that when I take their sum,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.369
are equal to that coefficient,
and what's my constant term,

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.660
and can I think of two numbers,
those same two numbers,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.410
that when I take the product
equal that constant term?

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.980
So let's do that over here.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.760
If we look at our
coefficient on x,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.610
can we think of
an a plus ab that

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.730
is equal to that
number negative 14?

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.690
And can we think
of the same a and b

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.400
that if we were to
take its product,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.440
it would be equal to 40?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.660
So what's an a and a b
that would work over here?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.970
Well, let's think about
this a little bit.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.790
If I have 4 times 10
is 40, but 4 plus 10

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.260
is equal to positive 14.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.980
So that wouldn't quite work.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.040
What happens if we make
them both negative?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.410
If we have negative
4 plus negative 10,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.680
well that's going to be
equal to negative 14.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.280
And negative 4 times
negative 10 is equal to 40.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.710
The fact that this number
right over here is positive,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.610
this number right
over here is positive,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.045
tells you that these are
going to be the same sign.

00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:07.370
If this number right
over here was negative,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.600
then we would have
different signs.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.050
And so if you have
2 numbers that

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.840
are going to be the same
sign and they add up

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.548
to a negative number,
then that tells you

00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:16.672
that they're both
going to be negative.

00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:18.130
So just going back
to this, we know

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.800
that a is going to be negative
4, b is equal to negative 10,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.050
and we are done factoring it.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:31.670
We can factor this expression
as x plus negative 4 times x

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.090
plus negative 10.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.600
Or another way to
write that, that's

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.020
x minus 4 times x minus 10.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.400
Now let's do the
same thing over here.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.240
Can we think of
an a plus b that's

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.360
equal to the coefficient
on the x term?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.810
Well, the coefficient
on the x term here

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.900
is essentially
negative 1 times x.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.270
So we could say the
coefficient is negative 1.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.830
And can we think of
an a times b where

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.545
it's going to be
equal to negative 12?

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.340
Well, let's think about
this a little bit.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.346
The product of the 2
numbers is negative,

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:15.220
so that means that they
have different signs.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.640
So one will be positive
and one will be negative.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.900
And so when I add the two
together, I get to negative 1.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.570
Well, just think about the
factors of negative 12.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.239
Well, what about if one is 3
and maybe one is negative 4.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.280
Well, that seems to work.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.690
And you really just have
to try these numbers out.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.820
If a is 3 plus
negative 4, that indeed

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.500
turns out to be negative 1.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.740
And if we have 3
times negative 4,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.150
that indeed is equal
to negative 12.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.340
So that seems to work out.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.173
And it's really a matter
of trial and error.

00:03:51.173 --> 00:03:53.982
You could try negative
3 plus 4, but then that

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:55.440
wouldn't have worked
out over here.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.830
You could have
tried two and six,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.165
but that wouldn't have
worked out on this number.

00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:01.540
Or 2 and negative
6, you wouldn't

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.160
have gotten the sum to
be equal to negative 1.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.720
But now that we've figured
out what the a and b are,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.070
what is this
expression factored?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.089
Well, it's going to be x plus
3 times x plus negative 4,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.005
or we could say x minus 4.
