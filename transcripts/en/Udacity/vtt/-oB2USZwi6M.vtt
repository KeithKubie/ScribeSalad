00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now comes the moment of truth.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I have been waiting for this moment for quite a while to let you experience first hand

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000
how to visualize data, and in this unit, you will do everything entirely by yourself.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I will give you data and you will plot those data and answer simple questions.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But there is one thing to know--this unit is strictly optional.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The reason is there is programming involved in this unit and programming was not a prerequisite.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
However, I will make sure what you have to do is extremely simple, is very well explained,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and a whole lot of fun, so if you choose to take this unit, you will visualize some interesting data

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
using a very simple programming tool. This over here is the Udacity programming interface.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Don't freak out--all I'll do is give instructions over here, and I'll hit the run button.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
As I scroll down, you can see a histogram of the data.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So this has been computed automatically now.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There are five data categories from 2.0 to 6.0, and you can see the frequency of data ions

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in the vertical dimension--1, 4, 3, 1, and 1 again.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now this is a familiar histogram. Just look out how easy it was to generate this.
