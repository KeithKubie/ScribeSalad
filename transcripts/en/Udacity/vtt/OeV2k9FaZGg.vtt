00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What you see here is a representation of all the classes in Firefox.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Every class here in this picture is a rectangle.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The larger the rectangle, the more lines of code in that class.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
These rectangles are nested into folders and packages.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The color of the rectangle indicates how many security issues have been fixed

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in that particular class.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What we see here, for instance, is the document object model,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which has a fair share of security fixes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But there is more areas with plenty of security issues.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Here we have JavaScript.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Here we do have HTML layout.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here we have a library for displaying the content.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now for the quiz.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Which of these four packages has had the most security issues in the past?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Is it JavaScript? Is it HTML layout?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Is it the DOM? Or is the content base?
