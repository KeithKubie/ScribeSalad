00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.780
So, now I want to do a little quiz about

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.530
identifying testable features. Let's consider

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.700
this simple problem called printSum.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.680
We won't see the implementation because we are doing black-box

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.780
testing. And all we need to know is that printSum takes

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.550
two integers, a and b, and prints the sum of

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.540
these two numbers. So what I want to ask, is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.700
how many independently testable features do we have here? Do

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.860
we have one, two, three features? Or more than three features?
