00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.343
All right.
Let's continue,

00:00:17.343 --> 00:00:22.781
then, on this unit of kinetics.
Today, we are going to talk

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:27.281
about temperature,
and we are going to talk about

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:33.000
collisions, and we are going to
talk about activation energies

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.509
and activated complexes.
And we are still in Chapter 13

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:41.938
in your book.
When we started this unit on

00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:47.123
kinetics, we listed a bunch of
things that can affect a rate of

00:00:47.123 --> 00:00:50.469
a reaction.
And let's just review what we

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.901
have talked about and what we
have left to talk about.

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:59.000
We talked about mechanisms of
reactions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.879
One step, two steps,
fast steps, slow steps.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.557
That can affect the rate of the
reaction.

00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:07.302
We talked about concentration
of material.

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:09.578
We talked about nature of
material.

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:13.529
We talked about first-order and
second-order integrated rate

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:15.671
laws.
Today, we are going to talk

00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:18.684
about temperature,
then Monday we are going to

00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:22.099
talk about the use of catalysts,
and then Wednesday,

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.313
again, is a review.
We are right at the bottom of

00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:30.000
our list here of things
affecting rates of reaction.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.192
The affect of temperature.
If you are in the gas phase,

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:38.929
it is sort of the qualitative
observation that if you increase

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.569
the temperature the rate
increases.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.383
You've probably sort of thought
about this, that if you want to

00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:49.722
make something go faster,
you add some heat.

00:01:49.722 --> 00:01:54.070
Today we are going to talk
about quantitative affects and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.884
how you can actually calculate a
change in rate constant if the

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:03.000
temperature of the reaction is
changed.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.293
Here we go back to 1889.
That is when Arrhenius plotted

00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:13.139
rate constants versus
temperature.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.917
And he was looking to get a
straight line.

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:23.860
He found that if he used the
natural log of the rate

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.154
constants and plotted that
against inverse temperature,

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:36.715
he got a straight line.
Here is what one of those plots

00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:40.218
look like.
The rate constants are varying

00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:43.547
exponentially with inverse
temperature.

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:47.226
On one axis,
we have the natural log of the

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:50.204
rate constant k.
On the other axis,

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:55.109
we have one over temperature.
And so this is the equation

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.603
that is being plotted.
Again, we have natural log of k

00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:03.458
on one axis.
That is rate constant.

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:06.648
The other axis is one over
temperature.

00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:10.931
And so if this is one over
temperature on this axis,

00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:15.717
then the slope of the line is
minus Ea, activation energy,

00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:18.488
over R, which is the gas
constant.

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:22.603
Up here, activation energy E
sub a and R,

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:26.549
our gas constant.
And the intercept of the line,

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.000
then, is the natural log of
capital A.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.250
And capital A has several
different names.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.452
You will see it listed in
different books as different

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:41.465
things.
I think our book usually refers

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:45.271
to it as factor A,
or the pre-exponential factor.

00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:48.204
And it would have the same
units as k.

00:03:48.204 --> 00:03:52.168
If one plots natural log of
rate constants over one

00:03:52.168 --> 00:03:56.846
temperature, one could determine
the activation energy for a

00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:02.000
reaction or the factor A for a
particular reaction.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.033
These quantities,
factor A and activation energy,

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:11.543
are dependent on the reaction
being studied.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:16.576
There will be a particular
measured value for one

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:21.715
particular reaction.
Let's think a little bit more

00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:27.902
about what these quantities are.
Factor A, is it temperature

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:30.000
dependent?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.943
No, it is not temperature
dependent.

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:44.563
So what is it?
Well, if we look over here,

00:04:44.563 --> 00:04:51.436
the natural log of A is going
to equal the natural log of k at

00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:56.619
zero, over here,
and that means when one over T

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:02.566
is approximately zero.
At what kinds of temperatures

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:06.637
would one over T be
approximately zero?

00:05:06.637 --> 00:05:10.884
Really, really big.
Factor A is the rate constant

00:05:10.884 --> 00:05:15.575
for that reaction at some
infinitely huge temperature.

00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:20.619
That is the maximum value that
you could get for that rate

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:23.362
constant.
At really, really huge

00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:27.964
temperature that is what it is.
It is not temperature

00:05:27.964 --> 00:05:32.031
dependent.
It is a quantity that is the

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:36.675
sort of maximum rate constant at
the biggest temperature that you

00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:39.433
can think of.
That is what factor A is.

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:43.786
What about activation energy?
Is that going to be temperature

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:46.471
dependent?
No, it won't be temperature

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.229
dependent either.
You can calculate it.

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.002
It is the slope of the line.
So you can get it out of

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:56.630
plotting these values,
but it is going to depend on

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.000
the reaction being studied,
not the particular temperature.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.536
And this is going to be
important in a few minutes

00:06:05.536 --> 00:06:09.432
because we are going to be
talking about the effects of

00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:13.329
rate constants on different
temperatures and looking at

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.000
equations and doing some
calculations.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.597
Okay.
We can rewrite this equation in

00:06:18.597 --> 00:06:22.711
a couple of different ways.
You will see that equation for

00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:25.958
the straight line that Arrhenius
came up with.

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:30.000
It is often called the
Arrhenius equation.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.817
And it can be written basically
just reversing these two terms,

00:06:34.817 --> 00:06:37.926
I guess because it looks better
that way.

00:06:37.926 --> 00:06:42.433
I am not really sure why you
cannot just keep it like that,

00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:46.552
but you will see it this way.
And you will also see it

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:50.204
rewritten this way.
Instead of natural log of k,

00:06:50.204 --> 00:06:52.691
you would see it as solved for
k.

00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:57.198
Here, the rate constant is
equal to A, which is this factor

00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:59.685
A.
This rate constant at infinity

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:04.658
huge temperatures times e to the
minus Ea, the activation energy,

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:10.000
over RT.
So you will also see this

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.839
equation this way.
It is a way of figuring out if

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:18.000
you know the activation energy
and you know factor A,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.759
you can calculate rate
constants at a particular

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.720
temperature.
It is not only gases that

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.399
behave in this way,
that exhibit this Arrhenius

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:32.948
behavior.
And you can apply these

00:07:32.948 --> 00:07:39.743
equations to other systems.
And let's just look at one

00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:47.820
other example of something that
behaves with Arrhenius behavior.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.641
What is that?
Crickets.

00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:56.666
How many of you have heard
crickets in the wild?

00:07:56.666 --> 00:08:01.901
Almost everybody.
I spent some years as a summer

00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:04.691
camp counselor,
and we always had kids coming

00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:08.494
to the country from the city.
And there would be crickets and

00:08:08.494 --> 00:08:11.030
bull frogs.
And these poor kids that grew

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.770
up right outside a hospital
where all night long there would

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.384
be ambulances going by and
traffic and helicopters and all

00:08:18.384 --> 00:08:22.188
sorts of things would sleep fine
at home, but then they would

00:08:22.188 --> 00:08:26.118
come to the country and couldn't
sleep a wink because of all of

00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:28.717
this noise.
The country is not as quiet as

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:33.149
people think it is.
Crickets will respond to

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:38.164
temperature, and so they
actually chirp faster when it is

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:40.850
hotter.
If you are out camping,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.223
you can count how many chirps
there are in 14 seconds and add

00:08:46.223 --> 00:08:50.522
that to 40 and get the
temperature in Fahrenheit.

00:08:50.522 --> 00:08:54.373
Has anyone actually tried this?
Did it work?

00:08:54.373 --> 00:08:57.955
You think so.
Did you have a control of a

00:08:57.955 --> 00:09:01.201
thermometer with you?
No.

00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:05.422
It probably works better if you
don't actually have the control,

00:09:05.422 --> 00:09:09.175
but it should theoretically
work if you can do a good job

00:09:09.175 --> 00:09:11.855
counting.
That is an example of a non-gas

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:14.000
exhibiting this behavior.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.097
All right.
Let's talk more about the

00:09:23.097 --> 00:09:26.991
activation energy.
We are going to talk a lot

00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:32.126
about activation energy today.
Activation energy Ea.

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:37.696
If you have two molecules
coming together and colliding,

00:09:37.696 --> 00:09:42.962
sometimes they will form
products, and sometimes they

00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:46.911
will just fall away back into
reactants.

00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:51.164
Not every collision will result
in product.

00:09:51.164 --> 00:09:55.316
Why is that?
Only the collisions that have

00:09:55.316 --> 00:10:02.000
the right amount of energy can
go on and form products.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.719
Really, what activation energy
is, is some critical amount of

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:11.202
energy that is required to go on
and result in a reaction.

00:10:11.202 --> 00:10:14.662
Only the molecules with that
critical energy,

00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:18.595
when they come together,
they will go onto product.

00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:22.764
Other molecules will come
together, and they will just

00:10:22.764 --> 00:10:27.011
fall apart, because they won't
be able to overcome this

00:10:27.011 --> 00:10:35.159
activation energy barrier.
Let's look at the affect of

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:46.050
temperature on the molecules
that have critical amounts of

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.636
energy.
If we plot, then,

00:10:50.636 --> 00:11:00.000
fraction of molecules versus
kinetic energy.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.323
And we can look at molecules
that have a low temperature,

00:11:07.323 --> 00:11:11.376
or molecules at low
temperature.

00:11:11.376 --> 00:11:19.484
There are some molecules at low
temperature, and we can look at

00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:25.892
some fractions of molecules at
higher temperature,

00:11:25.892 --> 00:11:34.000
and then consider the critical
energy needed to react.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.368
The activation energy.
Molecules with that amount of

00:11:39.368 --> 00:11:43.157
energy or more will be able to
react.

00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:47.894
And, if you look at the
fraction of molecules,

00:11:47.894 --> 00:11:53.789
then, that would have that
energy, at higher temperatures

00:11:53.789 --> 00:12:00.000
more molecules have that
critical amount of energy.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.768
And at lower temperature,
fewer molecules have that

00:12:03.768 --> 00:12:07.386
critical amount of energy.
So temperature makes a

00:12:07.386 --> 00:12:09.874
difference.
At higher temperature,

00:12:09.874 --> 00:12:12.361
more things will be able to
react.

00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:16.809
That is what gets into this
observation that reactions occur

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:20.728
faster at higher temperature.
More molecules have the

00:12:20.728 --> 00:12:24.798
critical energy needed to react
when they are at higher

00:12:24.798 --> 00:12:28.040
temperature.
At lower temperature it is more

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.129
difficult.
Fewer fractions of those

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:36.653
molecules have that critical
energy, can overcome an

00:12:36.653 --> 00:12:41.177
activation energy barrier.
Let's look at an example,

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:46.233
now, of if you know what the
activation energy barrier is,

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:50.580
figuring out different rate
constants at different

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.217
temperatures,
how temperature is affecting

00:12:54.217 --> 00:12:59.008
the rate of the reaction.
The example that we will look

00:12:59.008 --> 00:13:05.274
at is the hydrolysis of sucrose.
And this is part of the

00:13:05.274 --> 00:13:10.019
digestive process.
And digestion is a good thing.

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:13.776
Let's look at this particular
reaction.

00:13:13.776 --> 00:13:17.039
We are given an activation
energy.

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:21.884
Someone has measured the
activation energy for the

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:26.432
hydrolysis of sucrose,
108 kilojoules per mole.

00:13:26.432 --> 00:13:30.485
And someone has measured an
observed rate,

00:13:30.485 --> 00:13:38.000
a k(obs) of 1.0x10^-3 per molar
per second at body temperature.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.019
Now you are asked to figure out
what, would the observed rate

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:48.121
constant be if you lowered that
temperature, if you lowered it

00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:52.806
by 2 degrees to 35 degrees?
You could right two different

00:13:52.806 --> 00:13:56.319
expressions.
You can use Arrhenius equation

00:13:56.319 --> 00:14:00.000
and write two different
expressions.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.805
Over here we have the natural
log of k one,

00:14:03.805 --> 00:14:07.985
the rate constant at one time,
and t one at that

00:14:07.985 --> 00:14:10.671
temperature.
So, the rate constant at

00:14:10.671 --> 00:14:13.805
temperature one.
That would be equal to the

00:14:13.805 --> 00:14:17.835
natural log of factor A,
again, that is not temperature

00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:20.970
dependent, minus Ea,
the activation energy,

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.253
and then it is over RT.
And we write the same

00:14:24.253 --> 00:14:28.134
expression for a second
temperature and a second rate

00:14:28.134 --> 00:14:32.473
constant.
Now we can combine these two

00:14:32.473 --> 00:14:36.094
expressions and come up with one
equation.

00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:40.157
If we subtract,
we have natural log of the rate

00:14:40.157 --> 00:14:45.015
constant two minus the natural
log of rate constant one.

00:14:45.015 --> 00:14:50.492
And that can also be expressed
in terms of natural log of k two

00:14:50.492 --> 00:14:55.438
over k one.
And here we can pull out the

00:14:55.438 --> 00:15:00.297
temperature terms.
Both of these have the same

00:15:00.297 --> 00:15:04.212
expression, minus Ea over R,
the rate constant.

00:15:04.212 --> 00:15:07.276
And now we have the two
temperatures.

00:15:07.276 --> 00:15:12.468
This expression is telling us
how the rate constants are going

00:15:12.468 --> 00:15:17.659
to change with temperature for a
particular activation energy.

00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:20.468
What does this equation look
like?

00:15:20.468 --> 00:15:25.659
It should look familiar to you.
Something that we talked about

00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:30.000
before.
What was that equation called?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.294
Van Hoff equation.
And instead of rate constants

00:15:38.294 --> 00:15:45.882
we had what?
Instead of rate constants there

00:15:45.882 --> 00:15:50.647
were?
Equilibrium constants.

00:15:50.647 --> 00:15:57.000
And instead of Ea we had what?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.935
What tells us about how
equilibrium constants change

00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:11.561
with temperature?
If you have a reaction and you

00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:15.574
heat up the reaction,
how do you know which direction

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:18.506
it shifts?
What is our predictive tool?

00:16:18.506 --> 00:16:22.055
Delta H, right.
This equation is similar to one

00:16:22.055 --> 00:16:25.450
we saw before.
Here we are comparing how rate

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.000
constants change with
temperature.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.456
And a predictive tool is the
size, the magnitude of the

00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:35.399
activation energy.
Before we were talking about

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:38.087
how rate constants change with
temperature.

00:16:38.087 --> 00:16:40.711
And the predictive tool there
was delta H.

00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:44.104
In case you need a review of
this, we will review this

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:48.072
actually at the end of the class
because this is very exciting.

00:16:48.072 --> 00:16:51.464
At the end of the class we come
back to Le Châtelier's

00:16:51.464 --> 00:16:54.628
principle.
And we can explain Le

00:16:54.628 --> 00:16:59.204
Châletier's principle in terms
of temperature in a different

00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:03.934
way than we did when we started
the course, because now we can

00:17:03.934 --> 00:17:08.122
think about it in terms of
activation energies and rate

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:10.836
constants.
We will see that van Hoff

00:17:10.836 --> 00:17:13.473
equation again.
For the moment now,

00:17:13.473 --> 00:17:18.048
we are just considering how
rate constants are changing with

00:17:18.048 --> 00:17:20.995
temperature.
We can plug in our values.

00:17:20.995 --> 00:17:25.338
The initial observed rate for
the reaction at 37 degrees,

00:17:25.338 --> 00:17:31.000
and we have k two that
we are going to solve for.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.284
We were given the activation
energy.

00:17:33.284 --> 00:17:36.808
And we know the gas constant,
and we were given the two

00:17:36.808 --> 00:17:39.550
temperatures.
The only tricky thing here is

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.356
to remember to get your units to
cancel out.

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:45.554
Often activation energies are
given in kilojoules,

00:17:45.554 --> 00:17:48.034
whereas your gas constant is in
joules.

00:17:48.034 --> 00:17:50.841
The temperatures here were
given in Celsius,

00:17:50.841 --> 00:17:54.627
but if you are using the gas
constant you are going to need

00:17:54.627 --> 00:17:59.000
to convert them to Kelvin for
your units to cancel.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.913
The only thing tricky about
this is to make sure that your

00:18:03.913 --> 00:18:08.741
units are going to cancel.
And so we can solve this for k

00:18:08.741 --> 00:18:11.844
two.
And k two comes out to be

00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:17.189
7.6x10^-4 per molar per second.
It would be the same units as k

00:18:17.189 --> 00:18:20.810
one, and that is quite a
bit slower.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.603
We only changed our temperature
by 2 degrees,

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:29.000
and yet the rate is quite a bit
slower.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.568
The body temperature is the
reactions, the enzymes in our

00:18:33.568 --> 00:18:38.463
bodies, and how much they need
to work, how well they need to

00:18:38.463 --> 00:18:42.623
work, is really optimized for
the temperature of our

00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:46.376
particular body.
If your body temperature drops

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:51.189
quite a bit or if your body
temperature goes up quite a bit,

00:18:51.189 --> 00:18:55.431
that is not good for the
overall working of the human

00:18:55.431 --> 00:18:58.368
body.
Just some advice for a day like

00:18:58.368 --> 00:19:01.976
today.
It is best to keep your body

00:19:01.976 --> 00:19:06.000
temperature at normal body
temperature if you are spending

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.317
a lot of time outside.
Wear a hat, wear a scarf,

00:19:09.317 --> 00:19:11.294
wear gloves,
wear real shoes,

00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:15.247
not sort of flip-flop type
things, and you should be able

00:19:15.247 --> 00:19:18.776
to continue your hydrolyze your
sucrose and digest.

00:19:18.776 --> 00:19:22.447
You have to start worrying
about what clothes you are

00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:26.682
wearing this time of year in
Boston, for those of you who are

00:19:26.682 --> 00:19:30.000
from warmer climates.
All right.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.264
If we look at this equation
again, we will see that if this

00:19:34.264 --> 00:19:37.500
term is large,
if you have a large activation

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.764
energy, if you have a large
critical energy needed for that

00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:45.147
reaction to go,
then that reaction will be very

00:19:45.147 --> 00:19:48.161
sensitive to changes in
temperature, i.e.,

00:19:48.161 --> 00:19:52.205
if this is a big number,
then you are going to see a big

00:19:52.205 --> 00:19:55.735
difference between k one
and k two.

00:19:55.735 --> 00:20:00.000
This will tell you a lot about
the reaction.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.825
And we will come back to this
idea in a little bit.

00:20:03.825 --> 00:20:06.656
All right.
Let's consider the reaction

00:20:06.656 --> 00:20:09.258
coordinate and activated
complexes.

00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:12.242
There is this critical
collision energy,

00:20:12.242 --> 00:20:16.757
this activation energy that is
needed for these molecules to

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.511
actually react.
Why does this happen?

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:23.261
Well, as two molecules may come
toward each other,

00:20:23.261 --> 00:20:29.000
they may not be able to react
if they don't have that energy.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.468
Well, why do they need energy?
Well, they may need to sort of

00:20:33.468 --> 00:20:35.776
rearrange.
A bond may be broken.

00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:40.170
An atom may fall to the ground.
New reactions are occurring.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.893
There is energy needed to get
your desired product.

00:20:43.893 --> 00:20:47.393
They have to distort.
The bonds need to distort,

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:52.574
and that requires energy.
The result is that usually,

00:20:52.574 --> 00:20:57.819
before you go on to your
products, so say this is one of

00:20:57.819 --> 00:21:01.919
your products,
you need to usually form some

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:07.354
kind of intermediate state,
some kind of activated complex

00:21:07.354 --> 00:21:12.026
or transition state.
And that transition state can

00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:16.794
either go on to products or fall
back to reactants.

00:21:16.794 --> 00:21:21.753
And only those molecules with
this energy can do this

00:21:21.753 --> 00:21:26.711
reaction, can overcome this
barrier and go on to form

00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:31.076
products.
And I will show you a little

00:21:31.076 --> 00:21:33.894
movie of two molecules coming
together.

00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:38.122
They are going to circle each
other and figure out if they

00:21:38.122 --> 00:21:42.349
have the critical energy to
react, and when they have that

00:21:42.349 --> 00:21:46.279
critical energy you will know
it, and go onto product.

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:49.172
Let's just take a look at this
reaction.

00:21:49.172 --> 00:21:52.138
Here comes a molecule in red
and in blue.

00:21:52.138 --> 00:21:54.511
They are checking each other
out.

00:21:54.511 --> 00:22:00.000
They had enough energy and they
went on and formed product.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.494
But only those molecules with
that energy can go and form the

00:22:05.494 --> 00:22:07.142
product.
All right.

00:22:07.142 --> 00:22:11.996
Let's draw a reaction
coordinate now and look at these

00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:17.216
activation energy barriers and
these transition complexes.

00:22:17.216 --> 00:22:20.787
All right.
A reaction coordinate diagram

00:22:20.787 --> 00:22:25.000
has potential energy on one
side, --

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.672
-- and has the reaction
coordinate on the other axis.

00:22:35.672 --> 00:22:41.018
And that just means the
direction of the reaction.

00:22:41.018 --> 00:22:46.799
A reaction will start with
reactants with a particular

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.981
energy.
In this case,

00:22:48.981 --> 00:22:54.000
we are going to look at NO two
plus CO.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
We have two reactants at a
particular energy.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.903
And then these will react.
They will need to form some

00:23:06.903 --> 00:23:11.201
kind of activated complex up
here.

00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:18.105
Say, there are bonds distorting
and new bonds forming.

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:23.315
There is some kind of
intermediate state,

00:23:23.315 --> 00:23:31.000
some kind of activated complex
or transition state.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.200
There will be energy associated
with getting up here.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.299
If they have the critical
energy to react,

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:48.700
they will go on,
then, to products.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.500
And our products here are NO
plus CO two.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.500
And these are our products.
And so that is what the

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.000
reaction coordinate will look
like.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.576
If they didn't have enough
energy, it would just come back

00:24:09.576 --> 00:24:13.846
down here.
This barrier up here is the

00:24:13.846 --> 00:24:18.692
activation energy for the
forward reaction,

00:24:18.692 --> 00:24:24.461
and this over here is the
activation energy for the

00:24:24.461 --> 00:24:27.923
reverse reaction.
And, overall,

00:24:27.923 --> 00:24:33.000
you have a delta E for the
system.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:41.582
So, the difference between the
energy of the reactants and the

00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:46.929
products.
Delta E is going to equal the

00:24:46.929 --> 00:24:54.105
activation energy for the
forward reaction minus the

00:24:54.105 --> 00:25:01.000
activation energy for the
reverse reaction.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.800
And we can put some numbers on
this.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:13.207
For the forward reaction it is
132 kilojoules per mole,

00:25:13.207 --> 00:25:20.889
for the reverse reaction we
have 358 kilojoules per mole,

00:25:20.889 --> 00:25:28.159
and our overall delta E value
is going to be minus 226

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:35.418
kilojoules per mole.
Minus 226 kilojoules per mole

00:25:35.418 --> 00:25:42.490
is going to be equal to the 132
kilojoules per mole minus the

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:48.855
358 kilojoules per mole.
These are all going to add up.

00:25:48.855 --> 00:25:55.220
And that is one of the
equations on your equation sheet

00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:03.000
that you need to know for the
final that won't be provided.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.888
But it makes rational sense
that these should all add up

00:26:07.888 --> 00:26:09.577
together.
All right.

00:26:09.577 --> 00:26:14.111
How does this relate?
Delta E, what is this delta E?

00:26:14.111 --> 00:26:18.111
Well, this is a quantity that
can be measured.

00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:23.355
It is a thermodynamic quantity.
It can come from calorimetry

00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:27.000
experiments.
And it is related to a friend

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.755
of ours, delta H.
If you recall,

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:35.000
delta H equals delta E plus the
change in PV.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.712
And I think this was Lecture 17
from Professor Ceyer's notes

00:26:39.712 --> 00:26:43.306
when she started talking about
thermodynamics.

00:26:43.306 --> 00:26:47.380
And so most of the time,
these are pretty similar to

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.495
each other.
For gases, there is a little

00:26:50.495 --> 00:26:53.450
bit of a difference.
This term exists.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:58.322
You might have like a 1% to 2%
difference, but is more or less

00:26:58.322 --> 00:27:02.416
the same.
If it helps you to think about

00:27:02.416 --> 00:27:07.491
this as more or less the same as
the delta H, that can be useful

00:27:07.491 --> 00:27:09.827
for you.
They are very similar

00:27:09.827 --> 00:27:11.599
quantities there.
Okay.

00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:15.466
Again, there is a barrier.
And for this reaction,

00:27:15.466 --> 00:27:20.058
there is a smaller barrier
going in the forward direction,

00:27:20.058 --> 00:27:24.811
the smaller activation energy,
and a much bigger barrier for

00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:29.000
the reverse direction of this
reaction.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.726
If we think about activation
energy barriers,

00:27:32.726 --> 00:27:37.978
every reaction is going to have
some activation energy barrier,

00:27:37.978 --> 00:27:43.229
just like most things we do in
life have some activation energy

00:27:43.229 --> 00:27:46.024
barrier.
For me, writing papers or

00:27:46.024 --> 00:27:49.073
writing grants,
there is a very large

00:27:49.073 --> 00:27:52.461
activation energy barrier to get
started.

00:27:52.461 --> 00:27:57.120
The getting started part,
and it is usually kind of more

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.169
like this direction.
This kind of size activation

00:28:02.169 --> 00:28:05.732
energy barrier.
Once I manage to kind of get up

00:28:05.732 --> 00:28:08.288
over the hump,
really get started,

00:28:08.288 --> 00:28:12.859
then it becomes much easier,
and I can really get going with

00:28:12.859 --> 00:28:15.647
this.
I imagine that if I recall back

00:28:15.647 --> 00:28:19.598
to studying for final exams,
going back over the old

00:28:19.598 --> 00:28:23.626
material that you already
covered and reviewing that,

00:28:23.626 --> 00:28:28.119
there is a sizable activation
energy barrier to pulling out

00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:33.000
those first set of notes and
pulling out Exam 1.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.392
And looking at the things you
got wrong and going back over it

00:28:37.392 --> 00:28:39.695
has an activation energy
barrier.

00:28:39.695 --> 00:28:44.087
And what we are going to talk
about on Monday a little bit are

00:28:44.087 --> 00:28:48.119
some tricks to get over those
activation energy barriers.

00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:51.647
Catalysts can lower the
activation energy barrier.

00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:55.319
And, for most of us,
an enormous level of stress can

00:28:55.319 --> 00:29:00.000
also help us get over that
activation energy barrier.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.989
Your professor,
for example,

00:29:01.989 --> 00:29:06.631
mentioning the final exam every
day before class starts can be a

00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:10.831
little help getting over that
activation energy barrier to

00:29:10.831 --> 00:29:14.000
start reviewing material.
This kind of plot,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.905
you should feel like you should
bond with this idea of

00:29:17.905 --> 00:29:21.736
activation energy barriers.
You should understand the

00:29:21.736 --> 00:29:25.715
deepest level about these
barriers that these molecules

00:29:25.715 --> 00:29:28.000
need to overcome.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.073
All right.
Let's look at the affect of

00:29:36.073 --> 00:29:40.559
temperature on whether molecules
can make it over those

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:44.795
activation energy barriers.
Again, for an elementary

00:29:44.795 --> 00:29:47.619
reaction there is always a
barrier.

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:51.523
Sometimes it is smaller,
sometimes it is larger,

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:54.597
but there is always a barrier
to that.

00:29:54.597 --> 00:29:57.421
There is always a positive Ea
here.

00:29:57.421 --> 00:30:01.061
Okay.
What happens if you increase

00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:04.006
temperature?
If you increase temperature,

00:30:04.006 --> 00:30:07.981
it should increase the rate,
because of this down here.

00:30:07.981 --> 00:30:11.883
You increase temperature,
more molecules will have the

00:30:11.883 --> 00:30:15.122
energy required to make it over
that barrier.

00:30:15.122 --> 00:30:19.098
For an elementary reaction,
increasing temperature will

00:30:19.098 --> 00:30:22.558
increase the rate.
It will get over the barrier.

00:30:22.558 --> 00:30:26.607
For an overall reaction,
for a more complicated reaction

00:30:26.607 --> 00:30:30.361
that has multiple steps,
it is not necessarily clear

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:35.000
that temperature is going to
have this affect.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.619
And let's consider why this is
true.

00:30:37.619 --> 00:30:42.035
Let's look at the same reaction
we looked at with mechanisms

00:30:42.035 --> 00:30:46.377
last time and figure out what
all the k observed

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:49.446
terms are.
Are there small rate constants?

00:30:49.446 --> 00:30:51.766
Are there equilibrium
constants?

00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:56.257
What does k(obs) really mean?
And then we can think about how

00:30:56.257 --> 00:31:00.000
temperature would affect those
values.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.382
Here we have a reaction with
the fast reversible step

00:31:04.382 --> 00:31:07.500
followed by another step that is
slow.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.292
We can say that the rate of
product formation,

00:31:11.292 --> 00:31:16.179
our product here is NO two,
is going to be equal to

00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:19.719
two, because two were formed,
k two,

00:31:19.719 --> 00:31:23.679
this rate constant,
times this intermediate here

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:26.460
times the concentration of
oxygen.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.641
That is just this last step.
This slow step rate of

00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:35.298
formation of product.
But this is an intermediate,

00:31:35.298 --> 00:31:38.656
so we are not done.
We have to get rid of this

00:31:38.656 --> 00:31:41.791
intermediate.
And here, we can do it fairly

00:31:41.791 --> 00:31:46.417
efficiently, because we have a
fast reversible step followed by

00:31:46.417 --> 00:31:49.402
a slow step.
We can approximate that this

00:31:49.402 --> 00:31:53.208
step is in equilibrium.
And, if we approximate that,

00:31:53.208 --> 00:31:57.164
then we can solve for this
intermediate in terms of an

00:31:57.164 --> 00:32:02.347
equilibrium expression.
Again, the first step fast and

00:32:02.347 --> 00:32:04.850
reversible, the second step
slow.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.511
This is pretty much in
equilibrium.

00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:11.657
Not much of this intermediate
is being siphoned off to

00:32:11.657 --> 00:32:14.630
products.
We can solve by setting up an

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:18.229
equilibrium expression.
Here is the equilibrium

00:32:18.229 --> 00:32:21.515
expression.
Equilibrium constant for Step 1

00:32:21.515 --> 00:32:25.740
equals rate constant for the
forward reaction over rate

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.887
constant for the reverse
reaction equals products over

00:32:29.887 --> 00:32:33.988
reactants.
There are two reactants,

00:32:33.988 --> 00:32:38.295
two NO, so it is NO squared.
And we can solve for the

00:32:38.295 --> 00:32:41.029
concentration of the
intermediate,

00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:45.171
then, which would be k one
times NO squared.

00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:49.479
Now we can substitute that in
the overall expression,

00:32:49.479 --> 00:32:52.130
and we have this expression
here.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:57.183
Now our k(obs) is going to be
equal to this two k two

00:32:57.183 --> 00:33:02.142
and big K one.
This is what we need to

00:33:02.142 --> 00:33:06.335
consider, how that is affected
by temperature.

00:33:06.335 --> 00:33:10.993
Little k two is an
elementary rate constant.

00:33:10.993 --> 00:33:16.024
For an elementary reaction,
increasing temperature will

00:33:16.024 --> 00:33:20.403
always increase rate.
We know how this affected.

00:33:20.403 --> 00:33:25.155
And here is our expression that
we looked at before.

00:33:25.155 --> 00:33:30.000
Now, what about the equilibrium
constant?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.321
How do you know what is going
to happen with an equilibrium

00:33:35.321 --> 00:33:40.733
constant, if it will get bigger
or smaller with temperature?

00:33:40.733 --> 00:33:45.688
What is the equation that
relates equilibrium constants

00:33:45.688 --> 00:33:48.623
and temperature?
Van Hoff, right.

00:33:48.623 --> 00:33:52.935
It depends on delta H.
It depends on whether the

00:33:52.935 --> 00:33:56.330
reaction is endothermic or
exothermic.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:01.885
And here is that expression.
You can see these are really

00:34:01.885 --> 00:34:05.453
very similar expressions.
Here we have the equilibrium

00:34:05.453 --> 00:34:08.214
constants.
Delta H is our predictive tool.

00:34:08.214 --> 00:34:12.254
Whether that is endothermic or
exothermic will depend on what

00:34:12.254 --> 00:34:15.553
direction it goes.
It will depend on whether K one

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:19.862
is bigger than k two or k two is
bigger than k one with change in

00:34:19.862 --> 00:34:22.354
temperature.
And over here we have the

00:34:22.354 --> 00:34:27.000
expression that relates rate
constants with temperature.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.206
And, in terms of sign,
that is not an issue here,

00:34:30.206 --> 00:34:33.145
because activation energy is
always positive.

00:34:33.145 --> 00:34:35.617
There is always a barrier to
overcome.

00:34:35.617 --> 00:34:38.890
That is always positive.
Never a negative barrier.

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:42.497
There is no sign change here,
but there is an effective

00:34:42.497 --> 00:34:45.504
magnitude of that value as there
is with this.

00:34:45.504 --> 00:34:48.576
So it is not so simple.
If you have a multistep

00:34:48.576 --> 00:34:52.585
reaction, it is not always so
simple to predict the affect of

00:34:52.585 --> 00:34:56.526
temperature, because it may be
changing one thing in one way

00:34:56.526 --> 00:35:00.000
and something else in another
way.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.981
Let's consider this particular
one here.

00:35:02.981 --> 00:35:07.568
Again, little k is always going
to increase with temperature.

00:35:07.568 --> 00:35:10.473
The equilibrium constant,
in this case,

00:35:10.473 --> 00:35:13.607
will decrease,
because it is an exothermic

00:35:13.607 --> 00:35:16.359
reaction.
This particular reaction is

00:35:16.359 --> 00:35:19.493
exothermic.
If we think about Le Châtelier

00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:23.698
or we think about the van Hoff
equation, we say if it an

00:35:23.698 --> 00:35:27.597
exothermic reaction,
increasing the temperature will

00:35:27.597 --> 00:35:31.037
decrease the K,
because you are going to shift

00:35:31.037 --> 00:35:37.000
the reaction in the endothermic
reaction to use up the heat.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.749
The magnitude of the increase
or decrease will depend on the

00:35:43.749 --> 00:35:50.612
magnitude of the energy barrier
and the magnitude of delta H.

00:35:50.612 --> 00:35:57.247
If we look at this particular
example and you are told that

00:35:57.247 --> 00:36:04.110
the activation energy is a small
number, it is not a very big

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:10.322
activation energy barrier.
And you are also told then that

00:36:10.322 --> 00:36:13.919
delta H is a big number,
and it is a big negative

00:36:13.919 --> 00:36:16.466
number, what would that mean,
then?

00:36:16.466 --> 00:36:20.662
Well, if you look at this,
if you have a small number for

00:36:20.662 --> 00:36:24.334
activation energy,
then there is not going to be a

00:36:24.334 --> 00:36:28.904
big difference between the Ks.
The rate constant is only going

00:36:28.904 --> 00:36:34.000
to increase a little bit,
because this is a small number.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.062
On the other hand,
if delta H is a big number,

00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:41.214
and you are told delta H is a
big number, then the equilibrium

00:36:41.214 --> 00:36:44.345
constant should be very
sensitive to changes in

00:36:44.345 --> 00:36:47.272
temperature.
You should see a big difference

00:36:47.272 --> 00:36:51.151
in the equilibrium constants,
because this is a really big

00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:53.670
number.
This particular reaction is an

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.209
example where increasing the
temperature can actually

00:36:57.209 --> 00:37:02.578
decrease the observed rate.
And the effect is because of

00:37:02.578 --> 00:37:05.986
the delta H.
Again, a large activation

00:37:05.986 --> 00:37:11.052
energy means that the rate
constant is very sensitive to

00:37:11.052 --> 00:37:15.934
changes in temperature,
a large delta H means that the

00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:20.631
equilibrium constant is very
sensitive to changes in

00:37:20.631 --> 00:37:24.407
temperature.
Our predictors are activation

00:37:24.407 --> 00:37:29.197
energy and also delta H,
in thinking about what might

00:37:29.197 --> 00:37:35.000
happen when the temperature of a
reaction changes.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.320
And we mentioned that this is
always going to increase,

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:43.400
rate constant will always
increase with temperature.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.800
And you can easily remember
this, that there is always a

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.599
barrier.
You don't get a great deal.

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:53.559
There is always a barrier to
overcome.

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:57.880
And delta H can be positive or
negative, so equilibrium

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:03.000
constants can increase or
decrease with temperature.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.840
For delta H,
magnitude of delta H indicates

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:12.053
the magnitude of the change.
Sign of delta H indicates the

00:38:12.053 --> 00:38:16.442
direction of the change.
And, if you forget that,

00:38:16.442 --> 00:38:21.563
you can just look at the
equations and they will tell you

00:38:21.563 --> 00:38:25.312
the same thing.
Now we can come back to Le

00:38:25.312 --> 00:38:28.056
Châtelier.
We can explain those

00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:34.000
observations about how
equilibrium constants changed.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.742
And how the reaction was
affected, why you would shift in

00:38:38.742 --> 00:38:43.824
one direction versus another
when you change the temperature.

00:38:43.824 --> 00:38:48.990
Again, Le Châtelier says that a
system that is at equilibrium,

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:53.394
if you have the system at
equilibrium and you apply a

00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:58.560
stress, the system will respond
in such a way to minimize that

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.425
stress.
If you increased the

00:39:01.425 --> 00:39:05.631
temperature, the equilibrium
should shift in the endothermic

00:39:05.631 --> 00:39:07.911
direction.
That would be what the

00:39:07.911 --> 00:39:12.117
prediction would be from Le
Châtelier, because if you put in

00:39:12.117 --> 00:39:16.607
more heat the reaction wants to
respond in a way to decrease the

00:39:16.607 --> 00:39:19.174
heat.
And so it goes in the direction

00:39:19.174 --> 00:39:22.310
that absorbs heat,
the endothermic direction.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:26.301
This is what we talked about
before, but now we can think

00:39:26.301 --> 00:39:30.721
about this in a little bit of a
different way in terms of these

00:39:30.721 --> 00:39:36.293
reaction coordinate diagrams.
Let's look at an endothermic

00:39:36.293 --> 00:39:40.717
versus exothermic reaction.
Here we have an endothermic

00:39:40.717 --> 00:39:43.338
reaction.
We have reactants here,

00:39:43.338 --> 00:39:48.090
we have a large activation
energy in the forward direction,

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:52.677
we have products up here,
and a smaller activation energy

00:39:52.677 --> 00:39:57.101
in the reverse direction.
For this exothermic reaction,

00:39:57.101 --> 00:40:03.000
we have a smaller activation
energy in the forward direction.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.788
And a much larger one in the
reverse direction.

00:40:06.788 --> 00:40:11.729
Our equation here would then
indicate you have an endothermic

00:40:11.729 --> 00:40:16.011
reaction, your delta E is
positive, if you have a big

00:40:16.011 --> 00:40:20.870
number for the forward minus a
small number for the reverse.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:25.070
That is going to give you a
positive overall number.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:29.435
Whereas, in this case,
if you have a small number here

00:40:29.435 --> 00:40:34.047
minus a much bigger number,
you get a negative number for

00:40:34.047 --> 00:40:38.000
delta E or an exothermic
reaction.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.050
If you are given information
about the activation energy in

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:46.379
the forward direction and in the
reverse direction and ask if a

00:40:46.379 --> 00:40:50.360
reaction is endothermic or
exothermic, you can figure that

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.502
out using this equation.
Now let's think about

00:40:53.502 --> 00:40:56.296
temperature.
If there is a small barrier,

00:40:56.296 --> 00:40:59.578
only a small barrier,
most of your molecules can

00:40:59.578 --> 00:41:03.000
probably get over that small
barrier.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.274
It's not that hard.
But if there is a very large

00:41:06.274 --> 00:41:10.244
barrier, that is a problem.
Temperature helps with the big

00:41:10.244 --> 00:41:12.125
barriers.
The small barrier,

00:41:12.125 --> 00:41:14.564
the molecules are going over
anyway.

00:41:14.564 --> 00:41:17.420
The bigger barriers,
they need extra help.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.415
They need the help of increased
temperature.

00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:24.316
If we consider what happens,
increasing temperature here,

00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:27.103
the big barrier is the forward
direction.

00:41:27.103 --> 00:41:31.422
Increasing the temperature will
make it easier to overcome this

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:36.050
very large barrier.
It makes very little difference

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:38.432
here.
The molecules are already doing

00:41:38.432 --> 00:41:41.409
fine getting over the small
barrier, but here,

00:41:41.409 --> 00:41:43.725
there is a big help.
What this does,

00:41:43.725 --> 00:41:47.033
then, is it shifts the
equilibrium toward products.

00:41:47.033 --> 00:41:50.737
Increasing temperature for an
endothermic reaction shifts

00:41:50.737 --> 00:41:53.847
toward products.
That is what we learned before,

00:41:53.847 --> 00:41:57.089
but we had a different
rationale for it last time.

00:41:57.089 --> 00:42:01.912
Now let's consider this case.
If you increase temperature,

00:42:01.912 --> 00:42:05.053
it is going to affect the
reverse barrier more.

00:42:05.053 --> 00:42:08.536
That is the big barrier.
This is where molecules are

00:42:08.536 --> 00:42:11.951
having a difficult time.
They are getting over that

00:42:11.951 --> 00:42:14.136
barrier already,
so in this case,

00:42:14.136 --> 00:42:18.234
when you have this exothermic
reaction, adding temperature is

00:42:18.234 --> 00:42:21.990
going to shift toward reactants.
It will shift it in the

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.653
endothermic direction using up
the heat.

00:42:24.653 --> 00:42:28.000
Again, this is what we saw
before.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.658
But now we have a different
explanation for why.

00:42:31.658 --> 00:42:35.860
Again, a large activation
energy barrier means that the

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:39.596
rate constants are very
sensitive to temperature.

00:42:39.596 --> 00:42:42.320
It is highly affected.
If it is big,

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.433
it is large.
It needs temperature for the

00:42:45.433 --> 00:42:49.481
molecules to get over.
Increasing the temperature has

00:42:49.481 --> 00:42:52.360
a big effect.
Now molecules can do it.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.863
They can get over.
This is why a large barrier

00:42:55.863 --> 00:43:01.000
means that a reaction is
sensitive to temperature.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.851
Big activation energy,
big difference.

00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:07.184
Small activation energy,
not such a big difference.
