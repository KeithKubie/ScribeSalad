00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.350
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: A couple of caveats I'm
gonna steal a line from a telephone executive

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.160
who would like to say I know it's common to
ask people to shut down their phones but he

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.440
liked to hear the sound of ringing and so
he encouraged people to leave their phones

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.639
on.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.400
Rather than ask you to put down your laptops
or your Smartphones I will say that if you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.539
are looking into a screen I'm assuming you're
gonna be posting to Google+ about how interesting

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.680
this is and encouraging people to buy the
book and that' s just fine with me.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.350
My other caveat is that although I do have
direct comparisons in the book between Apple

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.540
and Google and they will be part of my comments
and I am happy to discuss them with you in

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.650
the Q and A, I didn't spend the last year
of my life studying Google, I spent the last

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.570
year of my life studying Apple.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.239
So beyond the conclusions that I am willing
to draw or the observations that I am willing

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.950
to make about the comparisons of the two companies,
in particular cultural issues, I don't wanna

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.369
put too much of the compare and contrast burden
on me for comparing Apple and Google, I'll

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.539
put that burden on you and I'll tell you about
Apple and leave you to make your own conclusions

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.780
about the differences between the two companies.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.590
One of my major epiphanies in working on the
book and on the article in Fortune Magazine

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.079
before it is just how differently Apple does
business from the way everybody else does

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.130
business.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.240
And indeed how the Apple way of doing business
is different from what's taught in business

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.009
school.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.060
And Steve Jobs was quite clear on this, he
didn't particularly care for business school

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.520
and he didn't particularly care for MBA's
in general.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.479
And part of the reason for doing Apple University
over the past four years was to as he put

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.109
it, "To try to create our own kind of MBA."

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:11.879
And so I'll ask you to keep in mind as I make
my points how much Apple differs from everybody

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.879
else.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.849
The question arises, well if they're so exceptional
and they're so unique and they had this extraordinary

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.700
one of a kind leader how much can we learn
from them?

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.980
And I would suggest there absolutely is a
don't try this at home aspect to Apple's way

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.060
of doing business.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.170
Having said that Apple is currently the world's
most valuable company and is absolutely crushing

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.959
it in a way and growing in a way that no large
company does, and maybe no large company ever

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.120
has and so I would submit that if they do
things differently it's at least worth asking

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.489
the question how and why.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.049
And I really wish we had one of those set
ups where we could pan the room because I

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.030
just love people sitting on the floor for
a talk –

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.530
[laughter]

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.040
wonderful.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.870
A moment on what Apple was like in 1997 when
Steve Jobs returned to the company.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.870
He would be quoted frequently and in ensuing
years talking about the fact that Apple was

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.829
90 days from insolvency when he rejoined the
company in 1997.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.920
The company was a shambles; it had too many
factories in the United States and abroad,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.790
it had too much inventory, it had too many
middle managers, Jobs went on to fire about

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.939
4,000 of them.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:35.370
The culture in his opinion had become infected
with people who were more interested in making

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.140
money than they were in making beautiful products,
and the company was structurally dysfunctional

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.090
in a way that he would change.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.060
And the example that I share in the book is
that at the time Apple had 16 advertising

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.060
budgets.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.670
Now the adverting budgets is a good metaphor
for fiefdoms; if you were a general manager

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.930
in the business and you had an advertising
budget that probably wasn't the only budget

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.939
that you had, you were an important person
in your own right.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.340
Jobs wanted to eliminate that, he wanted to
get rid of fiefdoms, he got rid of the whole

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.870
notion of general manager, and he wanted to
emphasize the notion of one company, one brand,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.680
one Apple, and so on.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.580
And in eliminating the advertising budgets
he was able to say to people who were responsible

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.870
for a product, "If you think your product
deserves advertising spend then you'll come

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.090
to me and ask for advertizing spend and I'll
decide whether or not to give it to you and

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.090
we'll make a decision at a central, at a corporate
level about how to advertise."

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.949
And we all know how that's gone for Apple.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.970
This was not about cost cutting by the way;
within short order advertising spending at

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.470
Apple increased it didn't decrease and Apple
developed this very virtuous circle of tending

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.570
to only advertise one or two major things
at a time, but there being a halo effect to

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.460
the other products that weren't being advertised
and this worked particularly well once the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.330
stores were up and running and became a force
of their own.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.940
Advertise an iPod and people might come in
and buy an iPhone; advertize the iPhone and

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.250
people have to walk past the Macintosh's to
get to the iMac's or the laptops to get to

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.440
the iPhone and so on.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.629
And so that's something that Jobs cleaned
up in his first few years back at the company

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.629
in '97.

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:39.139
Leadership is an important topic when thinking
about Apple, it's also an example of Apple's

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.810
exceptionalism.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.500
This is Narcissus the Greek god who was in
love with his own image; here he is gazing

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.509
into the pond to see his own beautiful self.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:57.300
And I just wanted to share the work of a psychotherapist
and business coach named Michael Maccoby who

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.199
wrote a Harvest Business School article and
then a book called Narcissistic Leaders.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:11.849
And as I was reading this article it goes
on explaining what a narcissist is first of

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:17.389
all, a narcissist is someone who is visionary,
who is charismatic, who has a willingness

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:24.520
to bet the company on his or her vision, who
expects to be followed but doesn't necessarily

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.479
care if they're loved.

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:32.080
And as I was readin' this I was thinking,
"My God this person is describing Steve Jobs

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.409
without using his name."

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.419
And then in fact Jobs did appear as an example
in Maccoby's work.

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:42.770
The productive narcissist, and I mentioned
that Maccoby was a business coach and a trained

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.069
psychotherapist, the productive narcissist
is someone who can channel their narcissism

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:53.170
in a productive way and he worked with clients
to help them be not less narcissistic but

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.590
more productively narcissistic.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:02.360
And I think that if you dig into this topic
you see that a lot of what makes Apple tick

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.539
is because it has been led by this kind of
personality.

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:11.659
What then you ask happens after the productive
narcissist is gone?

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:17.560
Well there's two other categories that Maccoby
identifies as business people and he uses

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.099
classical Jungian psychological terms for
this.

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:25.819
The second category is an obsessive and he
talked about productive obsessives, these

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:31.060
are people who make the trains run on time,
they're typically a side kick to the productive

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:37.060
narcissist, they can help the visionary realize
their vision by executing it.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.949
Tim Cook is a classic, the current CEO of
Apple, is a classic productive obsessive and

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:49.860
he's been in that role at Apple as Jobs' sidekick
for 10 years and now we'll see how the productive

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.300
obsessive can do as the CEO.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.919
There are obsessive's as CEO's of other companies,
but Apple is very much characterized by this

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.539
narcissistic led organization.

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:04.050
There's a third category, by the way, that
will be of interest to people in the room

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.639
because I noticed that the CEO isn't in the
room and that is, unless I'm mistaken then

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:11.979
I apologize Larry.

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:13.550
[laughter]

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.530
His third category it's called erotics, an
erotic is someone who in the Jungian sense

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:24.909
is someone who does feel a need to be loved,
who does not necessarily like to be criticized

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:26.360
and wants approval.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.639
This is an excellent person to have on a team,
not necessarily the person that you want running

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:33.770
the company.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.360
[laughter]

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.230
One of the essential teachings of the modern
business era is that business leaders should

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:46.510
empower their people, they should push decisions
down into the organization, they should give

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:52.050
people the rope to hang themselves and to
execute the strategy of the company.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.540
This is not how Apple does things.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.360
Steve Jobs was a classic micromanager and
the people beneath him micromanaged the people

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.850
beneath them.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.750
No detail is beneath their attention.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.320
I know I mentioned that he was a narcissist
but he also had obsessive characteristics

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320
as well.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.940
And I discussed this with Maccoby by the way,
I asked Maccoby what he was and he said, "Well

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.050
I'm mostly an obsessive but I've got some
narcissistic tendencies to me as well."

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:26.000
And my example of it I discuss in the book
is an exchange that Jobs had with the marketing

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.410
executive whose job it was to send out an
email concurrent with a keynote launch of

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.100
a product.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:39.410
And this person would email Jobs days before
the keynote to say, "Here's the email that

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.980
will go out."

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:46.610
And Jobs would object to the grammar in the
email getting down to the placement of a comma

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:52.710
or a semicolon and they would go back repeatedly
17 times until they got it right.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:59.550
To me this is bizarre behavior but not inconsistent
with the micromanagement that Apple embraces.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:05.680
I believe, by the way, from my conversations
that Jobs' opinion on the placement of the

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.680
comma was wrong --

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.150
[laughter]

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.060
but that doesn't matter and I think that's
obvious.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.700
He obviously was very interested in language
but not a grammarian as we know from the Think

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.600
Different campaign.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.880
[laughter]

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.220
A major part of my book and my research on
Apple is analyzing its secrecy.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.750
I've been able to turn the what was a disadvantage
for me in writing a book about a company that

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:37.770
it's very secretive into a thesis point about
the company.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:44.100
And my line is that every company keeps secrets
but at Apple everything is a secret and Apple

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.570
is particularly good at keeping secrets.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.570
[laughter]

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:53.450
They have a hint of a sense of humor about
secrecy; this is an actual T-shirt that you

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.540
can buy at the company store in Cupertino
which is open to the public, "I visited the

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.840
Apple campus.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.720
But that's all I'm allowed to say."

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.250
[laughter]

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.340
I will say it's the one example of a sense
of humor that I've been able to find at Apple

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.340
--

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.340
[laughter]

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.450
but I'm appreciative of it, very appreciative.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:19.980
There is a sense of a culture of fear at Apple,
I've heard this from many, many employees

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:25.240
and I'll say in anticipation of a question
that I typically get is: who are my sources

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.240
for the book?

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.500
My sources are people typically who worked
at Apple at all levels of the organization,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.950
very senior, very junior, and in between,
and compared with Walter Isaacson's biography

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.860
of Steve Jobs which is very much a view from
the top, I think that the perspective of a

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:47.490
junior person, for example, is very valid
in understanding how a company actually operates.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:54.140
And secrecy is so important at Apple that
people are afraid to deviate from the secrecy.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:00.310
And the hallmark of this is new employee orientation
which is every Monday at Apple, except as

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:05.060
I was told with a straight face when Monday
comes on a holiday.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.450
That the security briefing is part of new
employee orientation and new employees are

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:16.330
told in a very matter of fact way, "Secrecy
is important here, it's worth money and measured

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.600
in the hundreds of millions of dollars from
the benefit that we get when a product is

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:26.560
launched and retribution will be severe is
you breach the rules of secrecy.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.430
Termination obviously, maybe you'll be sued
as well."

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.180
And this is on your first day of work at Apple.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.630
[laughter]

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.520
So why keep secrets?

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.680
The first one is good basic business in my
opinion.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.920
You don't want your competitors knowing what
you're doing, you also don't want customers

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.820
knowing what you're doing until you're good
and ready to tell them.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:51.500
Now this is a debatable topic in the Internet
world and in the Web world and we can discuss

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.940
it with as much time as we have, but Apple's
very clear on the subject.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:01.770
Customers, the world, but customers in particular,
should learn about products the day that they're

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:06.430
released by us and not a moment before then.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.900
And there's good Silicon Valley precedent
on this; other companies have fallen afoul

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:18.610
of the basic rule of if you've got products
on the shelf in retailer's stores and even

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.990
more seriously if you've got product in warehouses,
the last thing you want is customers believing

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.870
that a new version is coming soon because
who's gonna buy a product that's sitting on

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.790
shelves when a new version is coming soon?

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.450
And even Apple hasn't been perfect about this;
quarter before last they acknowledged that

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.820
iPhone 4 sales were hurt because the public
expected an iPhone 5.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.550
They didn't get it, they were very disappointed
about this, they got the iPhone 4S instead

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.480
and it hurt Apple so badly that they went
on to sell 37 million iPhones in the last

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.370
quarter and rang up a $13 billion profit.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:14:00.610
But the quarter before that they did acknowledge
that the rumor mill had had a negative impact.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:06.790
But that's among the reasons anyway for keeping
secrets to outsiders.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:13.220
But what I've realized in studying the company
is that Apple takes internal secrecy as seriously

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.540
as it does external secrecy.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:21.370
And I've likened Apple employees to a horse
fitted with blinders; you don't look left,

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:27.360
you don't look right, you charge forward at
Apple and you don't multi-task by the way.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.600
It has been humbling for me when I came to
realize how focused Apple people are because

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:41.480
I'm a multi-tasker, I'm constantly doing many
things, and at Apple below a certain level

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:49.290
and that level is high you don't do many things,
you tend to do one thing.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.940
I don't know if it's an unintended consequence
but a realization that I had on this topic

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.640
of internal secrecy is that I've been told
over and over and I've come to believe that

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.870
below a certain level again there's very little
politicking at Apple.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.750
And that makes sense because how can you play
politics when you don't have the information

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.140
with which to play politics?

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.160
It is none of your business what I'm doing
[chuckles] and it's none of my business what

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.290
you're doing so what do we have to talk about?

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:25.080
And I skipped over an example on the outside
world; it's my belief from my 15 years in

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.280
Silicon Valley that engineers in particular
love to talk about what they do.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.670
And by the way journalists love to talk about
what we do.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.530
And we keep of course we keep secrets about
what stories we're working on, but we can

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.670
talk ad nauseam about craft and past stories
and whatnot.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:44.620
And my understanding is that this is something
that Silicon Valley engineers enjoy engaging

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.070
in; Apple people are told not to.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:53.600
And I describe in the book someone I know
who plays in a regular poker game with a group

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.450
of Apple people and this person does not work
at Apple and when the subject of Apple comes

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:04.680
up at the poker table the subject is changed.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:12.800
And so I've described Apple not only metaphorically
as the ultimate need-to-know culture but literally

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.990
as the ultimate need-to-know culture.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:20.780
And this manifests itself in interesting linguistic
ways and also in physical ways.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.180
So Apple is a culture of disclosure.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:29.010
I say to you, "Are you disclosed on the following?"
and I have to do a little kabuki if I don't

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.380
know if you're disclosed on it, I can't exactly
say what it is.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.850
But if everyone in a meeting isn't disclosed
then not everyone is welcome at the meeting.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:43.040
And this is true also in a physical sense
and I describe in the book how you'll be working

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.780
and all of a sudden barriers go up, windows
that were clear become frosted, doors that

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:56.080
didn't exist now exist, security badges that
once got you in to a certain area no longer

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.570
get you into the area.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.640
And if you're a typical worker what you know
is that there's a new project underfoot and

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.790
that's all you know.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:08.000
If you knew you're badge would get you into
that area and it doesn't.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.539
And most interestingly to me I've been told
again more than once, people telling me that

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:20.220
their bosses did not have access to the same
areas that they had access to for reasons

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.860
that they didn't necessarily understand.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:30.029
This is an org chart that I created first
in Fortune Magazine in May of last year, it's

00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:33.659
actually highly accurate but you're not expected
to be able to read the fine print from where

00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:34.870
you're sitting.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:41.160
But the key is this, and I like to say that
candidly this was more dramatic when Steve

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.480
Jobs, the Sun King, was at the center and
the planets were revolving around him.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.230
This is in fact how Apple operates but I think
one of the great unknowns is how it will continue

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:55.549
to operate with Cook as the CEO or whoever
follows him.

00:17:55.549 --> 00:18:01.240
But what you can see from this is what you
might expect from Apple an incredibly tight

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:07.390
and an incredibly focused org chart where
the CEO, this ring around the inner circle

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.870
are the vice presidents of Apple and I've
got most but not all of them there.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:18.140
It's a very small number of vice presidents
and the CEO can reach down no more than one

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:24.009
layer to really touch just about everything
that's going on at the company.

00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:27.980
As part of the culture, by the way, you won't
be surprised to learn that org charts are

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.570
frowned up at Apple; Apple doesn't create
and print org charts.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.669
And I was told that people were visibly nervous
having my org chart from Fortune Magazine

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:43.800
on their desks last year.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:50.929
Apple's famous for sweating the details and
the example I give in the book is the packaging

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:59.019
design room where a package designer had hundreds
of prototypes of iPod boxes and their sole

00:18:59.019 --> 00:19:05.529
mission, and Apple teaches this, this case
by the way is an example of attention to detail.

00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:09.610
This person's sole mission was to peel off
that little piece of clear tape that seals

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:15.240
your box and do this over and over and make
sure that the placement was just perfect.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:21.950
Now it sounds silly except, and I won't ask
for a show of hands because it could be incriminating,

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:27.409
but is there anyone in the room who has experienced
the joy of peeling off that piece of tape

00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:33.000
and opening their iPod or iPhone box and taking
the product out and seeing how everything

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.750
is laid perfectly and then taking their device
out and feeling this sense of joy?

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.750
[laughter]

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.419
Okay, I do have smiles and chuckles in the
room, maybe some nervous laughter.

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:49.039
But this is just one example and this pervades
the organization and so you get a sense of

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:54.190
why details are important at Apple.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:58.380
Jobs was famous for saying that he didn't
think that Apple should do customer research

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:04.820
and instead how could customers possibly know
what they wanted when they don't know what

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.250
the product is that we're going to give them,
and we'll give them the products that we think

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.380
they should have.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:15.200
By the way, Jobs especially later in life
like many of us was famous for repeating the

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.620
same lines over and over again and this was
one of his favorites because it resonated

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:25.070
so well because it's exactly the opposite
of how other people, how other companies do

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.820
things.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:32.669
We now know that integration is key to the
Apple's excellence and the integration that

00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:37.410
this typically refers to, and it's something
that Jobs spoke about, was the integration

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.210
of hardware and software.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:45.600
And it's sort of astounding that over the
past 15 years really only Apple has been particularly

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.580
excellent at integrating its own hardware
and software and its competitors have been

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.009
bifurcated in hardware and software.

00:20:53.009 --> 00:20:59.169
But my point is that the whole company is
integrated extremely well, Apple is not whimsical

00:20:59.169 --> 00:21:05.230
as its advertising might suggest but extremely
planned, extremely well organized, things

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:10.990
happen according to a timeline that is written
down, and the various parts of the company

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:16.900
work well together in the past by force of
will because Jobs made sure that people worked

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.480
well together.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.460
But a key to understanding Apple is the importance
of design.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.240
And again Jony Ive has become famous as the
head of industrial design at Apple, but what's

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.470
less well understood is just how important
his seat at the table has been.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:37.960
And you can glean this from the fact that
at Apple it would be inconceivable for say

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:45.500
a financial person to sit in on the same early
product development meeting where Jony Ive

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:50.200
or Jony Ive's people would have a conversation
about what the product would look like.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.410
Steve Jobs, at least initially, would have
been completely uninterested in a finance

00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:02.330
person's opinion of what it might cost to
do that or how we might pay for it or what

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:07.190
kind of revenue we might be able to get from
it; this is antithetical to the Apple way

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.289
of thinking.

00:22:08.289 --> 00:22:15.309
I likened it to a corollary to the personal
maxim of, "Do what you love and the money

00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:16.379
will follow."

00:22:16.379 --> 00:22:22.650
It's a little corny, I have to refine that
but it really does I think express Jobs' approach

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.970
to product was, "First we'll think of the
product, then we'll think of how to make it

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:33.529
beautiful and how to make it really good,
then we'll figure out what the market is for

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:34.529
it."

00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:39.570
And I would submit to you that's not the normal
decision making process at your typical big

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.179
company.

00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:49.149
A hallmark of Apple's entire way of doing
business is the power of saying no, and this

00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:52.919
is across the business and across product
development.

00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:58.090
It says no to industries to get involved in,
to who it will sell to, we know that it's

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:03.249
been famously uninterested in selling to big
businesses over the years, which by the way

00:23:03.249 --> 00:23:04.450
has some history.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.960
Apple got beaten up badly in the 80's selling
to the enterprise and this scarred Jobs, many

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.169
things scarred Jobs including this almost
running out of cash at the beginning.

00:23:14.169 --> 00:23:17.580
I have to tell you that I showed this slide
at Microsoft last week and I --

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.960
[laughter]

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.820
prepared them and I said, "Please don't take
this the wrong way," but I think it's very

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.820
telling.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.110
What you get when you open your box of a PC
that you got at a retailer and what you get

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.620
when you open your iMac box.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.399
I wanna do another slide that focuses more
on the screen because I think it's in the

00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:42.090
book and it's a very important part of Apple's
mentality of saying, "No."

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:47.320
You know what the screen on an iMac looks
like when you turn it on, I need to show what

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:52.559
the screen of a PC looks like especially if
you buy it from a retailer, your screen is

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:56.619
littered with what Jobs referred as, "Crapware."

00:23:56.619 --> 00:24:01.950
And Crapware are these icons from various
vendors that the retailers or the manufacturers

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.759
have done a deal with to goose their margin
a little bit.

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:10.970
I would suggest that it's nothing short of
insulting to the customer to put that on the

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.480
screen and it's something Apple wouldn't dream
of doing.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.510
Apple has faults by the way, but this is something
Apple's very good at.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:24.830
I could go on about the beauty of saying no;
Jobs would say that saying no is more important

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.309
than saying yes.

00:24:26.309 --> 00:24:32.350
This extends to how Apple cooperates or engages
with the rest of the world.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.789
Most companies will send its people out to
events to interact in the hope that there

00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:40.610
might be some intangible benefit from interacting.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.889
Apple even killed the trade show that it was
integral to starting although it was its own,

00:24:45.889 --> 00:24:46.889
Macworld.

00:24:46.889 --> 00:24:51.629
And then I just like showing this fanciful
slide of an Apple executive being in a chair

00:24:51.629 --> 00:24:55.929
at the World Economic Forum in Davos where
I was a few weeks ago.

00:24:55.929 --> 00:25:00.919
It's inconceivable to think of an Apple person
engaging in jawboning and talking about making

00:25:00.919 --> 00:25:03.360
the world a better place in Davos.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.360
[laughter]

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.519
With what's going on I shouldn't say inconceivable,
but it's until now impossible and I think

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:12.240
highly unlikely in the near future.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.889
You will know by the way if you see the CEO
of Apple on stage in Davos that things have

00:25:16.889 --> 00:25:20.570
really changed at Apple.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.159
Apple has this concept of the directly responsible
individual.

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:27.970
It’s one of these things when I first heard
about it, first of all Apple people have been

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:34.070
talking about for years this pre-dates Jobs'
return in 1997, it's not completely clear

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:40.009
to me that it was even language that Jobs
was all that familiar with which magnifies

00:25:40.009 --> 00:25:43.190
its importance to me that it's so important
at Apple.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:48.240
At Apple there will be a list of items on
the agenda for a meeting, for example, and

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:54.740
next to the action item will be a name, that
name is the DRI; the DRI is the one person

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.400
whose job it is to get the job done on that
specific task.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.630
It's so simple, it's so obvious, and yet my
hunch and I'm gonna try to test this with

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.419
business school professors, is that most businesses
don't do it.

00:26:08.419 --> 00:26:11.190
And I know that I, oops, I don't know what
that's about.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:15.950
My Outlook is open, I apologize.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.039
I know there was a period when I was working
on the article at Fortune that I started to

00:26:20.039 --> 00:26:24.860
become obnoxious within my own company by
asking, "Well who's the DRI on that?"

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.429
This was often on the telephone because most
of my colleagues are in New York, but I could

00:26:28.429 --> 00:26:33.950
feel the eyes rolling when I said it.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:38.730
I think it's unique that Apple is a massively
functional organization; this is the corollary

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:45.090
to Jobs' aversion to general management; he
did not want jacks of all trades running businesses

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.570
within the business, he wanted experts.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:51.770
He would brag that Apple employs the best
metallurgists in the world.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:59.210
And this is the case throughout the organization.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:03.610
This is I think one of the most important
and most controversial aspects of how Apple

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:10.059
does business in that in selected instances
it behaves like a start-up.

00:27:10.059 --> 00:27:14.690
Of course Apples is not a start-up, I'm not
so naive as to think that it is; there are

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:19.460
many elements of the company that behave just
like any big business anywhere.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:26.539
But where it's relevant, where Apple decides
that it's going to create something new and

00:27:26.539 --> 00:27:33.700
do something fresh, it manages to hive off
an area and let a relatively small group of

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:38.190
people behave as if they are at a start-up.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:43.490
And I've likened this to a bunch of rich kids
in that they're off in a corner doing their

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:49.539
own thing, but they have a very wealthy parent
funding their research, and in Apple's case

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:56.269
this is a nearly $100 billion balance sheet
funding their research.

00:27:56.269 --> 00:28:01.470
I think by now since I wrote about it last
May it's become well known that Apple thinks

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.940
a lot about the notion of small numbers.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:11.379
The British anthropologist Robin Dunbar referred
to the Dunbar's number as being about 150

00:28:11.379 --> 00:28:17.020
or smaller, that most humans really can't
relate to a group of people much bigger than

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.720
about 150.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.590
He was looking at primates in the wild, by
the way, but he decided that that was applicable

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.440
to humans as well.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.919
And in fact for years Apple has been having
this ultra top secret retreat of about 100

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:36.010
people whom Jobs characterized as the people
he would want to take with him if he were

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:40.690
to leave Apple, the 100 or so most important
people.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.450
Very interestingly to me, by the way, this
was not a rank thing with Jobs it was not

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.730
a status thing it was who he literally thought
were the most important people, not necessarily

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.299
by title.

00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:57.960
The stories about the top 100 are legendary
and typical Apple; Jobs would require everybody

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.840
attending the meeting to be bussed down to
the Santa Cruz or Monterey area in a bus from

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.059
Cupertino.

00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:10.450
And I had this image of certain senior executives
who had attained great wealth being forced

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:15.019
to get on a bus and drive for an hour and
a half or a couple of hours because the boss

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:17.369
didn't want them driving their own car.

00:29:17.369 --> 00:29:22.980
He would sweep the room for bugs beforehand,
legitimately paranoid that the competition

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.470
might try to find out the secrets that were
going to be revealed at a top 100 meeting.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:33.489
And indeed products for the next 18 months
or so have been revealed at top 100 meetings.

00:29:33.489 --> 00:29:39.179
Given how secretive Apple is Jobs thought
that it was important for a slightly larger

00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:45.700
group than the 10 or so person executive team
to be exposed to what was coming down the

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.700
pike.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.170
The rest of the company was not invited to
the meeting and would not be exposed.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:57.480
One of the fascinating elements of this secrecy
that I've learned, the sales people at Apple

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:03.350
are particularly frustrated because they don't
find out about what's going on at the company

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.960
in terms of new products any sooner than the
rest of us do.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.610
And if you think about again how different
that is from any normal company which obviously

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:17.489
wants to prep the sales force so they can
sell the product that's coming.

00:30:17.489 --> 00:30:23.289
On the subject of exclusion, I'm also told
that Apple people to this day will gather

00:30:23.289 --> 00:30:29.890
in a cafeteria to watch a closed circuit television
broadcast of the major keynotes whether it's

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:36.429
at Moscone or on their own campus because,
and I think this is so interesting, they’re

00:30:36.429 --> 00:30:40.409
learning about the product that's being revealed
for the very first time at the same time the

00:30:40.409 --> 00:30:43.169
public is, at the same time journalists are.

00:30:43.169 --> 00:30:48.070
This includes people who worked on the product
because they typically will only have seen

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:55.690
the feature or the part of the feature that
they worked on.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:02.519
Apple's marketing I think it's fair to say
is brilliant; one of the premises of the marketing

00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:05.029
at Apple is staying on the script.

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:09.200
I hope I'm not gushing too much and suggesting
that “1,000 songs in your pocket” is one

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.580
of the more brilliant marketing lines in the
history of consumer electronics marketing.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:22.159
Obviously MP3 players existed before the existing,
the incumbent's stressed storage capacity

00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:27.710
of their devices, Apple did talk about storage
capacity in terms of pricing, but “1,000

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:32.549
songs in your pocket”, who can't understand
that and who can't repeat it over and over?

00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:37.259
And that's another important that you'd think
would be normal in business but I think Apple

00:31:37.259 --> 00:31:38.840
does it better than most.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:45.109
I've described how first of all very few people
at Apple are allowed to speak publicly; it's

00:31:45.109 --> 00:31:51.919
a discreet, finite number that is defined
in preparation for a product launch and the

00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:57.570
language that they will use is preapproved
and agreed upon.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:02.710
And so I quote an executive who was approved
on the iPhone who explained to me in giving

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:09.289
speeches on my book I can understand the mentality
that when you give this message over and over

00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:14.309
the intellectual or human tendency is to change
up your delivery because that's how you keep

00:32:14.309 --> 00:32:16.220
yourself entertained.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:23.139
But he said, "No when you're pitching an Apple
product you deliver it over and over exactly

00:32:23.139 --> 00:32:25.059
the way we agreed it was gonna be delivered.

00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:26.059
Why?

00:32:26.059 --> 00:32:30.039
Well because the listener's hearing it for
the first time and what we want is for the

00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:35.100
listener to repeat it to their friends and
for their friends to start repeating it and

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:41.019
pretty soon it's being repeated back in the
marketplace exactly the way we wrote it."

00:32:41.019 --> 00:32:46.379
And it's a very pure and very understandable
approach when you think about it that way,

00:32:46.379 --> 00:32:50.659
but requires a ton of discipline.

00:32:50.659 --> 00:32:57.049
Sometimes I've described Apple as a company
of paradoxes because on the one hand Apple

00:32:57.049 --> 00:33:01.960
is described to me, Apple people describe
Apple as being resource constrained.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.100
I came to understand what they're really referring
to is people; it's very difficult to get enough

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.549
of the right people on a project.

00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:13.200
But when Apple decides to make a product or
market a product they will spend whatever

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.399
it takes for seemingly trivial expenditures.

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:25.700
And so the story I tell in the book is of
Jobs' desire to illustrate iMovie HD in 2005,

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.200
the first launch of the high def version of
iMovie.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:36.260
And there weren't a lot of HD cameras or HD
televisions in the marketplace at the time

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:42.330
so he decided they should do a wedding because
he knew that people used iMovie to shoot weddings.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:46.720
So they shot a wedding, it was an Apple employee;
it was a beautiful, elegant affair at the

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.149
Officers Club at the Presidio in San Francisco.

00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:54.480
Only when Jobs decided his opinion was it
was too elegant, it was too stuffy and he

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.990
said, "I want a beach, I want feet in the
sand, I want a tropical setting, Hawaii would

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.990
be good."

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.919
He was fond of Hawaii.

00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:07.129
This was three weeks before Macworld.

00:34:07.129 --> 00:34:11.030
And to make a long story short, finding a
beautiful actress who was getting married

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:17.061
on Maui right before New Years', the team
got its image at tremendous expense and the

00:34:17.061 --> 00:34:22.830
expense was really irrelevant; this was for
a 30 second or so clip at Macworld; they were

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:33.340
able to show iMovie HD in beautiful, emotional
terms; the money wasn't what mattered.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:40.220
So just to drive home the point, this is a
replica of an actual wall in a marketing building

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:45.030
at Apple; if you're in this marketing group
after you go in the door in the morning you

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:51.419
walk around this wall every single day on
your way to work to remind you what your approach

00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:54.220
to marketing should be at Apple.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.980
Only this isn't exactly how the wall appears,
this is.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:04.470
Apple has an interesting relationship with
the press and that includes me and I think

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:09.400
there's a profound business point here; there's
only one subject generally that Apple views

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.090
worthy of it discussing publicly and that's
its products; doesn't wanna talk about how

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.740
it does business which is the subject of my
book, it doesn't wanna by and large with the

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.540
exception of Steve Jobs it doesn't wanna talk
about personalities, it doesn't wanna get

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:28.380
involved in lifestyle issues of Apple, of
Apple people, and so on.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.660
So it keeps the press at arm's length with
two kind of amusing exceptions and that's

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.600
David Pogue at the New York Times and Walt
Mossberg at the Wall Street Journal.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.800
Apple will go to great lengths to keep the
two of them happy and I encourage you to read

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.900
the section in my book where I discuss that.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:51.430
Apple also, by the way, is very tuned into
the importance of celebrity and that celebrities

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.520
play an important role in your image.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.810
And I describe in the book the day that Harry
Connick, Jr. emailed Steve Jobs because he

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:04.330
had a problem with his monitor and this is
called an escalation.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:09.750
Jobs emailed Cook, Cook emailed a senior executive
in the supply chain organization who emailed

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:14.900
a junior executive in the supply chain organization,
who got Harry Connick, Jr. his new monitor

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.870
in a matter of a half hour or so.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.540
[laughter]

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.470
And my very last point, and this can sort
of serve as a jumping off point to discuss

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:32.240
the future of Apple, one of these paradoxes
about Apple is that it behaves in quite an

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:37.380
entrepreneurial way and the risks it's taken
and the new products it's come out with in

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:44.350
the last 15 years have been a triumph of entrepreneurialism
I would suggest.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:49.570
However, one of the sort of glaring realizations
I made toward the end of writing the book

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:57.490
is that really the great entrepreneur at Apple
was Steve Jobs and in fact his family listed

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:01.810
entrepreneur on his death certificate.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:07.220
The most important remaining members of the
executive team are not entrepreneurs.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.760
I mean Tim Cook bled IBM Blue for gosh sakes
for the first 10 plus years of his career.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.710
He loves Apple but he's not an entrepreneur.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:20.860
Scott Forstall who runs the mobile software
has only worked for two companies in his career

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.380
and both of them were headed by Steve Jobs;
the first was NeXT.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:29.670
Jony Ive has been quoted publicly saying that
when he ran his own design consultancy in

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.640
London it was called Tangerine, and I think
it's really interesting that the two great

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.670
companies of his career are Tangerine and
Apple.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:38.780
[laughter]

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.680
Commented that he didn't really care for the
business aspect of running Tangerine, he wanted

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.220
to design and boy has he done a great job
of designing.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.220
[chuckles]

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:52.840
But I leave you to think about what will be
the meaning of an Apple that isn't led by

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.830
someone who identifies as an entrepreneur.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:02.610
I invite you to look at my brand new Website
and as well as I put my Twitter handle up

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:07.320
there and I would love to see some engagement
on my Google+ profile as well and I'm happy

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.970
to do that with you and to take your questions
for 15 minutes.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:11.970
There's a mic right there.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.840
So thank you very much.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.310
[applause]

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:19.710
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hello.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.910
Hey Adam thanks a lot for the talk.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:27.030
So I actually have two questions: one question
is like on your second slide you mentioned

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:32.800
like everything Apple did is like quite contradict
to what we learned in business school, so

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.330
does this mean like, I don’t think, like,
people, me, like what we learned in business

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:42.339
school is wrong or like Apple is just like
absolutely by chance it's a great success,

00:38:42.339 --> 00:38:49.950
so what things we can learn from the success
of Apple from both like say in academia or

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.780
in business world so what thing we can really
take from Apple?

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.860
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Sure.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:39:02.310
So, thank you, so first of all I think that
I am saying that in Apple's opinion some of

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:06.830
the things that you learn in business school
are in fact wrong.

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:12.080
But I'm not suggesting that that's an absolute,
and I think that companies and people have

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:18.090
to go down the list and consider each one
and say, "Is this something that my company

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:22.050
or that I can emulate at Apple or is this
something that's unique to Apple?"

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:26.920
And I'll give you one example of one of these
teachings that I think that all companies

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920
can think about.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.070
I mean some companies have to be revenue optimizers
that's just the way they're set up, they've

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:38.190
gotta think about cash flow because maybe
that's their best bet, but other companies

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:42.380
can take an approach that thinking about the
revenue first is the wrong way.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:49.260
I also think that there isn't a company out
there of any size and in any industry that

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:54.610
can't ask itself the question, "Are we saying
no often enough?

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.370
Have we said no in each instance where it
might have made sense to say no instead of

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.470
yes?

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.770
That's one example I think.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:02.860
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.860
Thank you.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:07.850
One more question about like how I remember
you have one slide about the integration.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:13.020
So we know like Apple is, uh…very few company
that like do everything in a single chain

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:18.670
within one company for example from the design,
manufacture, operating system, and retail,

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.670
and marketing.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:24.040
So what's the reason do you think like they
did a great job in operation and management

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.451
for like integrate every parts like become
a world leader not only in every area but

00:40:29.451 --> 00:40:31.050
also integrate very well in every part?

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.480
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: So I'll give you, I'm gonna
give you two answers and the first one is

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.530
sort of cynical and is the conventional wisdom.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:41.070
The answer to your first question, why are
they so good at integrating?

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.490
You can answer in two words: Steve Jobs.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:49.850
And there's a very strong current of thought
within Apple including people who believe

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:54.470
that the company will not fare well going
forward that he was completely responsible

00:40:54.470 --> 00:41:00.070
for this integration through sheer force of
brutal will and that that will be far more

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.470
difficult after he's gone, with him gone.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:09.420
And then the more hopeful response is that
he developed a system where the culture of

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:15.350
the company includes this integration run
by the executive team and the CEO and that

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.550
this is a process at Apple.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:23.990
And I think this is, this will be one of the
great questions of the next call it five years

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:28.220
that will be answered: will they be able to
integrate as well without him or not?

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.220
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thanks.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.560
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Thank you.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.750
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hi, I had a question about Pixar.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:40.510
I wonder if you got any chance to compare
the way Apple as a corporation is run compared

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.700
to Pixar which is also I guess like Steve
Jobs' --

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.700
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Sure.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:44.700
&gt;&gt;male #2: step child.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.350
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: So relatively little, I
mean I read a very fine book called The Pixar

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:57.350
Touch by David Price which is a great history
of the company, very precise in terms of going

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:03.120
over what happened for Pixar to become Pixar,
including the fact that when Jobs bought Pixar

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.810
the Pixar assets from George Lucas neither
he nor anyone else had any clue that it was

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:12.140
gonna be an important feature film company
down the road; that was an accident which

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.740
he absolutely deserves credit for recognizing.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:21.070
But I didn't study Pixar for my book and this
question has come up so my only observation

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:26.990
would be that Jobs was never the day-to-day
CEO of, number one of Pixar, he was the CEO

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:30.720
for a time but he never spent all his time
there.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:37.880
And number two the culture of Pixar for the
culture of Pixar, Ed Catmull and John Lasseter

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.070
are extremely important to the way the company
operates and the way the company thinks in

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:48.050
the way that Jobs was for the '97 to '11 period
at Apple.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.670
But that's as deeply as I can go on Pixar.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.800
&gt;&gt;male #2: Okay, thanks

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.390
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Thanks.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.000
&gt;&gt;male #3: So this might be a controversial
question --

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.030
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Good.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:02.390
&gt;&gt;male #3: if you look at the top management
of Apple it's glaring that it's only white

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:03.390
male.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:07.920
And unlike other beta companies there are
no Indians and no Chinese, there are no women,

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.110
there are no African Americans, no one.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:15.710
Is it part of the culture of secrecy that
intends a white male to become a top of top

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.460
manager versus --

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:23.820
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: I understand your question;
all I can tell you is that I haven't had that

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:31.480
question before which suggests to me only
that it's not a top of mind conversation at

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480
Apple.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.850
I have had the question about the paucity
of female executives, there are no female

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:42.560
executives on the executive team, there are
quite a handful in the vice president level,

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.970
but I don't know how that would compare statistically,
I actually think it would compare probably

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:52.250
comparably to statistics in corporate America,
but obviously not the college graduate education

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.270
by any means.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.320
So I'll just give you, so I don't have anything
great to say about it.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:04.990
I'll give you a tangential point that I make
in the book and this is in contrast as I understand

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:13.930
it to Google, Apple is a headquarters centric,
face-to-face meeting oriented company where

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:20.790
meetings happen with people looking at each
other not over teleconference or video conference;

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:24.690
people travel but they come back to Cupertino
for the important meetings.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:36.130
So now I'm theorizing, if a face-to-face headquarters
culture engenders homogeneity that may be

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:41.150
your answer, but I'm not gonna state it in
any sort of declarative way 'cause it's neither

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:44.450
something that I've studied nor have a strong
opinion on.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:49.420
&gt;&gt;male #4: Thanks for all the fascinating
insights, when are you gonna do your book

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.420
on Google?

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.420
[laughter]

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.510
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Well two very fine writers
Ken Auletta and Steven Levy have written Google

00:44:55.510 --> 00:45:01.920
books in recent memory, so I'll let their
insights die down before I consider the fresh

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.920
insights.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.920
&gt;&gt;male #4: That was actually my joke questions.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.920
But --

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.920
[laughter]

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.920
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Oh.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.920
[laughter]

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.920
&gt;&gt;male #4: this could be serious, but --

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: I have other reasons why
that's not gonna be my next book.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.820
&gt;&gt;male #4: we're all Googlers here but from
your non-Googlers perspective how would you

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.850
compare and contrast Google versus Apple?

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:22.570
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Well culturally I've described
the companies as the opposites in almost every

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.060
single way so from a --

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.320
[laughter]

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:33.300
cultural perspective as stated by its own
beliefs and I believe practices, Google believes

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.650
in openness, Apple does not [chuckles].

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:48.550
Google is predicated on the World Wide Web
and ancillary technologies, Apple is not.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:52.300
There is a subtle similarity I believe in
the way I've heard Larry and Sergey describe

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:59.670
the graduate school environment of bitter
arguments over substantive issues in getting

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.720
to the best answer.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.200
That also characterizes Apple and I quote
somebody in the book saying, "You bring your

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:12.690
arguments about product, you bring your data
about product into an argument at Apple and

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.090
if you're data is the best thing for the product
you win."

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:19.130
It's not a beauty contest in that regard or
a popularity contest.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:23.360
So I would say those two are similar but where
the debate happens, I think the debate is

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:31.260
a much more senior level closed debate at
Apple and a broader, more inclusive debate

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.700
at Google.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:37.441
And then there's this fundamental product
difference in orientation and I describe it

00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:43.130
in the book and I came to realize that this
description of Google was based on a blog

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:48.380
post that a departing engineer wrote about
how Google would make, or how Google did make

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:54.330
decisions about color pallets for example
on a webpage, which was to try several shades

00:46:54.330 --> 00:47:00.360
of blue for example and then analyze the click
through rates on a million clicks on google.com

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.860
to choose the right shade.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:07.981
And I believe this person was expressing frustration
but I'm not gonna criticize that because I

00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:13.290
think it is a fundamental difference and an
important way, an important aspect of decision

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.040
making at Google.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.490
And at Apple over the last 15 years the way
the color pallet decision was made is that

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:24.260
people would show Steve Jobs various shades
of blue and he would choose the one --

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.260
[laughter]

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.360
that he thought was right.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.110
Very, very different and we could go on for
three hours on the differences.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:32.570
Thank you.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:38.720
&gt;&gt;male #5: So I saw earlier that you don't
use a Mac, are there any Apple products that

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.950
you do use and were there any that you started
to use after you wrote the book that you didn't

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:44.950
before?

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:45.950
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: I'm ready for this one.

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:46.950
[laughter]

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:52.470
First of all I do use a Mac, I'm just not
using one today and I will have this presentation

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:58.370
in Keynote, I just don't have it yet in Keynote,
long story, details aren't interesting, the

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.880
details are not interesting.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.911
Yeah, I have an iMac at home, I have an iPhone
that's turned off sitting over here, I have

00:48:05.911 --> 00:48:13.370
an iPad, I have an iPod and in fact, and I'll
tell ya I have no problem telling you the

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:17.590
thing that keeps me with a PC is Outlook.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:21.320
Being a journalist the information's very
important to me and my Outlook is extremely

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:28.700
important to me and everyone criticizes Outlook
on the Mac as being an inferior product and

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.600
so I'm scared to go over to it full time.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.100
But however, there's a serious point here
and I make it toward the end of the book which

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:43.050
is that when I joined Fortune, actually Fortune
editorial is a Mac shop and the business side

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:48.370
is a PC shop and I insisted on having a PC,
this was 10 plus years ago because I was not

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:53.501
a Mac guy and I didn't wanna go through the
pain of shifting to a Mac; 10 years ago it

00:48:53.501 --> 00:48:56.170
was a lot harder than it is now.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:03.150
And over the years I've started using Mac
products, starting with iTunes and iPod and

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:11.720
so on, and I maintain that the reason Apple
is a $400 billion plus company today, it's

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.860
great success, is because of people like me
not because of the enthusiasts who were gonna

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.280
buy Apple products no matter what.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.040
This is their great success is in selling
me stuff.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.490
&gt;&gt;male #5: I have one other question: now
you say that Apple, I mean you can't be like

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:33.050
Apple, but who do you see as the next Apple,
and I don't mean the next Apple --

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:34.050
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Yeah.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:38.360
&gt;&gt;male #5: trying to be like Apple, but being
as wildly successful doing things their own

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.590
way, is there anyone on the horizon?

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:46.700
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Well we could make up a
list of startups which I'm loath to do because

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.850
I think it's too risky and you end up looking
foolish talking about startups that could

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:58.950
be like Apple or doing things their own way
because they might be gone soon, although

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.960
I do get into this in the book, I have some
fun examples about how --

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.420
&gt;&gt;male #5: Sounds like I should buy the book.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.650
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: I would hope so yeah.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:05.650
[laughter]

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:06.901
I would wish you would buy five, but --

00:50:06.901 --> 00:50:07.980
[laughter]

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:13.850
I'll give quick examples and then I'll answer
your question.

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:17.770
Ness Labs is very interesting run by an ex-Apple
executive and they are certainly doing some

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:19.490
very Apple-like things.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:25.070
So is Tesla, its showroom strategy is not
like Apple retail, it is Apple retail and

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:28.660
it's run by an ex-Apple retail guy.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:34.530
And I think the big company right now that
has the most similar characteristics to Apple

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:37.830
is Amazon.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:44.280
I could list a bunch of things, the thing
that is most similar is the way Amazon truly

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:50.590
does not give a damn about what people think
of its short term strategy; Amazon is very

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:55.490
invested in the long term and I didn't say
it out loud today but Apple's a very long=term

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:56.490
oriented company.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:57.960
Thanks, yeah.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:04.810
&gt;&gt;female #1: From your research and experience
what makes Apple employees happy and what

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.460
makes them stay in the company?

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.420
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Thank you.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:13.400
There was a period in my reporting, in particular
for the magazine article, where I would go

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.840
and ask people, "Are Apple employees happy?"

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:23.910
And the standard response would be, "Apple
people tend to buy into the mission of the

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:24.910
company."

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.230
And I'd say, "Yes, but are they happy?"

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:27.230
[laughter]

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:31.720
And the response would be, "People take great
pride at Apple" [laughs]

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.720
[laughter]

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.200
in seeing their products used all over the
place," and so on.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:46.391
And so I think it's not trivial or an understatement
to say that it helps, everyone want to be

00:51:46.391 --> 00:51:51.860
on a winning team and you're willing to overlook
quite a bit to be on that winning team.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:58.160
And I am not, I don't wanna suggest that Apple
is a joyless place because some people have

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:05.000
drawn that conclusion from some of the stuff
in my book about Apple as a workplace, but

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:12.020
I think it's fair to say that joy and fun
is not at the top of the list.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:16.780
And I think again now trying to be non-judgmental
about this there's a certain purity about

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:23.490
this from a shareholder perspective or from
a customer perspective, would I settle for

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:29.270
a little bit less in ease of use, for example,
in exchange for a little more joy from the

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:30.270
workforce?

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:31.270
[laughter]

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:32.270
I don't know.

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:34.710
Should I take one more Bernadette or am I
done?

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:35.710
One more please.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:36.710
Yeah.

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.590
&gt;&gt;male #6: Sorry I don't have a chance to
get over to the microphone.

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:44.680
Would you say that Apple's experience with
Foxconn in China is a result of their corporate

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:49.960
strategies and focus and the like or is that
sort of anomalous having to do with labor

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:55.010
conditions in general in China, does it come
from Apple or is Apple just sort of a semi-willing

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:56.010
participant.

00:52:56.010 --> 00:53:02.630
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: So the question is, is Apple's
experience at Foxconn in China, essentially

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:08.220
I'll recraft your question, is it exceptional,
is it different from the industry?

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:13.540
And I have not gone deep on this topic so
my superficial understanding first of all

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:21.940
is that no their experiences in China are
similar to everybody else's experiences.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:28.040
And if anything, and I am neither excusing
them nor criticizing them for what goes on

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:35.830
in China, but am observing that Apple culturally
is unused to being the top dog; they're unused

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:41.120
to the scrutiny of being number one; they
identify with being the underdog, so I think

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.090
they were shocked that they were being singled
out.

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:48.110
We'll find out if they're better or worse
than everybody else but I think if you look

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:53.310
at the New York Times' article that has put
this back on the agenda or has elevated this

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:59.360
on the agenda, the Times went to great length
to suggest that the article that it did on

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:04.780
the situation at Foxconn could have been written
about any of the big consumer electronics

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:10.650
manufacturers who used contract manufacturers
in China, which is all of them.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:19.260
And you saw today that Apple has hired a third
party auditor to audit themselves again and

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.401
so we'll see how that goes.

00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:21.401
&gt;&gt;Bernadette: Thank you so much Adam.

00:54:21.401 --> 00:54:22.401
Please again join me in thanking Adam for
coming.

00:54:22.401 --> 00:54:23.401
[applause]

00:54:23.401 --> 00:54:24.401
&gt;&gt;Adam Lashinsky: Thank you.

00:54:24.401 --> 00:54:24.402
[applause]
