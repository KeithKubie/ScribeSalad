00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:19.680
[ Pause ]

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.980
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Good afternoon.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.280
My name is Roberta Shaffer,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.330
and I have the absolute
pleasure every day serving

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.850
as the 24th Law Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.320
At one time in my career I also had

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.600
under my wing this
phenomenal facility,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.080
the National Audiovisual
Conservation Center,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.640
also known as the Packard Campus,
and so it is indeed a pleasure

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.660
to be back here in Culpeper,
Virginia doing a joint program

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.000
with the Culpeper Packard Campus
and The Library of Congress,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.800
the Law Library of Congress, and
we are located on Capitol Hill,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.660
the main location of the
Library in Washington,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.600
D.C. So this afternoon we are
celebrating 50 years of Miranda,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.220
and actually the basic principle

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.690
of discouraging self-incrimination
is first found in history

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.420
in the 13th Century cited
by Moses Maimonides,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.910
who talked about the fact that
you should not force someone

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.750
to be a witness against them self.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.650
And we see that in American
law, it traveled through many,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.570
many Supreme Court and lower
Court and State Court decisions,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.290
looking at how to ensure that
national values would be guaranteed

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.920
in the police interrogation
aspect of criminal investigation.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.170 position:56%
So after many judicial cases Miranda
and its older sibling, Escobedo,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.440
finally reversed an 1897 case
where someone had been charged

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.070
with a crime based on their
confession that we believe many,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.370
many decades later
might have been coerced.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.530
But actually over the
course of the 50 years

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.610
since Miranda has been decided we
have learned our constitutional

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.500
catechism in American
society through film

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.130
and TV portrayal of
the Miranda warnings.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.160
And so it is today one of
the most well-known cases

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.860
by the American public.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.900
Even if they don't know it by
name I think most school children

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.680
who have watched television and
film and certainly most people

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.580
in this room probably
could be qualified

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.550
to give some form of
the Miranda warnings.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.970
And the reason I say some form is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.600 position:56%
because there also have been several
cases following the 1966 decision

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.740
that have reinterpreted, redefined

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.670
or in essence changed
perhaps the original debate

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.070 position:56%
that Miranda was involved in, and
that being part of the court looking

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.430
at not wanting to - and excuse
my pun - handcuff the police

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.280
and allow someone who might
have been guilty to go free.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.040
And on the other side people who
on the court who were concerned

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.820
that confession in general was
not the best way to prove guilt

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.150
or innocence in a criminal
proceeding.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.470
So here we are today
and we are privileged

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.290
to have Professor Jessica
Silbey with us.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.670
She flew in from Boston this
morning, she's flying home tonight.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.810 position:56%
She's teaching a course this summer,
so she truly is a wonder woman,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.910
not only in her incredible
intellect,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.240
but in just her physical stamina.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.290
And we are privileged
because this is an area

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.280
that she has expertise in,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.860
the law as it is reflected
in film and in media.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.450
So I'm very anxious to
hear what she has to say

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.450
and I know all of you are, as well.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.680
Before we do that, however, Rob
Stone, who is our Film Curator here

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.150
at the Packard Campus, has compiled
some clips that he will walk us

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.530
through to sort of warm us up
to how Miranda at least plays

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.560
out in the media, and
to please realize

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.590
that in most interrogations
rooms there is no lovely music

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.990
or high visual in the background,
and in fact that may be some

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.340
of the concerns about how Miranda
has been enforced in these 50 years

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.630
since it was first decided
by the Supreme Court.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.860
Before turning the podium over to
Rob, however, I must give a shout

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.710
out to Tom Leighton
and to Thomson Reuters,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.550
who have very generously
underwritten the Law Library's

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.520
full-year commemoration
of the Miranda decision,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.400
so they are sponsoring the event
that we have had here today,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.810
they sponsored the event that we
had a few weeks ago on Law Day,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.400
and they will sponsor
our connection of Miranda

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.000
to Human Rights Day in December.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.530 position:56%
So thank you, Tom, and Thomson
Reuters for joining us in this very,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.810
very important marking of a Supreme
Court decision and of American law.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.900
Rob, if you'll come to the podium?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.530
We will have question-and-answer

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.910
after Professor Silbey's
formal presentation

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.220
and so please keep your
questions until then,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.800
I think there'll be adequate time.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.220
And thank you for being here today.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.030
Rob?

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.330
&gt;&gt; Robert Stone: Good afternoon.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.880
In putting together a montage,
which is always hard to do

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.560
because you have to find a
word or two here or there,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.760
I discovered a few things about
how Miranda rights are portrayed

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.360
in films and how they
are used or not used.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.270
You know, some television
shows barely allude to it,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.750
other television shows every
week you're hearing something.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.200 position:56%
The way it has evolved on television
is the first clip you're going

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.960
to see is going to be Dragnet's
1967, it was called Dragnet 1967

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.760
because it ran the '66-'67 year.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.190
It's going to be the Big LSD
is the name of the episode.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.070
It was the very first
episode in September of '66

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.410
that Dragnet put together, and Jack
Webb was insistent upon once the

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.150
court decision was made
that he wanted to see

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.260
at least his perception
of the reading

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.710
of rights verbatim on screen.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.100
So that's the first thing
you're going to see,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.400
which a bit to his
credit he continued to do

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.460
that throughout both
Dragnet and Adam 12.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.460
You pretty much when they arrested
somebody you heard pretty much the

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.660
entire reading of someone's rights.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.320
Very quickly it went away from that
to you'd start to hear, you know,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.500
you did start to say the
beginning part - you have the right

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.720
to remain silent - and then
you'd kind of find away

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.310
because very quickly people
knew what they were saying

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.410
so they didn't have to put
it all on the screen for you

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.580
to know what was happening.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.980
Then it progressed even further
from that to read him his rights.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.470
And then you've gone to a lot of
shows, they arrest the person,

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.680
they just assume that you know that
they've been read their rights.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.190
And then it gets to the point
to where they don't even say,

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.550
have you read them their rights,
have they been Mirandized?

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.880
So, you know, with a single
word people are supposed

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.990
to understand everything.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.730
So some of the clips I'm going
to show you are those illusions.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.430
There's like a promo for a show
and a clip from The Good Wife

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.880
that are those kind of, you know,
you're kind of getting it read

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.930
to people, but not totally.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:31.740
But then most of the other clips I
chose to use for this clip show are

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.610
of the more humorous nature because
where we started with Jack Webb

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.820
with the whole thing being read
to now we kind of allude to it,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.230
it's really the whole reading
somebody their rights is used

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.150
in the humorous way
probably most often nowadays.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:57.480
And we can judge whether or
not that's a wise thing or not,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.860
but that's pretty much, most
movies if they're going to talk

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:08.150
about Miranda they're going to
take kind of a humorous look at it.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.110
So a lot of the clips
today are humorous,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.460
that's kind of intentional.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.830
But I think you'll notice the
guy that's the very last clip,

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:23.140
he's probably the, at least
his character was the champion

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.030
for not reading anybody any
rights much less anything else.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.420
But, anyhow, they're short clips
so I think you'll enjoy them,

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:37.680
and then after I'm done Dr. Silbey
will be here to talk seriously

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.780
about the subject, so enjoy.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.230
&gt;&gt; Pool boy.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.960
&gt;&gt; What do you think,
Joe, cartwheels?

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.260
&gt;&gt; Sugar cubes.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.560
I'll make you a book,
he's been dropping

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.860
that acid we've been hearing about.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.470 position:56%
All right, son, you're under arrest.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.520
It's our duty to advise you
of your constitutional rights.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.260
You have the right to remain silent

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.110
and any statements you make may be
used against you in a court of law.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.000
You have the right to the
presence of an attorney.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.680 position:56%
If you cannot afford one, one will
be appointed before any questioning.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.980
Do you understand that?

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.280
&gt;&gt; There I am.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.580
I'm over there.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.940
I'm not here anymore.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.140
My hair is green and I'm a tree.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.080
&gt;&gt; You ever see anybody
this torn up?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.240
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a cinch he's
not strung out on sugar cubes.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.730
&gt;&gt; If you can't afford
an attorney ...

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.410
&gt;&gt; You know I ain't
got no shirt to wear.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.100
&gt;&gt; ... one of these people
will be appointed for you.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.130
&gt;&gt; The blouse makes it weird.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.430
&gt;&gt; No.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.730
&gt;&gt; Good luck.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.030
&gt;&gt; Benched.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.630
It's Tuesday, October
28th, from USA.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:45.030
&gt;&gt; The Department was forced to
drop the charges because you forgot

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:58.740
to read him his Miranda rights.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:06.390
What possible reason is there for
not doing the only thing you have

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.440
to do when arresting someone?

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.070
&gt;&gt; I didn't read him his rights?

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.370
I did a version of that.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:25.980
&gt;&gt; Do you even know
the Miranda rights?

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.580
&gt;&gt; Let's hear them then?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.410
&gt;&gt; Wait, we've got a
lot of stuff to do.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.710
&gt;&gt; Go ahead?

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.010
You have time.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.310
&gt;&gt; I think I can probably
push it back.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.590
&gt;&gt; Go ahead, its four
declamatory sentences followed

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.660
by a question, a total of 57 words.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:47.950
&gt;&gt; Okay, it's, like it obviously
starts with you have the right

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.340
to remain silent, and - and then I
think it sounds something like ...

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.870
&gt;&gt; You have the right
to an attorney.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:59.760
&gt;&gt; Oh, right - you have the
right to remain - an attorney.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:07.090
&gt;&gt; Did you say that you have

used - what's the next part?

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.180

&gt;&gt; You have the right
to remain silent.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.320
You have the right to
speak to an attorney.

&gt;&gt; Now - anything you say
can be used against you.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.920
&gt;&gt; I was coming to that.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.220
&gt;&gt; But that comes before
the attorney.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.520
&gt;&gt; What do you mean ...

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.820

remain silent bit and then ...

&gt;&gt; In a court of law.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.320
&gt;&gt; And then you got
the whole attorney bit

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.620
and then the bit about ...

You're supposed to say I have

Nobody said I have the

heard of the Fourth Amendment?

What I'm saying is
that man had rights.

about that man's rights.

So, hi. I'm Jessica Silbey, and I'm
really, really pleased to be here.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.120
I'm very, very grateful
for the invitation

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.340
from Lea [Assumed Spelling]
and Roberta and from the folks

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.090
at the Law Library and for this
wonderful tour that we just had

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.950
of the backstage of
the archives here.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.660
I have a background, I'm a
Lawyer and a Law Professor,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.600
but I also have a Ph.D. in
Comparative Literature and Film

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.140
and that's where I started
my academic life in a Film

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.320 position:56%
and Literature Department thinking a
lot about the relationships actually

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:38.950 position:56%
between film and literature and law,
all forms of authoritative culture,

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.740
and trying to piece
those parts together.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.780
And so this is like
heaven to me, all of this,

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.080
this is really wonderful.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.460
So what I'm going to talk to you
today about is the relationship

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.430
or the shaping of culture
and law together.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:15:00.170 position:56%
I was, when I started my Ph.D., and
continue to be very, very interested

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.010
in how popular consciousness,
legal consciousness is shaped

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.680
by popular art forms, such as film,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.250 position:56%
and the fact of that shaping I think
should be pretty obvious to people.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.050
So just colloquially we say,
for example, that too much TV

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.400
or videogames is bad
for kids, for example.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.700
Why do we say that?

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.520
Because in the main we
think it teaches children

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.920
to like fast-food rather
than healthy snacks,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.320
to be beautiful instead of kind
and curious, to consume rather

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.570 position:56%
than to make, maybe to hold
weapons rather than to build robots.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.340
Not all popular culture
is negative, obviously.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.900
It's not homogenous either.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.830
But it successfully constitutes
communities of people and thought.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.160
All forms of popular culture,
television, film, music,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.440
they all help form us and
bind us as communities insofar

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.600
as we're both consumers and
admirers of that culture.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.020
And so I started wondering as a
student and as a scholar what kind

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.800
of community does legal
popular culture create?

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.200
If we're to look at
mainstream films or television

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.760
about law what do they
tell us about how law is

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.660
or should be in our society?

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.310
How do they construct
our expectations

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.140
about the American justice system?

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.540
So I'm going to explore
this question with you

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.990
and trace a history of law in film.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:24.640
The development, particularly,
of the trial film genre

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.330
from cinema's inception in
1894 to the present day.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.850
And what I hope will be interesting
about this film history is

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.390
that it's not only a
story about law films,

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.520
but it's about how film is
a medium of communication

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.040
and community building, shares
certain central preoccupations

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.650
with law as a system of justice.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:51.550 position:56%
So you'll see that film is very well
suited to telling stories about law,

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:56.340 position:56%
and I'll show how even in the
earliest stages film was preoccupied

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.440
with what it means to know through
sight, with the relationship

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.510
between witnessing
something and judging it.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.980 position:56%
And that these preoccupations, which
are themes throughout film and films

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.100
about law, there are both questions
that are legal, as well as filmic,

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.680
and they were embedded
in and shaped film

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.350
and film making from the beginning.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.930
So at the end of the presentation
I'll ask some questions

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.680
about the relationship between
law and film today in courtrooms

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.000
and in police cars, on
Facebook, and how that history

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.490
of film might shed some light on
what we should be doing with film

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.350
as lawyers or judges, as members

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.320
of society serving equal
justice under the law.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.260
So I'm going to start
with some definitions,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.500
that's what lawyers and
teachers tend to do.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.570
When I talk about law I'm
not talking today necessarily

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.770
about statutes or cases or
constitutions, I'm talking about -

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.970
I'm not talking about law on
the books, people would say -

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.330
I'm talking about law's popular
incarnation, which I think one

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.820
of its proudest is the trial.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.420
Trials are that ubiquitous
symbol of law and justice

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.730
in our contemporary popular
culture, although they are

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.710
so infrequent to be fair.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:11.340
And the trial is particularly
well suited to film and it's

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.450
on film all the time because
as a genre it shares some

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.310
of the general strategies
of film and of law

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:24.180
that is the authority grounded in
the individual's person who claims

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.620
to know and to judge the
world based on our capacity

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.480
to observe and to deliberate.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.860
So the trial is based on
witness testimony and judging

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.120
that testimony, for example,
and documentary evidence

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.260
and film is based on
the same kind of thing.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.900
So when I talk about film I'm not
only talking about what the film

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.220
or the video or the television
says, that is not only its content,

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.050
but I'm talking about how
it says it, the distinct way

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.850
of making meaning as primarily
visual whose significance comes

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.790
from this overdetermined
and illusory conflation

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.400
of images onscreen and
the event being filmed.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.830
The film constructs this community
through acts of visual display,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.230
our relationship to
what we're seeing,

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.930
and it manufactures a
coherence, that is a logic,

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.310
that what we see onscreen and
experience it as if it were part

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.500
of our world here and now.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.270
So the story I tell will be visual.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:27.240
It's a kind of vision through
film and a history in pictures

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.860
to create what I hope will
be a convincing trajectory

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.860
of the development of
law's history in film.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.570
So let's go back to 1894 in France,

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.050
which is the beginning
of film history.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.250
This is Auguste and Louis Lumiere,

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:47.610
and they developed a portable
moving picture machine in 1894.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.850 position:56%
Just a year later in December, 1895,
in the basement of the Grand Cafe

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.420
in Paris the first
movie theater opened.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.550
Showing there were four
Lumiere films, very short,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.790
they were called actuality films.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.290
Among them was L'Arrivee
d'un Train en Gare,

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.120 position:56%
The Arrival of a Train in a Station.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.760
And the story goes that upon
showing of this particular film,

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:16.500 position:56%
which is with a camera stations on
a K, and the train is growing larger

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.440
and larger onscreen as it goes
closer and closer to the station,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.470
the audience screamed,
jumped up from their seats

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.280
and ran from the theater.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.050
That is they were afraid that the
train was heading right for them

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.640
and they were not at all accustomed
to that illusion of reality

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.790 position:56%
that film motion creates, and this
1895 audience feared for their lives

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.540
and they didn't see
the end of the film

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.390
until they came back
and were told otherwise.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.130
So despite this aborted viewing
the French film empire was off

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.430
and running.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.370
There was a pleasure in that
fear, in that form of witnessing,

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.500
and the notion that film had
a particularly real feel,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.890
real and not real enabled
the audience to bear witness

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.190
to something that was
projected onscreen.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:04.110
Now around 1902 this
genre of actualities,

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.270
like pseudo documentaries,
they found narrative,

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.960
and with it the reality film

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.410
of the Lumiere brothers
was replaced with fantasy.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.450
The quintessential example is
of George Melies' early film,

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.690 position:56%
A Trip to the Moon, and although his
films looked more like stage plays,

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.800
the camera tended to be passive
while actors ran on and off stage,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.610
puppeteers moved props, the film
actually told a much more complex

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.630
story and it involved the
audience in that story.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:39.920 position:56%
So his 1903 film, The Magic Lantern,
this is the best I'm sure here

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.430
on this campus, I could
get a better than this

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.550
and I may be able to ask for that.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.550
So this is The Magic Lantern and it
was his first film, it's considered

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.220
to be the first film about film

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.100
and it tells a history
of Western dramatic art.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.470 position:56%
So from left to right it shows first
a landscape painting, then a play,

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.030
and then at the end it's the image

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.800
of the newly developed
moving pictures.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.250
And by placing film
in the trajectory

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.050
of Western representational
art Melies' film suggests

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.560
that film art is no
more or less faithful

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.670
to its subject than his painting.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.280
He also peaks the spectators'
attention, drawing the audience

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.550
out of what's considered
passive experience of watching

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.760
to a more active role
of contributing

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.590
and to critiquing the
meaning made of film.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.090
You all of a sudden realize you're
watching a film about a film,

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.340
about how film was artifice
just like everything else.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:38.400 position:56%
So being made to recognize that film
story is just one representational

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.490
scheme among others is to
acknowledge one's own complicity

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.980
in the perpetuation of the
illusion of film's omnissions.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:51.540 position:56%
So self-reflexivity in film, calling
attention to film's own artifice

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:56.340 position:56%
and relying on the audience to play
along makes the audience participate

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.220
in the story being told and
that was born with Melies.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.360
This self-reflexivity,
the recognition

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.440
of being present beyond
the representation that is

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.500
in the audience, but also
integral to the meaning

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.060
of what's onscreen is one
feature of what makes law and film

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.910
and their way of knowing and
judging the world so compatible.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.630
It's, for example, how audience
members might experience film

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:26.250 position:56%
as jurors might experience trials,
isolated and apart but acutely aware

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.600
of their integral role in the
justification and significance

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.750
of the spectacle before them.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:37.290
Now Edwin Porter's Great Train
Robbery was also made in 1903,

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.050
but in the United States.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.770
The Great Train Robbery
is considered one

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.700
of the first pseudo documentaries,
but it's a pseudo documentary.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.860
And its subject was
how to rob a train.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.900
And I kid you not there was
anxiety and fear and popularity

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.240
around this film that it was a
very effective teaching tool,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.530
telling audiences the truth
about how to do things

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.240
or how life is or can be.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.310
The Great Train Robbery's
other contribution

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.440
to film is its editing structure.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:12.530
By juxtaposing shots of otherwise
discontinuous images the filmmaker,

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.720
Edwin Porter, creates logic
where there wasn't before.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.310
So think about other films
the camera stayed still

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:23.540
and things happened in front of it
or the train, it was just a video

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.920
or a film of the train
entering the station.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.350
This is about actually
stopping and starting the camera

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.310
and making new shots and
piecing them together.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.850
And this phenomenon was
explained in early series

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:40.230
of experiments conducted in 1920
by Russian filmmaker Kuleshov

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.450
in which he juxtaposed various
scenes - here's an image

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.600
of the Kuleshov experiment
- juxtaposing the same image

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.560 position:56%
of a man holding his chin with three
different shots - a bowl of soup,

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.580
a corpse, and a woman
lying in a bed.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.270
And when he experimentally
established

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.900
that people would see the top
image and see the man as hungry,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.990
the middle image they'd
interpret the man as sorrowful,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:13.000
and the bottom image they'd
interpret him as lustful.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.310 position:56%
That is the idea that the same exact
image has different meaning based

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.220
on what comes before it.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.330
Now this might make sense to all
of us, but this was not understood

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.100
to be how film could make
meaning and yet it was one

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.360
of the most powerful ways that
film would develop over time.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.700
Here is Alfred Hitchcock
saying the same thing.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:40.600
&gt;&gt; Now the third way is what
one might call pure cinematics,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:49.230
the assembly of film,
and how it can be changed

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.530
to create a different idea.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.140
Now we have a close-up
that we show what he sees.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:01.640
Let's assume he saw a woman
holding a baby in her arms.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:08.500
Now we cut back to his reaction
to what he sees, and he smiles.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.660
Now what is he as a character?

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.900
He's a kindly man,
he is sympathetic.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.190 position:56%
Now let's take the middle piece of
film away, the woman with the child,

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.170
but leave his two pieces
of film as they were.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:29.550
Now we'll put in a piece of
film of a girl in a bikini.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:37.260
He looks, girl in a
bikini, he smiles.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.560
What is he now?

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.290
A dirty old man.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:44.970
He's no longer the benign
gentleman who loves babies.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:50.200
That's what film can do for you.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:56.130
&gt;&gt; All right, so before film was
10 years old the most important

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.500
technique was experimentally
established,

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.070
that is the human tendency
to create relationships

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.820
between otherwise totally
unrelated scenes.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.310
We, the audience, create narrative
where none existed before,

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:12.810
we bring the story to the images.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.300
This technique of montage
was made even more famous

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.660
with the filmmaker D.W Griffith.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:24.790 position:56%
Griffith's legacy for film and its
grammar, the close-up and deep focus

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.630
and the long shot, is profound.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:31.080
Before his masterpieces of Birth
of a Nation and Intolerance

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.480
in 1907 D.W. made one of his
first appearances on film -

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.200
directors often liked putting
themselves in film in little bits

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.440
and parts - and he was
in Falsely Accused.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.750
Falsely Accused is possibly
the first trial film.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.260
Here's an image from the trial
scene and I'll explain it.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.980
It contains many of the
trial film's generic markers

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.050
that remain intact today.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.200
Falsely Accused opens with
a murder of an inventor

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.330
and the false accusation that
his daughter committed the crime.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.000
The daughter's boyfriend dwelling

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.700
on the crime scene finds
a motion picture camera

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.410 position:56%
which had miraculously been running
during the commission of the murder.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.880
This is 1907, okay?

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.460
He develops, so it's a
film about a film, right -

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.130
he develops the film which, of
course, reveals the true murderer

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.020
and rushes it to the courthouse
where he shows it to the judge

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.290
and the jury to free his girl.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.540
And this is an image
of the courtroom scene

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.650
where a screen is being hung
to show that piece of evidence.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.990
It's been argued that
Falsely Accused is the genesis

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.060
of those trial films in
which the missing piece

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.400
of evidence is magically caught on
film or a photograph, for example,

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.160
which once developed
is shown to the court

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.260
in this triumphant
climax to solve the crime.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.970
In addition to its self-referential
gesture making the film,

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.320
the star of the film around
which the meaning of the story

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.380
about law's relationship
to truth is structured,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.070
Falsely Accused also participates
in the trial film genre

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.600
by featuring the film
audience as the jury.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.890
So by showing the film of the
crime in court to solve the mystery

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.710
and expose the true killer
the jury within the film

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.900
and the film's audience
who already knew

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.580
that eventually share
the same information

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.350
about who committed the murder
and can render a unanimous verdict

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:24.600
of not guilty, releasing what would
otherwise be a substantial amount

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.550
of tension in the film.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.510
So, thus, I suggest
this is the origin

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.090
of the audience satisfaction
that's so much

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.720
of what trial films have in them.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.560
so here in 1907 film is both
evidence and it's a story

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.490
of evidence, it's a way of
knowing, of revelation and a story

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.210
about how one comes to know.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.490
Many, many trial films that follow
will contain similar features.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.600 position:56%
And so already only seven years into
this new century self-reflexivity,

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.720
audience participation are
part of the film's world making

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.410
and were part of the story that
film told about law, as well.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:05.890
Now after the First World War there
were two European film movements

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.370
and they developed in parallel,
one in Germany and one in Russia,

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.380
and they both worked on the same
problem which is about point

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.810
of view, that is the view
from a single narrator

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.140
with which the audience
will identify.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.230
And this is the development
of film narrative

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.710
from what would otherwise
be omniscient tell-all,

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.960
sort of a perspective,
a God perspective,

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.580
to a much more intimate personal
story where we get to know

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.560
and experience the perspective
of subjective characters,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.270
usually the protagonists.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.860
So, for example, this is
an omniscient perspective,

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.330
Triumph of the Will,
Leni Riefenstahl's voice

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:46.680
of God perspective, and this would
be a much more subjective first

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.710
person perspective, where you
feel like you are a part of

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:54.370
or you are experiencing the
film story from the perspective

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.300
of one of the characters.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:02.670
It is here where we find the
seeds, also, of the American hero,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.180
the legal hero who is
autonomous and who stands apart

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.440
from the film's story
and yet is very integral

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.420
to its storytelling function.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.450
Much like the idealized juror or
the legal hero whose independence

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:22.280
from law is necessary for his
right to his participation in it,

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.620
we glorify these independent
and self-reliant individuals.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.280
His perspective might not
always be true, indeed,

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:36.370
it's not always true,
but we revere them.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.100
The development of the first
person narrative capitalizes

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.940
on the film's capacity for
empathy and to identify

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:46.500
with these heroes creating a
sense of intimacy and revelation,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.540
but it nonetheless does something
also which is blurring the boundary

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:55.630
between subjective and objective
perspectives between bias,

00:31:55.630 --> 00:32:00.790 position:56%
first person perspectives, and more
the value of unbiased or omnissions.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.420
The first person narrative
problematizes,

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.880
speaking from one perspective,
problematizes the ability to know

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.640
through sight because it depends
on who does the seeing or telling,

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.480 position:56%
whose view is the audience privy to?

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.510
This is not unlike the challenge
of credibility determinations made

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.540
in trial courts regularly
regarding witness testimony.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.870
So this problem of a first
person narration actually started

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:29.150
with German expressionism
from 1919 to 1933 about,

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.590
and after D.W. Griffith's
close-up, which signifies intimacy,

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:37.680
sometimes intrusion, that
close-up was transformed into sort

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.490
of psychological drama where the
film could mirror the subjective

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.760
feelings of a single character,

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.250
making room for distortion
and deception.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.680
So this is The Cabinet of
Dr. Caligari from 1920,

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.980
and it is one of these films

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.990
in which the audience thinks
it's being told a tragic story

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.270
but true story about
the main character

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:00.600 position:56%
from that main character's
experience, who turns out in the end

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.150
to be telling us a
deluded and paranoid fable

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.910
from inside a mental institution.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.840 position:56%
At the other extreme of the same
movement and style is Fritz Lang's M

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.520
from 1931, and this is the
story of a serial killer played

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.880
by Peter Lorre whose perspective

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.580
on the floundering
investigation haunts the audience.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.390
It's always from his perspective
that we're seeing things,

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:24.290
so much so that when he cries
out at the end of the film,

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.160
who knows what it's like to
be me, he yells that directly

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.900
at the camera, only the
audience really feels

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.450
like we know what it's
like to be him.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:34.850
And this is a notorious
trial film actually,

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.310
not because it depicts
any legal system actually,

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.110
but because it tells the
story of mob justice.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.680
The legal system is usurped
by mobs in this film,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.530
outlaws taking the rein
of law for good or for ill

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.840
and this becomes a familiar
paradigm in the following decades.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:56.600
So during this technical and
naratological revolution from 1895

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:02.390
to about 1930 we have montage
editing, first person narrative,

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.340
sound eventually shows up.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.070
This is the story of The
Jazz Singer from October 6th,

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:14.890
1927 on Broadway was the first
performance of a sound film.

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:18.960
And so you have to imagine that
all these movies, all these images,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.840
all this cultural capital
is spinning for two decades,

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.120
three decades without
audible words coming

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.400
out of the mouths of the actors.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.710
The pleasure of images strung
together and their capacity

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:35.730
to build instant and compelling
communities was so powerful

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.600
that words were unnecessary,
the pictures they sufficed.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.190
So from the late 1930s to 1950s

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.350
when the United States is
growing more politically powerful

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.170
and economically powerful
and dominant

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:52.180
in the world Hollywood also became
the cultural center of film.

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.770
Hollywood learned from its
European masters and Fritz Lang,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.770 position:56%
he comes to the United States and he
makes a film, Like Fury, from 1936.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.950
Big Heat he also made in 1953.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.130
And these films, both law
and chaos kind of films,

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.570
although Fury is the trial film,

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:13.630
they bookend what we call the Film
Noir period, which is characterized

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:17.170
by Cerio Skero's black-and-white
style of filmmaking

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:20.040
and a criminal underside
of post-war glory

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.820
of American life and institutions.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.220
So let me tell you about Fury.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.520
It's one of my favorite films.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.080
So it stars Spencer Tracy as Joe
Wilson, who is wrongfully accused

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.960
of kidnapping, and when
detained he is presumably killed

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.740
by this mob outside the jailhouse,
who sets fire to his jail cell.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.590
And the audience sees his
face through the flames.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.380
I couldn't get the
picture of the flames,

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.910
but the flames eventually come.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.690
And his burning face and
eventual confirmation of his death

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:50.550
in the newspapers in the
films are showed to us.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.770
And yet we know that he survives,
but only we know he survives.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:36:00.680
So here are the film within
the film, the newspapers

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.610
and the newsreel footages
that's shown in court.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.280
Here again is the court
scene with the scrim going

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:11.080
up to the show the film of him, of
the flames devouring him in jail.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.360
It looks a lot like the court
scene from Falsely Accused, right?

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.680
Which shows all of these film
and newsreels shows his demise.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.500
They actually fail to reveal
the truth, because Joe survives,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.640
and they perpetuate
the lie of Joe's death.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.870
So the film is pointing to
itself here, but in its moment

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.390
of self-reflection it's revealing
an untruth and that's the clue

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:36.730
to how law in this film
will fail to serve justice.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.170
So he seeks revenge, he seeks
revenge for his near death,

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.890
but instead of entrusting the
legal system with his exoneration

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.470
of kidnapping he manipulates the
district attorney and he conspires

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.970
with his brothers here
in the conviction

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.030
of the mob for his murder.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.820
Now when the film jury is about
to convict those in the crowd

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.920
who set the fire he
dramatically enters the courtroom,

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.270
another exciting climax,
and halts the trial.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.060
This film marks the beginning
of two decades of legal films

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.880
that criticize law's
capacity for justice.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.010
It is further evidence

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.490
of this liberal legal
subject as a legal hero.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:21.480
He's positioned antithetical to
and outside of the law, Joe Wilson,

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.720
but he nevertheless participates in
the system to right the institution

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.490
that has strayed from its goal.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.280
These are sort of like
legal cowboys,

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.150
alienated from the formal
legal system by choice or force

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.850
who eventually are brought back
to or return to see justice done.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.990
While criticizing the legal
system for failing its subjects,

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.480
the legal hero will add
strength to that system

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.270
by showing here how truth and
justice through law depends

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.860
on the participation of
righteous individuals.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.970
Film from this ilk are plentiful,
from this era are plentiful,

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:58.330
so well-known films include
Young Mr. Lincoln by John Ford,

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.770
The Paradine Case by
Alfred Hitchcock.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.400
It's also the time that Hollywood,
as I said, is growing more

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.370
and more dominant and Classical
Hollywood Style is taking

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.080
over from Film Noir.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.230
Really Classical Hollywood Style
in the '50s and '60s is an anecdote

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.650
to Film Noir, and some of the most
famous Hollywood trial films were

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.170
made during this time.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.850
And by famous I mean that they're
still referred to as providing

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.080
that template for the
courtroom genre,

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.820
creating some of the most
memorable characters onscreen.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.820
I'm sure many of you can name them
by heart, and they're commenting

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.530
on the American legal system that
was actually evolving at this time

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.350
to accommodate the
development of civil liberties.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:43.090
These are films that in contrast
to the skepticism from the '20s,

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:47.050
'30s and '40s pervaded
that time period,

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.530
portray now a more hopeful
vision of the legal system.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.760
So this is Adam's Rib, for example,
path breaking film for women,

00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:01.030
one of the few comedic trial
films also, 12 Angry Men,

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.470
Sidney Lumet's masterpiece
glorifying the jury process,

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.520
and the contribution of every
person to Law's Endeavor.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.980
Compulsion, in which Orson
Welles plays Clarence Darrow

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.920
in the Loeb-Leopold case and
delivers what has been reported

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.380
to be the longest speech at
15 minutes to a film audience

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.390
in one clip, breaking with
the fiction of the film

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.510 position:56%
and directly addressing the audience

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.890
about the horrors of
the death penalty.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.600
Inherit the Wind, Stanley
Kramer's rendition

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.500
of the Scopes monkey trial.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.720
To Kill a Mockingbird,
Gregory Peck brings

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.280
to life Harper Lee's Atticus Finch
and dramatizes the complicity

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.550
of the American legal
system with the personal

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.310
and social tragedies of Jim Crow.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.700 position:56%
So while Hollywood was creating and
distributing these memorable stories

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:51.370
and heroes of American justice
and the pursuit of truth,

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.410
French filmmakers,
what were they doing?

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:58.560
Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc
Godard were classifying film,

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.190
they were starting to critique
film, this is the '60s, after all,

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:05.350
about how film particularly
makes meaning.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:10.140 position:56%
The mechanical means of photographic
reproduction they say lulled us

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.840
into a false sense of objectivity.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.610
Concern with just how this false
objectivity would translate

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.860
into narrative and to politics.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.840
The study of film in the 1960s
began with the critical capacity

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:28.340
to examine films illusory
coherence between the thing on film

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.860
and the thing being filmed.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.440
We've gone right back to 1895.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.570
We see courtroom justice, but
what we see is not what is,

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.810
it's one story among many we
could tell and experience,

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:43.710 position:56%
but the experience of seeing it
makes us believe in its possibility.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.020
The question is how real?

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:50.650
French theorists wrote that film
is an instrument of ideology,

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.000
and that was the beginning of
the study of media studies,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.910
communication studies,
film studies and in

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.270
that way constituting its subject.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.890 position:56%
Film constitutes us, whether it be
law or a kind of hero or a community

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:06.160 position:56%
through this mechanism of seeing and
being seen, witnessing and judging.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.830
And the illusory sense
of omniscience,

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:12.200
but from our perspective at
the center of the story is

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.060
in fact what Classical
Hollywood film depends on,

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.590
this coherent narration,

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.990
a good story by a psychologically
defined individual

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:24.380
as the principal causal
agent of justice.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.790
The film enables narrative
coherence, that is that good story

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:31.640
through our act of watching it
and desiring a certain reassurance

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.260 position:56%
and control at the end, affirming
our sense of a certain kind of order

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:41.250
and a certain kind of understanding
based on seeing with our own eyes.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:45.110
The story of law that these films
tell is entirely fictional and

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.870
yet it lives in our culture.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:50.090
It is real in that way, part of
our collective consciousness,

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:53.260
and it cultivates - that's what
the French theorists said -

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.500
expectations, emotions and desires.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.980
So how does this work in
the films that followed?

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:05.140
Consider more recent films, like
Erin Brockovich, North Country,

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:11.250 position:56%
both squarely in this film tradition
echoing stories of this ideology

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.910
of the central independent
individual who brings us along

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:20.820 position:56%
in their story and whose skepticism
of law and marginalization is undone

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.860
by the experience of revelation
in and through the legal process.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.620
Truth is revealed through law and
on film, hear of the liability

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.460 position:56%
of polluters or of sexual harassers.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.960
Consider how many trial films
like this are combinations of sort

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.350
of a docudrama based on a true
story and Classical Hollywood film,

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:45.450 position:56%
two genres that will best perpetuate
an idealistic, perhaps naive view

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:49.360
of film's capacity and law's
ability to reveal the truth.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.350
These are typical films in that
they triumph the independent

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:55.170
and determined fair-minded citizen,

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.460
answering in the affirmative
the question about whether

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.820
that lone individual, the
legal hero, the every person

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.600
who is devoted and idealistic.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.290
Think not only of Charleze Theron
and Julia Roberts' character,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:10.540
but John Travolta in a Civil
Action, Paul Newman in The Verdict,

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.870
both based on true stories.

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:15.140
Or more fictional but
equally forceful,

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.250
Tom Cruise in A Few Good Men,
Denzel Washington in Philadelphia,

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.530
George Clooney in Michael Clayton.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.910
These legal heroes prevail
in tainted legal systems

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:27.890
by making a difference
through determined

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.550
and against all odds participation.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.630
The lawyers are protagonists in
these films, are everyday heroes,

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:37.000
they're David's and Goliath's
system, and the story is of access,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.100
of opportunity, of fairness
no matter who you are

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:45.800 position:56%
and where you came from - it's an
American story, an ideal to be sure.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.300 position:56%
You should have noticed that most
of these legal heroes are white men.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.130
Interestingly enough, sometime

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:54.890
in the 1990s American trial films
started casting more lawyers

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:58.770
and judges as African-American
and as women,

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.630
presenting a much more hopeful
picture of an enlightened future

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:04.730
where positions of power in the
judicial system are open to all,

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.620
again, constituting a hopeful
community of inclusion.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.510
By contrast judges who are
shortsighted at this time

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:16.230
or portrayed as crazy, there are a
lot of bored and eccentric judges

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:20.050
in these films, are often old and
Caucasian, telling another story

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.350
about where the weak link
in our systems might lie.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:27.930
There are many iconic trial films
that are based on true stories,

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.800
making this ideology of
American independent minded

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.950 position:56%
and determined hero even more
authoritative, even more persuasive.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.670
And although many films are
not self-explicitly referential

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:43.770 position:56%
in their symbolism it's not uncommon
for the legal investigation leading

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:47.050
to the trial film's climax in
these films to be structured

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:50.830
around a visual revelation,
uncovering a missing document,

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:55.170
a smoking gun, the critical word,
discovering a missing identity.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.490
So film's indicia of truth,
achieving a just verdict

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:03.530
through visual revelation
only furthers film's

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:04.830
authoritative message.

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:08.170
It's a way of conveying it
by convincing the audience

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:11.480
that seeing is knowing
and witnessing is power,

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.660
which in turn should
facilitate justice.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.870
Think of other classic
courtroom dramas

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:18.720
that are based on true stories.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.530
Anatomy of a Murder, Inherit the
Wind, People vs. Larry Flynt,

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:26.020
Young Mr. Lincoln, Judgment
at Nuremburg, The Verdict.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.720
These true stories are
not necessarily popular

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.820
because they're true, but because
they exemplify through 100 years

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.190
of cinema the central ties
that bind film world making

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.210
to legal world making.

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:43.270 position:56%
From the Lumiere brothers' actuality
films, where audience members ran

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:46.290
from the theater worried the
train would run them down,

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:50.090
to docudramas like The Civil Action
where viewing audiences are made

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:54.020
to worry, to really worry that the
legal system is not sufficiently

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.590
capacious to condemn polluters
who cause illness and death.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.430
These films play on the question
of how do we know what we know,

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:07.840 position:56%
how do we decide we know what we do,
and the law's relationship to both.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.880
Ultimately they're about the duty

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.390
and difficulty of judging
as citizens.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.510
The roots of early film are in
these docudramas, they unify sight

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:22.440
with knowledge, which is an issue
of evidence, and ways of knowing

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.350
as seeing and being seen by each
other, which is about judging

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:30.260
and objectivity and the importance
of each individual's perspective.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.700
This I would say shows the
root of law in early film.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.670
I could tell you the same
story about television,

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.780
which has three main variations.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.650
There are Law and Order
type police serials,

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:44.510
which revolve around
investigative teams and end

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:48.240
with revelation usually of guilt
after hard, courageous work

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.420
and a lot of rule breaking,
despite the ubiquity

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.230
of Miranda warnings we saw
those rule breaking there,

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.980
gratuitous police procedure
and paperwork.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.440
The most recent incarnation of
this genre is True Detective,

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.900
talk about guilt and rule breaking,
if you haven't already seen it,

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.870
ends in this climatic
confrontation with evil.

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.780
One of my favorites in the
new version is How to Get Away

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.520
With Murder, the award winning
Viola Davis playing this liminal,

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.340
edgy hero, who can dazzle in
court with her team and plays law

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.750
like an exquisite instrument
towards the ends

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:22.500
that she believes to be just.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.470
And yet we tend to agree because
we're so impressed with her,

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.610
and she's part of the second
type of legal television show,

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:32.640 position:56%
which is the law firm serial -
Damages, Boston Legal, The Practice,

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.000
Ally McBeal, L.A. Law,
The Good Wife, Suits.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.340
All the same kind of show in
which law is this game played

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.510
by skilled actors, who
we trust or love or not,

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:46.170
mostly because of their
character and judgment.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.120
Law is just a sport in these
films or in these TV shows,

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.560 position:56%
and we root for the winners who are
winners, not because of their causes

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.580 position:56%
but because of their character, whip
smart, hardworking, independent.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:04.060
The third kind of television genre
are reality shows and court TV --

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:10.510
Peoples Court, Judge Judy,
The O.J. Trial Then and Now.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:14.350
Making of a Murderer, the
documentary serial which is hard

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.110
to watch, if you haven't
yet, because it's hard

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:21.070
to believe can police be
so corrupt, so flawed?

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.480
We need really only look
around to recent events.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:30.780
Forced to ask is reality on
TV or is TV making reality?

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.630
When courtroom television first
began we debated this so-called CSI

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.170
affect, are audiences so
lulled by what they see

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:43.440
that once we participate in actual
legal procedure it will distort us,

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.480
we will distort or it will
be distorted or mismanaged

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.190
through our expectations.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:52.810
Do people watch Judge Judy
or did they watch Judge Ito

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.990
and think this is what
courts are, in fact, like?

00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:01.570
When you turn on a camera in an
interrogation room, for example,

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.530
or you film a documentary

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:08.960 position:56%
about a murder investigation do you
think you're not altering the events

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.530
that are being filmed?

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:13.560
Are you not becoming the part
of the story that's being told?

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.200
The thin blue line famously
created a whole new trial

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.020
for the defendant in that case.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:24.000
The paradox at the heart of Making
a Murderer is the same thing.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.780
The podcast sensation, the
serial, the same thing.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.040 position:56%
It's also at the heart of the debate
concerning cameras in the courtroom.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.110
Film and law collapsed
together as joined ways

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:37.670
of telling the most definitive
truth we can say about our world.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:41.240
Truth matters to law and to the
confidence in our justice system,

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.460
if not also to our democracy,
but truth is not easy to see,

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.570
it's not easy to see,
and it's rarely on film

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.120
or television as hard
as we may look.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.870
What we see are myths and ideals
and nightmares and the truths

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.050
of our lives together
is much more complex

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.980
than a video image or a film story.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:05.300 position:56%
So after the past weeks I have to
say after Saint Paul and Baton Rouge

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.300
and of Dallas it bears
repeating that policing

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:13.120
and legal decision-making is
increasingly involving film,

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.030
documentary like film, films
that compete for truth claims

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:21.230
about police brutality, racism
and the justified use of force.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:25.520
Bystander videos of police
brutality don't answer the question

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.590 position:56%
of whether the police were motivated
by racism and unjustified fear.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.930
We come to these films,
videos of police brutality

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:36.160
or videotaped confessions
of guilt, for example,

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:41.070
with preconceived notions already
about the justice or injustice

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:42.420
of the event they portray.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:46.100
When I look at films of the
killing of Philando Castile

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.160
and Alton Sterling I see
excusable murder, but I know enough

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.900
about US culture and film to know

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:56.630
that not everyone sees
what I see in those videos.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.030
Likewise, filmed interrogations,
filmed confessions, dash cams,

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:04.230
bodycams, what story do they tell?

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:09.660
The early film masters would ask
whose story do they tell and how?

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.590
Like most documentaries they do
not tell us what really happened.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:17.080
If there is an incontestable
and singular account, at all,

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.560
but as visual narratives they're
particularly good at persuading us

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:25.410
of a point of view and they can
contextualize claims to truth.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.710
They can help us tell a bigger
story, a more complex one.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:30.950
But, of course, the film
is not the whole truth.

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:33.350
It does, however, participate
in culture

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:35.600
as if it needs no explanation.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.970 position:56%
But films need a lot of explanation.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:41.490
Letting films speak for themselves
is leaving the world they create

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:43.100
in other people's hands.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.620
So I cannot resist,
because I'm a Law Professor,

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.280
to talk about a case in
my last five minutes.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.000
The case is Scott vs. Harris
from 2007, and at the center

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.700
of this case was a video of a
car chase taken from the dash cam

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.520
of a police cruiser that
was pursuing a suspect.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:04.010
And the video shows the
police officer racing

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.950
down this dark narrow road

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:09.820
and deliberately ramming the
suspect's car to end the chase.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:13.600
The suspect was paralyzed as a
result of the crash and the issue

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.120
to be decided was whether or not
the police officer was justified

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.780
in the use of force
to end the car crash.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.440
As you can imagine,
the focal evidence

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:25.550
in the case was the dash cam
video, and it went all the way

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.580
up to the Supreme Court and at
oral argument both Justices Breyer

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.830
and Scalia vocalized this power
of film that I've been talking

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:37.700 position:56%
about for the past 40 minutes, this
power of film and their naive belief

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:42.640 position:56%
that film captures reality, at least
the relevant legal reality at hand.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.430
Justice Breyer noted, his
voice raised if you listen

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.390
to the oral argument, he says I
see with my own eyes what happened,

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.260
what am I supposed to do?

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.570
And Justice Scalia exclaimed that
the video of the car chase was one

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:58.570
of the scariest he'd seen
since The French Connection.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:02.280
So sure was Scalia of his and the
court majority's interpretation

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.370
of the video as justifying the use
of force because the chase looked

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.130
so dangerous to them
that in a footnote

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:11.440
to the opinion Justice
Scalia invited the readers

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.710
to watch the video for themselves.

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:15.560
So he says far from
being the cautious

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.850
and controlled driver
the lower court depicts,

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.470
they overturned the lower court,

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:23.370
what we see on the video more
closely resembles a Hollywood style

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.870
car chase and the most frightening
sort, placing police officers

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:30.760
and innocent bystanders alike
at great risk of serious harm.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.060
And then he says we're happy

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.130
to allow the videotape
to speak for itself.

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:39.830
I read that and just groaned.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.720
Justice Stevens was the
lone dissenter in this case,

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.130
and he took the majority to task

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:47.950
for disregarding the lower
court's factual findings based

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:51.380
on all the evidence before it,
evidence that included much more

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:53.000
than the film, driving conditions,

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.300
common speeds on the particular
stretch of road, the experience

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.610
of police officers, the
suspect's known criminal record.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:05.010 position:56%
And particularly he complained his
colleagues had never clearly driven,

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.970
had clearly never driven on
a dark country road before.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:11.560
He says it's not a scary speeding
car chase, he says, it's normal.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.550
He says I can only conclude that my
colleagues were unduly frightened

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:17.440
by two of the three images on
the tape that looked like bursts

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.600
of lightning or explosion, but
were in fact merely the headlights

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.080
of vehicles zooming by
in the opposite lane.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.800
Had they learned to drive when
most high-speed driving took place

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.370
on two lane roads rather
than on superhighways,

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:31.180
when split second judgment is about
the risk of passing a slowpoke

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:33.440
in the face of oncoming
traffic were routine,

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.550
they might well have reacted to
the videotape more dispassionately.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.470
So, in other words, he says don't
just fall victim to the effects

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:44.660 position:56%
on screen, consider the evidence
that can contextualize what you see.

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.900
He does what many film
and cultural critics do,

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:52.110 position:56%
he asks how the film's portrayal of
the event is being shaped and coaxed

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:55.810
by particular experiences and
points of view, a bird's eye view

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:59.000
on the dashboard, for
example, rather than from above

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.860
or alongside the car, which would
have given you a very different

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.150
sense of how fast the car was going
and how dangerous things were.

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:11.430
A long shot rather than a close-up
would have made all the difference

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:12.730
in this video.

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:16.230
He manifests a healthy
skepticism towards film that claims

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:19.380
to depict the truth
or speaks for itself.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.760
He does not disregard the film,
that's an important point,

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.120
he just understands its power and
its relevance and he simply asks

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:30.010 position:56%
that all other evidence be
considered, not just the film alone.

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.190
So he does not fall
victim to the illusion

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:34.520
of reality that the film portrays.

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.760
He did not repeat the mistake
of that first film audience,

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:44.220
as experiencing film as reality
unraveling in front of his eyes.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.900 position:56%
So film very persuasively constructs
a world for us, a compelling,

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:51.810 position:56%
sometimes loveable, sometimes scary
world, but film like all other forms

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:55.190
of communication - it can be
photography, oral testimony,

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:59.020
drawings, it can be
Twitter, Snapchat, e-mail -

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:01.720
all of it is a kind of language
that must be interpreted,

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.120
it must be scrutinized,
it has to be evaluated.

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.710 position:56%
It must be cross-examined, actually,

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:10.570
to understand what it really
means for the case at hand.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.070
So the history of law and film

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:15.880
and television is really an
idealized story of heroes

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.220
and villains, easy-to-identify
corruption,

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:23.100
and quick procedural fixes
to avoid future injustices.

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.410
That is not the world we live in.

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:29.580
Film can tell very potent stories
and may foster civic engagement

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:31.370
or social change on their own.

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:35.420 position:56%
They are very, very powerful forms
of communicating and world building,

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:38.050
but we need much more than
these beloved characters

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:40.090
or shocking images to
fulfill this promise

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.010
of equal justice under the law.

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:45.370
Films get the story going, they
plant seeds, but it's really

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:48.220
up to the collective work
of communities committed

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.790
to human flourishing to
make sure that the story

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:53.480
that the film began ends well.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:56.510
Thank you.

00:56:56.510 --> 00:57:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.340
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Thank
you, Professor Silbey,

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:05.280 position:56%
that was fascinating and a wonderful
proof of the thesis of The Library

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.930
of Congress, that we have to look

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:10.520
across the disciplines
to find insight.

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.150
We'd like to open the
floor for questions.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:16.890
We'll have a roving mike,
so if you'll raise your hand

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:20.540
when you would like to ask a
question we can then bring the mike

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.970
to you and we can capture
it on our tape.

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:28.020
So there's a question
right here that I see.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:36.000
&gt;&gt; Hi. A wonderful lecture,
Jessica, I really appreciated it.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.220
I'm just wondering if you've
thought about the role

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:43.640
of the legal technical advisor
in the making of law films,

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.030
what their ethical
responsibilities might be,

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.830
what is the role they have,

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:51.880
whether they actually play a
positive role or a negative role?

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.020
I'm just wondering if
you've thought about that?

00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:56.300
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Are you
talking about the folks who consult

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:57.960
like on The Good Wife
and stuff like that?

00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.260
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.560
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Right, I've
always wanted to be one of those.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.860
&gt;&gt; My former trial partner

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.960
in the Cook County State's Attorney
is the consultant on The Good Wife.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.260
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Okay.

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.560
&gt;&gt; And I've done it myself.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.860
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: I think I
might remember you saying that.

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:11.320 position:56%
So I find The Good Wife to be one of
- I love The Good Wife in large part

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.340
because they often
get the law right,

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:16.360
although in very truncated
form, that is the questions

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.990
that they're wrestling
with are actual -

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:22.690
they resonate with real questions
I would talk about in class.

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:29.460
So the role of the technical
advisor, so ethical duties?

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:37.130
So I would hate to say that
I think popular culture needs

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:42.380
to be accurate all the time, I
think that's sort of a silly -

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:55.650
I wouldn't want to say that, but
there are films, ones that claim

00:58:55.650 --> 00:59:01.290
to be true or based on true
stories that take liberties

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:04.660
that I feel do harm, can do harm.

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:10.650
And in those films I've
been part of debates

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:14.180
that I understand both
sides of, so documentaries

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:20.790
that are clearly advocacy
documentaries and aren't evenhanded

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:23.990
and they have experts that
say, you know, you don't have

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:25.530
to be evenhanded, you're
telling the truth,

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:28.820
you're just not giving both sides.

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.990
I think it's like a bad form
of teaching, for example,

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:36.750 position:56%
but I don't think there's an
ethical obligation to be evenhanded.

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:42.830
And what I tell my students is that
documentaries don't pretend to be -

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:44.410
I mean you can't, how do
you tell the whole truth?

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:47.390
Documentaries are films, when you
go to court you have a legal trial,

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:51.160
there are all different
ways to portray truths.

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:56.320
But you can see how it
facilitates the power

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:58.770
of visuals over everything else.

00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:02.170
And so one of the things that
upsets me or I get concerned

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:04.380
about in the dominance
of visual images

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.170
as this truth telling mechanism
is when we get police videos,

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:13.090 position:56%
for example, which just take over
all other forms of rational thought.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:15.830
And that makes me nervous.

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:18.110
I wish it wouldn't be the case.

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:22.310 position:56%
I don't think it has to be the case,
but I think we lend ourselves -

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:26.480
we go down that path when we
lose our critical capacity.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.160
What I just want to say is I
think most of us go to film,

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.510
we go to the movies or we watch TV,
and we have critical capacities.

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:34.900
We're film critics all the
time, like that was a bad one

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.260
or they should have done that
or why did they end that way?

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.540
We say that all the time
as consumers of culture,

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.050
but sometimes when there's this
truth veneer, a documentary

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:47.590
or a dash cam, we lose
that critical capacity

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:51.430
and I'm very interested
in that slippage.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:54.420
And I think when that
slippage is possible I feel

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.450
like there's more ethical
obligations

01:00:56.450 --> 01:01:00.680
to bring one's attention
back to the critical.

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:12.770
&gt;&gt; At heart, in most courtroom
dramas, they're mysteries

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:16.710
and I think that's one reason
why it's so appealing to us.

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:23.080 position:56%
And there's a narrative, information
is withheld, we are typically not,

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.200
you know, there might be
an omniscient narrator

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.830
who knows everything but
only reveals information

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.380
to us in little packets.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:34.240
I was glad you included that
little clip of Alfred Hitchcock

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.790
because he was the master of that.

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:38.090
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey:
Of withholding, yes.

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:43.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Withholding that information, but
at the same time is there a tension

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:50.760 position:56%
between the narrative impetus of the
filmmaker and I put it in quotes,

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.180
accurate portrayal of the law?

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.980
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: So the first
thing I think of when you say

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:03.440
that is when you go to trial
or you're negotiating documents

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.670
for discovery you're
constantly withholding things,

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:08.030
you're constantly trying
to negotiate,

01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:09.740
like what story am I going to tell

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.310
and what information do I not
want the other side to have

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:15.630
so they can't tell
a different story.

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:21.250
So legal negotiation and the
relationship of law, legal process,

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:25.900
to truth is as contorted
as Hitchcock's narratives.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:29.310
And that's something that
we just need to accept.

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:34.760 position:56%
Law is rarely about revealing truths
as much as it's a fair process,

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.520
it's supposed to be a fare
process of competing truths

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.610
that somebody then judges
as which one is better.

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:48.590
So I think withholding information
is not - I mean it's essential

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:52.450
to being rational at
some level, you know?

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.580
They say people who are
crazy know too much, right?

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:58.620
So I think film, and
Hitchcock gets it right,

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.920
he would have been a great lawyer.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:14.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm not an attorney, but when I'm
watching TV shows I often see things

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.230
that I say, you know,
that just wouldn't happen,

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:20.450
its illegal or whatever.

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:22.900
Are there any particular things

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:27.560
that you wish they would
stop doing and get right?

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.430
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Well, from the
perspective of teaching students

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:41.910
who are going to be lawyers I
think I resent most the drama

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:48.070
and the flash of so many of the
lawyers that are on TV and in film.

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:50.930
Being a lawyer you read
and you write and you sit

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:53.170
with documents all the time,

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:57.270
like you are a librarian
most of the time.

01:03:57.270 --> 01:04:02.140
And I think there's a lot of
dissatisfaction in the profession

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.610
because of that dissonance.

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:06.930
You can be a change agent, you
can absolutely be a counselor

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:09.590
and an advisor, and you
see that on television

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:12.770
and popular culture,
doing good things.

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:18.310
But the time it takes, the span of
lifetime, and I tell the stories

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:22.680
of the Civil Rights movement, how
Thurgood Marshall started in 1920

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.640
and didn't make until 1956 -
like it takes a whole lifetime

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.830
to make those kind of
changes and on television it's

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:33.870
like 43 minutes, you know?

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:39.710
So the drudgery of lawyering,
I wish that there was -

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:45.830
I mean that's not a good TV
show, but the pace of law films

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:50.990 position:56%
and law television is very distorted
and I think it gives us a sense

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:54.090
of impatience, which
I don't think is good

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:57.230
and I think lawyers
need to be very patient.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:08.360
&gt;&gt; Hello. Comparing shows like
Boston Legal and Good Wife,

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.520
of course, are the question, but
I'm always interested in issues.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.610
Boston Legal had very deep
issues all over the board.

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:19.100
Are there any specific
issues that you would think

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:24.350
of that are strongly often
omitted and there are the ones

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:29.040
that are almost every
TV show or movie.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.340
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Omitted?

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.990
&gt;&gt; Omitted, yes?

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.190
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: So this
is just my own bias speaking,

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:39.700
and so one of the reasons I love
The Good Wife for parts of it is

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:43.230 position:56%
because they had some
intellectual property cases on there

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:44.530
that were done really well.

01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:50.760
And so if you look at where legal
practice is and how it's changing.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:57.230
So patent law, people weep with
boredom, but I mean it's a huge,

01:05:57.230 --> 01:06:02.090
huge important practice for
access to medicine, for robots

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:06.710 position:56%
and artificial intelligence and it's
the future of all the technology

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:10.550
that we have seen in this building
and there's no way they're going

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.830
to have a show about patent cases.

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:15.580
So that's not talked about.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.110
I think The Good Wife
it was a copyright case,

01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:21.200
it was a music copyright case
of all things, that's very sexy.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.700
And, you know, trust and
estates, like basic family law,

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.070
I mean there are a lot of
wills and stuff like that,

01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:31.600
but it's not the way
lawyers can be really helpful

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.830
on a day-to-day basis, the way a
general practitioner can be helpful

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:42.950 position:56%
on a day-to-day basis, you don't see
that in films, TV shows about law

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:45.880
and that's where lawyers
can be really helpful

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.610
and not just everyday consulting,
but that's not dramatic.

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:53.220
But I would have loved
to see stuff like that.

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:56.650
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Jessica, I had a question.

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:57.950
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Yes?

01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:59.250
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: I think
you opened the door on this,

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.810
so I'm not feeling too
bad about asking it.

01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:03.930
But could you make a personal
comment about your feeling

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:06.870
about cameras in the courtroom?

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:08.420
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Oh, yes.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:13.810
So my view has changed on
this actually over time.

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:19.400
I used to think that it would have
been a really, really good thing

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.510
to open up all courtrooms
to the cameras,

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:23.910
especially the Supreme Court.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:27.320
It annoys me that they're
one of the last to hold out.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.080
And I no longer feel that way.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:34.070
I think being there in
person, listening to the audio,

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:36.410
reading the transcript,
everything is digitized,

01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:41.160
you can get real-time transcripts,
you can hear oral arguments,

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:47.060
I think that might engage with the
questions of law from the audience

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.790
in a richer way right now.

01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:54.490
I am scared about the
power of visuals

01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:58.700
to over determine people's
lives today.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:05.180
And so I feel like technology
is ahead of our own capacity

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:10.480
for judgment a lot of the time,
and so I'm not in favor of cameras

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.530
in all courtrooms at the moment.

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:16.770 position:56%
There was a controversial decision
in Massachusetts a couple months ago

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:21.700
where some testimony,
the courtroom was open

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.680
and there was videotaped
testimony and a lot

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.280
of the testimony was
sealed because people were

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:33.390
in the courtroom using their
phones to record what was going on,

01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:36.240
which is okay and yet a lot

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.590
of that testimony was really
hurtful or really upsetting.

01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:42.630
And the judge just closed
it down because afraid

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:45.770
of that testimony just
getting out there in the world.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.850
Now it's already out there
in the world, anyone can walk

01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:49.710
into that courtroom
and see the testimony

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:52.990
but there was something different
about it being digitally reproduced

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:56.310
and then on every social
media platform in the country.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:09:00.880
And there is a difference in kind
in that, and if I was testifying

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.280
and knew that was possible
I'd feel differently.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.050
And I think the courtroom has to be

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:11.600 position:56%
about the people whose interests are
involved first before anything else.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:17.660
So I've changed my mind about that.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:23.870
&gt;&gt; Hi. Do you have any particular
films that you find have changed --

01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:28.310
so when I think of a film like Jaws
I now am scared to go in the water.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:29.610
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Yes, right.

01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:34.150
&gt;&gt; It has completely shifted the
mindset of many of us I think,

01:09:34.150 --> 01:09:40.600 position:56%
and do you find that there are films
that have distorted law so much

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.820
that it takes the law
profession a long time to recover,

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:47.770
like it takes a long time for
me to go back into the water?

01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:53.110
Because it scared us so
much or changed the view?

01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:54.410
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Yes.

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:55.710
No, it's a good question.

01:09:55.710 --> 01:10:01.600
I don't know if I - I think
about them as collections

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.030
of films and not as any one.

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:07.830
But you're right about Jaws,
you're right about that.

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:10.720
&gt;&gt; It takes a long time to
recover from that experience.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.020
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Right.

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.320
&gt;&gt; It's out there for
20, 30 years now.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:18.240
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: So I mean, right
- I mean there are styles of film

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.150
about the criminal defendant,

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:22.470
the wrongfully accused
criminal defendant,

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:25.390 position:56%
for example, that people talk about.

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:30.370
I haven't written about this, but
other people have, that that story

01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:33.690
of the wrongfully accused was part

01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:38.800
of the impetus behind
innocent project

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.720
and criminal defense movements.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.450
And so that it's not that it's
had time - you had to get over it,

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:49.960
but that it - the commentary
actually provided the fuel for some

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.320
of these other movements.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.900
I have to think - I don't know
if other people have thoughts

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:59.450
on law movies that
are scarring that way?

01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:05.400
Dead Man Walking, oh, didn't change
death penalty stuff here, no.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:12.150
Yes, yes, oh, that's a good movie.

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:18.310 position:56%
I sometimes have clips from Dead Man
Walking in presentations like this

01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:21.310
because the perspectives
Dead Man Walking uses,

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:26.140 position:56%
the camera shoots the execution both
from the side through the glass,

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:29.950
but also from the top of
the ceiling when he's dying,

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:31.800
so you have these different
- I'm getting goosebumps -

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.320
you have these different
perspectives on who is watching

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.650 position:56%
at that moment and it's really good.

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:44.950
I'd love to hear favorite
films from you all.

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:47.370
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Why don't you
shout out some favorite legal films

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:49.980
that you have or memorable ones?

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:51.280
&gt;&gt; Shawshank.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.830
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey:
Oh, Shawshank is good,

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:54.430
wrongfully accused, there you go.

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:55.730
&gt;&gt; Thin Blue Line.

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:57.030
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Thin
Blue Line is really good,

01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:58.680
taught in so many classes all over.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.980
It's really good.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.280
&gt;&gt; Anatomy.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.580
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey:
Anatomy of a Murderer,

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.500
based on a true story, yes.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:08.930
Upper Peninsula Michigan, anybody
from Upper Peninsula Michigan?

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:10.230
Yes.

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.790
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Any others?

01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:17.040
&gt;&gt; I have a question about ...

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.070
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey:
Wait, you need a mike.

01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:20.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Justice Delayed.

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:28.510
&gt;&gt; I was a huge Good Wife fan,
too, and I was curious it seemed

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:30.890
like all the judges were so quirky.

01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:35.490
Not all of them, but many
of them had these strange,

01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:37.860
you know, like in my opinion.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.160
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Right.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:42.050
&gt;&gt; And is that typical, I mean?

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:45.230
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Judges
are - so if you were to plot

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:49.180
out the characters in trial
films it's either lawyer focused,

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:52.910 position:56%
in which case the lawyer is
reasonable and the judges are crazy,

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:56.060
or it's the other way around, the
judges are the reasonable people

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.650
and the lawyers are crazy.

01:12:57.650 --> 01:13:01.620
It's rarely both of those things at
the same time, except in very few.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.790 position:56%
So in In Justice for All, for
example, that's the one I showed you

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:09.810
with the judge with the gun,
everyone is crazy in that film.

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:11.890
But they're often opposed
to one another,

01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:14.280
which I think is interesting.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.740
It's much easier, so often
the judge is a telltale sign

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:23.500
of how the law is going to
work, so if the judge is a woman

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:30.080
or is not white for example,
often the - this is post 1980 -

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.130
like the courtroom is a good place
to be, fairness will resolve.

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:37.560 position:56%
I mean it's sort of interesting, you
now start watching and you'll see

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.860
that that's totally true.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.890
And it's even true in
The Good Wife actually,

01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:45.020
they're usually like the win signs.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:58.010
&gt;&gt; I watch a lot of British legal
dramas, do you have a comparison

01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:01.230
between the way they
treat law and US shows?

01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:03.310
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: No, I'm
totally ignorant of them.

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:04.610
Which are your favorite?

01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:06.810
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm trying to ...

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:10.370
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: I mean there
are people devoted to them, I know,

01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:15.130
I'm not, I just don't - not
an expert in them, at all.

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:17.650
It's so different, I mean
the people talk about Witness

01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:20.620
for the Prosecution as one
of these great trial films.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.920
I didn't feature it here.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:26.010
It's a completely different way of
understanding the adversary process

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:30.980
and because the adversary
process is so part of the story

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:34.850
of the legal hero that I'm
telling, the American legal hero,

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:36.980
it's very different in Britain.

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:40.710
But I'd be interested
for the comparison.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:44.590
How come you like them so much?

01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:49.140
&gt;&gt; Well, I just find it interesting
to see a different system

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:53.150
and where the prosecutor and
the defense attorney are sort

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:57.900
of seated together and the
defendant is standing up in a box.

01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.200
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Yes, right.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.630
&gt;&gt; And the judge has a wig.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:01.930
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Right.

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.230
&gt;&gt; Well, so did the ...

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:05.030
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Right,
it's a very different cast

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:06.850
of characters and intentions.

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:13.090
&gt;&gt; The prosecutors can be
defense attorneys in other trials.

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.650
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey:
Right, right, right,

01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:19.320
it sets up different plot lines.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.600
&gt;&gt; Given what you said a few
minutes ago about your concerns

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.850
about the power of video in today's
world, can you envision a framework

01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:35.250
in which bodycam film, particularly
worn by police officers,

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:39.940
can be made a healthy
addition to the legal system?

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:43.610
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Yes, I
mean I think it could today.

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:47.670
I mean even I watch so I have an
almost 12 year old and an eight

01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:51.830
and a half year old, and the way
they communicate through computers

01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:54.430
and text is so much more
sophisticated than I do,

01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:56.330
although I've been living
with it a lot longer.

01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:59.460
And so I have a lot of faith
that people who are grown

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:05.320 position:56%
into the new technologies understand
the nuances a lot better than people

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.850
who are learning it
like a second language.

01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:12.190
And so I do think that - I mean
the problem is that law is an old

01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:14.170
and conservative profession.

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:19.690
The people who are doing the most
important judging prosecution cases

01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:24.700
usually are not using the
most sophisticated tools

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.380
or the technologists.

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.930
And so I think, I can imagine it

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:31.430
because I think eventually
all the people

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:35.450
who are making those decisions
will have experienced technology

01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:38.080
as a first language rather
than - or visual technology

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.560
as a first language rather
than a second language.

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.140
What I have advocated
and I've worked

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:47.290
on are whenever video
evidence or, yes,

01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:52.000
mostly video evidence is admitted
that you have very strict rules

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.670
of how juries are instructed on it
or how judges are instructed on it

01:16:56.670 --> 01:16:58.590
or where all the outtakes are.

01:16:58.590 --> 01:17:01.130
You just have to learn to
ask the right questions

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:03.450
about what you're seeing,
and that's just not something

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:07.580
that most people understand to ask.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:13.100
Best practices, for example, would
be that when you have a dash cam

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.730 position:56%
or when you have police video that
you have more than one on the scene.

01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:20.320
Most of the time --
there are several,

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.290
several cases where from
one angle what looks

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:27.980
like a gun is actually a phone,
for example, and you can see

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.710
that clearly from the
different perspective,

01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:32.870
from a different camera placed.

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:36.500
Knowing that that is
important is just part of how

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.400
to use the visual technology
smartly, but not knowing

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.250
to ask about that is a problem.

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:47.590
So I do, I think it will
happen, just slowly.

01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:50.690
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm sorry.

01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:55.380
Are you familiar with the film,
The Exorcism of Emily Rose?

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.680
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: No.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.380
&gt;&gt; It's sort of based on
an anthropological study

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:03.460 position:56%
of the exorcism of Anneliese Michel.

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.240 position:56%
But I was curious, particularly with
one of the comments that you made

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.740 position:56%
about each one of us being a critic,
there's a scene where there's sort

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:17.520
of an adversarial role between an
anthropologist and psychiatrist

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.990
and they're sort of weighing I
guess the testimony that's being

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:23.450
offered there.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:25.750
And I was wondering if
you could possibly talk

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:32.130
about how a judge interprets
or makes a hierarchical call

01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:35.610
on the sort of testimony
that's offered?

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:39.940
So a lot of times we think of
anthropology and humanities sort

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:47.610
of people see them as lighter as
opposed to hard science, medicine.

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:48.910
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Yes.

01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:52.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And I figure with your background
in literature you could probably ...

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.580
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Right.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.240
No, I appreciate the comment.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.980
Right. So judges will instruct all
evidence should be treated the same

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.280
unless, you know?

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:05.730
I mean there's instruction on the
non-hierarchy of certain things,

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:12.290
but of course and we believe that
juries follow those instructions.

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:19.210 position:56%
I think what you're suggesting is we
come to the judgment mode with all

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:24.150
of these other preconceived ideas
of the hierarchy of knowledge and,

01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:27.040
right - so that one of the
things I am very worried

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.490
about is the privilege
that's given certain forms

01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:32.010
of evidence over others.

01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:35.670
So you'll have a video and then
you'll have a live witness saying

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:39.420
something different about the
video, and the video always wins.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:40.720
Why is that?

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.640
Well, because witnesses
can lie and videos can't.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.370
Well, that's just not
the way it works.

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:52.370 position:56%
Videos don't lie, they don't have
intent, but they're not always clear

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:56.030
as to what they mean and they
might mean something very different

01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:59.750
if you had figured out what
came before and what came after.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:04.410 position:56%
And the example I give is
videotaped confessions, so this is -

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:09.200
to answer your question - so
here is psychological evidence,

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:12.910
experimental evidence where
you have a confession,

01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:17.550
a videotaped confession
that's filmed straight on,

01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:20.600
just the person speaking
to the camera.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.800
The confession is perceived
as truthful and voluntary.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:30.070
You have the same exact
confession filmed from an angle

01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:34.080
with including one of the
interrogators, so it's an angle

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.750
and you see half of a
face of the interrogator,

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:39.310
that same exact confession
is perceived

01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:41.530 position:56%
as less voluntary and less truthful.

01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:43.360
It's the exact same confession.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.220
So that kind of evidence, that kind

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:48.960
of experimental evidence should
debunk the hierarchy of -

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.190
because then you could have the
witness saying what I said I didn't

01:20:52.190 --> 01:20:54.780
mean or I didn't exactly say it
that way, but they're not going

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.730
to believe you because they
see the straight on confession.

01:20:57.730 --> 01:21:01.890
But that kind of evidence can be
very powerful to undermine it.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:10.770
&gt;&gt; I was just going to mention
one of my favorite films,

01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:13.650
it's not really a trial film,
it's more an evidence film,

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:15.470
The Conversation, Francis
Ford Coppola film.

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.280
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey:
Oh, yes, that's great.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.400
&gt;&gt; It kind of ties into
what you were just saying.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.140
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: Yes,
that's a great film, yes.

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:24.470
&gt;&gt; Could you explain a little bit
to the audience who is not familiar

01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:28.110
with the film why is
it significant that -

01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:31.690
the amount of information he
gets draws one conclusion,

01:21:31.690 --> 01:21:34.520
and then as he continues
to fill in the gaps ...

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: The gaps you draw
a completely different conclusion.

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:39.820
This is a lot like - it's the
style of Roshomon, if people know

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:43.290
that story, that film,
Akira Kurosawa, where -

01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:47.220
this is really just a
story that you hear pieces

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:50.320
and then you get more information
and all of a sudden your idea

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.930
of what the story is about and
how it's going to end changes.

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:56.560
Kurosawa's film was the same thing,
it's the story of a murderer told

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.210
by one person and you're
completely convinced,

01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:02.180
and then told from the
perspective of a different person

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:06.050 position:56%
and it's a completely different
story but it's about the same event.

01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:09.730
And then you're told a third story
that sounds completely different

01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:12.440
about the same event that gives
you a different idea of guilt

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.920
and innocence and liability.

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.410
And Kurosawa made that
film in '80, 1980?

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:18.710
&gt;&gt; 1950.

01:22:18.710 --> 01:22:22.300
&gt;&gt; Jessica Silbey: 1950, yes,
I was thinking '80 is wrong.

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.480
So that the idea of withholding,
back to the conversation

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:29.050
about withholding, about what
is the whole truth, you know,

01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:32.220 position:56%
the difference between what we
hear, the narrative, and what we see

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.650
versus what actually happened.

01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:38.060
All of those film questions on
a regular basis, film questions,

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:42.960
and ironically the way film is used
a lot of the time in law, however,

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.810
is to not question it at all,
just exactly the opposite

01:22:46.810 --> 01:22:52.940 position:56%
of how it became such a wonderful
and playful medium of entertainment.

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.240
Anyway, thank you very much.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.540
[applause]

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:56.840
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Please join me

01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.280
in thanking Professor
Silbey one more time.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.260
I also want to thank my
colleagues, Rob Stone

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:06.580
and Lea Cavalla [Assumed Spelling],
who really made this event possible

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.270
and have planning it
for several months.

01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:12.300
There is going to be a videotape
so you can hear it again,

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:16.300
but also tell your friends to go
to The Library of Congress website

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:19.570
and see and hear this
wonderful presentation,

01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:21.720 position:56%
which will also be closed captioned.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.360
And I thank all of
you, the audience,

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.310
for attending the event today.

01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:28.510 position:56%
Thank you so much, Professor Silbey.

01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:33.880
