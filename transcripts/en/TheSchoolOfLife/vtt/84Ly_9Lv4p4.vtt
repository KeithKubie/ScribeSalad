00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
It seems very strange to make a case for hugging.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.680
After all, hugging has become deeply fashionable;

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.820
it’s viewed as an expansive alternative to the handshake,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.200
intended to suggest a flatteringly warm-blooded informality.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.020
Like the peck on both cheeks, a hug is now something you can do at the office or with someone you’re only meeting for the second time:

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.720
in other words, it’s grown into a sentimental token of chumminess that means more or less nothing.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.420
Which is a pity, because in its essence, hugging is of deep and poignant significance.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.380
The central time for hugging is early childhood.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.120
Up to about the age of four, a child may be frequently held, cradled, patted and carried.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.160
We accept that a little person can’t manage the trials of existence on their own.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.320
There will be times when they are overwhelmed and in need of a big person to take the strain.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.200
The young child can’t be helped by explanations and reasons; they can respond to touch alone.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.240
But as we grow towards adulthood, independence and self-reliance become key

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.840
and the sort of hugs we once knew recede.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.020
The chummy office hug is all we’re left with.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.620
We're taught to be wary of any suggestion of needing a wiser, stronger person to look after us.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.400
One of our most taboo political ideas is paternalism:

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.500
the admission of a collective desire be be parented which is taken to be profoundly humiliating.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.680
And yet to suggest that we continue to need the proper, older kind of hug

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.060
is to insist that we go on being, at points, rather like the children we once were,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.440
that is, people who can’t cope on their own.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.560
To be in need of a hug is to admit, in shorthand:

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.600
'I feel, at the moment, terrifyingly small – and need someone else to be, for a while, like a parent’.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.600
It’s tricky to admit how normal and reasonable regressive tendencies are.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.020
They can seem like an affront to individualism and dignity,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.960
but there can be no genuine maturity without an accommodation with the childhood self.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.960
It can be helpful to come across profoundly dignified and prestigious cultural objects that take the need for hugs very seriously indeed.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.720
In a late work, the Mystical Nativity, Sandro Botticelli (a great observer of the parent child hug)

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.140
shows us a group of angels hugging adult humans.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.760
Botticelli was hugely sensitive to the way failure and fear are always edging their way into every life...

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.800
irrespective of how sunny it might look from the outside.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.460
Few of us can sadly now believe that angels are actually going to help us out,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.060
but we retain a theoretical need for them nevertheless.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.440
The capacity to regress should belong within every good loving relationship:

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.960
it’s a sign that someone feels safe enough with you (and you with them) to allow themselves to be seen in a pathetically vulnerable state.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.840
We’ve been too keen to exorcise looking after another person when they are fragile or broken from our vision of relationships;

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.220
but true love is as much about sympathy for the vulnerabilities as it is about admiration for the strengths.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.300
Today it's pretty well understood that not getting enough sex may be a strangely intense problem,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.100
leading to feelings of stress, disconnection and difficulties with concentration.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.800
Not getting enough of the right sort of hugs should be recognised as no less serious.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.280
A hug is a symbol of everything we tend to sorely miss in our hyper-individualistic achievement-centered culture:

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.980
a chance safely to admit, for a moment, to our total dependence on another person.
