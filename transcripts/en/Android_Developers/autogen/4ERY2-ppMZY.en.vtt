reach and coverage alone are not enough
 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.520
reach and coverage alone are not enough
we want to optimize the purchase

around the globe so Google Play is a

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:12.790
around the globe so Google Play is a
 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.660
around the globe so Google Play is a
global commerce platform and that's

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670
global commerce platform and that's

outside of the country that your app is
 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.220
outside of the country that your app is
being developed in so I want to talk to

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.230
being developed in so I want to talk to
 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.650
being developed in so I want to talk to
you a little bit about the way that we

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660
you a little bit about the way that we
 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.670
you a little bit about the way that we
think about optimization now we think

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680
think about optimization now we think
 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.670
think about optimization now we think
about it as applied effort over time we

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680
about it as applied effort over time we
 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.600
about it as applied effort over time we
are constantly improving the platform so

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.610
are constantly improving the platform so
 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.580
are constantly improving the platform so
Google Play obviously is a very widely

the purchase flow every single month in

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360
the purchase flow every single month in
 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.150
the purchase flow every single month in
our back-end systems we upgrade every

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160
our back-end systems we upgrade every
 

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.010
our back-end systems we upgrade every
single week parts of our back-end system

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.020
single week parts of our back-end system
 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.100

is always learning it's always improving

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:02.710
is always learning it's always improving
 

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.080
is always learning it's always improving
and what that means for you as a

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.090
and what that means for you as a
 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.940
and what that means for you as a
developer is that's how we fulfill the

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:05.950
developer is that's how we fulfill the
 

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.220
developer is that's how we fulfill the
promise from last year to this year that

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:08.230
promise from last year to this year that
 

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.060
promise from last year to this year that
our purchase flow is a little bit faster

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.070
our purchase flow is a little bit faster
 

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.860
our purchase flow is a little bit faster
converts a little bit better and is a

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:13.870
converts a little bit better and is a
 

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.790
converts a little bit better and is a
little bit more of the

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:15.800
little bit more of the
 

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.010
little bit more of the
and so this is what we do for the

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:18.020
and so this is what we do for the
 

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.719
and so this is what we do for the
platform on your behalf writing code is

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:19.729
platform on your behalf writing code is
 

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:21.969
platform on your behalf writing code is
fun not writing code and getting the

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:21.979
fun not writing code and getting the
 

00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:25.059
fun not writing code and getting the
same result also fun deleting code

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:25.069
same result also fun deleting code
 

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:27.129
same result also fun deleting code
that's expert mode but you know we'll

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:27.139
that's expert mode but you know we'll
 

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:29.429
that's expert mode but you know we'll
talk about that later

00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:29.439
talk about that later
 

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:32.259
talk about that later
so I want to talk about a little model

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:32.269
so I want to talk about a little model
 

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:34.719
so I want to talk about a little model
that we use to think about optimizing

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:34.729
that we use to think about optimizing
 

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:37.329
that we use to think about optimizing
our purchase flow and this works with

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:37.339
our purchase flow and this works with
 

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:39.850
our purchase flow and this works with
your applications as well now we think

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:39.860
your applications as well now we think
 

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.980
your applications as well now we think
about commerce obviously I love commerce

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:41.990
about commerce obviously I love commerce
 

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.259
about commerce obviously I love commerce
but there are other ways to monetize in

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:44.269
but there are other ways to monetize in
 

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:45.759
but there are other ways to monetize in
your application as well this works for

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:45.769
your application as well this works for
 

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:48.280
your application as well this works for
advertising this works for purchases

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.290
advertising this works for purchases
 

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.350
advertising this works for purchases
even outside of commerce but this is the

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360
even outside of commerce but this is the
 

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.550
even outside of commerce but this is the
model that we use we think about

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560
model that we use we think about
 

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.600
model that we use we think about
friction and motivation now motivation

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:55.610
friction and motivation now motivation
 

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.720
friction and motivation now motivation
is anything that gives your users

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:57.730
is anything that gives your users
 

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.519
is anything that gives your users
incentive to make a purchase so maybe

now friction is anything that can stop

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:23.779
now friction is anything that can stop
 

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:25.960
now friction is anything that can stop
that purchase from happening the fact

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:25.970
that purchase from happening the fact

that purchase from happening the fact
friction is also anything that can even

friction is also anything that can even

friction is also anything that can even
slow that purchase down now some

little bit less subtle or a little bit
 

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.500
little bit less subtle or a little bit
more subtle is things like the number of

more subtle is things like the number of
clicks so the number of screens that a

checkout but so then they looked at the

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800
checkout but so then they looked at the
 

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.740
checkout but so then they looked at the
other cohort the other high-value user

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:27.750
other cohort the other high-value user
 

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.440

this but the key point is you should be

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.190
this but the key point is you should be
 

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.630
this but the key point is you should be
doing it and then looking at these users

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:20.640
doing it and then looking at these users
 

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.360
doing it and then looking at these users
who are not in the top 95% what they saw

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:23.370
who are not in the top 95% what they saw
 

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.090
who are not in the top 95% what they saw
was that when they dug into this 84

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100
was that when they dug into this 84

weren't getting any further than the
 

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:36.949
weren't getting any further than the
home screen right why right

00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959
home screen right why right
 

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.750
