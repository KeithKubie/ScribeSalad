00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.510
I've hopefully given you a bit
of a gut feeling behind where

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.180
the formula of Gibbs Free
Energy comes from.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.039
In this video I want to do
something a little bit more

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.320
rigorous and actually,
I guess you could

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.270
say derive the formula.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.620
So to do that, let's just study
two systems that have

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.660
the exact same change
in entropy.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.195
To depict that, I'll get out
our handy PV diagram.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.160
What we're going to do is we're
going to compare two

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.020
systems. One that's this
perfect, reversible system and

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.860
one that's irreversible or
a spontaneous system.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.020
So they're both going
to start here.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.990
They're going to go from this
point on the PV diagram to

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.260
this point right here.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.980
And before we go into exactly
what they're doing, I think

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.490
it's a good review to kind
of talk about what an

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.730
irreversible process and
what a reversible

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.120
process really is.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.920
An irreversible process is this
theoretical thing where

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.950
you have no friction, where
you're always so close to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.950
equilibrium that you can
always go backwards.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.004
You're always-- you can kind of
view that the reaction is

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.010
never really proceeding
forward or backwards.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.960
Although obviously it is moving,
so it's a very-- it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.820
actually doesn't really exist
in nature, but it's a useful

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.000
theoretical construct.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.880
So let me draw a little.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.870
So if this is a-- I'll get
the good old pistons out.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.530
So let's say this is an--
I'll do it twice.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.870
So that's my irreversible
piston-- That'll be my

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.810
reversible, this is going
to be my irreversible.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.480
Let me draw them.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.820
OK, and let me label them.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.270
So this right here is going
to be reversible.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.240
And this right here is going
to be irreversible.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.305
Or it could also be considered
spontaneous.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.710
Using the key word.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.580
That's going to matter for
Gibbs Free Energy.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.740
But all spontaneous reactions
are irreversible.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.870
So they're going to go from
this state to this state.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.220
So in our reversible
world, we have this

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.900
little cap to our piston.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.350
And we have our gas in here,
exerting some pressure.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.470
And what we'd have is
a bunch of pebbles.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.759
We have a bunch of
pebbles out here.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.080
And we slowly remove the
pebbles one by one.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.010
And as we remove the pebbles,
our piston-- or this movable

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.990
ceiling up here-- will
move upwards.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.390
It'll move upwards.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.020
So the pressure will push up,
but as we move up, we will

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.590
have lower and lower pressure
because the gases will bounce

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.110
into the surface less.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.500
And we'll have a higher,
higher volume.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.150
So as we move each
infinitesimally small grain of

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.730
sand, and we're going to do it
super slow, that we're always

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.600
infinitely close
to equilibrium.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.270
We're going to move from this
state to this state.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.470
And even better, let's view that
this is the first stage

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.530
of our Carnot cycle.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.270
Let's say in either case, we're
on top of a reservoir.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.470
So in either case, both of these
systems are on top of

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.980
this infinite reservoir that
has a temperature T1.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.650
And what that does it keeps
the temperature constant.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.140
So we're going to travel
along an isotherm.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.870
Because normally if we were to
remove these things and if we

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.130
just allowed it to occur
adiabatically, we would

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.620
actually lose temperature.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.360
We would actually lose
average kinetic

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.910
energy as work is done.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.940
But in this case we have
this reservoir.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.220
So heat is just going to be
transferred to my system.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.510
Heat is going to
be transferred.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.230
So let me call that QR.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.490
Right?

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.250
If the reservoir wasn't here,
our temperature would go down.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.940
But since we do have the
reservoir, we will constantly

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.220
be transferring heat.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.900
And we've seen this.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.410
This is just the first phase
of the Carnot cycle.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.500
We'll move along an isotherm
like this.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.430
This is the reversible case.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.300
And the only reason why we can
even draw the state at every

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.590
point here is because reversible
processes are

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.480
quasistatic.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.740
They're always infinitely
close to equilibrium.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.510
And when we say reversible,
we're also saying there's no

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.840
friction between this little
piston in the cylinder.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.363
That if we put a grain of sand
back, it'll go exactly to

00:04:00.363 --> 00:04:01.260
where it was before.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.890
And no energy was lost
because there was no

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.450
heat of friction there.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.650
So this is what the graph
of the reversible

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.460
process would look like.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.670
Now what does the graph of the
error irreversible-- Well,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.110
actually no.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.410
I won't draw the graph, but
let's talk about what the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.050
irreversible process is
going to be like.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.600
So it's going to look similar.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.680
It's going to look like that.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.760
It's going to have
its gases there.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.830
But for the sake of an argument,
to get from that

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.810
state to that state, instead of
moving the pebbles one by

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.220
one, let's say I have
these big blocks.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.240
And when I remove one of these
big blocks, I go from that

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.440
state to that state.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.470
But obviously all hell
breaks loose.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.280
So I'm not really defined in
this in between state.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.420
But I definitely go from that
state to that state once I go

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.920
back to equilibrium.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.420
Now the other key thing in the
irreversible process-- and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.880
every real process in our world
is irreversible-- is

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.210
that you're going to
have friction here.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.320
As this moves up, it's going to
rub against the side of the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.690
container and generate
heat of friction.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.980
So let me call that
heat of friction.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.100
So let me ask you a question.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.220
If, in this case, Q sub R had
to be added to the system to

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.960
maintain its temperature, what's
going to be the Q sub

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.200
irreversible here?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.200
How much has to be added to this
system in order to keep

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.280
it at the constant
temperature T1?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.840
Will it have to be more or less
than what was added to

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.870
the reversible system?

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.480
Well this guy, as this piston
moves up, he's generating some

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.530
of his own heat.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.410
So if this was an adiabatic
process, he wouldn't lose as

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.210
much temperature as
this guy would.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.210
So he's going to need less heat
from the reservoir in

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.400
order to maintain
his temperature.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.760
At T1.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.220
In order to get to this
point on the isotherm.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.310
Remember, this irreversible
process, we don't know what

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.010
happens over here.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.960
He might be travelling
on some crazy path.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.570
In fact, we can't even define
the path, because it goes out

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.580
of equilibrium.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.670
So it's going to be
some crazy thing.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.830
But we know it pops back on the
PV diagram right there.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.810
But because it's generating some
of its own heat from the

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.255
friction, it's going to need
less heat from the reservoir.

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:09.270
So let me write that down.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.050
The heat absorbed by the
reversible process is going to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.050
be greater than the heat
absorbed by the

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.180
irreversible process.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.790
And that's because the
irreversible process is

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.760
generating friction.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.960
Fair enough.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.690
Now what is the change in
entropy for both systems?

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.500
Well they both started here.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.720
And they both ended here.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.520
And entropy is a
state variable.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.220
So the change in entropy for
the reversible process is

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:47.150
going to be equal to the change
in entropy for the

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.650
irreversible process.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.290
They're both going from
there to there.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.460
And obviously the entropy
has changed.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.850
We're going from one state
to another state.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.620
And the entropy, well I won't
go too much into it.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.720
But let's ask another
question.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.190
What is the total change in
entropy of the universe for

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.380
the reversible process?

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.640
So for the universe, that's
going to be-- Our universe

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.960
here is the reservoir
in our system.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.040
So let me write here.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.240
Reversible.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.260
I don't want to run
out of space.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.670
Let me see, I'll do it
in a different color.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.700
So this is the reversible
process.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.510
So the change in entropy of the
universe is equal to the

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.050
change in entropy of our
reversible process plus the

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.390
change in entropy of-- oh, I
already used R for reversible,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.670
so let's call it the reserv--
well, the first three letters

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.350
are the same, so let me call
it of our environment.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.900
Right?

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.195
And then the reversible process,
the change in entropy

00:07:46.195 --> 00:07:49.436
of our reversible process is
the heat added for our

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:50.370
reversible process.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.730
And we can use this definition
because it is

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.890
a reversible process.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.690
It's that over T1.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.500
And then what's the change in
entropy of our environment?

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.830
Well it's giving away Q sub R.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.230
Right?

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.850
So its heat absorbed
is minus Q sub R.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.700
And, of course, it's at a
constant temperature.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.180
It is a heat reservoir.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.540
It's at T1.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.090
So it equals 0.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.510
It equals 0.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.440
Interesting.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.990
So actually I should take
a little side note here.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.500
That, the change in entropy of
the universe for a reversible

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.440
process is 0.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.590
And actually that should make
a lot of intuitive sense

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.040
because the whole point of a
reversal process is you could

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.370
go in this direction, or you
could go in that direction.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.360
It's always so close people to
equilibrium you can move in

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360
either direction.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.890
And if the entropy was greater
than 0 in one direction, it

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.289
would have to be less than
0 on the other direction.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.540
So it wouldn't be able to go in
the other direction by the

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.550
second law of thermodynamics.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.110
So it actually makes sense
that the entropy of the

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.390
universe-- the change in entropy
of the universe, not

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.270
just of the system--
when a reversible

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.000
process occurs, is 0.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.860
Let's see if we can relate
that to the irreversible

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.490
process So if I wanted to
figure out the change in

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.750
entropy of the irreversible
process-- What's the change in

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.870
entropy of the irreversible
process?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:15.130
And then let me subtract from
that the heat that was taken

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.200
away from the reservoir, from
the irreversible process, Q

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.300
sub IR, and of course
all this over T1.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.870
What is this going to be equal
to in relation to 0?

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.350
Remember this is an

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.980
irreversible, spontaneous process.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.770
Well, this value, the
irreversible process is

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.220
starting here and going there.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.010
So its change in delta S is the
exact same thing as that.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.460
Change in delta S is the same
as the reversible process.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.130
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.810
Now, I just told you that since
there's some heat of

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.810
friction, this guy has to take
in less heat from the

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.550
reservoir than this guy.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.380
So if this-- and I
wrote it here.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.940
I mean, let me clean this
thing up a little bit.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.670
I wrote it right here.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.530
Q sub IR, the heat that the
irreversible process has to

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.570
take from the reservoir, because
generating its own

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.160
heat from friction, is less
than the heat from the

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.610
reversal process.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:14.150
So this number, right here, is
less than this number here.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.360
Or you could view it this way.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.560
This number here was
equal to this.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.560
So this number here is going
to be less than this.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:31.870
So this has to be greater than
0 for the irreversible,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:38.150
spontaneous process.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.130
Now let's just do a little
bit of mathematics.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.340
So this is the heat that was
essentially given to the

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.910
irreversible system.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.600
It's a minus here because
this is the term.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.220
It's kind of taken away from
the actual reservoir.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.650
So let's just do a little bit
of-- let's just multiply all

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.825
sides of this equation by T1.

00:10:56.825 --> 00:11:04.980
And we get T1 times delta S of
the irreversible process minus

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.000
Q of the irreversible process
is greater than 0.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.550
Now, well, let's just--
So what is this?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.220
How can we say this?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.680
But let's actually just multiply
both sides of this by

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.420
negative 1.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.590
And remember, this
is true for any

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.090
irreversible, spontaneous process.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.450
If you multiply both
sides of this by

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.680
negative 1, you get this.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.970
The heat added to the
irreversible process minus T

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.990
times delta S of the
irreversible process is going

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.200
to be less than 0.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.840
This is true for any

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.230
irreversible, spontaneous process.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.080
And at this point,
this should look

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.320
reasonably familiar to you.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.240
When we wrote the Gibbs Free
Energy formula, we said change

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.950
in G is equal to delta H
minus T times delta S.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.310
And we said that if this is less
than 0, then we have a

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.560
spontaneous process.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.510
And this all makes sense.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.590
Because these two are equivalent
to each other.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.750
What's the only difference
here?

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.710
Here we wrote heat added
to the system.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.260
Here we wrote change
in enthalpy.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.400
And I've done three or four
videos right now, where I say

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.860
that change in enthalpy is equal
to the heat added to a

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.560
system, as long as we're
dealing with a constant

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.270
pressure system.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.750
So we get this result just by
comparing a irreversible to a

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.560
reversible system.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.750
And this is true for all

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.790
irreversible, spontaneous processes.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.100
And then if we assume that we're
dealing with a constant

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.130
pressure system-- so you can
forget a little bit of what I

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.072
just drew, because we know
that this is true, and we

00:12:42.072 --> 00:12:44.420
assume constant pressure--
then we get to this.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.720
And then we know that if
something is spontaneous, then

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.590
this right here must
be less than 0.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.590
So hopefully you found that
a little bit interesting.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.320
Actually I'll do one
more point here.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.390
This kind of gels with the
idea that second law of

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.810
thermodynamics tells us that for
any spontaneous process,

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:10.400
delta S is going to be greater
than or equal-- or well for

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.330
any spontaneous process, is
going to be greater than 0.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.090
Because although this right
here isn't the formal

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.390
definition of entropy, because
we're not dealing with a

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.510
reversible process here,
you can kind of

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.500
think of it that way.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.100
And so, at least, on an
intuitive level it gets you

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.350
there, that we have delta
S greater than 0.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.270
And I won't fixate on that too
much, because what I did

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.890
earlier in the video is more
rigorous than what I'm heading

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:35.560
to right now.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.820
So hopefully that gives you a
sense of where you can get to

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.140
the Gibbs Free Energy formula,
and how it drives spontaneous

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.900
reactions from just our basic
understanding of what

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.790
reversible and irreversible
processes are, and how they

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.830
relate to entropy and heat
exchange and enthalpy.
