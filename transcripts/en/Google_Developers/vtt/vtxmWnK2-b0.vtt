FRANCIS MA: Welcome
to our session on Grow

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.850
your app with Google identity.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.180
My name is Francis Ma and I'm a
product manager on the Google+

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.377
platform team.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:12.960
JENNIFER LIN: My
name is Jennifer Lin,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.684
and I'm the engineering lead
on the Google+ platform team.

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:18.600
FRANCIS MA: So today
we're going to be sharing

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.680
10 insights with you guys on
how you can grow and engage

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.960
your audience via Google.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.770
These insights or actionable,
they're easy to implement,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.960
and they help you tap into
the array of Google platform

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.200
services ranging from things
like search, Google+, YouTube,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.440
and more.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.900
So let's get started.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.900
JENNIFER LIN: All right.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.530
Oftentimes when users
are looking for something

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.490
they start on Google search.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.420
This makes Google search
a prominent entry point

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.600
for users.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.740
As developers, you're looking
to grow your audience.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.880
So some of you may want
to get more visibility

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.130
on Google search.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.330
Well, our very
first insight helps

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.740
you increase
visibility in search

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.740
so you can be
discovered more easily.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.930
All you have to do is create
a Google+ page and post fresh

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.280
content about your service.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.780
Then Google search will show
your content on the right hand

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.160
side when users search
for your service.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.140
As you can see, GQ
Magazine already does this.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.040
This is actually really easy for
you to do, no engineers needed.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.960
So think of your Google+ page
as your brand's home on Google.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.420
Using your Google+ page you
can directly control what brand

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.700
content shows up on the
Google search results page.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.540
This is a really
great way for you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.850
to drive traffic to your
website from Google Search

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.352
and you'll reach a lot more
people through Google search.

00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:55.060
FRANCIS MA: So that
was a really easy way

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.170
to get your brand identity
more visible in search.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.190
Another insight is
about app indexing,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.210
which you may have heard
earlier today at the keynote.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.639
So let's talk about a
problem that some of you

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.160
might have as app developers.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.020
When users install
your app oftentimes

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.880
you may find it hard
to re-engage the users,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.110
to keep them sticky,
to come back.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.600
And this problem gets worse,
especially as users install

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.620
more and more apps
and your app might

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.960
have been pushed to say the
fifth page of the App Launcher.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.040
So even though you
might try to come up

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.680
with new updates, new
content, oftentimes the users

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.650
may just not remember and may
not be coming back to your app.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.800
And app indexing is a good
way to solve this problem.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.930
So what app indexing does,
it lets you create deep links

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.070
from Google search
into your native app.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.110
So as you see on an
example on the screen

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.240
there, when I search
for, let's say,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.140
a movie review, because
I have IMDB installed now

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.410
Google search shows
me, hey you can

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.000
view this content in IMDB app.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.050
And when I tap on that I get
deep linked right into the app.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.330
Now as native app developers
this is particularly important

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.700
because you might have
unique experiences

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.470
in the native environment
that you otherwise would not

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.370
have on your mobile website.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.130
So app indexing is
really a good way

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.540
to help bring that users from
search, which is typically

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.360
where they start to
look for content,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.370
and bring that back
into your native app.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.980
Another feature
with app indexing

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.600
that was mentioned
earlier in the keynote

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.410
is the app indexing
API, which also

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.050
lets you programmatically
index your content

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.430
as users are viewing
them or consuming them

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.930
in your native app.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.880
And by using the
app indexing API,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.890
Google search can also show
this user's app history

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.510
in the instant
search suggestions.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.480
So for example,
if I was searching

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.380
for "It's a Wonderful
Life" movie, as I

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.130
type I-T-S Google
would automatically

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.030
suggest to complete the search
history because I'm already

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.600
an existing user of your app.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.959
So this is a really good way
to help drive engagement.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.780
Another benefit of using app
indexing is that you would,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.090
as part of the setup process,
you would have your website

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.240
and also create a listing
in the Google Play store.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.195
Now when you have a
listing on the Google Play

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:35.470
store with your native
app, Google search

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.430
would then also
automatically index that

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.850
and provide another way for
users to discover your app.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.890
So even though users
may not necessarily

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.520
be browsing or searching from
within the Google Play store

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.890
you now have another vector
for users to discover your app.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.590
Switching gears a bit,
we talked about how easy

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.620
it was for you to integrate
with search, another problem

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.030
that you might have is driving
cross-platform engagement

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.210
and growing your users
across these platforms.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.850
Now some of you might have
been in business for many years

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.070
and have been developing
apps starting on the web

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.920
and now as users are
spending more time on mobile

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.730
you're making this pivot.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.880
But the problem is
you've invested a lot

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.970
to get your audience
on the web and now when

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.810
you pivot to mobile
it's like starting

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.426
from scratch all over again.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.800
The app distribution
dynamics are

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.170
very different in the
native app stores,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.590
and to have to restart from
that it's oftentimes costly.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.810
So the good news is we have
an easy way to help you.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.140
The third insight that we're
sharing with you today is

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.220
to integrate Google+ Sign-In.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.105
Now Google+ sign in lets
your users very easily sign

00:05:48.105 --> 00:05:50.640
in to your website without
having to remember another

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.640
credential.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.540
So they can use
their Google account

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.680
and log in to your site.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.060
Now what's special
about that is,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.350
because they use
their Google account

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.030
we can also figure out whether
they're an Android user

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.590
and have your app installed.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.280
In this example you see
on the screen with Fitbit,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.360
when user doesn't
have the app installed

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.750
and I login, what I
see is a prompt for me

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.390
to download the Fitbit app.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.470
And if I say yes the app
gets installed automatically

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.060
on my native phone.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.040
So this happens
in the background

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.950
while I'm still on the
website and engaging.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.150
The user can continue
to resume their session

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.850
and do their thing
on your website,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.480
but then later on when
you switch to mobile,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.720
they would have your
app ready to go.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.140
So this is not like at a later
time, they don't have to fiddle

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.450
and figure out, oh,
what was that app again?

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.110
I have to search for
it in Play store,

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.500
wait a couple
minutes to download.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.600
They have it right there
and then, ready to jump it.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.310
And because users
are very engaged,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.510
they've expressed an intent
to engage on your website,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.690
driving this app install
we've seen very good results.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.350
As an example, one of our
partners, Deezer-- some of you

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.860
might know it's a music
streaming service,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.130
they've seen that on
average 33% of users

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.800
convert when prompted to
install their mobile app.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.300
So if you contrast that to
something like a mobile app

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.920
install ad, you might get
single digits or maybe even

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.430
lower conversion rates.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.020
With this you get 33% conversion
rates and best of all,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.210
it's free.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.060
So Deezer gets really
good results as a result

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.030
from integrating Google Sign-In.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:38.530
Now also because we show this
installation prompt at the time

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.850
when user has engaged
with your website,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.360
the referral is a very
high quality user.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.410
It's not just somebody who has
accidentally clicked on an add

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.547
or might have heard
about your service.

00:07:49.547 --> 00:07:51.880
This is somebody who's already
engaged with your website

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.170
and now are
redirected to mobile.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.240
For Deezer, the
result they see is

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.014
that when users
sign in with Google

00:07:59.014 --> 00:08:00.430
and they download
the app, they're

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.420
twice as more likely to
upgrade to their account.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.940
So this not only helps you
with the app discovery,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.260
but also helps with the
monetization story as well.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.600
Lastly, because with Google+
sign in it's easier for users

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.496
to sign in without having
to remember another log

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.850
in and password, they've seen
a reduction in sign in drop off

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.410
rates.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.070
JENNIFER LIN: So you just saw
how Google+ sign in can give

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.680
you quality Android
app installs.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.890
Now when users open
your Android app,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.309
we wanted to make sure they
get a seamless experience,

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.610
so we automatically
sign in your users

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.820
with their Google account
on your Android app.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.020
Let's take a look at
9Gag as an example.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.770
9Gag.com is a
social media website

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.700
that lets users upload
and share images.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.760
After users sign in
to 9Gag's website

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.660
and install the Android
app over the air,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.480
they're automatically signed in
when they start 9Gag's Android

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.030
app and they're greeted
with a welcome back toast.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.790
So let's think about
how this insight can

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.510
help you grow your
audience across platforms.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.280
Let's say you're building
an e-commerce website

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.970
and mobile app and you notice
your users are abandoning

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.070
their shopping cart
on your website.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.910
So what can you do to
increase purchase conversions?

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.860
Well, since sign in with
Google automatically

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.000
logs in users on your website
and mobile app across devices,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.480
you can help those users when
they're in your mobile app

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.760
continue from
where they left off

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.470
so they can finish
their purchase.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.290
Let's take another example.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.200
Let's say you're
building a news service.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.660
And your users are reading
articles in your mobile app,

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.840
but they don't finish because
their bus ride comes to an end.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.670
Later on they're
on their laptop,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.540
browsing your news website.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.330
Well here you can
help those users pick

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.710
up from where they left off
by showing them the article

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.300
they didn't finish
reading earlier.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.470
So these are just
a few examples,

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.020
but you can apply
this best practice

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.250
to other services
you may be building,

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.470
like a hotel booking service.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.610
And remember any user
with a Google account

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.490
will get this seamless
sign in experience.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.060
And Google accounts include
Gmail users, Google+ users,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.270
Android users, YouTube
users, et cetera.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.000
Fancy is one of our partners
who integrated Google sign

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.680
in earlier last year.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.910
And we have a quote from
Andrew, the executive VP

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.910
of operations at Fancy.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.900
He said that "users
who were signed

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.040
in through Google
more profitable."

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.960
We also want to share with
you their integration results.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.990
Fancy saw that users
who sign in with Google

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.980
spend 14% more than other users.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.150
And those users helped increase
purchase conversion by 20%.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.510
So for more case studies
from our other partners

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.675
you can visit this link
at developers.google.com.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.670
FRANCIS MA: So we
just talked about ways

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.750
to get more visibility
in the search

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.030
and driving more app
installs and connecting users

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.382
across platform.

00:11:17.382 --> 00:11:18.840
Another problem
that you might face

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.140
is when users first
experience your website,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.680
how do you help create a
more engaging experience?

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.580
Now of course, you guys
know that a lot of websites

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.270
are just another click away.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.770
It's very easy for them to
download your competitor's app

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.260
and just go on from there.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.300
So really captivating
that first time experience

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.930
is very important.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.660
And with Sign-In with
Google one of the things

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.280
you get is the ability to
request for the user's profile

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.350
information for things like
name, email, contacts, circles,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.850
et cetera.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.660
So with this you can
do a couple things.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.140
First, for new users
for the on-boarding flow

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.750
you can make that much simpler.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.970
Instead of having to go through
the laborious process of having

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.110
to fill in the user
name, et cetera,

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.030
you can pre-populate
a lot of these things.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.130
As Alexandra here on this
website, she arrives,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.880
she's ready to go.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.500
Another thing you
can do with some

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.570
of the social data like
contacts and circles,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.670
is that you can create a more
engaging social experience.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.790
So for things like if you
have a public oriented service

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:31.310
like a community forum you can
use that to also show people

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.710
that Alexandra
might be connected

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.340
with, friends of
hers, et cetera, who

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.660
are using the service to then
also tailor that experience.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.100
Instead of just showing the
cookie cutter welcome message,

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.950
you might now show,
oh hey, by the way

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.420
your friend Bob and
Jane are here and here

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.800
are some of the other content
that they've generated.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.750
So being able to
capture the user

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.850
to make them easier to on
board to your website and also

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:00.050
present a more engaging,
personalized experience.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.860
It's really good thing.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.820
JENNIFER LIN: So once you get
users engaged in your apps

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.160
that's personalized
just for them,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.180
you should convert these
users into your advocates

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.360
to help you drive viral growth.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.880
And we have the insights
to help you do this,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.160
and also to help you reach users
across the surface of Google.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.460
What you need to do is
integrate sharing to Google+.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.870
And the key insight here is
to facilitate targeted sharing

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.500
to individuals.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.970
Now when users share content
from your website or mobile app

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.320
with their friends, you can
pre-fill their recipients

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.310
right here on the bottom.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.910
And you can do this by
either using your own data,

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.600
or as Francis mentioned
earlier, by getting

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.430
the user's list of
friends from Google.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:55.590
This will make sharing easier
and faster for your users.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.440
Then the share action will
trigger a notification

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.570
to all the recipients.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.960
And all the recipients
will see this notification

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.690
because the notification icon
is visible across all Google

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.040
properties.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.020
So when you enable sharing
to Google+ you can now grow

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.420
your users and re-engage them
whenever they are on Google

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.110
maps, Google+, search,
YouTube, et cetera.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.585
FRANCIS MA: So as an
alternative to pre-populating

00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:30.380
their recipients, you might
not necessarily have the data

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.490
or if you don't want to go to
the extent of integrating some

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.880
of the other API's
is that you can also

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.280
take advantage of
automatic suggestions.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.660
So here's an example of an iOS
app that's integrated share

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.160
Google+.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.820
When they choose to
initiate the share,

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.910
if there is no
recipient pre-populated,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.920
Google would
automatically suggest

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.180
some of the recipients
they can share to.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.330
As an example, let's say I'm a
new user to Google+ and I share

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.120
this and I trigger the share.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.250
Now I might not have connected
with anybody yet on Google+,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.080
but I do get a list of
recommended recipients for me.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.490
So my friend Jay, on
the top left there,

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.544
is shown because
Google's figured out

00:15:16.544 --> 00:15:17.960
that Jay is a close
friend of mine

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.240
through our interactions
across Google.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.120
Perhaps I have exchanged a lot
of emails with him recently,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.840
or I might have interacted with
him through YouTube, et cetera.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.640
So Google would
automatically suggest that.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.330
And if I choose not
to use the suggestion,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.730
if there's somebody specific in
mind that I want to share to,

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.600
the search feature also
lets the users search

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.680
through their local
contacts as well.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.230
So again, even though the
user might be new to Google+,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:53.430
they can use either the
suggested recipients or through

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.830
search to share to people
that they care about.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.630
So of course when the
recipient gets this,

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.900
they too get the
notification across Google,

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.200
whether it's on Gmail,
drive, et cetera.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.210
So the net takeaway here is
that Google makes sharing easy

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.720
and it helps you
grow your audience.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.320
JENNIFER LIN: In addition
to growing and re-engaging

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.010
your users via Google+
sharing and notifications,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.170
there are other key channels
of the Google platform that can

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.140
help you re-engage your users.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.400
And you can easily access
these channels through Google+

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.850
Sign-In.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.280
Let's start with YouTube.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.070
Some of you may have
a YouTube channel,

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.950
but for those who don't, here's
why you may want to get one.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.000
Now when users sign in to
your website or mobile app

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.390
with their Google
account you can also

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.290
ask them to subscribe
to your YouTube channel

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.810
as part of the sign in process.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.710
Then the next time
users visit YouTube

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.730
they'll see videos
from your channel

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.420
alongside other
recommended content.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.370
Your YouTube channel
will also show up

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.570
on their subscription list.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.440
And all this leads to
more views on your videos.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.630
Now YouTube has more than one
billion monthly active users

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.290
and they spend over six
billion hours watching videos,

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.619
so you should really
take this opportunity

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:23.140
to get in front of your users.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.650
Now I'm going to walk you
through a really cool example

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.020
that combines this YouTube
subscription insight

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.790
and the Google search visibility
insight we talked about earlier

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.780
to help you get amazing user
reach across Google search,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.290
YouTube, and your Google+ page.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.640
Let's say you just
released another version

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.340
of your mobile app.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.410
Well, you can upload a video
to your YouTube channel that

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.780
promotes the latest
mobile app release.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.290
Then you can share this
video on your Google+ page,

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.590
and that video post will show
up on the right hand side

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.520
of Google search when
users search for your app.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.620
And users who are subscribed
to your YouTube channel

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.850
will see that same video
when they visit their YouTube

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.410
homepage.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:15.060
So with these insights you can
now reach users across Google

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.560
search, YouTube, and
your Google+ page.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.700
So be creative
with our insights.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.900
Mix and match them to
help you grow your app.

00:18:25.324 --> 00:18:27.740
FRANCIS MA: So in the theme
of being creative and thinking

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.780
about how you can tap into other
Google channels as touch points

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.260
to reach your users,
here's another one.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.130
Now some of you
may have time based

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.730
events associated with your app.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.960
Things like you might have
live streaming video events,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.770
or in this specific
example, Flixster

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.340
offers movie show times.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.760
Now by using Google+ Sign-In
you can also integrate with

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:57.000
the Google calendar API very
easily and create reminder

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.210
events which would then generate
notifications to bring the user

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.140
back.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.520
Now they're a couple
things to take note here.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.640
One, is that you are now
creating a separate touch

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.670
point with the user when
they are not directly

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.750
using your app.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.200
So here's another
good way for you

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.570
to re-engage your user
through Google calendar.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.850
The second part is being
able to just use the calendar

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.200
infrastructure very
easily and for free.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.050
Now this is particularly
more important

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.850
if you're building a mobile web
application where you might not

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.940
have access to
push notifications.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.030
So being able to tap
into calendar as a way

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.810
to drive timely reminders
and bring your user back

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.060
is a really effective feature.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.610
JENNIFER LIN: Let's move
on to other key channels

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:48.040
of the Google Platform that can
help you build your app faster.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.340
Once you've integrated sign
in with Google or Google+ sign

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.370
in, you can use Google Drive
to easily store and retrieve

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.760
user's data.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.240
Think of Google Drive as the
user's personal hard drive

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.140
in the cloud.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.750
You can store anything, a
user's document, photos, song,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.070
et cetera.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.300
And you get 15 gigabytes
of storage space per user

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.740
for free.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.430
Now let's say you're building
a photo editor application.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.440
Well you can build
your app faster

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.570
with the help of Google Drive,
because Google Drive can

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:28.740
help you handle secure
backups of users' photos,

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.100
it can scale with
your application,

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.310
and it can sync
photos for you so they

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.730
are accessible from any device.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.960
Now you can focus on building
an awesome photo editing

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.530
experience and you can leave the
Cloud Storage to Google Drive.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.350
FRANCIS MA: So we have just
covered nine different ways

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.580
that you can tap into the
vast array of Google platform

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.510
services.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.482
Here's one more.

00:20:53.482 --> 00:20:55.690
And this is particularly
interesting for those of you

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.920
who are building commerce
apps, because it's

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.710
likely to help you
make more money.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.960
So with the Google Wallet
Instant Buy feature

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.510
it would help you access the
user's payment information.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.410
So for example, if the Google
user has purchased content

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.840
from Google Play, whether it's
an app that they have paid for,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.310
they've downloaded
a movie, or they're

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.420
a subscriber of the Google
Play music All Access,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.000
they would have their payment
information already set up

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.040
with Google.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.050
Now when you integrate
the Instant Buy feature

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.980
you can use this
account set up and have

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.500
that as a way to help
your user check out.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.100
So the experience is
very simple for users.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.140
They get this Buy with Google
option, they tap on that,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.567
you get a confirmation
and then they're done.

00:21:43.567 --> 00:21:45.900
They don't have to reenter
their credit card information

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.790
because that's already
available through Google.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.790
And of course, if you combine
that with Google+ Sign-In then

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:57.320
you can also make the whole
conversion process very,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.270
very seamless from the initial
time when they want to sign up.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.390
Create an account is a one click
experience for them to log in,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.070
and then to check out
is also very seamless.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.570
So let's look at some of the
results that our partner sees.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.540
Hotel Tonight, some of
you may be familiar,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:17.140
you can see they're outside
in the showcase area as well.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.600
They have seen really positive
results when they integrated

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.470
Google+ Sign-In and Wallet.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:26.400
So first, once they've
integrated Google+ Sign-In they

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.032
have doubled the number
of users that have signed

00:22:29.032 --> 00:22:29.930
in on their app.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.180
So again, these
users have now been

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.585
moved one step closer to
the check out process.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.560
Another data point is that
when a user is signing in

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.240
with Google they are
converting 50% more than users

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.600
who use other options.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.590
Again, this is because the
login process is simple

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.270
and the fact that oftentimes
their Google account payment

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.810
information is already set up.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.280
And lastly is on growth.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.200
We shared with you
several insights

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.995
on how you can grow with
Google and Hotel Tonight

00:23:04.995 --> 00:23:06.420
has integrated some of these.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.880
And since integrating
Google Sign-In

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.670
they've seen a 50% growth
in their Android user base.

00:23:14.234 --> 00:23:15.650
JENNIFER LIN: So
we just went over

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.490
10 insights that help you
grow and re-engage your users.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.150
Let's do a quick recap.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.500
Google search helps
you drive traffic

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.900
to your website and
mobile app so you

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.140
can be discovered more easily.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.130
You get quality Android app
installs from Google+ Sign-In

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.380
and users are automatically
signed in across multiple

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:42.650
devices to help you grow your
audience across platforms.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.360
You can access the
user's email address,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.650
profile data, contacts,
circles from Google

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:54.220
to help you build a personalized
experience for your users.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:24:01.170
Targeted Google+ sharing helps
you reach users across Google.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:05.280
You can re-engage your
users through YouTube.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.530
With Google Calendar you
get reminder notifications

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.910
for free.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.830
Google Drive handles
cloud storage for you

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.580
so you can build
your app faster.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.900
And Google Wallet's
Instant Buy helps

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.110
you make payment processing
easier with less friction.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.960
Now we have one more insight
for you, it's a bonus insight.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:35.180
And that is focus on the user
and all else will follow.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.220
Now at the end of the
day none of the insights

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.080
that we just gave you will
do you any good unless you

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.140
do right by your users.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.100
So think of how you
can apply each insight

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.750
to building an awesome
user experience.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.180
Put yourself in
your user's shoes.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.100
If you find the experience
easy to use or helpful then

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.730
your users will probably too.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.920
So the message here is focus on
delighting your users so they

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.610
love your service, keep coming
back and tell others about it.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.120
FRANCIS MA: There you have it.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.897
That's how you can
grow with Google.

00:25:12.897 --> 00:25:13.730
Thank you very much.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.720
And we'd love to
get your feedback.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.090
There's A QR code here.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.650
And also for those
of you who are

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.900
interested in doing
a deeper dive on some

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.980
of the technical details
on the integrations

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.490
we mentioned,
tomorrow morning we're

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.450
going to be out in the
Distribute Sandbox.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.390
Some of the engineers
from the platform team,

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.550
Google+ platform team will be
there to walk you through some

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.680
of the technical details on
integrating across Android,

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.540
iOS, and web.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.330
Thank you.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.865
JENNIFER LIN: Thank you

00:25:45.865 --> 00:25:47.240
FRANCIS MA: And
we'll hang around

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.110

of who want to come by

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.610
and we'll hang out here.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.710
Thank you.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.760
[APPLAUSE]
