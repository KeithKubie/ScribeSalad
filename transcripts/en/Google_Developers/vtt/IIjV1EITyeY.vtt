JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Hello everyone.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.490
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.580
Welcome to YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.470
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.030
In the studio, let me introduce
our guests.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.704
Hannah Eaves from Link TV.

00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:01.460
How are you doing, Hannah?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.210
HANNAH EAVES: I'm very
well, thank you.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.840
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How
was your vacation?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.849
HANNAH EAVES: It was awesome.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:05.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Did you
go somewhere exciting?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.130
HANNAH EAVES: I did.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.660
I went to Greece and Turkey and
I'm feeling very mellow

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.470
and relaxed.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.590
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great frame
of mind for this show.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.530
We have Darin Wilson.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.640
How are you Darin?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.760
DARIN WILSON: Good, thank
you very much.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.220
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I hear you
were driving down from the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.300
wine country today
for the show.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.230
DARIN WILSON: Petaluma, yes

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
well I really appreciate that.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.830
I know it's hard to get out of
the wine country to Silicon

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.800
Valley, but we are hopefully
going to make it worth your

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.490
trip today.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.180
DARIN WILSON: For you guys,
I'm happy to do it.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you for saying that.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.160
Jeremy Wilson, my
famous co-host.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.690
JEREMY WALKER: Hello.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How are
you doing, Jeremy?

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.180
JEREMY WALKER: I'm doing
pretty well.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I heard you
got a lot of sleep last night.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.010
JEREMY WALKER: I
got a lot, yes.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Which is
about six hours, right?

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.250
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, six
hours broken up.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That's good.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.840
I think you look a lot
better than usual.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.740
JEREMY WALKER: The caffeine
is keeping me alive.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.680
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And
then live from New

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.100
York, Jeremy Posnick.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.070
How are you doing, Jeremy?

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.080
Sorry, Jeff.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.670
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah,
I'm doing well.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.920
I'll take Jeremy's identity.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.790
Hi everybody.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I am slightly

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.610
jet-lagged I must admit.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.220
I just got back from South Korea
about 24 hours ago, so

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.800
you're going to have
to forgive me when

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.750
I mix up your names.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.580
OK, so let's get into it.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.650
We will talk about Link TV.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.330
For those of you that are not
familiar with it, we'll give

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.340
you a great introduction.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.940
We're planning a little demo.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.970
And then we'll drill into the
technical aspects of their

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.290
integration with YouTube
and YouTube APIs.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.320
And then towards the end of
the show, Jeff is going to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.860
tell us a little bit more of
what's happening in the stack

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.730
overflow space.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.990
Because we've been getting a lot
of high quality questions.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.530
So we thought it might be a
good idea to cover some of

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.290
them live on the show.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.430
And then, as always, if you have
any questions about what

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.550
we are covering today, please
ask them using the moderator

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.830
link that is in the
YouTube embed.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.510
So let's start with
you, Hannah.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.770
So tell me about Link TV.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.600
HANNAH EAVES: Well, Link TV is
an independent nonprofit

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.260
national television channel on
Dish and DirecTV in about 33

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.800
million US households.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.740
It was founded in 1999 by
a group of independent

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.530
television producers who wanted
an opportunity to try

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.170
and bring international

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.470
programming to American audiences.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.290
So particularly news,
documentaries, world cinema,

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.560
international music--

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.780
basically different

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.980
perspectives to American audiences.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.963
For instance, we were one of the
first broadcasters of Al

00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:33.160
Jazeera English.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.966
We were actually the first
national broadcaster of Al

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.800
Jazeera English in America,
which I think was very

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.000
important at a time
per September 11.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.220
And we got a lot of attention
for our bringing international

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.830
perspectives to American
audience.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I can totally
relate to that as

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.540
somebody with immigrant
background.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.960
So is it an IPTV station?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.680
Is it traditional broadcast?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.940
Tell me a little bit more
about the distribution.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.290
HANNAH EAVES: It is on Dish
and DirecTV in the basic

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.270
packages, so satellite, and also
in some local cable areas

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.410
in smaller chunks
of programming.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.520
But also we recently announced
we'll be merging with KCT in

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.600
Los Angeles.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.320
And they have I think a little
over 5 million cable

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.339
households in the Los
Angeles area.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.730
And pretty soon you'll be seeing
more of our programming

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.440
in LA I think.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.860
On top of that, over the last
five years, we've been moving

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.490
a lot into the digital world.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.950
So part of what I'm going to be
demoing today is a move we

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.040
made into the iPad.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.220
And also, we have a
corresponding website and

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.560
Google TV app.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.780
So we're definitely moving
as much as we can

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.550
into digital delivery.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then can
you give us a little sense of

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.270
your size as it relates to
independent broadcasters.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.580
Are you kind of in the middle,
or are you a large one or a

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.595
small one for those
who are not very

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:55.960
familiar with the scope--

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960
HANNAH EAVES: We're large--

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.190
especially when you
add KCT into the

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.350
mix, we're very large--

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.776
for being an independent
television channel.

00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:09.460
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great, so for
some of our audience who

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.770
have been following our blog,
they have read about

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.300
viewchange.org, which is
something that we talked about

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.100
probably a little
over a year ago.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.340
What's the relationship between

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.380
viewchange.org and Link TV?

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.830
HANNAH EAVES: Well,
viewchange.org was a project

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.830
of Link TV.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.026
We received funding from the
Bill and Melinda Gates

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:29.930
Foundation to build a video
website that focused and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.200
brought together hundreds
of videos about global

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.800
development and progress being
made in the developing world.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.120
And so it was for that project
that we developed a kind of

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.430
new stream of technologies.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.450
And part of that was integrating
the YouTube API.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.200
And also doing natural language
processing on the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.430
metadata around video in order
to do intelligent search to

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.160
bring up related content from
around the web that was

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.850
relevant to the video
you were watching.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.490
And also, that meant that we
could create an archive of 450

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.600
high quality videos and also
connect them to the latest

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.980
news, the latest videos, so
down the road, the content

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.310
remained relevant.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.410
So that was kind of our first
step into this new video

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.470
technology.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.270
And then we received funding
from the Bertha Foundation,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.740
which is a great London-based
foundation, to take that same

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.140
technology and apply it
to global news videos.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.170
And in between there, we got
funding from the Knight

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.490
Foundation to basically build a
prototype of this new global

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.720
news video system online.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.220
And we did research with 16-
to 24-year-olds about their

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.320
news habits.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.160
So this has kind of been an
ongoing process for us.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.350
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great, and
then for those of you that

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.570
have been following, you might
have noticed that actually

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.350
viewchange.org has open
source implementation.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.330
So if somebody wants to take a
stab at deploying their own,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.635
they could actually get
the source code and

00:06:56.635 --> 00:06:57.410
play around with it.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.980
HANNAH EAVES: Yeah,
it's on GitHub.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.480
It's called the Link
TV platform.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.970
That is prior to a lot of the
changes we've made to support

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.265
this new global news site.

00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:10.650
But yes, the core architecture
is there on GitHub.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.730
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You also won
the Peabody Award, right?

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.290
Can you tell me more about it?

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.380
HANNAH EAVES: Yeah,
so that was--

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.490
after September 11th, Link
thought about what was missing

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.160
from American broadcasting.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.050
And part of that was
perspectives

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.810
from the Middle East.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.293
So we started this show called
Mosaic: World News From The

00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:30.980
Middle East, where we monitored
about 40 different

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.030
Middle Eastern broadcasters
every night.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.540
And then we take 10 to 15
segments of those, translate

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.700
them into English, do English
language voice-overs, and then

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.220
package them together
into a nightly

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.190
half hour news program.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.120
And so we won a Peabody for that
show because it was such

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.000
a unique way of bringing--

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.430
what is the Iranian state
television saying about

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.740
something that's happening in
Iran instead of just, what is

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.350
America thinking about that?

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.978
As well as what's Al Jazeera
Arabic saying on the ground in

00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:00.820
the Middle East?

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And this
is very important in my

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.730
experience-- obviously
the perspective.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.480
It makes a huge difference.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.980
So how does Link TV
get their content?

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.150
You mentioned that for the
Middle East coverage, you

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.150
obtain content, you
repackage it.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.650
Can you tell us more about where
the content comes from?

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.810
HANNAH EAVES: Yeah, we go to
international festivals, we

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.660
have relationships with
international distributors.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.730
And so we hand select specific
documentaries that don't get a

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.010
lot of airplay in the US.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.470
Also occasionally we stumble
across some great

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.470
international show.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.510
We have a Danish show called
Borgen right now, which has

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.000
been a huge success for us.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.520
We've got a double-page
spread in Newsweek.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.690
Everyone loves it.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.450
It won the BAFTA in the UK for
its airing on BBC, but no one

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.250
in America is showing it.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.380
So we have relationships with
certain distributors and we

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.680
pick up programming that way.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.350
So you'll see in the app, we
have a whole documentary

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.450
section that's all
acquired content.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.460
And then we create shows
like Mosaic.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.670
We also have another program
called LinkAsia, which is a

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.780
weekly news program where we
have correspondents on the

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.490
ground in certain
Asian cities.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.190
And then we have them report on
stories that might not make

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.260
it to America.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.000
They look at what's breaking in
social networks in China,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.300
translate that out of Chinese,
and look at stories from those

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.780
perspectives.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.590
So it's mostly acquired content
from distributors and

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.100
also international news
broadcasters, and also a

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.330
little bit of original
production.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.843
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I was told
that you also curate content

00:09:30.843 --> 00:09:32.548
from YouTube.

00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:34.010
HANNAH EAVES: Yes, we do.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.540
We curate I'd say--

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.870
you'll see when we demo the
app-- probably about 80% of

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.140
the content in the app is
curated from YouTube.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So maybe we
should switch and look at the

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.620
app a little bit and then
drill into some of the

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.470
technical aspects.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.330
Because I know Jeremy is jumping
up and down ready to

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.826
ask some questions of Darin.

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.120
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, I'm
ready to get started

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.840
with some of those.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.940
HANNAH EAVES: OK, well I'll jump
onto the iPad over here.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.140
Let's take a look at this.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.080
Need to get back on here--

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.770
all right-- it might take
it minute to load up.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.450
This is the Link TV World
News iPad app.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.990
You can download this now.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.350
It's now available through
the App Store.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.200
If you just search for Link
TV it'll come up.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.250
So what you see here is a pretty
standard presentation.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.150
We wanted to take how we curate
global news for the

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.490
television channel and
apply it to this app.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.260
So you can see, we have a
variety of sources here from

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:50.600
AP, Euronews, Al Jazeera
English, ITN.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.610
We try and curate as
much as we can--

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.530
Press TV, Current TV--

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.420
off of YouTube.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.930
And then we're also, like I
said, doing some of this

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.570
translation from Arabic and
also Asian language new

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.050
sources that we put up.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.550
And this is a mix of
international stories that you

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.530
might not have seen covered
so much in the US media,

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.220
and also raw video.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.370
So we do a lot of trying to find
what is the best, most

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.670
important, eyewitness videos
you can see out of, for

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.075
instance, the Gaza conflict
or something like that.

00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:23.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is raw video a
technical concept or is that

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.170
a journalistic concept?

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.220
HANNAH EAVES: It's just a
journalistic concept.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.660
It just means--

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: When I hear
raw video, I think in terms of

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.160
the bytes and the bits.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.610
HANNAH EAVES: Oh right.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.290
No, it's just that
it's unedited.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.590
So it's not edited.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.050
It's not wrapped up
in a broadcast,

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.775
which I think is really--

00:11:40.775 --> 00:11:42.090
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So it's like,
user generated content

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.240
might fall into that
kind of category?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.220
HANNAH EAVES: Citizen
journalism?

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.060
Yes, definitely.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.880
So we were trying to find
the best pieces

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.420
of eyewitness accounts.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.230
So if I pick a video here--
here's Obama's

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.330
recent trip to Myanmar.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.800
And so you can see here we go
into a video that this is

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.855
where the natural language
processing is happening.

00:12:06.855 --> 00:12:06.987
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How so?

00:12:06.987 --> 00:12:07.190
Can you explain how
that works?

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.030
HANNAH EAVES: This is a
Telegraph TV piece--

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.280
Sure, so we partner
with Zemanta.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.540
I don't know if you're
familiar with them.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.880
They do the natural language
processing on the title and

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.890
the metadata that we're pulling
from YouTube, in this

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.140
case from Telegraph TV's
YouTube channel.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:27.220
And then they feed back to
us what people, places,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.870
organizations, topics, are
covered within the video.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.620
So this is something I know
that you guys have started

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.090
integrating.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.180
But this was--

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.660
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Similar
to what Freebase

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.150
topics API does, right?

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.725
HANNAH EAVES: Exactly, except
we built this two years ago.

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:44.000
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sure, that's
why you're here.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.880
HANNAH EAVES: And so, as you
guys are doing, we tied these

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.670
to Freebase IDs so you can see
underneath the video here--

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.020
if you're not familiar with the
people or places covered

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.970
in the video, you can tab
through these tabs down here

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.487
and get background information
about everything that's

00:13:00.487 --> 00:13:01.050
covered in the video.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.570
And that's all automated.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.925
And this information is being
pulled from Freebase.

00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:08.220
And if there's no Freebase
record, then we use DBpedia.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.540
So we kind of have a fallback.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.700
You can follow any of these
topics, and I'll show you that

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.480
feature in just a second.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.360
That means that any time
something new comes up that's

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.290
relevant to what you're
following, it'll come up in

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.780
the My Links section.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.350
And then we also use that same
system to call up related

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.960
videos from elsewhere
on the web and

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.850
related articles as well.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.520
Not sure why we're not--

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.330
let's take a look at
another video here.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.630
We should be seeing some
related articles

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.900
as well down here.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.730
So here you see, we have
related articles.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.260
And we have thousands of sources
that we're scraping to

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.220
bring up related articles.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.180
We're using Daylife for that,
, as well as Zemanta.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.680
And so if there is an article--
like here's a Globe

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.310
and Mail article that I'm
interested in reading that's

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.640
about the same thing that's
covered in the video.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.540
It brings up the whole Globe and
Mail website so you don't

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.070
have to leave the app.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.860
You can dig deeper, you can
learn more about a topic.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.800
You can then go in and read
some articles about what's

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.550
covered in the video without
ever having to leave the app.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:16.110
We also have this feature
called In Depth.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.290
Sorry, I keep on accidentally
updating here.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.290
Here we go, so here's
an In Depth feature.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.560
This is where we pull
together a playlist.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.240
We might have curated 30 videos

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.930
about the Gaza conflict.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.770
Here's a place where you can
look at that playlist and

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.650
watch all of those videos
back to back.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.550
And then also on this page we
curate and key tweets and

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.000
articles and ways you
can take action.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.240
Although, I'm having trouble
loading this page right now.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.040
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So while
we're loading, I had a

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.590
question about--

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.930
how do you actually decide
what to show to

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.710
a particular user?

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:54.760
So when I fire up the app, I get
a view of the content that

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.790
you have curated.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.510
Is there any personalization
capability?

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.910
Can I pick topics that I care
about or news stations that I

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.390
care about?

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.300
HANNAH EAVES: Yep, you
can pick topics

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.620
that you care about.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.700
Here we go.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.630
You can follow news stories.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.670
And I'm going to jump right
into that here.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.640
Here you could see
the story page.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.960
I think what's interesting
about this In

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.770
Depth feature is also--

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.820
and all the pages we
try to do this--

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.050
there's an action that
you can take.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.325
So in some pieces, it
might be donating--

00:15:22.325 --> 00:15:24.290
if it's something about women's
rights, it might be

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.490
send a child to school,
send a care package,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.530
something like that.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.950
Here it's learn more about the
Israeli-Hamas conflict.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.330
So you can see, here's the
playlist of 38 videos.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.830
You can watch those
back to back.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.630
You can see key tweets.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.540
I think this was really good
for us on election night.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.790
It's really like a live blogging
kind of platform.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How do you
know what actions to associate

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.400
with which topics?

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.430
HANNAH EAVES: That's the one
piece that's not automated in

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.340
our whole system.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.810
So it really is a matter of
researching what topic-- and

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.540
we've had a long history of
trying to associate action

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.880
with content.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.210
So it's calling on that
institutional

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.210
knowledge to go back.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.010
And we also have a lot of
partners that we've done

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.160
programs with, like Save
the Children and Oxfam

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.850
and places like that.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.550
So here is the much talked
about My Link

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.140
personalization page.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.410
If you reach this page and
you're not following anything

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.100
yet-- like I said before,
I showed you you

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.530
could follow topics.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.610
We suggest things that you might
be wanting to follow.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.040
So here we have a few different
pieces-- you might

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.820
want to follow the Syrian
civil war or

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.770
anti-austerity protests.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.850
You might want to
follow sources--

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.810
Al Jazeera English, LinkAsia.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.670
And so now if I--

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.745
let's see, I'm going
to follow--

00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:41.995
oh David Patraeus, oh dear.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.760
You might not want to follow
self-immolation.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.330
That's a bit of a hardcore
topic there.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.080
So now, if I refresh this page,
you can see how we then

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.050
display all of the latest
content for all the things

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.970
you're following as well as
pulling out specific videos.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.040
If there have been any in the
last five days, we pull those

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.750
out to the forefront.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.780
And so now there's all this
content that is being curated

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.150
based on your interest.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.529
And we also have a Documentaries
section.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.960
For instance, "Crisis" is
a great documentary.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.609
We have a selection
of documentaries.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.089
You can see here we have
some Vice guides.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:25.990
So we partnered with Vice
and acquired some

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.780
content from them.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.170
I know there's also a lot of
Vice content up on YouTube.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.570
And other feature length
documentaries--

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.130
you can see here this is a good
example of the way you

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.940
can take an action.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.840
You can donate to help better
the lives of India's poor on

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.510
this page specifically.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.370
And there's one last thing
I'm going to show you.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.230
We build a map feature
as well.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.050
I think that it's really
important for us as a globally

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:58.950
focused news app for you to be
able to really look deeply

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.030
into specific regions.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:01.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Really cool.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.660
So what are the squares?

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.520
What do they represent?

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.040
HANNAH EAVES: Pardon?

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.990
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: The squares
of the map, what do they--

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.290
HANNAH EAVES: They represent
where there are videos.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:08.900
And here we go.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:14.570
You can go last 24, last
week, or last month.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.600
We'll zoom in a little bit here
and you'll be able to

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.090
see, for instance, how we can
break out areas specifically

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.910
in places like Syria
where you could see

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.200
Aleppo versus Damascus.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.990
It's taking a little while
because of-- last month we had

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.890
hundreds of videos.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.440
Now we have an editorial
staff running 24/7.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.020
We have staff based in
different cities.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.670
And so we're adding content--

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.930
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the videos
are geocoded when you

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.140
upload them for your content,
and then for YouTube you're

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.040
using the geolocation-based
search?

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.990
HANNAH EAVES: No
right now we're

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.560
doing everything manually.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.026
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So they are
curated since I think there

00:18:57.026 --> 00:18:58.560
are still a lot of videos on
YouTube that don't actually

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.730
have the tags.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.490
I see.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.620
HANNAH EAVES: Again, it's taking
a second to load here.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.610
Here we go.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.530
Look at all those squares.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.130
So if I zoom in here say,
for instance to Syria--

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.810
you can see a little drawer
comes out if I tap on Syria.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.350
We have 10 videos here, but
then we also have--

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.170
I'll do this from the side.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.210
It's a little tricky,
much more granular.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:31.480
So we have Aleppo, areas I
can't pronounce sadly--

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.870
I need my Arabic team here to
pronounce everything for us.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.390
But I think you get a good
idea of the depth of

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.480
international content we're
curating in here from

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.480
all over the world.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: This
is really cool.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.830
I see you have something
in Poland as well.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:51.680
HANNAH EAVES: Do we?

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.690
Ah no, sadly.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.130
I should have had them
add something just

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.680
before we did this.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.810
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
well this is great.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.110
Thank you so much for running
the demo for us.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.150
It's a very interesting app.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.200
And I understand the app has
been quite successful in the

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.650
store since you have
released it.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.580
HANNAH EAVES: Yeah when they
launched, we were number one

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.610
in the news category and
number 25 overall.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.150
And I think we've been able to
maintain a fairly good rate of

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.710
organic downloads.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.370
And we've gotten a lot
of really great

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.730
comments and ratings.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.280
We're, like, this close
to having five stars.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.460
It's like four stars and
7/8 of a fifth star.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Ok great,
maybe the audience on the show

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.110
and I will check out this app
and contribute to some of the

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.270
good ratings.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.050
Especially given that this is
all very nice and easy to use,

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.780
but when you look under the
hood, there's actually some

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.070
heavy lifting going on with
[INAUDIBLE] analysis and

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.570
geoinformation.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.430
So it's very nicely done.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.510
So let's switch to the
technical part.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:02.140
I understand Darin is here and
he's a developer at Link TV.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.620
So Darin, tell us more about
the implementation.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.570
DARIN WILSON: I just want to say
hello to my partner Chuck,

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.355
who's in the peanut
gallery there.

00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:13.540
The two of us did all of the
development, at least on the

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.700
front end of the app.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.020
The nice thing about when we
started, the news site was

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.910
already up and running.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:24.660
So we had a backend in place
that we could build off of.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.860
The CMS that the editors used
to input videos and edit

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.920
things was already in place.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.640
They didn't have to learn
anything new.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.830
Some new features like the In
Depth feature that Hannah just

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.130
showed was brand new, so
we had to build out

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.050
some backend then.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.000
But we had a good solid
base to start with.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.710
JEREMY WALKER: I am always
curious, what languages did

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.650
you use and why did
you go that route?

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.550
DARIN WILSON: The backend
was written in Rails.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.500
And I inherited that.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.610
I just started at Link
about a year ago.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.220
But I was coming from a Rails
shop so that felt pretty

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.630
comfortable.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.220
For the front end, we sort of
went back and forth on whether

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:08.350
we were going to do native or do
something using HTML5 like

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.300
PhoneGap or one of those
technologies.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.350
And we did a lot of research and
talked to a lot of people.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:20.750
And the overall feeling we got
was, to get the best and

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.770
smoothest experience performance
wise, you were

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.700
going to be better
off going native.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.450
The HTML5, at least a year ago,
wasn't quite there yet in

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.290
terms of smoothness and speed.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.440
And so we decided just
to dive right in and

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.270
implement it native.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:42.920
So we used the standard iOS
framework and Objective-C for

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.500
the client.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.750
And then communicated--

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.950
we added a REST-like API for the
backend that was just for

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.870
the iPad app.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.910
Hanna didn't mention this, but
we also released a Google TV

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.930
app at about the same time that
the iPad app launched.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:03.090
So we used the REST API
for that as well.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.460
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.000
Can you tell us a little
bit about how you

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.530
use the YouTube APIs?

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.320
DARIN WILSON: A few
different ways.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.850
First off, the website,
news.linktv.org, uses

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:15.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.590
Player for displaying the
YouTube content there.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.820
We also used the data
API in the backend.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.350
So when an admin finds a video
on YouTube that they like and

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.050
they want to add to the site,
they just drop a URL in and

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.770
then the data API runs and
fetches all the metadata.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.340
So they don't have to copy over
the description or the

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.750
duration or the title
or any of that.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.640
That works very nicely.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.310
And then in the front end, the
actual video window that you

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.820
see is the iOS webview.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:53.290
And we're using the embed
player API, the iFrame.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.540
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.270
Was there anything that
surprised you as you were

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.175
integrating, maybe with
the player API or

00:24:00.175 --> 00:24:01.600
even the data API?

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.720
DARIN WILSON: Yeah, I think
the first surprise was--

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.060
we thought, OK, how do
you drop a YouTube

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.190
video into an iOS app?

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.870
Well, there's got to be an
Objective-C control for that.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.520
And then we looked around
and said, nope.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.480
Because we know there was a
YouTube app, so we thought,

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.480
we'll just use whatever
they're using.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.170
But it turns out, no, you just
drop a little webview in there

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.090
and use the same technology
used for the website.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.470
So that was kind
of a surprise.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:28.010
But there was some nice sample
code to start with.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:31.190
And I was talking to Chuck
right before we started.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.180
And he dropped it in, and in
about half a day it was

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.560
working pretty quickly.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.540
It's always nice when you see
some sample code and you drop

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.350
it in and it works
the first time.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:46.150
Very often, you get a surprise,
sometimes a bad one.

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.370
There's some little strange
bug or the sample code was

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.790
posted two years ago and
it's not the same.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.580
But the documentation was nice
and up-to-date, so it worked

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.250
the first time.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.740
Then we just kind of refined
it from there.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.320
JEREMY WALKER: OK great.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.060
So I'm guessing--

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.540
from feedback, you're saying it
sounds like you're hoping

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.770
for an iOS native app.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.775
Is there anything else that
comes to mind on anything

00:25:08.775 --> 00:25:09.450
you're integrating?

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.430
Maybe just for general feedback,
we always like to

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.230
hear a little bit about that.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.920
DARIN WILSON: Well, I mean
obviously if there were a

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.730
native iOS control that did
YouTube, that would be that

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.110
sort of pie in the sky dream.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:27.990
But even then, I think it would
be nice just to see more

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.430
code samples of iOS
integration.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.970
Particularly, the piece we
stumbled on a little bit,

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.670
which took a little research
to figure out, was

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.410
communication between
the video player

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.470
and the native app.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:41.180
Because we wanted to do some
things, first of all with

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.690
analytics--

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.110
to know how long someone played
a video, like when they

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.050
paused it, when they left.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:52.140
And we also wanted to make the
launch a little bit smoother.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:57.470
So we've got these nice Reuters
images that we use for

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.430
the videos and we wanted that
image to be up there while the

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.910
video was loading.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.510
And getting the message back
from the player that it was,

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:10.550
not only ready and not only
cued, but actually playing,

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.880
took a little bit of research
and a little bit of

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.740
experimentation to find out.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.200
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So Darin, to
that point, it sounds like you

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.400
were using the iFrame embed in
the UIWebView and then the

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.810
JavaScript iFrame API to
actually kick off the video

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.930
playback since | noticed you
have your own control of-- the

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.800
player button is uniform across
all the different types

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.140
of content.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.095
And then in addition, you said
you have been able to track

00:26:38.095 --> 00:26:41.300
the communications between
the iFrame [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.620
machine in your app.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.120
So how is that piece done?

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.240
DARIN WILSON: That was
another surprise.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.460
We researched a lot to see,
how are people doing this?

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.200
And it turned out the prevailing
method was for

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.430
JavaScript to fire off a
location change, so setting

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.030
window.location to
something else.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.470
Because that is actually
an event that

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.980
the iOS webview tracks.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.370
It's one of the few
that will do that.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:13.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: This is like
the smoke signal equivalent of

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.467
the modern age, because
it's kind of low-tech.

00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:18.450
DARIN WILSON: Exactly,
so you fire off a

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.370
location change and then--

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.820
so we just created these--

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.740
they're not really URLs, they're
just kind of messages.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.745
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I
call that-- it's

00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:27.060
a First World problem.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.730
DARIN WILSON: Right, exactly.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.820
So we catch that and then based
on the event, we look at

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.890
it and say, OK, it looks like
it's been paused or it looks

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:35.860
like it's been playing.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.840
So let's do something
in response to that.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.630
And then to go the other
direction, the iOS webview has

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.200
a call that will let
you just execute

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.880
JavaScript at that level.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.670
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So this
is how you can call the

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.910
JavaScript API method from
the Objective-C code.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.370
DARIN WILSON: Yeah which,
at this point

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:57.060
we're not doing anymore.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.040
But one rev, we were
doing that.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.880
So that's how we handled the
bidirectional communication.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.070
So it was a little chunky, and
sort of surprising once we saw

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.520
the method.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.040
But once we tried it, it
worked terrifically.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, it
seems to work pretty

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.102
nice in your app.

00:28:12.102 --> 00:28:12.540
DARIN WILSON: Yeah, thank you.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.730
JEREMY WALKER: Great, so have
you guys had a chance to try

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.760
to new data API or the
new analytics API?

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.115
DARIN WILSON: No, we haven't
put that in.

00:28:21.115 --> 00:28:25.420
We've been so focused on the
iPad app that we haven't

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.640
looked at the backend stuff.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.886
Particularly there's a
case of, if it ain't

00:28:28.886 --> 00:28:30.690
broke, don't fix it.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.790
The network is working fine.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:36.700
But I saw your show a few weeks
ago, when Shawn Simister

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.280
was here showing off the
Freebase connection.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.940
And that would be great because
as Hannah mentioned,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.750
we rolled all that
stuff ourselves.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.480
So if there were a way to
leverage what we're already

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.470
doing with communicating with
the data API to get more of

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.740
the top information back, we
could cut out a bunch of code

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.170
and not have to maintain
it anymore.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.110
HANNAH EAVES: And Darin is
a Freebase alum as well.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.590
DARIN WILSON: I worked at
Metaweb years ago at the very

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.680
beginning, when Freebase was
just a twinkle in Danny

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.270
Hillis's eye.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.050
Yeah, I worked on the
first version of it.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:17.910
And so a lot of those guys
I know after the Google

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.070
acquisition happened.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.120
So it's kind of fun because it
was this thing I worked on

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.295
years ago and thought how
this might get used.

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.920
And we wondered about it.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.690
And then, when Google picked it
up, it got more widespread.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:36.110
And now I'm using it as a client
in my own package.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.860
Not something I ever would've
imagined but--

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you
probably won't be complaining

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.318
too much if it doesn't work as
well a you think it should.

00:29:41.318 --> 00:29:44.730
DARIN WILSON: Well if it
doesn't, I know who to call.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.780
One of my friends will
get an email.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well
we're very excited

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.925
about the topics API.

00:29:48.925 --> 00:29:50.990
I think so far the feedback
has been very encouraging.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:54.500
We'll be looking forward for
developers to adopt it.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.855
And Jeff has put up very
nice code samples

00:29:56.855 --> 00:29:59.660
around it as well.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.860
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah,
it's really nice.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.800
When you do a search, you can
add a topics ID and it helps

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.110
make that search much better.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.870
DARIN WILSON: That was actually
the thing we talked

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.530
about at the very beginning.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.180
If someone types B-A-S-S into
a search engine, how do we

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.630
know if it's a musical
instrument, a fish, or a beer?

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.690
Because back then you couldn't
really do that.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:21.600
My voice is squeaking.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.530
I'm Peter Brady all
of a sudden.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.940
Excuse me.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.120
Must be the early hour.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.580
So now we're really seeing
that happen in

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.830
action and it's terrific.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.560
HANNAH EAVES: I forgot to
mention, another piece of us

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.120
taking the YouTube content
is that we--

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.640
and I think a lot of people as
they start thinking about how

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.480
to build apps around
YouTube content--

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.840
we spent a lot of time thinking,
how do we package

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.240
YouTube content so that it's
more attractive to the user on

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.360
the frontend experience?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.590
Which is why we have a

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.870
subscription to Reuters Images.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.020
And we also have some fantastic
headline writers.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.470
So we try and give more context
to the YouTube videos

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.460
through using the metadata.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.250
But then we also try and wrap
it in a pretty package.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.020
Choosing really striking imagery
and catchy headlines,

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.670
and also headlines that might
tell you a little bit more

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.960
about what's going on
in the larger frame.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.185
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Rather
than "video001.--"

00:31:17.185 --> 00:31:18.490
HANNAH EAVES: Exactly.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.555
We don't see too
many of those.

00:31:20.555 --> 00:31:24.650
But we definitely do with
the raw video for sure.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:25.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think
I'm slowly getting

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.040
the raw video concept.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.720
HANNAH EAVES: Well you know, in
all the research we did--

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.940
we did Bertha National
Survey and we did a

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.840
lot of market research.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.620
And also, like I said, this
white paper we did with 16- to

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.800
24-year-olds about their
news habits.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
I saw that.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.554
It's available on
your site right?

00:31:40.554 --> 00:31:43.070
HANNAH EAVES: Yeah,
news.linktv.org--

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.060
that's the website version
of the app--

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:45.250
/whitepaper.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.820
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Anybody
who is interested in

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.160
user-generated content-- or
as you call it, citizen

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.150
journalism--

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.810
I think it's a very
interesting read.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.070
HANNAH EAVES: Yeah, I mean raw
video, just the interest in

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:59.940
raw video amongst young
people, is enormous.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.720
You guys know this.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.260
At YouTube, when something
breaks, everyone's really

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.600
looking for the eyewitness
accounts.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.540
And then people also then want
to step back and really

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.000
understand the larger context.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.050
But I think, in the moment, raw
video is of such interest

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:17.030
and there's a lot of distrust
towards produced news content

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.030
from broadcasters.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:22.690
A lot of pretty sophisticated
media understanding I think

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.750
from young people which
was surprising to us.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:26.425
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, that
was I think one of the

00:32:26.425 --> 00:32:28.696
surprising finds that I saw
in the paper as well.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.100
Jeremy, do you have any other
tricky questions for Darin?

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.530
JEREMY WALKER: I think we can
just close with-- and by the

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.070
way, thanks for sharing
all this.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.940
Do you have any feedback you'd
like to give to developers who

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.750
are just starting their own
integrations with the YouTube

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:46.855
APIs, or [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:46.855 --> 00:32:49.890
for the data APIs?

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.920
DARIN WILSON: No, nothing too
much beyond definitely start

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.620
with a sample code because
that's going to get

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.060
to 90% of the way.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.240
And then, make sure to review.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.520
I just learned a couple things
about the API this morning

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.310
from Jarek when we were
talking before.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.320
So, go over the documentation
with a fine-toothed comb

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.290
because there are some things
in there that will surprise

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.910
you and help you.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.070
JEREMY WALKER: Great, so kick
it over to Jeff I guess.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, thanks
a lot for sharing all your

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.300
experience.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.460
We have a few minutes left, so
I know Jeff wanted to tell us

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.610
a little bit more about what's
happening in the stack

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:27.740
overflow space.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.470
Jeff, any interesting questions

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.430
that came up recently?

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.730
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sure, well,
I'm a little biased.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.640
I think all the questions
are interesting.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.930
There is one in particular that
I wanted to highlight

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.340
that we got from a developer
recently.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.840
This actually points a little
bit to a deficiency in our

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.720
sample code.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.640
Thanks for that very
interesting talk.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.730
I certainly appreciate the fact
that we do need to have

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.980
good examples out there, because
that's what developers

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.740
are building on.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.760
So the one question I wanted
to highlight--

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.170
I'm going to actually start
screen sharing right now, so

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.517
you will not be able to see me
anymore, but I'm going to pull

00:34:02.517 --> 00:34:04.240
up the question.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.310
This is about how you can "like"
a specific video in

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:12.540
using version three of the API,
which is a new version we

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.449
released a few weeks ago.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.530
And, if you read through
the question--

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.730
and by the way there's a link
to the specific question

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.949
posted on our Plus YouTube Dev
Google+ page right now if you

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:25.960
wanted to go back later.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.810
But basically if you look
through what the developer's

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.699
initially doing, they
were trying to

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.650
insert an activity basically.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:38.550
And that's a very natural thing
to expect yourself to be

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.550
able to do.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.409
Because you can actually read
the activity feed and you can

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.260
get information about the videos
that have been "like"d

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:44.659
from there.

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.900
So it logically makes sense.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.339
Well, why can't I just post
something to that activity

00:34:50.339 --> 00:34:54.172
feed and add [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:54.172 --> 00:34:55.690
via that mechanism.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.989
Unfortunately though,
that's not actually

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:58.220
how things are done.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.850
So I wanted to explain
what I put into the

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.500
answer to that question.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.900
And basically, this ties into
how we treat pretty much

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.390
everything in version three
of the API as a playlist.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.960
So things that version two
had their own standalone

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.560
endpoints--

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.930
the Favorites feed, for
instance, or the--

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.640
I guess there wasn't
even a Liked Videos

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.630
feed in version two.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.060
But there's a severed endpoint
for "like"ing video.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.150
Watch Later was also treated
as something special.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.430
Those are more or less coalesced
into the general

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:36.910
idea of a playlist in version
three of the API.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:38.505
And that does simplify
some things.

00:35:38.505 --> 00:35:40.840
It means that you don't
have to write special

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.590
purpose code for--

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.130
"like"ing a video or adding a
video as a favorite is all

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.350
pretty much the same operation,
but you pass in a

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.200
different playlistId.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.030
So the basic way you'll want to
do this is by first making

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.970
an authenticated call to
channels.list, which is

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:58.560
something that gives

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.580
information about your channel.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.190
You could pass in the parameter
mine=true and you'll

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.810
get information back about
your specific channel.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:10.570
And you'll get back this list
over here if you specify

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:11.940
part=contentDetails.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.460
And this contains the specific
IDs that correspond to your

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.160
own Likes playlist and
Favorites playlist.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.920
Also the Uploads, Watch Later,
and Watch History playlists.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.360
And all of those playlists can
be read from if you do

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.910
standard playlist
items dot list.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:34.170
And some of them can do to write
operations and add new

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.310
videos to it.

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.990
So the way you do the "like"
operation, getting back to the

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.550
initial question, is that you
take the ID that you get back

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:45.740
from your channels.list call--

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.860
an implementation detail, right
now at least they're all

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.280
prefixed with LL for the Likes
playlist and FL for the

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.040
Favorites playlist.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.850
Please don't hard code that.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.160
It's much better to do what
we're recommending here, which

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.680
is try to retrieve this
playlistID dynamically.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.890
Just in case we ever change
anything in the future,

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.900
hard-coded logic is a great
way to run into

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.700
problems down the line.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.700
So get this Likes playlistID
and then you could do a

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.450
standard playlist
items insert.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.180
Here's a sample of the body
that you would do.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.535
In this case, you pass
in the playlistId and

00:37:23.535 --> 00:37:24.785
you pass in the videoId.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.068
It's again very similar to how
you do the Favorites insert if

00:37:30.068 --> 00:37:31.470
you want to "favorite" a video,
if you want to add a

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:34.040
video, any arbitrary playlist.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.980
Hopefully that simplifies
things for a

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.110
developer moving forward.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.620
Part of the problem, in going
back to what I was saying

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.690
about simple code, is that
there's no code sample for

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.330
this right now in the docs.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.395
So as part of answering this
question, I also submitted a

00:37:47.395 --> 00:37:50.230
code sample that should
hopefully show up pretty soon

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.540
within our online code
samples in the docs.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.050
So if you're somewhere down the
line looking for similar

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.670
code, you should be able to
find it pretty easily.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.530
That's the main thing I
wanted to point out.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.000
There are a bunch of other
interesting questions on stack

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.760
overflow but we'll save some
more for next week.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool, thanks
for covering that Jeff.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.390
I think the moral of the story
is that the world is nothing

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.870
but a playlist.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:14.390
JEFFREY POSNICK: There you go.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.080
Playlists everywhere.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
so I think we have just a

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.320
little bit of time left to
look at the questions.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.480
I see one question
that is relevant.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.050
I think this one's addressed
to you, Jeremy.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.970
Is YouTube Google developer
relations hiring?

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:33.580
JEREMY WALKER: Yes we are.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.260
We're always hiring.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:40.870
Go check it out at
developers.google.com/jobs and

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:41.700
feel free to apply.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.560
We're always looking for help.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.750
And I think that's the only
question actually.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.610
Yeah, so if you're interested,
definitely go check out that

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.020
page, read a little
bit about it.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.310
We'd love to hear from you,
so definitely apply.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great, well
thank you very much for

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.400
joining us on the show today
Darin and Hannah.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.320
Jeff, thanks for joining
from New York City.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.600
And it was a pleasure
to have you on the

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.460
show co-hosting, Jeremy.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.950
And I guess we'll see
you next week?

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.090
JEREMY WALKER: I'll
be in Brazil.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.445
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That's true,
we won't see you, but--

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.270
Jeff I think you're on mute.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.320
OK, you're no longer on mute.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.390
JEFFREY POSNICK: I think I'll
be flying solo next week.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:32.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, great,
until next week then.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.850
JEREMY WALKER: All right

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:33.240
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Bye.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.350
DARIN WILSON: Thank you.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.600
JEFFREY POSNICK: Bye everybody.
