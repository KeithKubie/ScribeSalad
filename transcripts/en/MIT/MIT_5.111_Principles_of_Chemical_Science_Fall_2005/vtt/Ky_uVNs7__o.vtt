00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.984
All right.
For this half of the course,

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:21.675
we talked about chemical
equilibrium, acid-base.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:25.994
We talked oxidation-reduction.
We talked about shapes of

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:28.821
molecules.
We talked about this VSEPR

00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:32.153
theory.
We talked about transition

00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:36.295
metals and kinetics,
which we just ended on Monday.

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:40.934
All of these things represent
the basic principles of how

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:44.082
enzymes work.
Enzymes work by acid-base

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:46.816
catalysis.
They catalyze oxidation

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:51.041
reduction reactions.
And so if we want to understand

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:54.437
biochemistry,
you need to understand these

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:59.828
basic principles of chemistry.
That is how I got into

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:03.902
chemistry in the first place,
was this connection.

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:08.641
And, as I mentioned last time,
inhibition of enzymes is an

00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:12.299
important area.
And we need to understand how

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.874
the enzymes work if we want to
inhibit them.

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:18.866
Well, why do we want to inhibit
them?

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:23.855
Well, inhibition of enzymes is
used in the treatment of a lot

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:26.681
of different conditions.
Headaches.

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:30.090
This time of year,
a lot of us walk around

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.065
carrying a bottle.
Sometimes the small size isn't

00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:38.991
going to really quite do it.
We might get a little larger.

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:42.365
Here is ibuprofen.
There are a number of headaches

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:45.808
that occur around now.
And headaches are treated by

00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:48.838
inhibiting an enzyme.
Someone has designed an

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:52.281
inhibitor for an enzyme,
and the enzymes are called

00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:56.000
prostaglandin synthases or
cyclooxygenases.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.926
And these materials,
like aspirin and stuff,

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:01.308
bind to the enzyme and inhibit
them.

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:05.255
And, to get good inhibitors,
we need to know how the enzyme

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:07.773
works.
And so some of you have heard a

00:02:07.773 --> 00:02:09.950
lot of news recently about
Vioxx.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.693
That was a drug that was
designed to target the enzymes.

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:17.232
They were very proud of
themselves for trying to make

00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:20.294
the drug very specific to a
particular type of

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:24.310
cylcooxygenase enzymes that
would only inhibit the class two

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.964
and not one.
And it turns out that was a

00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:32.000
great idea, except that it
turned out to be dangerous.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.584
We will see how that plays out.
But, all of that,

00:02:35.584 --> 00:02:38.346
they are targeting enzymes.
Arthritis.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:42.304
A lot of drugs to treat cancer
are inhibiting enzymes.

00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:45.365
I mentioned HIV,
that there are inhibitors

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.352
against HIV protease,
which is an enzyme.

00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:52.981
And so the people have designed
inhibitors against that enzyme.

00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:57.162
Designing inhibitors against
enzymes is a big part of the

00:02:57.162 --> 00:03:01.763
pharmaceutical industry.
And, to really have a good

00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:06.037
inhibitor, a good pharmaceutical
product, you need to know a lot

00:03:06.037 --> 00:03:09.971
about how the enzyme works and
also something about how the

00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:13.159
cell works, so that you can make
a good product.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.347
And this is big money.
Understanding these basic

00:03:16.347 --> 00:03:19.400
principles, then,
allows you to understand how

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.317
enzymes work.
I am going to take one enzyme,

00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:25.234
and I am going to tell you
about the enzyme.

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:29.236
I am going to tell you about
how this enzyme works to do its

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:32.526
reaction.
And I am going to use,

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:36.136
in telling you about the
enzyme, all of these things.

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:40.231
All of these different topics
you need to know to understand

00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:43.285
this one enzyme.
And, if you understand these

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:45.714
different topics,
you will, in fact,

00:03:45.714 --> 00:03:48.699
be able to understand how this
enzyme works.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.267
The enzyme, it shouldn't
surprise you,

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:54.390
is vitamin B12 dependent,
my favorite vitamin.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.000
And it is called methionine
synthase.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.831
I have mentioned this a little
bit in the course of this

00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:06.150
semester, and we are going to go
back over some of these things

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.867
as a review.
This is going to serve as a

00:04:08.867 --> 00:04:12.420
review of the different topics
that we have covered,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.530
at the same time showing how
these basic principles apply to

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.107
other fields in chemistry and
biology.

00:04:19.107 --> 00:04:22.869
We will start at the back.
We will start with kinetics.

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:25.516
That is easy.
Methionine synthase is an

00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:29.000
enzyme, and enzymes are
catalysts.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.991
Catalysts speed up reactions,
make them go faster.

00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:36.738
And the speed of reactions is
what kinetics is.

00:04:36.738 --> 00:04:41.219
Here is the reaction that
methionine synthase catalyzes.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:45.862
It converts an amino acid
called homocysteine into another

00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:50.668
amino acid called methionine.
And it takes one form of folic

00:04:50.668 --> 00:04:54.823
acid, which is another B
vitamin, and converts it to

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:59.720
another form of folic acid.
And this reaction is very

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.367
important in your body.
It is important for the proper

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:06.464
formation and maintenance of
your spinal cord.

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:10.593
And women who are pregnant need
to take lots of folic acid to

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:14.378
make sure that they have enough
for this reaction to go,

00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:18.369
so the baby is born with a
properly formed brain and spinal

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.778
column.
Inhibition is connected with

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:24.012
neural tube defects.
Homocysteine is linked with

00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:26.765
heart disease.
You want to make sure this

00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:31.621
enzyme is working really well.
You will have too much

00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:34.791
homocysteine,
and that is a big indicator of

00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:38.255
problems with heart disease.
Also, you need this

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:41.572
tetrahydrofolate,
this one form of folic acid,

00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:45.331
for DNA biosynthesis.
Some people have thought about

00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:48.796
inhibiting this enzyme to
prevent this reaction,

00:05:48.796 --> 00:05:52.997
and that would lead to stopping
cancer cells from growing.

00:05:52.997 --> 00:05:56.756
Of course, if they do that,
they might cause people,

00:05:56.756 --> 00:06:01.991
then, to have heart problems.
There are definitely balances,

00:06:01.991 --> 00:06:05.176
and that is why the
pharmaceutical industry often

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:08.163
gets in trouble,
because you solve one problem

00:06:08.163 --> 00:06:11.946
and then create another one.
You really need to know a lot

00:06:11.946 --> 00:06:16.061
about how the system works as a
whole to be able to design good

00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:18.783
inhibitors.
So, this is a really important

00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:21.371
reaction.
For this reaction to go in the

00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:24.491
body, you need a catalyst,
you need this enzyme.

00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:27.544
What do catalysts do?
This is review of what we

00:06:27.544 --> 00:06:32.061
talked about Monday.
Catalysts act by lowering the

00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:34.763
activation energy barrier,
lowering EA,

00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:38.815
the activation energy barrier
for the forward reaction and

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:43.080
also for the reverse reaction.
They do not change the overall

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.066
thermodynamics,
they do not change delta G,

00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:49.123
they do not change the
equilibrium constant,

00:06:49.123 --> 00:06:52.606
but they do speed up the
reaction by lowering this

00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:55.308
barrier.
There is a much higher barrier

00:06:55.308 --> 00:06:57.796
without the catalyst,
lower barrier,

00:06:57.796 --> 00:07:02.316
it stabilizes.
Another way to think about it

00:07:02.316 --> 00:07:07.110
is it stabilizes the activated
state or the transition state.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.385
Catalysts are not in the
overall equation,

00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:15.179
they are not consumed in the
reaction, they are just added to

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:18.933
make the reaction go faster.
That is a catalyst.

00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:21.490
Enzymes are the catalyst of
life.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.404
Transition metals.
We are moving backwards through

00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:29.000
the semester,
transition metals.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.584
This one, lots of transmission
metals.

00:07:32.584 --> 00:07:36.169
It uses vitamin B12,
which has cobalt,

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.335
and it uses zinc.
Here is the methyl form of

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:44.211
vitamin B12, also called
methylcobalamin,

00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:49.152
and it has a corn ring.
A corn ring contributes four

00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:55.159
nitrogen ligands to the central
cobalt, so it is a tetradentate

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:59.791
ligand.
And that tetradentate ligand

00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:03.679
coordinates the cobalt.
It is a chelate.

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:08.365
And so we can review what the
chelate effect is.

00:08:08.365 --> 00:08:14.148
A chelating ligand has multiple
points of attachment to the

00:08:14.148 --> 00:08:18.833
particular metal.
And they are unusually stable.

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:22.123
Why are chelates unusually
stable?

00:08:22.123 --> 00:08:27.308
What factor is it that causes
that unusual stability?

00:08:27.308 --> 00:08:32.021
It is entropy.
It is entropic effects,

00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:36.503
because usually you are
replacing four bound waters,

00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:39.051
in this case,
with one ligand.

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:43.181
You are putting one thing on
and releasing four.

00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:48.190
And it is easier for four
things to be disordered than for

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.848
one thing to be disordered.
That gives you a favorable

00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:56.715
entropic effect.
The chelate effect has to do

00:08:56.715 --> 00:09:01.878
with entropy.
Now let's consider the zinc.

00:09:01.878 --> 00:09:05.476
It also needs zinc for this to
work.

00:09:05.476 --> 00:09:09.588
Zinc plus two,
what would be the d-count?

00:09:09.588 --> 00:09:13.906
How many d electrons are you
going to have?

00:09:13.906 --> 00:09:18.327
For that, we would go to the
Periodic Table,

00:09:18.327 --> 00:09:22.233
find zinc and see which group
it is in.

00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:25.831
It is 12.
The oxidation number is 2.

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:32.000
We are at 12 minus 2 or a d ten
state.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.101
What would you guess would be
the color of this zinc site?

00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:40.771
Colorless.
And that is because you are not

00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:45.962
going to be able to have any
d-to-d transitions because you

00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:49.364
have ten electrons,
everything is full.

00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:54.197
There are five orbitals and
they all have two electrons

00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:59.299
each, so it is completely full.
You would have a colorless

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:02.855
system.
Now, people did not realize

00:10:02.855 --> 00:10:06.498
methionine synthase was a zinc
enzyme for a long time.

00:10:06.498 --> 00:10:10.623
Vitamin B12 has a beautiful red
color, and zinc had no color.

00:10:10.623 --> 00:10:13.303
They knew it was a
B12-dependent enzyme,

00:10:13.303 --> 00:10:17.359
but people were studying this
enzyme for years and years and

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:21.483
years before they realized that
zinc was bound to the protein

00:10:21.483 --> 00:10:24.301
because it has no color.
What about VSEPR?

00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:28.494
VSEPR allows you to predict or
rationalize shapes of molecules

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:32.000
based on a simple idea of
repulsion.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.778
That lone pairs want to fill up
space and move the bound atoms

00:10:37.778 --> 00:10:41.094
away.
That the structure is designed

00:10:41.094 --> 00:10:45.736
such that there is minimal
repulsion between bound

00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:48.957
electrons or electrons in
orbitals.

00:10:48.957 --> 00:10:53.694
If we consider this,
then, if we look at the steric

00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:59.000
number for the whole center
around the cobalt.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.247
Again, there is this
tetradentate corn ring system,

00:11:03.247 --> 00:11:07.494
and there is one ligand above
and one ligand below.

00:11:07.494 --> 00:11:11.571
And so what does that give for
our steric number?

00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:14.459
Six.
We have four in the equatorial

00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:17.857
positions and two in the axial
positions.

00:11:17.857 --> 00:11:21.000
What formula would this be?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.203
What is first?
A, then X, then six.

00:11:32.203 --> 00:11:37.574
We have a central atom A and we
have six things around it.

00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:43.416
And what would be the geometry
of something that has six things

00:11:43.416 --> 00:11:45.395
around it?
Octahedral.

00:11:45.395 --> 00:11:48.975
And here we have our octahedral
system.

00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:53.781
If I hold it like this,
the equatorial positions are

00:11:53.781 --> 00:12:00.000
filled with the corn ring,
have a methyl group on top.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.185
And we have another ligand on
the bottom.

00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:05.892
What are the angles for
octahedral?

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.803
90, thank you.
All right.

00:12:07.803 --> 00:12:11.147
The zinc site,
I will tell you a little bit

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:15.049
about the zinc site.
Three ligands were identified

00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:17.836
to zinc.
And so geometry is going to

00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:21.419
have X equals three.
If we don't know what the

00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:25.161
ligands are, we might not know
about lone pairs.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:29.779
But if you have three things
bound, what is the most common

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:34.000
geometry if three things are
bound?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.144
Trigonal planar is pretty
common with three things bound,

00:12:39.144 --> 00:12:44.657
so that might be a good guess.
And so it might look something

00:12:44.657 --> 00:12:48.240
like this.
And what would be the angles,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.180
if that was the correct
geometry?

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.650
Right, 120.
Okay.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.049
We know something about it from
VSEPR.

00:12:56.049 --> 00:13:00.000
All right.
Oxidation-reduction.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.196
This enzyme catalyzes an
oxidation-reduction reaction.

00:13:04.196 --> 00:13:07.760
Here is the cycle of turnover
for this enzyme.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.877
We have a lot of different
reactions going on in this

00:13:11.877 --> 00:13:14.886
enzyme.
Here is an abbreviation for the

00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:18.846
cobalamin cofactor.
We just have the cobalt and its

00:13:18.846 --> 00:13:21.142
oxidation number of one,
here.

00:13:21.142 --> 00:13:25.814
Sometimes, instead of going
around in this primary turnover,

00:13:25.814 --> 00:13:30.090
its normal sort of cycle,
where it is reacting with the

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:35.000
folic acid and reacting with the
homocysteine.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.863
Instead, sometimes an electron
is lost.

00:13:37.863 --> 00:13:42.159
And, for it to kind of come
back into the catalytic cycle,

00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:44.571
the enzyme needs to be
activated.

00:13:44.571 --> 00:13:48.715
And so it becomes Co-two state.
It loses an electron and

00:13:48.715 --> 00:13:52.257
becomes oxidized.
And then you have to re-reduce

00:13:52.257 --> 00:13:56.553
it and you have to methylate it
to go back into this form.

00:13:56.553 --> 00:14:01.000
A methyl is just a carbon with
three hydrogens.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.663
The methyl group comes from
this compound called S-adenosyl

00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:10.246
methionine, and it gets an
electron for the reduction from

00:14:10.246 --> 00:14:12.577
flavodoxin.
If we look at this

00:14:12.577 --> 00:14:16.597
oxidation-reduction,
and we talked about this a big

00:14:16.597 --> 00:14:20.055
earlier, too,
but it is a really nice review

00:14:20.055 --> 00:14:24.236
for oxidation-reduction.
We have a standard potential

00:14:24.236 --> 00:14:29.060
for vitamin B12 of minus 0.526
volts and a standard potential

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.000
for flavodoxin of minus 0.23
volts.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.216
Which of these is a better
reducing agent?

00:14:37.216 --> 00:14:43.078
B12 is a better reducing agent.
A large negative reduction

00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:48.939
potential means that the reduced
species is very reducing.

00:14:48.939 --> 00:14:55.315
If it is a good reducing agent,
it likes to reduce other things

00:14:55.315 --> 00:15:00.251
and be oxidized itself,
so B12 has a low negative

00:15:00.251 --> 00:15:03.857
number.
If we do the math here and

00:15:03.857 --> 00:15:07.000
calculate a delta E for the
cell, and, again,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.928
the same equations can apply,
if you are talking about a

00:15:10.928 --> 00:15:14.714
battery or you are talking about
a biological process.

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:19.071
We have the standard reduction
potential for the reaction that

00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:22.000
is a reduction,
and the standard reduction

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
potential for the reaction that
is acting as the oxidation.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.742
And, in this biological case,
flavodoxin is reducing vitamin

00:15:31.742 --> 00:15:34.475
B12.
Flavodoxin is getting oxidized

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:39.056
and B12 is getting reduced.
And, if we put in the numbers,

00:15:39.056 --> 00:15:41.869
we find that delta E is minus
0.296.

00:15:41.869 --> 00:15:45.245
Is that going to be a
spontaneous reaction?

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:48.300
No, it won't be a spontaneous
reaction.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.399
Because if this is negative,
if delta E is negative,

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.293
then delta G is going to be
positive.

00:15:55.293 --> 00:16:01.000
And if delta G is positive,
then it is not spontaneous.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.176
And we did this math before,
but just as a review,

00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:09.352
you can calculate delta G if
you know the delta E.

00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:14.636
It is just minus the number of
electrons involved times Faraday

00:16:14.636 --> 00:16:18.982
constant times your delta E,
your change in the cell

00:16:18.982 --> 00:16:21.880
potential.
That would be minus one,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.653
it is a one electron reduction,
times Faraday's constant,

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:31.000
times the cell potential we
calculated.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.672
And we get positive 28.6
kilojoules per mole.

00:16:33.672 --> 00:16:36.344
That is not spontaneous.
But, as I mentioned,

00:16:36.344 --> 00:16:38.713
the cells come up with a way to
do this.

00:16:38.713 --> 00:16:42.114
It has to do this reaction,
or none of us would be alive.

00:16:42.114 --> 00:16:44.301
This is an important reaction
for us.

00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:47.581
The way that it does that is it
couples it with another

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:49.585
reaction.
So, at the same time the

00:16:49.585 --> 00:16:52.379
reduction is happening,
you are cleaving that a

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:55.295
S-adenosyl methionine.
It is giving up the methyl

00:16:55.295 --> 00:16:59.000
group, which is important for
the reaction.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.487
But also, this is very
favorable, minus 37.6 kilojoules

00:17:03.487 --> 00:17:06.812
per mole.
That allows the reaction to go.

00:17:06.812 --> 00:17:11.383
That sort of pumps in the
energy that is needed for this

00:17:11.383 --> 00:17:15.455
unfavorable oxidation-reduction
reaction to occur.

00:17:15.455 --> 00:17:19.777
Cells that require energy to
catalyze non-spontaneous

00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:23.600
reactions are called what?
Right, electrolytic.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.506
And if it is a spontaneous
reaction, it is what?

00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:32.172
Galvanic, right.
Here, in this one example,

00:17:32.172 --> 00:17:36.685
we talk about the connection
between thermodynamics and

00:17:36.685 --> 00:17:40.612
oxidation-reduction,
and we talk about oxidizing

00:17:40.612 --> 00:17:43.704
agents and reducing agents.
All right.

00:17:43.704 --> 00:17:46.880
The enzyme does an
oxidation-reduction.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.473
It is a catalyst,
it speeds up the reaction,

00:17:50.473 --> 00:17:55.069
it has two transition metals in
it and it uses acid-base

00:17:55.069 --> 00:18:00.000
catalysis as well.
Let's talk about acid-base.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.799
There is an acid-base reaction.
There is catalysis by a Lewis

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:08.880
acid in this part of the
reaction, the reaction with

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.240
homocysteine,
the conversion to methionine.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.160
Let's talk about this.
The B12 is going to give up

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.960
this methyl group,
two homocysteine,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.559
to make methionine.
It turns out that only the

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:25.519
deprotonated homocysteine is
reactive.

00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:30.000
Here is homocysteine.
It is an amino acid.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.365
This is proteinated.
The sulfur down here has a

00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:35.414
proton.
This is deproteinated

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:38.560
homocysteine.
The sulfur here has no proton.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.658
It has a negative charge.
And only this homocysteine here

00:18:42.658 --> 00:18:47.048
that is deprotonated with the
sulfur with the negative charge

00:18:47.048 --> 00:18:49.975
can be methylated.
The reaction catalyzed

00:18:49.975 --> 00:18:54.292
transfers this methyl group,
this CH three group and

00:18:54.292 --> 00:18:58.024
puts it on the sulfur,
and that makes the amino acid

00:18:58.024 --> 00:19:01.957
methionine.
But if there is a proton there,

00:19:01.957 --> 00:19:04.168
the methyl transfer does not
happen.

00:19:04.168 --> 00:19:06.000
It has to be deprotonated.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.230
At physiological pH,
we need to ask the question,

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:17.491
how much homocysteine is
deprotonated?

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:22.779
Remember, our body is buffered.
It is all around the same pH.

00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:27.891
We want to know at this pH,
how much of the homocysteine is

00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:33.355
in the deprotonated form and how
much of the homocysteine is in

00:19:33.355 --> 00:19:38.380
the protonated form?
What do we need to know,

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.341
what value do we need to know
to be able to answer,

00:19:43.341 --> 00:19:48.003
at a particular pH,
how much HA you have and how

00:19:48.003 --> 00:19:53.559
much A minus you have?
What do we need to know?

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:56.833
We need to know the pKa.
Question.

00:19:56.833 --> 00:20:01.000
What is the pKA?
Here, it is ten.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.913
That is a big number.
If we know the physiological

00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:12.586
pH, we know the pKA,
what equation can we use to

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:17.534
find the ratio of HA to 
A minus?

00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:22.362
Henderson-Hasselbach.
We can do the math.

00:20:22.362 --> 00:20:29.000
Physiological pH is around 7.4.
The pKa is ten.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.186
What is the ratio of protonated
to deprotonated,

00:20:33.186 --> 00:20:37.373
the ratio of this protonated
homocysteine to the

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:40.491
deprotonated?
It turns out to be 400

00:20:40.491 --> 00:20:43.787
protonated for every one
deprotonated.

00:20:43.787 --> 00:20:48.330
Well, that is bad news for us
because it needs to be

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.606
deprotonated to be reactive.
At physiological pH,

00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:55.991
then, it is protonated and
nonreactive.

00:20:55.991 --> 00:21:02.009
Here the enzyme has to come in.
Enzymes catalyze reactions.

00:21:02.009 --> 00:21:06.029
The enzyme needs to get
involved and make this reaction

00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:08.486
happen.
Again, this is unfavorable

00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:12.133
without the enzyme.
Let's think a little bit about

00:21:12.133 --> 00:21:15.930
pH and pKa for a minute.
Let's review some acid-base

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.280
titration issues.
This is not in your handout,

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.183
I don't think,
it has been there before,

00:21:22.183 --> 00:21:24.565
but let's just take a look at
it.

00:21:24.565 --> 00:21:30.000
You should remember what these
titration curves look like.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.191
Remember, at the half
equivalence point,

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:36.874
pH equals pKa.
And that happens because at the

00:21:36.874 --> 00:21:40.803
half equivalence point,
half of the acid has been

00:21:40.803 --> 00:21:45.631
converted to the conjugate base.
These are equal quantities.

00:21:45.631 --> 00:21:50.378
And so they will cancel out in
the Henderson-Hasselbach and

00:21:50.378 --> 00:21:53.734
this will be true.
You have equal amounts.

00:21:53.734 --> 00:21:57.989
If you are at a pH that is
below the half equivalence

00:21:57.989 --> 00:22:02.000
point, you will be more
protonated.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.134
If you are at a pH that is
above the half equivalence

00:22:06.134 --> 00:22:08.997
point, you will be more
deprotonated.

00:22:08.997 --> 00:22:12.734
We have not maybe discussed
this in these terms,

00:22:12.734 --> 00:22:16.551
but that is how you can think
about this problem.

00:22:16.551 --> 00:22:19.812
Now, let's go back to
methionine synthase,

00:22:19.812 --> 00:22:24.344
and this is in your handout.
At the half equivalence point

00:22:24.344 --> 00:22:27.922
in a titration,
or when the pH equals the pKA,

00:22:27.922 --> 00:22:31.739
half of your material is
protonated, half of your

00:22:31.739 --> 00:22:37.164
material is deprotonated.
If your pH is below that pKa,

00:22:37.164 --> 00:22:41.194
you are more protonated.
If you are a little bit below,

00:22:41.194 --> 00:22:43.582
you still have some
deprotonated.

00:22:43.582 --> 00:22:47.089
If you are very far below,
it is all protonated.

00:22:47.089 --> 00:22:51.343
Going the other direction,
if you are at pH above the pKa,

00:22:51.343 --> 00:22:55.447
you have mostly deprotonated,
maybe a little protonated.

00:22:55.447 --> 00:23:00.000
And when you get far away,
it is all deprotonated.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.390
Now we can put in what we know
about homocysteine.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.615
The pKa is ten,
and we are at pH 7.4,

00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:10.751
so we are quite a bit below the
pKa.

00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:14.962
And we calculated that at that
pH with this pKa,

00:23:14.962 --> 00:23:19.800
we would have 400 protonated to
every one deprotonated.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.176
I am not going to write out 400
of these to be protonated for

00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:31.000
every one deprotonated,
but we are mostly protonated.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.727
All right.
That is the problem,

00:23:33.727 --> 00:23:37.181
because we don't want to be
protonated.

00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:41.636
We want to be deprotonated for
the enzyme to work.

00:23:41.636 --> 00:23:46.363
What does the enzyme do?
Well, part of how the enzyme

00:23:46.363 --> 00:23:51.272
catalyzes the reaction is that
it lowers the pKa of the

00:23:51.272 --> 00:23:53.818
homocysteine.
Instead of ten,

00:23:53.818 --> 00:23:58.090
which is what the pKa is with
free homocysteine,

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.818
the pKa now,
when homocysteine is bound to

00:24:01.818 --> 00:24:07.407
the enzyme, is six.
That is a pretty substantial

00:24:07.407 --> 00:24:09.901
drop.
The pKa is substantially

00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:13.082
lowered.
Now let's go and look at what

00:24:13.082 --> 00:24:18.156
that does for us in terms of the
reaction that is catalyzed.

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:21.509
All right.
What is happening here is the

00:24:21.509 --> 00:24:23.659
zinc.
Here comes the zinc.

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:28.646
The zinc is acting as a Lewis
acid, and it is coordinating,

00:24:28.646 --> 00:24:34.596
binding that homocysteine.
And that interaction between

00:24:34.596 --> 00:24:40.158
the zinc and the sulfur of the
homocysteine lowers the pKa of

00:24:40.158 --> 00:24:43.125
the homocysteine from ten to
six.

00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:48.503
That is why this protein has to
have the zinc to act as the

00:24:48.503 --> 00:24:51.099
Lewis acid.
We can go back to

00:24:51.099 --> 00:24:55.456
Henderson-Hasselbach and plug in
our new values.

00:24:55.456 --> 00:25:00.000
We are still at physiological
pH, 7.4.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.430
But now, the pKa is 6.
And so our ratio then,

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:09.666
of protonated to deprotonated,
instead of 400 to one,

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:13.996
is now one to 25.
There is more deprotonated

00:25:13.996 --> 00:25:20.440
homocysteine when it is bound to
the enzyme at this physiological

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:26.381
pH because the pKa is lower.
And if we look at that in terms

00:25:26.381 --> 00:25:30.575
of this again --
-- Here is the pKa.

00:25:30.575 --> 00:25:33.808
The protonated is equal to
deprotonated,

00:25:33.808 --> 00:25:37.870
and our pKa now is six for the
bound homocysteine.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.518
And now the pH,
the physiological pH is above

00:25:41.518 --> 00:25:43.259
the pKa.
It is at 7.4.

00:25:43.259 --> 00:25:47.072
And, above the pKa,
there is more deprotonated,

00:25:47.072 --> 00:25:49.891
25 deprotonated to one
proteinated.

00:25:49.891 --> 00:25:54.367
Now we are in good shape.
You need the deprotonated for

00:25:54.367 --> 00:25:58.098
it to be reactive.
Most of it is deprotonated.

00:25:58.098 --> 00:26:03.546
The enzyme can go.
The enzyme uses this Lewis acid

00:26:03.546 --> 00:26:08.558
catalysis to drive this reaction
forward in the direction that

00:26:08.558 --> 00:26:11.433
you want.
It is all about adjusting.

00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:14.308
Enzymes can work by adjusting
pKa's.

00:26:14.308 --> 00:26:16.855
All right.
Chemical equilibrium,

00:26:16.855 --> 00:26:21.456
the first thing we started with
in the second half of the

00:26:21.456 --> 00:26:24.577
semester.
What is true about methionine

00:26:24.577 --> 00:26:30.000
synthase is that it exists in
multiple conformations.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.901
This enzyme can have multiple
states.

00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:37.577
And these conformations are in
equilibrium with each other.

00:26:37.577 --> 00:26:42.010
Lots of things can be in
equilibrium, including enzymes.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.154
And an equilibrium is a dynamic
process.

00:26:45.154 --> 00:26:48.862
What is happening?
Well, let's look at why this

00:26:48.862 --> 00:26:51.522
enzyme would need multiple
states.

00:26:51.522 --> 00:26:54.827
Well, it needs to react with
homocysteine,

00:26:54.827 --> 00:26:59.100
it needs to react with the
folic acid, and it needs to

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.614
react with the S-adenosyl
methionine and flavodoxin to do

00:27:03.614 --> 00:27:09.084
this reaction over here.
If we look at the structure of

00:27:09.084 --> 00:27:13.323
the enzyme, the vitamin B12 is
in green, the methyl group that

00:27:13.323 --> 00:27:17.492
is going to be transferred is in
red, and all this yellow and

00:27:17.492 --> 00:27:19.924
white is more protein.
Homocysteine,

00:27:19.924 --> 00:27:23.329
when it is deprotonated,
needs to come in here and

00:27:23.329 --> 00:27:26.942
accept that methyl group.
Folic acid needs to come in

00:27:26.942 --> 00:27:30.000
here and donate the methyl
group.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.764
And also S-adenosyl methionine,
in the activation reaction,

00:27:33.764 --> 00:27:37.593
needs to methylate at the same
time the electron is added to

00:27:37.593 --> 00:27:40.125
the system.
The enzyme needs to position

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:43.305
all of these guys up here.
And, if you look at the

00:27:43.305 --> 00:27:46.875
structure, there is no room for
anything to fit into the

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:49.341
structure.
Nothing can kind of go over.

00:27:49.341 --> 00:27:51.937
You can just barely see the
methyl group.

00:27:51.937 --> 00:27:55.637
But these guys are kind of big
and are not going to fit in

00:27:55.637 --> 00:27:58.253
here.
Because in this one

00:27:58.253 --> 00:28:01.090
conformation of the enzyme,
they do not fit.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.861
The answer has to be that the
enzyme moves,

00:28:03.861 --> 00:28:06.237
it changes shape during the
reaction.

00:28:06.237 --> 00:28:09.734
And this is something that had
been known for enzymes,

00:28:09.734 --> 00:28:13.494
that they did this for quite
some time, but my father told

00:28:13.494 --> 00:28:17.057
all our neighbors that his
daughter had discovered that

00:28:17.057 --> 00:28:19.432
enzymes change shape.
[LAUGHTER] But,

00:28:19.432 --> 00:28:22.468
since none of our neighbors
knew anything about

00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:24.909
biochemistry,
even what an enzyme was,

00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:26.954
I think that that was just
fine.

00:28:26.954 --> 00:28:31.542
All right.
So this needs to change shape.

00:28:31.542 --> 00:28:34.423
This is a picture of the
structure.

00:28:34.423 --> 00:28:38.067
Here is the B12.
The red is the methyl group

00:28:38.067 --> 00:28:41.203
again.
This whole region needs to move

00:28:41.203 --> 00:28:44.762
to make room for those reactions
to happen.

00:28:44.762 --> 00:28:49.423
There has got to be a number of
different states of this

00:28:49.423 --> 00:28:52.220
protein.
Here is a little cartoon.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.203
In orange is where the B12
binds to the protein.

00:28:56.203 --> 00:29:01.107
The B12 is in red.
This region above we call the

00:29:01.107 --> 00:29:04.015
methyl cap.
It sits over the methyl group

00:29:04.015 --> 00:29:07.285
and protects it.
There needs to be a domain to

00:29:07.285 --> 00:29:09.902
bind folic acid,
another domain binds

00:29:09.902 --> 00:29:12.882
homocysteine,
and another domain over here

00:29:12.882 --> 00:29:16.807
binds the S-adenosyl methionine
and is involved in that

00:29:16.807 --> 00:29:20.441
oxidation-reduction reaction and
the remethylation.

00:29:20.441 --> 00:29:24.802
What has to be true for this
enzyme is that you need at least

00:29:24.802 --> 00:29:30.024
four different conformations.
You need a conformation where

00:29:30.024 --> 00:29:32.467
the folic acid sits on top of a
B12.

00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:35.120
It needs to give the methyl
group over.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.960
You need a conformation where
the homocysteine in yellow

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.009
domain sits on top of the B12
and accepts the methyl group.

00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:45.383
Zinc needs to be around there,
too.

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:49.781
You need a conformation that is
resting where the region that we

00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:53.690
saw in the initial crystal
structure is sitting over this

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.505
cap.
It is capping the B12.

00:29:55.505 --> 00:29:59.554
And you need a conformation
where this activating domain is

00:29:59.554 --> 00:30:03.115
above the B12 to do the
oxidation-reduction reaction

00:30:03.115 --> 00:30:06.983
there.
So we need at least these four

00:30:06.983 --> 00:30:09.760
conformations.
And what is true is that the

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.661
enzyme is just kind of switching
conformation as it is going

00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:17.297
through, and that these
conformations are in equilibrium

00:30:17.297 --> 00:30:21.264
with each other and are just
shifting back and forth to these

00:30:21.264 --> 00:30:24.173
different states.
And, when you add something

00:30:24.173 --> 00:30:27.280
like folic acid,
it helps shift the conformation

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.085
to this form.
When you add homocysteine,

00:30:31.085 --> 00:30:34.614
it helps shift the conformation
to this form.

00:30:34.614 --> 00:30:37.983
This is just chemical
equilibrium going on.

00:30:37.983 --> 00:30:42.074
There is a lot of things that
can be in equilibrium.

00:30:42.074 --> 00:30:45.764
And enzyme conformations can be
in equilibrium,

00:30:45.764 --> 00:30:50.818
just like some of the reactions
that we studied in the beginning

00:30:50.818 --> 00:30:53.545
of the course.
Enzymes are dynamic.

00:30:53.545 --> 00:30:56.112
Equilibrium is a dynamic
process.

00:30:56.112 --> 00:31:00.672
Chemistry is dynamic.
Things are happening.

00:31:00.672 --> 00:31:04.893
I am not talking about
chemistry in the solid state in

00:31:04.893 --> 00:31:08.317
this course.
I am talking about chemistry in

00:31:08.317 --> 00:31:11.742
solution, because that is
chemistry of life.

00:31:11.742 --> 00:31:16.202
That is the chemistry that is
happening in your body that

00:31:16.202 --> 00:31:19.945
allows you to breathe and live.
And so, finally,

00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:24.245
I am going to show you
methionine synthase in action in

00:31:24.245 --> 00:31:25.578
its dynamic process.
