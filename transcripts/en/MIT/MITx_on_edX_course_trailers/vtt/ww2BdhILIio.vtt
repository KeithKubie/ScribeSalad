00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.020
JOHN GUTTAG: Computational devices have
become so pervasive that most of

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.570
the time we don't even realize
that we're using them.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.865
Computation keeps our planes in the
air and our cars on the road.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:15.300
It manages our electrical,
communications, and financial systems.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.370
It controls everything from
homes to pacemakers.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.650
And most importantly, computation
has changed the way people

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.910
think about the world.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.370
Hello.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.510
My name is John Guttag, and I want to
tell you a little something about the

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.759
course Introduction to Computation
and Programming in Python.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.840
On the surface, this course may appear
to be just another introduction to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.470
programming in Python.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.320
But if that's all you get out of
it, I'll be very disappointed.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.340
In particular, you should come away from
this course with a good start on

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.800
understanding how to use computation
to solve real problems.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.570
The idea is to simultaneously Python,
how to be a good programmer, and do

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.720
both of these in the context of solving
problems of genuine interest.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.080
Now for some truth in advertising.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.900
Like all good engineering courses,
this course is mostly

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.750
about learning by doing.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.980
We've worked hard at preparing
the online lecture material.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.190
But truth be told, you'll learn a lot
more by doing the problem sets and

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.490
attempt to apply the things we've
talked about in the lectures.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.680
If you've never programed before,
you're in for a treat.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.600
It may take you a little while to get
the hang of it, but once you do,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.590
you'll discover that programming
is an enormous amount of fun.
