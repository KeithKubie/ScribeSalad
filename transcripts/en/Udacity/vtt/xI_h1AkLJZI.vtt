00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.680
It's time to expose the secure
monolith pod externally and

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.530
to do that will create
a kubernetes service.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.760
Explore the monolith
service configuration file.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.350
Things to note, one we've got a selector
which is used to automatically find and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.830
expose any pause with the labels.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.375
App equals monolith,
secure equals enabled.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:26.390
Two, now have to expose the no port
here because this is how we will for

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.850
external traffic from port 31 thousand
to engine next on port four four three.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.380
Use the kubect1 create command
to create the monolith service

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.960
from them on the service
configuration part.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.910
This output is telling us you're
using a port to expose the service.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.920
You're going to have port collisions if
another app tries to bind to that port

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.860
on one of your servers.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.850
Kubernetes handles this port
assignment for us normally.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.230
Here, I chose one so that it's easier
to configure health checks later on.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.910
Use the G Cloud compute
firewall rules command

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.190
to allow traffic to the mildest
service on the exposed no port.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.970
Now that everything is set up.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.040
We should be able to hit the secure
monolith servers from outside cluster,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.320
and what value is in port 40.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.330
First let's get an IP address for
one of our nodes.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.740
And then try hitting the secure
Monolith service using Curl.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.590
That's not working.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.220
What's going wrong?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.210
On that note I'm going to stop here and
see if Carter can help us troubleshoot.
