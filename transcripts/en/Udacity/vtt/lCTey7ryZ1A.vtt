Refreshing our page you see here that it

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.680
correctly appended the header to our page but that it's slightly off.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.630
Again we can make a simple fix with CSS to center our header.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.300
Back in our code we simply select the H2 elements on our page and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.100
change the text align to be center.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.020
And going back to our chart we see here.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.450
The World Cup Attendance title has properly been centered on our page.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.360
And hopefully this shows you the benefit that d3 provides us by allowing us to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.960
use standard CSS and HTML knowledge that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.090
we might have gathered from web development to create great data visualizations.
