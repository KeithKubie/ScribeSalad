00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.719
Okay. So, let's start with the joint probability.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.120
Now since A and B are both dependent

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.330
on each other, there are only two possibilities.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.802
Both can be heads or both can be

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:14.628
tail, tails. So the joint probability is also 0.5. What

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:19.620
is the, what is the conditional probability? Conditional probability is given as

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.165
probability of A comma B upon probability of B. So,

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:28.530
conditional probability is 1. Now, what is the entropy

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.100
of A? It is similar to the last example, because

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.570
we are still using fair coins. So, the entropy of

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.080
A is 1. Entropy of B is also 1. What

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.570
is the joint entropy between A and B? Okay. Let's

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.380
use this formula, and see if our answer changes. Okay,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.190
the joint entropy comes out to be 1, which is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.220
different than our last example. What is the conditional entropy?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.560
The conditional entropy is given by this formula. Let's substitute

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.510
the values to find out what we get. Okay, the conditional

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.973
entropy comes out to be 0. What is a mutual

00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:04.665
information between A and B, then subtract the entropy of A,

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.718
and the conditional entropy of A given 0, which is

00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:10.560
1 minus 0, which is 1. So the, so the mutual

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.710
information in this case is 1, while in the previous

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310
case, it was 0. So since these coins are dependent on

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.110
each other, the random variable A gives us some information about

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.100
the random variable B. This tells you, how mutual information works.
