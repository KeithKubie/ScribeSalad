REBECCA MOORE: Hello,
good afternoon,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.420
and welcome to Maps for Good,
savings trees and saving lives

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.630
with petapixel-scale computing.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.400
I just love saying
that word, petapixel.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.230
How's I/O going for you guys?

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.095
Yes?

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:16.595
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:18.720
All right.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.620
Well, in my opinion we've
saved the best for near last.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.980
My name is Rebecca Moore.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.810
I'm the engineering
manager on the GEO team.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.700
I lead two projects,
Google Earth Outreach,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.310
which is our program that
works with nonprofits

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.240
and indigenous communities
all over the world

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.380
to foster the use of
Google's mapping tools,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.580
to make the world
a better place.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.430
And then also,
several years ago I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.790
started the Google
Earth Engine project,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.300
which is what we're
going to focus on today.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.740
Both of these were 20% projects
that are now thriving teams.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.505
So go Google.

00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:56.380
We're going to talk
about a couple of things.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.160
First of all, what is Maps for
Good, How did it get started.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.280
I want to introduce you guys
to not only Earth Engine,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.130
but the whole field
of geoscience.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.130
A lot of times when we
talk about Earth Engine,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.570
we're talking to specialists
in so-called remote sensing.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.350
I think a lot of you guys are
Android developers or whatever.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.800
So there may be
some new concepts.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.320
We'll crack open
Earth Engine, look

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.420
under the hood at how it
works, why it's so amazing.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.572
We actually have experimental
APIs that we'll demonstrate.

00:01:26.572 --> 00:01:28.030
Then we're going
to talk about some

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.120
of the really exciting projects
that our partners are doing

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.310
that are making the world
a better place using

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.130
Earth Engine.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.430
And finally show you
how you can get started.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.960
So how did I get started?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.240
I'm not an activist.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.064
I'm just a computer
science nerd.

00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:46.230
But I live in this beautiful
place in the Santa Cruz

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.300
Mountains.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.090
And one day back in 2005 in
the summer, I opened my mail

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.920
and I got this.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.520
OK, what does it say?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.200
Hm.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.700
So I'm a map geek,
so I studied it.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
Notice of intent to harvest
timber, non-industrial timber

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.430
management plan area.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.210
The legend was not that helpful.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.690
If you look at it, it
sort of says black lines

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.970
tell you what's going on.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.230
Well, the whole
thing's black lines.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.420
So there were a couple
thousand of my neighbors

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.190
and I that got this
notice in the mail.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.840
And most people threw it out.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.690
Because they couldn't
understand it.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.010
But Google Earth had just
launched two months earlier.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.500
And I had been playing
with Keyhole before that.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.570
And I thought what if-- I wanted
to understand what this map was

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.370
saying, because I was
worried that my community was

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.130
threatened.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.590
We have the largest remaining
stand of old growth redwood

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.980
trees in Santa Clara County.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.720
It's a beautiful place.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.150
So over one weekend, I
opened up Google Earth.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.370
And I found the same place.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.370
And I started bringing in
the elements of the plan

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.820
onto Google Earth.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.310
Where the helicopters were
going to land and take off.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.250
Where the logging
zone was going to be.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.700
How close it was going
to be to schools,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.326
day care center, nursery
schools, and so on.

00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:09.380
Google Earth also, of course
you know, gives us 3D.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.564
So we had just
acquired SketchUp,

00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:12.980
and one of my
colleagues helped me

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.370
make a 3D model of a
helicopter on a bombing run

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.160
over the schools.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.770
Anatomically correct
helicopter, actually.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.880
Tree to scale.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.820
But because, in fact,
the plan was proposing--

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.300
because the land
was so steep, they

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.010
couldn't get the
logs out by road.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.830
So they were going
to be helicoptering

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.410
over the community
in perpetuity.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.750
So this was actually
the same time

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.390
when Al Gore was going around
with an "Inconvenient Truth."

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.520
I had a much smaller
audience, but I

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.530
was being asked to
present this Google Earth

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.650
visualization and the animated
fly over to the newspapers,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.580
to the politicians, to
members of my community,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.810
to the Sierra Club.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.220
Because no one could understand
that 400 page document and read

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.200
those grainy black
and white maps.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.490
But they could understand
the data in Google Earth.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.770
And eventually,
it took two years,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.400
there were a lot of
battles back and forth.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.209
But using Google
Earth, we not only

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.079
showed that the plan
was a bad idea for fire,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.420
safety, water pollution,
endangered species, and so on,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.910
but actually that
it was illegal.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.200
We used Google Earth to prove
that the plan did not even

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.600
meet the requirements
for consideration.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.947
And so we stopped the
logging using Google Earth.

00:04:36.947 --> 00:04:38.530
Here's where you're
supposed to cheer.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.518
Yay!

00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:43.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.740
So that got a lot of
attention in the media.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.100
And I started being contacted by
nonprofits all over the world.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.830
Teach us what you did.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.800
It was one of the earliest
grassroots environmental uses

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.470
of Google Earth.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.745
And so long story short,
as my 20% project--

00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:03.370
because at this point I was now
a Google engineer on the Google

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.460
Earth team, another story
there-- I said, hey,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.890
can I be the liaison to
the environmental community

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.080
and help them understand
how to use our tools.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.490
And with several
other Googlers, we

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.470
started what became
Google Earth Outreach.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.790
We now have more than 5,000
nonprofits all over the world

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.020
that are using Maps
API, creating KML,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.630
Street View visualization.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.060
They're doing all kinds
of things using our tools

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.140
for conservation,
human rights, disaster

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.480
response, cultural preservation.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.100
There are some amazingly
beautiful projects

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.960
that people are doing.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.760
So there I was in
the Brazilian Amazon

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.840
in 2008, because an
Amazon chief had actually

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.270
come to Google the year
before and asked for our help

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.110
to teach his people how to
put themselves on the map.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.990
Literally, because
this was his territory,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.480
and it was under threat.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.840
There were illegal invasions
of his land happening

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.550
that you can even see in
the satellite imagery.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.609
And when he saw that
in Google Earth-- he

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:06.900
was the first member of his
tribe to go to university--

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.800
he said, this is the tool
that will raise awareness

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.810
with people around the world
of the threats my people face.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.040
And he told his
tribe the time has

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.190
come to put down the bow and
arrow and pick up the laptop.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.950
But while we were
there, we also met

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.160
with a Brazilian geoscientist.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.360
And he said to us, Google Earth
and Google Maps are great.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.100
But in fact, the earth
is changing dramatically.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.640
This is deforestation
in the Amazon

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.730
over a couple of decades.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.430
That pattern is very typical.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.570
They were losing more than
a million acres a year

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.300
of Amazon rainforest to
often illegal deforestation.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.120
This scientist had
the methodology

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.720
to analyze daily
satellite data coming in

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.030
and automatically detect
areas of suspicious change.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.450
And alert law enforcement.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.390
Because the law enforcement
on the ground is very skimpy.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.630
But the problem was, it
was like terabytes of data.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.630
It required weeks of
processing on his desktop.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.190
By the time you would get
the results, it was too late.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.540
So he said, Google, you
have Google Earth and Maps.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.490
You let us look at the data.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.090
How about if you let us
measure, monitor, do science.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.149
And do alerting on changing
phenomena on the earth surface,

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:27.940
like deforestation.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.740
Well, that was a
pretty cool challenge.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.500
And so we decided to do that.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.370
That was the inspiration
for Google Earth Engine.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.950
That you can not only look
at the data, the imagery,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.690
but you can analyze it.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.840
And so we think of Earth
Engine as deriving information

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.350
from all of this data
that is around us,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.190
but has not been
thoroughly mined

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.340
for useful information for
people and for the planet.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.440
So for example, there
are a ton of satellites.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.730
This is just NASA's
satellites that

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.210
are orbiting the planet--
as we're sitting here--

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.760
working very hard,
collecting lots of data.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.010
And not just pictures of earth,
but scientific measurements

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.360
that could relate to weather,
heat, all kinds of things.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:28.080
And one example sensor
is the Landsat satellite.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.260
It's been orbiting--
that program

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.030
has been orbiting earth
for more than 40 years.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.390
Every 16 days, it
completes a pass

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.030
and it starts all over again.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.470
It's never had a
break in coverage.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.539
There's more than
3.6 million images

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.910
of Landsat data in the archive.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.900
And it's a treasure trove.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.270
And that's just one example.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.620
Now I said that it's not
just red, green, blue pixels.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.670
It's not just RGB.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.628
And I want to say a little
bit more about that.

00:08:57.628 --> 00:08:59.800
Because here's where the
interesting geoscience

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.300
comes in.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.380
So let's go back to
high school physics.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.270
We know the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.560
So there's the visible light to
human beings, red, green, blue.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.460
And then beyond that, there's
infrared and other bands.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.000
These satellites are
actually taking measurements

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.700
across all of those bands.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.460
So for example, here
is a Landsat image,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.690
right near Burning Man.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.330
There's various things
going on in that scene.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.850
It's kind of hard to figure out.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.450
There's clouds,
there may be snow.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.050
There may be grass.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.380
It's hard to tell.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.490
Very, very typical
satellite image.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.860
That's what you can see with
the red, green, blue bands.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.990
But if instead you use the red
and the near-infrared bands,

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.120
you can discriminate vegetation.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.340
Growing vegetation.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.060
And that shows up here
in the dark green.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.960
Or if you're interested
in snow-- snow and ice--

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.210
you can look at the green
and the mid-infrared band.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.850
And that does an excellent
job of discriminating

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.860
snow and ice versus
everything else.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.350
So this kind of data is
important for us to store.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.130
So we became
committed to storing

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.990
all of this scientific-- these
spectral bands of information.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.270
So there's the
nature of the data,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.990
and then there's
the scale of it.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.390
So I mentioned Landsat
is a huge archive.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.950
It comes off the
satellites, and it

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.110
goes onto tapes in a
vault in South Dakota.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.070
It's very secure.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.150
But the problem is it's
difficult to get access.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.350
And until 2008, it
cost $600 a scene.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.600
So scientists used to say,
we would do the science

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.450
on the data we could afford,
not the data we needed.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.060
But in 2008, the US government
enlightened data policy,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.860
made all of Landsat free.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.780
Suddenly the historic
archive and the data

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.000
being collected every
day-- massive amounts--

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.090
is now available
suddenly for data mining.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.330
How could you possibly
handle that on your desktop?

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.060
You can't.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.350
This is where cloud
computing comes in.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.850
So with Earth Engine
we decided to focus

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.660
on five or six of the
most important satellites

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.430
that scientists were
telling us would

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.240
be transformative in advancing
science, natural resource

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.610
monitoring, if we
could get that data out

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.670
of those dusty archives
and online and available

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.394
for analysis.

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:38.060
So that's what we did
with Earth Engine.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.190
And when you look
at this data center,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.040
there's really two
things about this

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.539
that are important
for Earth Engine.

00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:44.940
First the storage.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.570
We're now storing
petabytes of this satellite

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.700
and other environmental
data coming in every day.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.170
And then the compute resources.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:59.130
Massive compute that's
co-located with that storage.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.650
So when you have all the data,
and you have this compute,

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:02.649
what can you do with it?

00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:06.190
Well for example, most
scenes look like this.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.010
This is, I think it's Borneo.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.360
But when you-- if
Landsat collects

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.270
let's say 20, 24 images
a year, the clouds

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.075
may be over one
pixel in one image.

00:12:17.075 --> 00:12:18.652
But clouds move around.

00:12:18.652 --> 00:12:20.610
They won't be over that
pixel in another image.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.230
If we have all the pixels,
we can select the best pixel

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.430
from a stack.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:30.005
And we can composite a
complete cloud-free image.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.390
Here's another place.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.130
This is the Isle
of Mull in England.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.940
And this is after we composited
and removed all of the clouds.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.420
it's like magic.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.160
South America used to look like
this in Google Earth and Maps

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.640
a year ago.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.750
Not that great, to be honest.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.360
But after we applied
this technique

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.480
to all of South America,
It looks like this now.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.880
And in fact, last spring we
did it for the whole planet.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.500
And we launched the first
15 meter global cloud-free

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.910
satellite based
map of the planet.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.450
And that is what you see in
Google Earth and Google Maps

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.580
when you open them.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.760
And that was created
by Earth Engine.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.520
So that was one time period.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.940
The dates of those images were
approximately-- the pixels

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.690
that we used to make that
cloud-free mosaic were

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.110
approximately 2012.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.610
We went back a
little earlier if we

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.725
had to in really cloudy areas.

00:13:31.725 --> 00:13:33.382
But then we did
the next project.

00:13:33.382 --> 00:13:34.840
We said, well we
have all this-- we

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.080
have like more than
30 years of data.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.210
What if we could create
essentially a cloud-free image

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.130
of the whole planet every year?

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.590
And then stitch those
together into a seamless,

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.400
online animation that
you can navigate.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.214
So we built that.

00:13:51.214 --> 00:13:52.130
It's called Timelapse.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.980
We launched it last May.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.950
And it's an HTML5 video
animation of the entire earth.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.260
Whereas you fly in, instead
of in Google Earth and Maps,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.310
where the world is static,
it's animating underneath you

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.610
from 1984 to 2012.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.610
And these are some of the
phenomena you can see.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.720
You can see glaciers retreating,
crop circles of irrigation

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.890
appearing in the
desert of Saudi Arabia.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.800
These artificial islands
sprouting off of Dubai,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.880
because the tourism agency
wanted more beachfront.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.490
And deforestation in the Amazon.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.150
But we're not limited to this.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.590
You can go anywhere in
the world in Timelapse

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.450
and you can find
interesting things.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.430
Here's Las Vegas.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.990
What do you see?

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.230
Las Vegas was the
fastest growing city

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.490
in the US during this period.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.740
What it's saying to me
is Las Vegas is growing,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.917
but Lake Mead is shrinking.

00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:47.000
And that's pretty obvious.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.625
You can see that in
just a few seconds.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.580
Time Magazine was really
excited about this.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.170
Maybe because their
name is Time, who knows.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.270
But we worked with them
actually as partners

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.110
to launch this on
their site as well.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.840
And they did a whole
series of science

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.370
and environmental
reporting of the phenomena

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.750
that you could see,
really for the first time,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.450
in Timelapse that help
you understand things

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:18.330
like urban expansion or
desertification or climate

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.440
change.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.560
Now what I wanted to point
out is the kind of compute

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.310
that was involved.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.680
So this was almost 30
years of satellite data.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.550
We analyzed more than two
million Landsat scenes.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.470
It was almost a petabyte
of data, 909 terabytes.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.290
It took two million
hours of computation.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.610
But we sharded it
over 66,000 computers,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.090
and so we had the result
in a couple of days.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.810
I think it would've taken
300 years or something, if we

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.450
had tried to do it
on a single computer,

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.890
if it never rebooted
in those 300 years.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.800
Those are
visualization products.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.050
But the heart of why we built
Earth Engine was for science.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.990
This is Carlos Souza.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.200
He was the scientist who
originally inspired us.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.690
That was his system, called
SAD-- Sistema de Alerta de

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.700
Desmatamento-- for detecting
and alerting on deforestation.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.290
He has now built-- really
our first power user,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.920
our first launched application--
running on the Earth Engine

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.410
API in Backend-- to monitor
deforestation in the Amazon.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.870
It's a very canvas
app that allows

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.580
you to change the temporal
range on the client.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.640
And you see the patches-- those
red patches of deforestation--

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.680
that show up,
depending upon what

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.990
occurred during that time range.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:41.080
Every month, he
publishes a bulletin

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.450
that goes to law enforcement--
to Brazilian law enforcement

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.210
authorities on what has been
seen using Earth Engine.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.250
And he reported to
us that it's cutting

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.400
in half the time
it used to take.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.560
And moreover, now he can give
it to all these other countries

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.186
in the Amazon Basin and around
the tropical forested belt

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:03.254
of the world who've
been wanting that.

00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:05.420
But they didn't want to
deal with running a software

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.500
package from this researcher.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.050
Now that it's online
in Earth Engine,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.359
they can all have access to it.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:16.079
Back in the US, we did a
project with Matt Hansen,

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:20.230
who's a leading scientist
in analyzing Landsat data.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.180
And that was detecting
forest change

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.910
in Colorado in 2000 to 2010.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:31.750
Finding things like pine bark
beetle damage, wildfire damage.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.320
We then went global
with Matt Hansen

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.700
and created the world's first
high resolution global map

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:44.130
of deforestation, from 2000 to
2012 at 30 meter resolution.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.270
You would think that people
would have known where forest

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.040
was and where it
was disappearing.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.560
But in fact, there were
many, many countries

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.980
in which there was
complete ignorance.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.350
So that's what it looks like.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.200
It was published in
Science Magazine.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.030
We've had thousands of
institutions now downloading

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.900
the data and doing different
kinds of analysis on,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.070
well how does this
relate to national parks?

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.290
Are those parks
actually protecting

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.800
the landscape or not?

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.110
I should say about this,
this was a million hours

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.470
of CPU on 700,000
Landsat scenes.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.220
We ran it on 10,000
computers in parallel.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.020
So we had that in
less than a week.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.350
That one would have
taken 15 years.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.740
So the ideas were
like turbo-charging

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.050
this really great geoscience for
the benefit of the environment

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.340
and the benefit of all of us.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.130
Here's an animation
that shows you

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.860
some of the data in the
data set that we produced.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.990
This is the island of Sumatra.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.540
You see the advancement
of deforestation,

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.680
including encroaching on
their supposed national parks.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.490
And now the final
step with this project

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.370
is-- World Resources Institute
has used this data as the base

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:01.340
map for a monthly
alerting system,

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.490
called Global Forest Watch--
and go to globalforcewatch.org--

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:10.110
where anyone can find out what's
going on, in near real time,

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.580
in a forested place
on the planet.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.760
You can subscribe to a place
you may be interested in.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.950
Businesses are using this.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.737
Governments, media, and so on.

00:19:19.737 --> 00:19:20.820
So we're happy about that.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.640
OK let's crack
open Earth Engine.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.840
So This is sort of a typical
top down, bottom up thing.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.470
At the bottom of Earth Engine
we have this massive public data

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.550
catalog that we're
updating every day.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.190
And we keep adding to the
data sets that we host,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.700
based upon demand from
our community of users.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.460
On top of that, we have
two kinds of computation.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.190
Either interactive on demand.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.070
Or batch, when you
have a really big job,

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.950
like those one million
hours of computation

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.470
for the whole world.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.700
We have restish APIs.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.770
But in fact what our users
really are developing against

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.240
are our client libraries
in JavaScript and Python

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.680
that have about 600 functions
now that do image analysis

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.210
and do vector analysis, or
fused image and vector analysis.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.730
And finally, on
top of that, Google

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.230
has built a couple
of apps and we've

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.070
got this growing community of
users that are building this.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.520
We're still experimental.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.907
But we have now a couple
thousand developers on our API.

00:20:25.907 --> 00:20:27.990
So this is kind of going
through some of the data.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.440
I've mentioned Landsat.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.800
But there's MODIS,
there's elevation data.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.110
You can do a lot of interesting
things when you know elevation.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.180
Weather data we're
getting every three hours.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.330
Fire data, and so on.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.160
Another important point that's
kind of small on this slide.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.700
If you have a Google
Maps Engine account,

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.420
and you're uploading your own
data-- raster data, or soon

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.740
your vector data-- you can
analyze that from Earth Engine.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.850
Privately, securely.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.860
So that's kind of good.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.360
You get access to both public
data and your own private data

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.280
for analysis.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.400
So what can you do
with Earth Engine?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.520
Well, at the most basic,
you grab an image.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.670
Your image or one of the
images from our catalog.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.480
You can then apply
an algorithm to it.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.780
This may be one of our
several hundred algorithms

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.880
we've provided, or our
scientific community has

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.120
contributed, or maybe one
that you've written yourself.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.280
You can also filter a
collection of images

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.020
by date, or by
geography, by metadata.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.450
And this is actually where it
gets much more interesting.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.750
Because if you're just analyzing
one or two satellite images,

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.330
don't come to Earth Engine.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.630
We're like the Large
Hadron Collider when

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.330
you need like a
little telescope,

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.710
or a little-- I don't
what the analogy would be.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.820
But where it gets
interesting is when

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.570
you're trying to operate
over massive amounts of data.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.850
So you apply the algorithm
to the whole collection.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.110
And then you can reduce
it to a single image.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.440
This is truly MapReduce.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.340
And finally, you can do
aggregate statistics over that.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.100
Yes, truly MapReduce.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.547
Someone laughed, OK.

00:22:08.547 --> 00:22:11.130
I mentioned-- I'm going to kind
of speed up a little bit here,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.588
because I want to
get to the demos.

00:22:12.588 --> 00:22:14.340
But there's on-demand.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.570
You'll see lots of demos of
this interactive from our IDE

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.390
or through the API.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.830
If you have a
really big job, you

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.672
can do a batch job, which
we run at lower priority.

00:22:23.672 --> 00:22:24.630
So it's very efficient.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.270
We parallelize-- all
of those functions

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.890
are intrinsically parallel.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.960
So imagine there's some area
you're trying to analyze.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.050
We split it up into
256 by 256 image tiles.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.410
We distribute those to thousands
of computers if need be.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.740
Each one performs its part of
the computation, the algorithm.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.650
Under the covers of the API,
we stitch it all back together.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.360
And there you go.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.940
All right, some code.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.230
Remember I told you
we were removing

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.390
massive amounts of
clouds and producing

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.280
that first global
cloud-free image?

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.550
You can do this too,
in four lines of code.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.980
I hope this blows your mind.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.140
So if we walk through this, and
we have JavaScript and Python.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.940
The first thing accesses our--
you select an image collection.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.960
This is requesting the
Landsat 7 satellite.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.370
We're filtering it down in the
next line to a range of dates,

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:38.820
from January 1, 2011
to December 31, 2012.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.440
The third line is where
the magic happens.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.940
It says median image
is filtered dot median.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:51.150
What we're doing there is for
every pixel in every band,

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.610
we're finding that median.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.810
And the statistical
median tends to rule out

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:01.360
clouds, which are very bright,
or shadows, or data caps, which

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.670
are very dark.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.850
And you end up getting a
very nice representative

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:05.970
version of that pixel.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.020
So we're doing statistics on
the planet, which you can only

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.870
do when you have
massive amounts of data.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.147
And then finally,
adding it to the map.

00:24:12.147 --> 00:24:13.730
And the other thing
I should point out

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.990
is when you write this code,
you're creating an expression.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.250
It's almost a Lisp-like.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.830
It's a functional
expression of something

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.080
that will undergo
lazy evaluation.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.340
We store that code.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.550
It's applied when you
use our interactive IDE

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.170
to browse around.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:35.230
And it runs it on
demand or in batch mode.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.730
All right.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.640
Demos.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.290
So we have two frontends.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.100
One is our Workspace
GUI that's really

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.660
well-designed for
classification.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.270
This is our home page.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.990
If you go to
EarthEngine.google.org,

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.650
you'll see a series of
interesting data products

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.650
that have been produced.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.170
There's a data catalog
that you can browse.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.530
But now what we're
going to do is

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.480
use Google's machine
learning infrastructure,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:07.010
which we've wired in into
the backend of Earth Engine.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.340
So you know YouTube did
a major machine learning

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.930
on the corpus of YouTube videos.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.850
And they found that
there's a lot of cats.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.830
Well, I'm really curious
to see what people

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.640
find in all the corpus
of satellite data.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:28.900
So what we're doing here is
first choosing a range of dates

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.260
that we want to classify.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.960
What we're going to try
to build is a classifier

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.316
of forest versus non-forest.

00:25:35.316 --> 00:25:36.940
And literally you
can do it in a couple

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.950
of minutes in our Workspace.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.610
We're creating the classes.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.790
You could have two classes.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.890
You could have 10 classes.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.320
Of course, the more
classes you have,

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.970
it puts a burden on can
you really discriminate

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.700
those different classes from one
another, based upon the data.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.750
Remember that we're not just
analyzing the three band RGB

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.690
data that we see here,
but underneath that are

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.690
multiple bands.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.000
In the case of Landsat,
it may be 10 bands,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.730
depending upon which sensor.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:08.050
So now we're going to
train it, by putting down

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:14.620
here are representative spots
in this image that are forest.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.910
You can do this by
dropping a placemark,

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.110
you can create a polygon.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:23.970
And later, the machine
learning infrastructure

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:27.370
is going to try to extract
what's the pattern there,

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.610
as distinct from now
we're putting markers

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.550
down for non-forest.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:37.950
Looking for those places that
are clearly not forested areas.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.640
Google's machine
learning backend

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.710
has a whole series
of different methods

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.970
you can use-- cart,
random forests.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:52.920
We're going to use the fast
Naive Bayes, because it's fast.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.030
And it actually does
a pretty good job.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.800
So what we're doing now
is we're training a model.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.660
And you can see in the
upper left, and there we go.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.240
And I did not speed this up.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.750
This is actually
the way it works.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.460
It's now built that model.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.490
It's applied it to
what we're looking at.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.420
And as we zoom
out or pan around,

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.870
here is that
just-in-time evaluation.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.450
We're now applying
that model throughout

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.070
the Brazilian Amazon.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.710
And Chief Almir now
has classification

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.970
of forest versus non-forest.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.800
So that's the GUI.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.310
Now let's look at the IDE.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.260
You remember that
code on cloud removal.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.820
So it's a simple
IDE, but we have

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.300
a series of examples for
vector and raster analysis

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.080
that are built-in to
help you get started.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.160
There's a code
editor that has tips.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.752
If you're missing
your semicolons,

00:27:50.752 --> 00:27:52.043
we have built-in documentation.

00:27:55.242 --> 00:27:57.770
When you hit run,
that's when you actually

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.990
cause your algorithms
to run over the area

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.830
that you're looking
at in the viewport.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.700
And finally, this
is really important,

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.810
the Get link allows you to
say, OK, I really like this.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.490
Give me a link.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.906
I'm going to share
it with someone

00:28:08.906 --> 00:28:10.780
else who is an Earth
Engine Trusted Tester.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.880
They'll open it up.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.630
And they'll see exactly
your analysis on the data.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.330
And it will run for them.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.340
It's a great way to collaborate.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.440
So now we're actually going
to run a cloud removal.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.800
The first thing I'm going
to show you is bad data.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.050
So I think the first image
here is one week of Landsat 7.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.030
There was a defect
in the satellite

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.080
that has these scan line gaps.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.860
22% of the pixels are missing.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.230
There's clouds.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.710
But now we're going to bring
in that cloud removal code.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.340
This is what you get for--
this is the South Bay.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.960
And if you pan around, you
would see this elsewhere.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.150
Here's another example.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:02.150
In this case, we're going
into that area of Burning Man.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.210
And we're going to show those
different types of information

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:10.970
you can extract from the same
fundamental set of imagery,

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.020
just looking at different bands.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.320
That's the RGB imagery.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.500
Now we're going to bring in
the vegetation analysis that

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.080
just looks very simple.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.450
It's one line of
code in Earth Engine

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.990
to compute what you just saw.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.165
And now we're running the
snow and ice detector.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.790
Now, OK, that's interesting.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.870
Who cares, right?

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.410
Well, one of our
science partners

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.490
is now using this to look
at snowpack over the Sierra.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.830
And in fact has determined
very efficiently,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.070
in just a few lines
of code, you can

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:57.190
see the snowpack that was in
the Sierra in May of 2010.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:02.370
And then you can see the
snowpack as of last month.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.220
Again, you see pulling
down the code window.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.890
So that's 2010.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:16.390
And now we'll turn off
2010 and turn on this year.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.830
There's the drought.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.350
You can see it
with your own eyes.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.510
So all of those were
analyzing one point in time.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.736
Imagery at one point in time.

00:30:26.736 --> 00:30:28.110
Where it really
gets interesting,

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.910
since we have years, decades
of data, is looking at trends.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.230
Doing change detection.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.800
So this is a fun data set
we wanted to show you.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.230
We start with-- it's called
City Lights at Night.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.110
There's a particular
satellite that

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:47.210
is measuring light emission,
both visible and a bit

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:48.240
of near-infrared.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:53.350
And you can see the major
cities in Europe, for example.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:57.770
But we have in there I
think 20 years of data.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.720
So we're wondering, how
are these cities growing

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.510
or shrinking?

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:06.750
So we have an algorithm that
lets you do a linear fit.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:08.232
And then you can produce this.

00:31:08.232 --> 00:31:09.690
Again, in just a
few lines of code,

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.950
and you can see Spain
is getting-- red means

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:14.260
it's growing.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.610
The kind of green
means it's stable.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.780
The blue means it's decreasing.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.070
It's interesting you
can see blue in cities

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.979
like San Francisco and New York.

00:31:24.979 --> 00:31:26.770
Not necessarily because
they are shrinking,

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.090
but because of new
policies that are

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.290
trying to reduce
light pollution.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.660
And street lights are
facing down rather than up.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.880
But that big red blotch
over North Dakota

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.280
is the fracking oil
fields of North Dakota.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.980
I think it's the
Bakken oil fields.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.190
All right.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.790
The European Parliament,
member of the parliament

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.020
and the Society for
Conservation Biology,

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.930
they came to us because
they wanted to map

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.370
where are the roadless
areas of the world.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.950
Those last remaining places
that are untouched by humans.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.930
Because those are the center
of biodiversity, for example.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.560
And they had no way to do that.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.370
So using Earth Engine, we
brought in the Google Maps Road

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:13.270
Data.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:18.800
And we made a measurement
of all the areas

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.280
that were more than a certain
distance from the nearest road.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.230
This is showing 1,000
meters, or one kilometer

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.750
from the nearest road.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.960
But the organization wanted
to see 10 kilometers.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.650
We just changed the code,
changed that constant, re-ran.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.570
And you see how quickly
it reruns the results.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.760
And there it is for
the whole world.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.140
And they're using that now
as an instrument for policy,

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.970
trying to protect those areas.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.460
All right.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.992
So you've seen kind of
a whirlwind introduction

00:32:50.992 --> 00:32:52.950
to geoscience, a little
bit of what you can do.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.580
I just wanted to
end with what are

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.580
some of the amazing things
some of our partners

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.520
are doing beyond forest.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.190
Forest was our first
use case, but now we're

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.110
really branching out
with these partners.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:09.180
So David Lallemant at Stanford
is mapping earthquake hazard,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.740
using Earth Engine.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.550
This one I found
somewhat alarming.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.486
So here we are, Bay Area.

00:33:15.486 --> 00:33:17.360
You can bring in vector
data, as I mentioned.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.360
Here's the San Andreas Fault.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.040
He's modeled predicted
ground acceleration

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.820
in the event of a rupture
on San Andreas Fault of 7.8,

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.180
that matches the
1906 earthquake.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.740
I asked him, I said hm,
I wonder where I live.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.055
So we brought in two dots.

00:33:33.055 --> 00:33:34.430
I don't know if
you can see them.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.760
One down south is where I live.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.730
The other dot is
near the Bay Bridge.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.610
That's where we are right now.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:45.280
You can see why you might care
about having this information.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.730
Sea-level rise.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.320
You may have seen in
the news that glaciers

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.130
are-- like the Antarctic
is calving these glaciers.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.880
Sea-level's already
rising in certain places.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.800
People need to know what
the risk is to their home,

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.120
to their livelihood.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.820
And you can model that now.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.810
With the digital elevation,
modeling sea-level

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.460
rise, where will
inundation happen.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.034
This is being done with
the Australian government

00:34:10.034 --> 00:34:13.080
and CRCSI.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.300
Drought monitoring.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.270
Very relevant here
in California.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:24.179
So this is looking at anomalous
heat or wetness or dryness

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.570
in California for
the first two weeks

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.380
of December, last December.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.290
And you can see what we all know
who live here, that California

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:36.110
is showing up bright red
because of the tremendous,

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:40.460
unprecedented drought that has
struck much of the American

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.530
West.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.800
Now, a really important area.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.040
It's a little bit more wonky.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.940
It's called evapotranspiration.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.100
But being able to model how
plants are taking up water.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.699
How much water they're using.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:57.400
So this is Nebraska over
the Ogallala Reservoir.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.630
And we're modeling here--
this is Rick Allen's team,

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.040
University of
Nebraska and so on.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.450
They're modeling where
plants are taking up water.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.920
Now, this is important
for a lot of reasons,

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.510
like helping farmers
and food security.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.200
But there's also,
we're discovering,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.710
a lot of commercial interest
now in Earth Engine.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.480
We developed Earth
Engine as this platform

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.180
for helping science,
helping humanity, protecting

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.150
the environment.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.970
And that remains our huge focus.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.910
But we're being approached
by, for example, Gallo Winery.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:36.180
They manage 8 million acres
of vineyard in California.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.040
They try to tell their
farmers, their growers,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.270
how much irrigation to do.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:45.050
They have eight people who
download Landsat data by hand

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:46.050
into a desktop.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.970
And they run these algorithms
painfully on their desktop

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:50.990
that we have fully automated.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:54.810
So they are now Trusted Testers,
Gallo Winery of Earth Engine.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.285
And we're really excited
to see where that goes.

00:35:57.285 --> 00:35:58.660
The last one I
wanted to show you

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:05.260
was emerging infectious disease,
or global public health.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.760
This is one of the
more important ones.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.840
We focused a lot on environment.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.860
But it turns out
that you can predict,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.250
by knowing environmental factors
like rainfall, temperature,

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.880
the greening of the
landscape that you

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.640
can see from the
satellite data-- we've

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.300
shown you some examples of that.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.780
You can predict where
mosquitoes are going to hatch.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.260
Where there's going to be
various types of disease

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.640
vectors, six or eight
weeks in advance.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.650
And with that information,
you can mobilize the resources

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.500
much more effectively.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.690
So UC San Francisco
is just starting

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.409
to use Earth Engine to
do this kind of analysis.

00:36:44.409 --> 00:36:46.950
And the common theme that we're
hearing from these scientists

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.770
is they have the science.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.100
They know how to do it.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.740
But they've been limited to what
they can do on their desktop.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.100
This is what Gallo
Winery told us also.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.920
They want to scale.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.110
They want to go big, right.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.140
They want to go global.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.390
And now Earth Engine
lets them do that.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.360
These are some of our partners.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.950
As you can see, they are
largely scientific institutions,

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:07.990
government institutions.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.230
Because in fact, as
you've probably seen,

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:16.860
Earth Engine is a fairly
technical platform and API.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.550
We're really honored
to be working

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:22.370
with some of these leading
scientists in the world.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:26.220
We do have, again I said
it was an experimental API.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.750
And maybe half of you are
scared off by what you've seen.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:36.120
This is not a tool that lets
you send "yo" to someone.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.020
Right?

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.390
It's kind of the other extreme.

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.970
So you can cut
yourself in this--

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.600
it's really massively powerful.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.750
But you kind of got to
know what you're doing.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.480
Or you could probably
get into trouble

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.220
and make a lot of stuff
that doesn't make any sense.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.800
That said, we have a sign-up.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.380
We have our website.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.860
There's documentation.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.480
There's tutorials,
introductory API tutorial.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.910
And there's a
particular tutorial

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.180
on the Hansen global forest data
that we think is very useful.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.710
So what did I want to say.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:19.720
I think for a lot of you
guys, this technology

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.130
may be so out there that
it's not really relevant.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:25.510
And that's fine.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.030
That's great.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:32.400
We have really hit a sweet spot
with the geoscience community.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.340
What I'm excited about is seeing
if there is some middle ground.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.830
Can we make remote sensing--
this type of earth observation

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:45.210
data analysis-- transformatively
or disruptively easier

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.630
than it's been before?

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.860
So you don't have to be
a Ph.D. in that field,

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.220
in order to be able to
come in with new ideas.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.600
Contribute something new to this
community and to this space.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.990
And maybe change
the world in a way

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.050
that no one has ever
anticipated before.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.080
I know someone in this
room is going to do that.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.417
I know people watching are
going to use Earth Engine

00:39:05.417 --> 00:39:07.000
and they're going
to change the world.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.840
Thank you very much.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.109
So we just-- I kind
of get excited.

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:20.150
I kind of go on too long.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.490
But we do have a few
minutes for questions.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.215
So please, come up to
the-- there's two mics.

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:32.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:36.060
I'm a fellow geodata
geek and developer.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.390
And I work for a
commercial product

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:44.520
that allows you to move data
around, spatial data around.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.033
And so I'm curious
about your ability

00:39:48.033 --> 00:39:50.010
to export those
tiles that you've

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.610
computed with Earth Engine.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:55.370
And I would be very
interested to hear more

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.850
about those capabilities.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:58.880
REBECCA MOORE: That's
a great question.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.490
A lot of our users
have already developed

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:07.010
some historic workflow
in some other tool chain.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.030
But they see the
tremendous value

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:12.020
of using Earth Engine
for the data catalog,

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.490
for preprocessing, for producing
some of the data products

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:18.410
they need for their
other workflow.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.560
So yes, you can
produce something

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.530
and then download it to Google
Drive, your own personal Google

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.290
Drive.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.590
You can download it
over to Maps Engine.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.829
But if you put it
in Drive, then you

00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:31.870
can download it and do
whatever you want with it.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.170
It's your data.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:34.450
We have data liberation.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.920
And this is a good
example of that.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.590
Yes.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.290
A lot of people are doing that.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.950
Our goal is to make Earth
Engine so rich and so powerful

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.260
that fewer and fewer people
need to take the data away.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.280
They can get the job
done in Earth Engine.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.281
But whatever floats
your boat, that's fine.

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:50.780
Yes.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.050
You're next.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.040
AUDIENCE: Google has
announced their plans

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.710
to launch large
constellations of satellites

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.160
for communications.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.420
But is Google intending to enter
the earth imaging arena also?

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.170
REBECCA MOORE: So I
think you're referring

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.950
to Skybox acquisition,
which we're

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.980
really excited about actually.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:14.820
Because they are one of
those innovative, disruptive

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.420
new satellite companies.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.380
Skybox collects
one meter imagery.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.710
You can task their
constellation.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.750
They just launched one so far.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.820
They have plans to launch more.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.410
I think there are a lot of
exciting integration points.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.230
We can't speculate too
much, because it actually

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.130
hasn't closed, this deal.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:37.970
But we can see a lot of really
exciting opportunities there.

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.443
Does that answer your question?

00:41:39.443 --> 00:41:40.310
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.640
REBECCA MOORE: OK, yes.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.270
AUDIENCE: I'm involved
with a project

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.800
to categorize road
segments by their width.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:54.510
And it seems that this fits
with the set of tools you have.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:57.110
Am I correct in thinking that?

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.820
REBECCA MOORE: If you have
access to the high-res data-- I

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:05.590
think the public data catalog
we have, Landsat for example.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:11.454
Even if you pan-sharpen Landsat,
it's 15 meters per pixel.

00:42:11.454 --> 00:42:12.870
And that probably
doesn't give you

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:16.840
the resolution you want
for mapping road width.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.250
You're going to need a
higher resolution data set.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:21.820
If we had Skybox data,
that's one meter per pixel.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.430
They're commercial data sets.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:27.120
Now if you have
that data already,

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.560
you could bring that into
your Maps Engine account.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.730
And you can analyze
it in Earth Engine.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.530
And yes, you could do that.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.311
You could do that.

00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:35.310
It would be interesting.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.120
We'd love to try.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.270
Yes.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:40.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:41.970
So two questions actually.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.530
The first question
is that so you

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.250
did make mention of the
fact that you can come up

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.770
with irrigation
strategies, as far

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.620
as agriculture is concerned.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.440
I'm just wondering,
can Google Earth Engine

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.290
be used for the
purpose of tracking

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:58.700
crop yields in rural areas?

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.130
Especially where there are
frequent food shortages.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.240
REBECCA MOORE: Yeah, that's
an excellent question.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.060
The answer is yes.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.970
Some, at least two of
our science partners

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.540
that we know of are
already doing that.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.430
A global crop yield estimation.

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.330
There are tremendous
applications

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.540
of that for food security,
as you're suggesting.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.720
If you can bring in
information about drought,

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.070
rainfall patterns,
understanding something

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.180
about the nature of
the crops, and be

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.830
able to estimate the yield, it
has tremendous positive value.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.434
And people are doing that, yes.

00:43:33.434 --> 00:43:34.850
AUDIENCE: So the
second question I

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.400
had was pertinent to how often
is the imagery updated as

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.110
far as Google Earth
Engine is concerned?

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:45.200
So if you wanted to see what
your yield was in the last two

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.620
weeks or four weeks, is that
level of data available?

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.490
REBECCA MOORE: Yes.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.070
I love to be able to say that.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.230
Yes.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:57.170
We have a feed from
US Geological Survey.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:01.540
We're getting thousands of
images every day from them.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.190
From all of their sensors.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:06.000
All the Landsat satellites.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.200
We get the data I think within
less than 24 hours of it

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.170
being collected.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.900
So yes, there is
fresh data coming in,

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:19.210
available, in Earth Engine for
exactly that type of purpose.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.210
REBECCA MOORE: Yes.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.560
AUDIENCE: So I work a lot--
we do a lot of remote sensing

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.980
at my company.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.360
REBECCA MOORE: Yay, there are
some remote sensing people

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.520
here.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.220
AUDIENCE: And so I
gather that Earth Engine

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.580
is free to use for nonprofits
and for governments.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.680
But what about commercial
licensing and rights

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.760
to resell derivative products?

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.930
REBECCA MOORE: Right, right.

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:50.290
So as I said, our birth
was public benefit,

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.140
advancing science,
nonprofit use.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:57.070
We will continue to
really push on that.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.490
But there are commercial
companies that are interested.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:02.970
And we're actually
realizing that if you

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.580
want to change the world--
helping the business sector

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.120
do better management, for
example, of their supply chain.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.850
So Nestle or Walmart or
Unilever or McDonald's

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:18.480
can verify that where
they're sourcing their palm

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.700
oil for their Girl
Scout cookies is not

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.790
resulting in illegal
deforestation.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.010
That's a good thing.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.940
So we're just starting
this year to work

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:34.670
with a handful of commercial
companies for free.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.366
And letting them kick the
tires of Earth Engine.

00:45:37.366 --> 00:45:38.365
But use it commercially.

00:45:38.365 --> 00:45:42.200
The normal-- under our
Trusted Tester agreement--

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.120
normal license restriction is
you use it non-commercially.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.530
But if you have a
commercial application

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:51.419
you want to experiment
with, you can contact us.

00:45:51.419 --> 00:45:51.960
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.240
Thanks.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:59.290
REBECCA MOORE: But you have
to have a good use case.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.030
Because our team is small.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.150
We want to support
the people that we

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.680
think are going to do
really amazing things.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.400
All right.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.560
We have one minute left.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.360
Who's going to-- yes.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.290
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:16.710
The first one is I'm
curious about the plans

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.200
for improving the
support of vector data

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.140
within Google Earth Engine.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.080
And the second is
whether support

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.410
exists for interannual
analysis, like you

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:34.880
would use for computational
model-building and predictive

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.730
efforts.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.610
REBECCA MOORE: So I misled you.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.020
We're actually a minute over.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.870
What was the first question?

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.424
AUDIENCE: Plans for improving
the vector data supply.

00:46:44.424 --> 00:46:45.215
REBECCA MOORE: Yes.

00:46:45.215 --> 00:46:49.510
So today we integrate
with Google Fusion Tables.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.720
And so knock yourself out.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.050
We have a whole suite of vector
operations on Google Fusion

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:55.690
Tables.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.250
We're also integrating with
Maps Engine, Google Maps Engine

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.570
vector tables.

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:01.410
That should be
coming out this year.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:05.270
So we should have pretty rich
support for different vector

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:07.390
backends from Earth Engine.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.360
But today you can
use Fusion Tables.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.110
Interannual analysis,
yes you could do that.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.219
But why don't we talk
offline so I understand

00:47:15.219 --> 00:47:17.010
more specifically what
you're trying to do.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:18.480
All right you guys,
thank you very much.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.313
Go change the world.

00:47:19.313 --> 00:47:22.570
