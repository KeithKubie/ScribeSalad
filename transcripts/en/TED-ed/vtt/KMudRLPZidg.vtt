00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:12.271
Some people can't see 
the forest for the trees,

00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:18.533
but before Stephen Sillett, no one could see
or even imagine the forest in the trees.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.644
Stephen was an explorer of 
new worlds from the start.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:24.505
He spent his boyhood in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:28.229
reading Tolkien and playing 
Dungeons and Dragons with his brother Scott.

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:32.428
But when the Sillett family visited 
their grandparent's cabin near Gettysburg,

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:34.320
their grandmother Helen Poe Sillett,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.606
would take the boys into the nearby 
mountains and forests to bird-watch.

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:40.522
They called Grandma Sillett Poe,

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:44.876
and she taught the boys to identify 
songbirds, plants and even lichens,

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:51.029
creatures that often look like splotches of carpet
glued to the shady sides of rocks and tree trunks.

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:54.193
Looking upwards, 
both boys found their callings.

00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:58.141
Scott became a research scientist 
specializing in migratory birds.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.140
Stephen was more interested in the trees.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.612
The tangle of branches and leaves
attracted his curiosity.

00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:06.806
What could be hidden up there?

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:10.676
By the time Stephen was in college,
that curiosity pulled him skyward

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:16.140
to the tallest trees on Earth:
the ancient coast redwoods of Northern California.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.680
Rising from trunks 
up to 20 feet in diameter,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.132
redwoods can grow up to 380 feet, or 38 stories,
over a 2,000 year lifetime.

00:01:25.132 --> 00:01:29.616
But no one had thought to investigate 
the crowns of these natural skyscrapers.

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:32.183
Were there more than 
just branches up there?

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:34.914
Stephen decided to find out firsthand.

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:39.712
In 1987, Stephen, his brother Scott
and his friend Marwood

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:41.355
drove from Reed College in Oregon

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:45.207
to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park
in Northern California.

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:49.441
Deep inside the park,
Stephen picked the tallest redwood he could find.

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:52.606
Its lowest branches
were almost 100 feet up,

00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:54.456
far beyond his reach.

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:59.135
But he saw a younger, shorter redwood 
growing next to the target tree.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:02.658
With a running start, he leapt 
and grabbed the lowest branch,

00:02:02.658 --> 00:02:05.378
pulled himself up and scurried upwards.

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:07.972
He was free climbing
without ropes or a harness,

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:10.388
one misstep meant death.

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:12.434
But up he went, 
and when he reached the peak,

00:02:12.434 --> 00:02:17.162
he swayed and leapt across the gap of space
onto a branch of the target tree

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:20.021
and into a world never seen before.

00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:21.926
His buddy Marwood followed him up,

00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:25.718
and the two young men free climbed
high into the redwood's crown.

00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:29.436
Stephen came across lichens
like Grandma Poe had shown him as a boy.

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:33.355
He noticed that the higher he went,
the thicker the branches were,

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:35.451
not the case with most trees.

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.313
He found moist mats of soil many inches thick,

00:02:38.313 --> 00:02:43.020
made from fallen needles, bark,
other plant debris and dust from the sky

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.619
piled on the tops of the large branches.

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.465
He even found reiterations:

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:50.705
new redwood tree trunks 
growing out from the main trunk.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.316
The redwood had cloned itself.

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:55.098
When Stephen reached the pinnacle,

00:02:55.098 --> 00:02:58.714
he rested on a platform of 
crisscrossing branches and needles.

00:02:58.714 --> 00:03:02.481
Growing in the soil mat was a 
huckleberry bush with ripe berries!

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:05.162
He ate some and waited for his friend.

00:03:05.162 --> 00:03:09.897
Stephen had discovered a new world
hundreds of feet above the ground.

00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:14.044
His climb led to more excursions,
with safety equipment, thank goodness,

00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:17.502
up other ancient redwoods
as he mapped and measured the architecture

00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:21.733
of branches and additional trunks
in the canopy of an entire grove.

00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:25.383
Stephen became an expert
in the ecology of the tallest trees on Earth

00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:31.330
and the rich diversity of life in their crowns,
aerial ecosystems no one had imagined.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.146
There are ferns, fungi and epiphytic trees
normally found at ground level

00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:39.008
like Douglas firs, hemlocks and tan oaks

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:42.062
whose roots had taken hold
in the rich wet soil mats.

00:03:42.062 --> 00:03:48.885
Invertebrates such as ants, bumblebees, 
mites, beetles, earthworms and aquatic crustacean copepods

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:51.413
make their homes alongside
flowering plants like

00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:54.427
rhododendrons, currant
and elderberry bushes.

00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:58.419
Ospreys, spotted owls, and jays
search the canopy for food.

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.908
Even the marbled murrelet, 
a Pacific seabird,

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:04.003
flies many miles from the ocean
to nest there.

00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:06.975
Squirrels and voles 
peek out of penthouse burrows.

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:10.782
And the top predator?
The mighty wandering salamander!

00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:14.393
Sillett's research has changed
how we think about tall trees,

00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:16.939
and bolstered the case
for their conservation,

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:19.378
not just as impressive
individual organisms

00:04:19.378 --> 00:04:22.234
but as homes to countless other species.

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:25.283
So when you look up into 
the branches and leaves of a tree,

00:04:25.283 --> 00:04:26.992
ask, "What else is up there?"

00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:31.254
A new world might be just out of reach.
So leap for it.
