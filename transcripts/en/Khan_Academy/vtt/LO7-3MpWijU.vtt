00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.890
In the last video, we tried to
relate what 13.7 billion years

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.530
really means by compressing
it to 10 years, which is still

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.390
a pretty long time, at
least from our perspective.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.840
And we saw that these huge
periods of time, everything

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.890
that's happened since
the United States

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.470
Declaration of
Independence, all gets

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.220
compressed into
just five seconds.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.170
And that's not much when
you think about 10 years.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.230
I mean 10 years, you
could wait around a lot.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.130
That's a huge amount of time.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.979
So hopefully, that put things
in perspective a little bit.

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:34.520
What I want to do in this video
is kind of do the same thing,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.950
but relate the 13.7
billion years, if that were

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.470
a distance or the
length of a time line,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.070
how big each of these
periods would be.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.280
So just to start off,
at the timeline--

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.710
I'm recording this in
high definition right now.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.187
There should be
1,280 pixels wide,

00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:52.770
depending on where
you're watching it.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.060
So maybe you're watching
it on a high def TV.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.650
If the timeline was
width of my screen right

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.130
over here, if the timeline was
the width of my screen here,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.900
so if that was
13.7 billion years,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.122
from there-- let's say this is
the beginning of the universe

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:09.330
and this is our present time.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.730
If that was 13.7 billion
years, the amount

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.180
of time that humans have been
on this planet-- modern humans,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.290
so people who look and think
like us-- the amount of time

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.840
that we have been on this
planet will not even be a pixel.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.180
This little dot I drew
is multiple pixels.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.730
The amount of time we've been
here would not even be a pixel.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.630
In fact, a pixel--
and that dot I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.590
drew here is about four pixels.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.810
But a pixel, just one
little pixel on my screen,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.179
would represent
11 million years.

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.095
Let me scroll over it.

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:49.960
It would represent
11 million years.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.700
So if this was the
timeline, the dinosaurs

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.580
would have been extinct about
six pixels from the end.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.280
So it would be right about--
so six pixels from the end

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.762
is when the dinosaurs
would have gotten extinct.

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:06.220
And the amount of time that
modern humans are on the planet

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.630
wouldn't even register here.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.100
It would be 1/20 of
that pixel over there.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.840
In fact, if we just expanded
that very last pixel--

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.800
if we were to expand
that very last pixel--

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.010
I'll do it in yellow-- that very
last tiny pixel that you can't

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.250
see, if we were expand
that to the entire length

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.700
of this screen again-- so
if we were to just expand

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.530
just that very last pixel--
so I'm saying everything

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.280
on this yellow line could be
contained in that very last dot

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.150
right over there, then
every pixel in this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.160
would still be 8,000 years.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.320
So the entire period
of time that humanity

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.150
has been on this
planet on this scale--

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.700
so we've broken out this
little tiny pixel here all

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.280
the way out here, 200,000 years,
that's on the order of about 25

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.490
of these pixels.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.840
So 25 of these pixels would
be something like that,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.870
not even that, not even that.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.450
So 25 pixels on this screen--
at least at my resolution,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.230
is about that distance.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.980
So this is the fraction
of just that pixel that

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.820
is the amount of time humans
have been on the planet.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.970
If you want the
time since Jesus,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.120
it would be 1/4 of a pixel
on this yellow scale.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.376
On this yellow scale, it
would be 1/4 of a pixel.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.750
And the amount of time to the
Declaration of Independence

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.121
would be even a more
minuscule amount of time.

00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:37.620
So that's one way
to think about it.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.430
But these timelines to some
degree also don't give justice.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.805
So another way to
think about it,

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.450
what if we had a time line
that stretched from here,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.270
where I am, in this
San Francisco Bay

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.320
Area, if it stretched 1,300
kilometers to Seattle?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.950
So if this thing
stretched 1,300 kilometers

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.610
all the way to Seattle, so
this thing, the Big Bang,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.010
would be sitting in Seattle.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.150
This would be
sitting in Seattle.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.790
The universe--
well, the formation

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.910
of the Earth and the
solar system, this

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.360
would be about 200
kilometers away,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.610
a little over 200 kilometers.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.820
And in the direction of
Seattle, I don't know,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.519
that would get us in
probably some part

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.429
of northern California
with redwoods and whatnot.

00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:22.220
But just to give an
idea of 200 kilometers,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.550
that would get me from where I
am near the coast of California

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.050
to about the Nevada border.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.070
So still a pretty
good distance relative

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.030
to the entire timeline.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.360
The dinosaurs, the
last land dinosaurs,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.480
when the Earth got hit by an
asteroid this-- so remember,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.670
our whole timeline now stretches
all the way to Seattle.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.310
This event now would
have only occurred

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.180
about 3,000 meters away.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.500
Or maybe I should just say
three kilometers away or roughly

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.457
about two miles.

00:04:56.457 --> 00:04:58.540
So that's still seems like
a pretty good distance.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.300
But remember, our timelines
stretches all the way

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.960
to Seattle from the
San Francisco area.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.430
So it's a pretty big timeline.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.350
So this is already a
pretty small distance.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.800
But it gets even smaller.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.640
Australopithecus,
this right over here,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.367
when they were roaming the
Earth 3 million years ago,

00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:17.950
this gets reduced
to a little bit more

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:25.040
than a football field, about
150 meters, not kilometers.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.100
Let me write that in a color
where there's some contrast.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.370
150 meters is
where-- so 150 meters

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.960
in the direction of
Seattle, if that's

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.870
the timeline that
we're talking about.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.590
And then the first
humans, even shorter.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.330
It's only going to be 10 meters,
10 meters of this timeline that

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.300
stretches all the
way to Seattle.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.110
The birth of Jesus,
2,000 years ago,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.210
would be 10 centimeters, 10
centimeters on a time line

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.060
that stretches from San
Francisco to Seattle.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.380
And then finally, the
Declaration of Independence,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.300
the American Declaration
of Independence,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.760
would be 1 centimeter on a time
line that stretches to Seattle.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.410
Anyway, I don't know
if that put things

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.660
in more or less perspective.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.730
But it was worth
giving it a shot.
