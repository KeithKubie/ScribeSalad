00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:06.490
We know that we must, to lay claim to any
respectability or competence, keep up with

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.129
the news. That’s why we’ve ringed the
earth with satellites, crisscrossed it with

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.130
fiber optic cables, and created networks of
bureaus that inform us with maniacal urgency

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.509
of pretty much any event to have unfolded
anywhere on the planet in the last few moments.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.470
We are, furthermore, equipped with tiny devices
that we keep very close to hand, and which

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.470
we tend to check at intervals of between one
and five minutes (rarely longer) so as to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.750
monitor all unfolding stories in close to
real time. We have been granted a ringside

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.350
seat on the second by second flow of history.
As a result we see a lot more. And at the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.750
same time, strangely, we see a lot less. The
constant presence of news from without hampers

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.640
our ability to pick up on an equally important,
though far less prestigious source of news

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.109
from within. We are not, by nature, well equipped
to see inside ourselves. Consciousness bobs

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:10.160
like a small boat on a sea of disavowed emotions.
A lot of feelings and ideas require a high

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.000
degree of courage to confront. They threaten
to make us uncomfortably anxious, excited

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.310
or sad were we to learn more about them. So
we use the news without to silence the news

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.340
from within. We have the most prestigious
excuse ever invented never to spend any time

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.480
roaming freely inside our own minds. It is
not that the news from without is unimportant

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.540
to someone (indeed, it will be the most important
thing in certain people’s lives a continent

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.840
away or in a company in the capital or somewhere
in the upper reaches of government), it’s

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.600
just that this news is almost certainly wholly
disconnected from our real priority over the

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.270
coming years; which is to make the most of
our life and our talents in the time that

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.360
remains to us. It is touching that we should
give so much of our curiosity over to strangers,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.679
but it is poignant that we are forced eventually
to pay such a high price for this constant

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.170
dispersal of energy. We dismiss fragile, tentative
thoughts about what we should do next, who

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.140
we should call, what we really need to do,
thoughts upon which an adequate future for

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.930
us depends – for the sake of the more obvious
drama of the moment. But the drama won’t

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.409
save us, and cares not a jot about our development
or our real responsibilities. It feels counter-intuitive

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:40.829
to think that there might be certain things
more important than the news. But there is:

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.120
our own lives – which we have, troublingly, been granted such prestigious reasons and means

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.440
to avoid confronting.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.640
We can educate ourselves in the art of being calm.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.320
Not through special teas or slow breathing but through thinking.  This book guides us through that process.
