ADAM COIMBRA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.020
I'm Adam Coimbra, and
I'm a Product Manager

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.160
on the Google Assistant.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.534
SACHIT MISHRA:
I'm Sachit Mishra.

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:15.789
I'm on the Google Assistant
Developer Relations team.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.080
JAMIE HIRSCHHORN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.690
I'm Jamie Hirshhorn from our
Product Partnerships team.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.370
I work on early
stage integrations

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.278
with lots of our developers.

00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:24.580
ADAM COIMBRA: Cool.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.610
So welcome to the Introduction
to Building Actions

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.070
for the Google Assistant.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.929
This is our overview session.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.470
So if you're totally
new to all this,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.928
hopefully it'll
pique your interest

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:35.620
in the other great
deep dive sessions

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.975
we have at I/O this year.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:39.100
So I'll be going through
the why you should build--

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.147
so the motivation and background
for building for the Assistant.

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:44.230
And then we'll hear my
favorite part from Sachit--

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.600
how to build; the deep
dive into the tech.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.160
And finally, Jamie
will explain how

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.690
to really flourish
with the platform

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.640
and optimize your actions
to get more value.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.480
So it seems like we see a
major shift in technology

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.300
every decade or so.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.800
Mainframes-- or so I'm told--

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.019
the desktops, the web, mobile.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.270
For example, with the
move from web to mobile,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.290
we saw an explosion
of new devices,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.310
new ways to consume content,
interact with services

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.650
via apps in the mobile web.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.350
So with each shift, computing
becomes more ubiquitous,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.050
and people expect technology to
do more and more to help them

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.570
with their day-to-day lives.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.820
But all these devices
and services also

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.980
increase complexity, and
they can get in the way,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.650
creating confusion when we're
just trying to get things done.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:33.270
So that's why we're so
excited about the Assistant,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.700
because we hope that it can
solve some of these problems

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.820
by orchestrating across this
ocean of services and devices

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.940
at our disposal and allow
us to just naturally express

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.740
what we want-- literally
say it out loud,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.490
and get back what we ask for
in an equally natural way.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.500
So the Google Assistant
is our approach

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.240
to this new era of
digital assistants

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.010
and conversational computing.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.290
And we're starting to see
that long-term vision come

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.670
to fruition.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.799
Users are asking for
things in new ways.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.090
They're saying, I want to know.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.750
I want to do.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.754
I want to hear.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.170
And they're expecting to be
able to complete more and more

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.597
complex tasks with assistance.

00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:08.430
And they're asking for
their favorite brands

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.530
to be available in this
new modality across all

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.720
their devices.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.940
So a great example that you
probably saw this morning

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.630
is Starbucks.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.120
Soon, you'll be able to ask
Starbucks for your usual,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.100
and in minutes, have your
drink waiting for you

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.630
at the closest location.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.490
So this is a service that many
of us use on a daily basis,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.970
and we're bringing an entirely
new level of convenience

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.350
and seamlessness
to this use case.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.659
So how do we do this?

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.700
Well, Actions on Google
is the developer platform

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.990
for the Google Assistant.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.520
Now, if you're
already participating

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.800
in Google's existing
ecosystems-- like Search,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.620
Android, Play, Maps--

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.370
well, we're working
to automatically bring

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.477
your services and
content to the Assistant.

00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:45.810
But Actions on Google is the
way to target the Assistant

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.110
directly.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.530
So let's say you already have
a web app or a mobile app.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.210
You've optimized
every pixel of it,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.680
and you're asking what's next.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.540
Bring it to the Assistant.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.190
But don't go rewrite
your whole app.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.860
Think about the use cases
that make sense in this space.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.350
For example, Starbucks
focused on the daily routine

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.830
of ordering your usual
coffee on the way to work.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.740
So we want Actions on Google to
be this powerful new ecosystem

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.020
for developers to participate
in this new Assistant

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.730
space and leverage
Google's investments

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.582
in AI-first technology.

00:03:13.582 --> 00:03:15.540
But for you to invest,
we expect you to ask us,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.990
what do I get in return?

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.000
And there's three
things that I think

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.208
are really important for us
to provide for this to be

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:21.090
a valuable platform.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.761
Those are reach, monetization,
and reengagement.

00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:25.260
First of all, we
have to provide you

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.094
with reach, which is access
to a wide audience of users.

00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:30.010
Now, users are already
coming to the Assistant

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.010
to perform over 1
million actions,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.972
but the ecosystem is
far from saturated.

00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:36.930
As users come to get more
and more things done,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.060
there's a huge
opportunity for your brand

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.030
to get discovered and
fulfill unmet needs.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.530
And they're performing
these actions

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.780
across a huge range of
devices and contexts,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.210
from voice-enabled speakers
like the Google Home

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.630
to phones to Android Auto to
TVs, Chromebooks, and more,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.060
bringing the number of devices
where you can reach users

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.799
to over 500 million.

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.590
Another component to
the audience expansion

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.850
is the global user base.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.580
Actions are now available
in 25 plus locales,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.990
with more coming this year.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.160
So once you have access
to this wide audience,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.870
you need to be able to actually
run your business, make money.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.940
So last year, we added
transactional capabilities

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.353
for physical goods and services.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:16.019
And soon we're expanding this to
digital goods and subscriptions

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.900
as well.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.899
Now, we've built out an
end-to-end transactional

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.110
experience completely native
to the conversational modality.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.850
Using Google Pay,
we can seamlessly

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.100
take payments from users.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.433
And with Google Identity, we
can sign them into your app

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:30.090
and even register
for new accounts.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.000
And now these experiences are
going to be even more seamless,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.985
with fully eyes-free support
for both Payments and Identity.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.610
So we have a great
session on Thursday,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.010
actually, on adding
transactional capabilities

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.870
if you'd like to learn more.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.790
Now, the final key to
making this successful

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.670
is to create a
sustainable platform.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.590
And reengagement is all
about creating a loyal base

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.960
of users that keep coming
back to your action over

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.390
and over again.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.260
Now, I'm a product
manager on the Assistant.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.030
I can tell you that
our team constantly

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.890
thinks about what we
call user journeys.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.965
And we've analyzed
tons of usage behavior

00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:02.340
and found three
critical journeys

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.309
where we think we can
really assist users--

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:06.600
in the morning when they're
trying to get out the door,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.360
during their commute so they
can be productive on the go,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.450
and in the evening when they're
trying to de-stress and relax.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.700
So in these key moments,
users are highly engaged,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.491
and they keep coming
back to the Assistant.

00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.030
And by optimizing
for these moments,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.030
the Assistant can drive
organic discovery and retention

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.937
to your actions.

00:05:21.937 --> 00:05:24.270
So if you'd like to learn
more about driving engagement,

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.460
come to Thursday's session
on building a user base

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.652
for your actions.

00:05:28.652 --> 00:05:31.110
So we really do believe there's
an amazing opportunity here

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.380
for you to get a wide audience,
make money, and then get

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.210
more loyalty and retention.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.520
But what should you actually
build to get in on this?

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.640
Well, we offer a
range of integrations.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.456
And the first one is
vertical programs.

00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:45.330
So these are direct
integrations with Google,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.240
and they're great because with
a simple API implementation,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.520
Google creates an entire
user experience for you.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.930
Now, it's been amazing to
see the success and adoption

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.314
of our Smart Home API.

00:05:54.314 --> 00:05:55.730
As you've heard,
it now integrates

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.740
with over 5,000 devices.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.810
A single API ties together
the Google Assistant

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.880
and the device maker's
infrastructure,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.210
which lets Google to understand
increasingly complex commands

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.830
and support a wide
range of understanding.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.640
So we have a great talk on Smart
Home integrations on Thursday,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080
so please visit
to find out more.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.260
And this is just one example of
how powerful vertical programs

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.330
are by enabling great
user experiences

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.434
with simple integrations.

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:21.350
Now, for publishers, we
offer content actions.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.720
This extends our long
history of structured data

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.080
markup with Google Search.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.740
You can optimize your structured
data for the Assistant

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.040
to enable great voice
experiences with your content.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.020
So for example, a user might
ask the Assistant about recipes

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.690
and see a rich set of
results from Food Network.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.000
Because the content is
optimized for the Assistant,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.440
we can provide
voice instructions

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.170
and guide them through
the recipe step-by-step.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.420
If you're already doing
structured data for Search,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.530
you're on the right track.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.000
And we have a deep
dive Wednesday

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.860
on taking the next step
to actually optimize

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.890
that for the Assistant.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.961
Next, with app
actions, we're helping

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:56.210
you to discover the core
capabilities of your existing

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.330
Android app.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.260
So you can expose actions and
content from your Android app

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.940
by linking it to
semantic intents

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.350
in the actions.XML file.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.180
This allows Google to map user
queries for content and actions

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.510
to your app and then
feature you in suggestions

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.720
across the Android launcher,
Smart Text selection, Google

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.990
Search app, and Google Assistant
on Android and the Play Store.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.910
So you see, app actions
will allow your app

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.629
to get further reach and
engagement with our users.

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.170
And you can find all about this,
actually, just today at 5:00

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.730
PM in the talk, Getting
Started with App Actions.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.230
So these are great
ways to integrate

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.850
if you have an
existing Android app

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.319
or a vertical or
content-specific use case.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.110
But many of the most
successful ecosystems,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.390
like the web and mobile,
are powerful because they

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.420
have a generalized integration
model that allows developers

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.050
to build custom experiences for
any use case they can imagine.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.680
For the Assistant, this model is
called conversational actions.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.900
These are immersive
conversational experiences

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.740
completely custom
for your brand.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.530
They're a direct conversation
between you and your user.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.830
So here's a cool example
of conversational action.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.360
It's called California
Surf Report,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.901
and it helps you
find wave conditions

00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:02.840
if you live in California.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.100
Let's walk through
the user experience.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.100
So a user says a query like,
talk to California Surf Report,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.090
and this is like the voice
version of a shortcut

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.174
on the mobile home screen.

00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:14.756
So the Google Assistant is then
able to look through its index

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:16.070
of actions and finds a match.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.661
So now it's time to
let the user know

00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:19.160
that it's going to
hand over control

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.292
to California Surf Report.

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.250
So it says something
like, sure, connecting you

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.907
with that action.

00:08:23.907 --> 00:08:26.240
The user hears an earcon,
which is like an audio version

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.740
of an icon.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.710
It's a distinctive sound
letting the user know

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.340
a transition is taking place.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.370
And now the user is conversing
directly with the action.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.679
The action welcomes the
user in its own voice,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.799
explaining its functionality
and asking an initial question.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.590
And finally, the action
is able to respond

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.690
with the information the
user asked for and ends

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.710
the conversation.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.080
We hear another earcon
letting the user

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.880
know the Assistant is back in
control of the conversation.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.534
So this is a powerful,
open-ended model

00:08:52.534 --> 00:08:54.950
where you can build any sort
of conversational interaction

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.790
that you can imagine.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.610
And it's not just about voice.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.620
So Assistant is on so
many different devices,

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.030
and many of them have screens.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.390
Now, adding rich
visuals to supplement

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.380
a conversational interface
makes it far more

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.672
engaging and delightful
for your users.

00:09:09.672 --> 00:09:11.630
Here are some examples
of that same interaction

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.720
with California Surf
Report on visual devices.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.000
As you can see, it creates
an immersive experience,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.830
responding to the
user with rich visuals

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.690
as well as visual output--

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.802
as well as voice output, sorry.

00:09:22.802 --> 00:09:25.010
Now, supporting different
modalities and form factors

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.810
has always been a
challenge for platforms

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.080
like the web and mobile.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.030
And when you build
for the Assistant,

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.670
you're targeting an even more
diverse range of modalities,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.590
from voice-only
like Google Home,

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.110
to voice-forward devices
like the new smart displays,

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.790
intermodal devices
like the phone,

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.740
and visual-only
like smartwatches.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.340
But our conversational
action APIs are multimodal.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.675
With a single implementation
of our rich response API,

00:09:45.675 --> 00:09:47.300
Google is able to
scale your experience

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.499
across all these devices.

00:09:48.499 --> 00:09:50.540
If you're interested in
learning more about this,

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.270
we have a great session on
Wednesday called Design Actions

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.420
for the Assistant.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.386
Of course, no matter how
smart these APIs are,

00:09:57.386 --> 00:09:59.760
it still takes some work and
technical know-how to get up

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.620
and running.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.000
And that's why we provide
templates to get you started.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.240
This is a super fun and easy
way to build for the Assistant.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.980
No programming
knowledge required.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.230
You can create fun and
engaging conversational actions

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.339
like personality quiz,
trivia, and flashcards.

00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:16.380
All you have to do is come
to the Actions Console

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.240
and follow a step-by-step
wizard to get

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.770
started with the template.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.200
Then you just fill out a
Google Sheets spreadsheet

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.070
with the content.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.220
For example, for flashcard,
there is a row for each card,

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.364
and columns for the
two sides, and a hint.

00:10:28.364 --> 00:10:30.030
So I'd love for
everyone here to tonight

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.785
go and spend 20, 30 minutes and
build a conversational action

00:10:33.785 --> 00:10:34.410
with templates.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.099
You'll see it's
really fun and easy.

00:10:36.099 --> 00:10:38.640
Of course, I know most of you
are developers, so that's never

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.660
going to be satisfying enough.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.826
You probably have a use
case we've never thought of,

00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:43.710
or you want to create
something truly custom,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.960
or you're just interested
in this conversational space

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.650
and want to start
building your skills.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.525
So let's hear a little
bit about how to build

00:10:49.525 --> 00:10:52.790
custom conversational actions.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.330
SACHIT MISHRA: All
right, hey, everyone.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.430
So Adam's just laid
out a bunch of options

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.430
for integrating with
the Google Assistant.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.888
And what I want to do is I want
to walk us through building

00:11:04.888 --> 00:11:06.220
a conversational action.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.400
And to do that, I want to
share a journey with you of how

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.780
I got to here--

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.720
a fully-functional,
high-quality, conversational

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.490
action that I
built from scratch.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.770
And what it does is it gives
the user some information

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.984
about any given
programming language,

00:11:19.984 --> 00:11:21.400
specifically
information that will

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.740
inform whether to use that
language in an upcoming

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.510
project.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.850
So like many of my
colleagues at Google--

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.300
and I'm sure many of you here--

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.470
I have had the profound gift
of sharing my programming

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.760
knowledge with others.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.950
Back when I was in high
school in South Florida,

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.712
I volunteered at a youth
program in my community

00:11:38.712 --> 00:11:40.420
where we taught the
basics of programming

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.216
to middle school and
high school students.

00:11:42.216 --> 00:11:44.590
And this was in a community
where a lot of these students

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.660
wouldn't have had
exposure to this knowledge

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.090
without these kinds of classes.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.460
And after high school, when
I moved away for college,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.720
I had to say goodbye
to these students

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.310
with whom I had
worked for so long.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.060
And I've also been
looking for another way

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.086
to reach out to them.

00:11:57.086 --> 00:11:58.960
But lucky for me, a lot
of them have grown up

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.900
and they now have Android
phones and other devices

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.370
with the Google
Assistant built in.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.260
So I thought that the Assistant
would be a great platform

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.510
to reach out to them once
again, with an old lesson

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.790
about choosing the right
language for the right project.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.940
So from all of the options
that Adam had laid out,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.290
I had to figure out which
one was the best for me.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.920
So I needed to build something
that was educational,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.640
but I have my own brand,
my own way of teaching.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.600
And I want to own
that back and forth.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.060
I want to control the dialogue.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.310
So I needed conversation.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.590
So I went to the Actions
on Google documentation

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.750
and I learned more about
building conversations.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.291
And I learned that
it basically works

00:12:33.291 --> 00:12:35.050
by sending your
endpoint a request

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.910
for every turn of dialogue.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.490
And it gives you complete
control over the conversation.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.614
You've got your own voice,
separate from the Google

00:12:41.614 --> 00:12:44.020
Assistant, and the conversation
ends when you decide--

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.577
or when the user cancels out.

00:12:46.577 --> 00:12:48.160
But that's pretty
daunting, especially

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.870
for someone who has
historically built

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.180
graphical applications, right?

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.020
So I wanted to learn more.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.790
So when it comes to
any new platform,

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.040
there are four
things I care about--

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.579
design, tools,
infrastructure, and testing.

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:04.120
So with this whole new paradigm
of interacting with the user,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.700
I wanted to start with design.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.530
So I learned that one
big thing to consider

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.080
is your Actions persona.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.060
Human beings-- we have
this remarkable habit

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.850
of comparing any
human-like interaction

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.010
to a real human presence.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.100
And I promise that this is
going to happen to your Action.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.040
So find a persona for your
Action, and always ask,

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.150
what would this persona
say or do in this moment?

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.890
And how did I come
up with my persona?

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.720
Well, first I came up
with some adjectives

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.160
that describe my brand, right?

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.590
So I'm a little bit
geeky and I'm over-eager

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.780
and I'm talkative when
the topic is something

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.487
that I really care about.

00:13:39.487 --> 00:13:41.320
And then I came up with
some characters that

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.790
embody this in the real life.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.900
So I could use an engineer, like
myself, or maybe a librarian.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.140
Or if you're, like any of
my friends, a video game

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.980
enthusiast, they tend
to be this way as well.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.160
And then I chose one,
and I wittled it down

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.940
to a description.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.850
So I came up with a
digital librarian program

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.220
that's been migrated
from legacy architecture

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.200
to architecture since
the '70s, and so it

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.490
knows a lot about
programming languages.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.490
All right, so then I had
another choice to make.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.020
I had to choose a voice, right?

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.978
And I realized I had a
couple options here, OK?

00:14:09.978 --> 00:14:12.550
So the platform comes with some
built-in synthesized voices,

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.920
both female and male.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.750
And that makes it really easy to
just plug in your text and go.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.420
And you can even get
some advanced control

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.360
over the delivery of that
output, which Speech Synthesis

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.220
Markup Language.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.970
And that allows you
to control some things

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.060
like the pitch and the speed
and insert little breaks,

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.511
and even embed audio
clips in the output.

00:14:30.511 --> 00:14:33.010
The other option is I could go
with a recorded voice talent,

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.218
and I could use that instead.

00:14:34.218 --> 00:14:36.790
And this has the potential
to take my experience

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.770
to the next level,
but I would actually

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.921
have to go find some
voice talent help,

00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:43.420
and I would have to localize
my recordings if I wanted to be

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.785
supported in more regions.

00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:46.660
So I just didn't have
the resources for that.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.354
That wasn't going
to work for me.

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.770
All right, so now I figured
out a couple design principles

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.820
to guide me, and I can
jump into the tools.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.380
The first place I went
is the Actions Console.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.114
And here I created a project.

00:14:58.114 --> 00:15:00.280
And I can see all these
options for getting started.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.870
I can see the different
categories of actions

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.860
that I can build.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.080
I can simulate my action
when it's in development.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.969
I can check out analytics on
the action when it's published.

00:15:07.969 --> 00:15:09.760
I can edit the directory
listing that users

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.680
are going to see in the
Assistant Directory.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.480
And the beautiful thing
about this project

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.280
is that it's actually
backed by the Google Cloud

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.000
and by Firebase.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.900
So all of my related technical
assets can live in one place.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.860
All right, cool.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.350
So I can create a project, and
I can create an endpoint in,

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.180
let's say, Firebase
using the same project.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.030
But this endpoint
is going to receive

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.250
the text of the
user's utterance,

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.140
and I need to process that, OK?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.440
But I don't have a PhD in
natural language processing,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.600
and my machine learning
is shaky at best.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.080
All right, so what do I do,
use regular expressions?

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.640
So the next thing
I figured out is

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.890
that Google is going to
give me this amazing tool

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.840
for natural language
understanding called

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.937
Dialogflow.

00:15:47.937 --> 00:15:49.270
And it does exactly what I need.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.420
It turns that unstructured,
natural language input

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.820
into a structured representation
that my endpoint can consume.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.530
Dialogflow sits in the
middle between the Assistant

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.600
and my server, and
it does that for me

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.420
with hybrid machine learning
powered intent matching

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.790
and entity recognition.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.790
All right, so we'll dive
into those in a second.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.716
But first, I just wanted to
build one turn of dialogue.

00:16:09.716 --> 00:16:11.340
So I dug more deeply,
and I figured out

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.600
how to at least build this.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.100
And so the way this
is going to work

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.650
is that the user's going to
invoke my action by name using

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.230
one of our supported
phrases like talk to,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.420
and then the magical Google
Assistant infrastructure

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.820
is going to handle that like it
would any other user utterance,

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.040
but it's going to realize
that my action is the best

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.550
to handle it.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.055
So my Dialogflow agent is
going to receive a request,

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:31.930
and it's going to realize
it's being invoked.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.030
So it's going to
trigger something called

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.654
a welcome intent,
and this is a default

00:16:34.654 --> 00:16:36.750
that every Dialogflow
agent comes with.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.310
All right, so how do I do this?

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.130
From the Actions Console in
the Project Overview page,

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.310
I can create a custom
action through Dialogflow.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.380
And in Dialogflow, I'm going
to modify the welcome intent.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.260
And I'm going to remove
the default greetings

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.420
that it gives me.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.220
All right, so now
I need to come up

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.260
with some sort of
greeting for the user.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.670
And I'm thinking about it,
and I can't really come up

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.020
with anything captivating.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.960
And then I remembered,
what would my persona

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.770
say in this moment?

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.069
And so with that, I came
up with a couple geeky

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.290
and over-eager variations
of welcome prompts

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.791
which asked the
user for a language.

00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:09.873
Something like, hi, there.

00:17:09.873 --> 00:17:11.880
I can tell you all about
programming languages.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.380
Which one do you
want to hear about?

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.579
So I'm greeting the user.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.680
I'm orienting them to
what my Action can do,

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.980
and then I'm prompting them.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.760
And so from there, I can head
over to the Actions Console

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.500
through the Dialogflow
Integrations page,

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.589
and I can start
messing with my Action.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.970
And if I wanted
to in the future,

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.595
I could do some really
cool stuff here.

00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:30.570
So I could taper the
greeting for repeat users,

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.361
or I could change it
based on how long it's

00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:35.496
been since that specific user
has last spoken to my action.

00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:36.870
And by the way,
there's a session

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.150
at 10:30 AM on day three
about personalizing

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.987
actions for users.

00:17:39.987 --> 00:17:41.820
So if you're interested,
check that one out.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.830
But anyway, I've got a
dialogue started now.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.720
All right, so that
was easy enough, OK?

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.790
But now the user is
going to respond,

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.290
and there's a million
ways that they

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.940
could answer that
question of which language

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.273
they want to learn about, right?

00:17:52.273 --> 00:17:55.140
So how do I account
for all this variation?

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.090
I'm going to use a
Dialogflow intent.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.070
All right, so the way
Dialogflow intents work

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.190
is that you train them to listen
for phrases that the user is

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.040
going to speak in
each turn of dialogue.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.910
And then each semantically
similar set of phrases

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.130
is called an intent, right?

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.900
So with the power
of machine learning,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.510
when the user says anything
similar to the phrases you've

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.760
provided at any point
in the conversation,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.087
Dialogflow is going
to match that intent.

00:18:20.087 --> 00:18:22.170
So I created an intent
which listened for the user

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.060
saying something like,
tell me about Kotlin,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.350
or should I use JavaScript?

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.540
And then Dialogflow knows
that they're basically

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.859
asking about a language,
and it extracts from that

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:30.900
which language they want.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.320
Now, how does it do that?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.170
Well, I had defined
a custom entity

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.820
in Dialogflow called
Languages which

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.932
lists out all of the programming
languages that I support.

00:18:38.932 --> 00:18:40.890
And how am I going to
account for the variation

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.170
in the way each programming
language is spoken?

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.220
Programming languages
have nicknames.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.390
Well, Dialogflow offers the
feature of designating synonyms

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.070
for each canonical value.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.620
And Dialogflow also comes with
a bunch of built-in system

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.161
entities that it
already knows about,

00:18:54.161 --> 00:18:58.284
things like temperature and
cities and dates and times.

00:18:58.284 --> 00:18:59.700
All right, so now
at this point, I

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.410
need to actually
dynamically respond

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.900
to the user with some
information about the language

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.830
that they've chosen.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.414
So I'm going to need to expand
my infrastructure a little bit.

00:19:07.414 --> 00:19:09.829
OK, so we've got the interaction
that I've already built--

00:19:09.829 --> 00:19:11.010
that one turn of dialogue.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.468
But now the user's
going to respond

00:19:12.468 --> 00:19:15.030
with a request to know about
some specific language.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.852
Let's say they say,
tell me about Kotlin.

00:19:16.852 --> 00:19:18.310
And this time, the
Google Assistant

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.101
is going to hand off
directly to my Action,

00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:23.090
because the user's already
entered the dialogue.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.400
It's going to handle the
speech-to-text transcription,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.310
and Dialogflow is going to match
which language intent that I

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.570
described earlier.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.160
But this time,
instead of responding,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.050
it's going to reach out
to my WebHook hosted

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.176
on Cloud Functions
for Firebase, and it's

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.550
going to dynamically pull
information about that language

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.750
and present it to the user.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.690
So how did I tell
Dialogflow to do that?

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.970
Well, I set the URL
of my Cloud Function

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.020
in the Fulfillment
settings of Dialogflow.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.230
And here I can edit some
Off and Header settings

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.870
for the post request
that my WebHook receives.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.890
And there's also an inline
editor in this page,

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.430
so you can actually edit your
Cloud Functions code right

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.586
in the Dialogflow console.

00:19:58.586 --> 00:20:00.210
All right, let's talk
a little bit more

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.811
about building one
of these WebHooks.

00:20:01.811 --> 00:20:03.810
So since I'm using Cloud
Functions for Firebase,

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.329
I'm going to be using Node.js.

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:07.620
And the first thing I'm going
to do in my index.js file

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.240
is I'm going to
create a simple JSON

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.300
mapping of language strings
to some helpful fact

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.920
about that language.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.790
And then later,
in the same file,

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.140
I'm going to use the Actions on
Google Node.js client library

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.810
to handle the which_language
intent from Dialogflow

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.500
with a callback.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.090
And so in that
callback, I'm actually

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.370
going to respond with some
fact from that mapping

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.840
that I had defined
earlier, and I'm

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.200
going to prompt the user to
ask about another language.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.927
So I'm furthering
the conversation.

00:20:31.927 --> 00:20:34.260
And at this point, I've got
something pretty substantial

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:34.515
to test.

00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:36.420
So I can go back to that
simulator in the Actions

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.340
Console, and I can play
around more with it

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.300
like a natural user.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.250
And at this point,
I might actually

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.430
use some of the debugging
information on the right side.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.180
And I can actually
simulate the experience

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.050
as if I was a user on
different surface types.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.240
All right, so
speaking of surfaces,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.950
the experience right
now is a little bit

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.730
dry on a screen device.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.270
So how can I change that?

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.770
Well, one thing
I can do is I can

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.090
add more visual descriptions
of the information.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.610
So here I'm using a BasicCard
class from the Node.js library

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.520
to construct a rich visual
response for the Go programming

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.480
language.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.010
And it has a couple cool things.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.440
It has a title, and it
has some text, and even

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.260
some imagery and alternative
text for accessibility.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.960
In this case, the
image is Go's mascot.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.860
And I've even got a button
with a link to Go's website.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.806
And notice how the API gives
me really granular control

00:21:24.806 --> 00:21:26.430
over the construction
of the response--

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.320
even the placement
of the chat bubbles

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.260
above and below the BasicCard.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.660
So let's say I needed to
guide the user a bit more--

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.010
they didn't know which language
they could choose from.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.070
So I can create a list
of programming languages

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.730
that I support.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.990
And in the library,
what I'm going to do

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.330
is I'm going to create a
mapping of each language

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.302
to a row in the list with
its own title and image.

00:21:45.302 --> 00:21:47.010
And then I'm going to
present the options

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.440
to the user as a list, and
the user can tap or say

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.000
whichever they choose.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.430
But what if I wanted to
emphasize the graphics?

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.530
I can change one
word in the code.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.090
List becomes carousel.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.130
And the user can now
swipe through and browse

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.220
the options more visually.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.230
But this is all on a
screen device, right?

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.850
What if the user's
on a smart speaker

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.240
and I want to show
them something visual?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.170
Well, here's a
super cool feature,

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.200
and it's one that empowers
you, as developers, to leverage

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.060
the immersiveness
of the Assistant.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.660
I can check if the user is
on a screen device currently,

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.670
and if not, whether
they have any screen

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.760
devices with the Assistant
linked to their account.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.651
And if they do, I can actually
ask them to switch devices.

00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:28.650
So the dialogue's going
to end on their speaker,

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.360
and they're going to get a
notification on the phone

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.818
where they can
resume the dialogue.

00:22:31.818 --> 00:22:35.160
And I even get control over
what the notification says.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.690
So this is a great
example of how

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.060
we're really unlocking
the power of the Assistant

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:39.810
for all of you.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.150
And there's a session
tomorrow at 11:30 AM

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.049
about designing across
surfaces, so check that one out.

00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:46.590
And then let's say
I had a mobile app

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.810
and it includes
some authentication.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.820
I can actually plug
into that from my Action

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.800
so that the user's
identity is shared

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.770
across mobile app and Action.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.190
And there's a
session on day three

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.904
at 9:30 AM about integrating
mobile apps with the Assistant.

00:22:59.904 --> 00:23:02.320
All right, so now I've got a
pretty cool experience going,

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.110
but I want to test
it further, right?

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.777
So we've already
talked about testing it

00:23:05.777 --> 00:23:07.401
in the Actions Console
simulator, where

00:23:07.401 --> 00:23:08.910
I can get debug
information and I

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.245
can try my Action on
different surfaces.

00:23:11.245 --> 00:23:12.870
But while I can test
it in the console,

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.260
I can also test directly on any
Assistant-enabled device which

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.660
is logged into the
same Google account.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.730
And we're also announcing
something really cool

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.450
that you've asked
for for a long time.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.800
You can create alpha and
beta versions of your Actions

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.470
that can be shared with a
limited audience for feedback

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:29.140
and iteration.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.860
So this means, with my Action,
I could share it to my students

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.130
before publishing live.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.380
And there's a session with
more about testing tomorrow

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.610
at 8:30 in the morning,
so check that out.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.162
But now you've built
this high-quality Action.

00:23:42.162 --> 00:23:43.620
You've got some
rich responsiveness

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.330
and you've got
variation and you've

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.830
shared it with some
users and you've

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.290
iterated on the feedback.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.040
So you're ready to
submit to a review team

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.820
and push the Action live.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.580
So let's hear more about that.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.289
JAMIE HIRSCHHORN: Awesome.

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:00.830
Hi, everyone.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.060
I'm Jamie again.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.340
So now that you've heard a
lot about the how and what

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.140
to build on the
Assistant, let's talk

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.750
about how you can actually be
successful on the platform.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.030
So we think of this
in three key pillars--

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:14.690
discovery, monetization,
and reengagement.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.340
As you heard from
Adam, people are

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.260
turning to their devices
and their assistance

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.280
for lots of different
things in their day.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.280
It can be small, something
like setting a timer.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.029
Or it can be a little
bit more meaningful,

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:25.580
like helping plan your day.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.100
So whether you're building
a productivity action,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.590
a food ordering action, a gaming
action, whatever it might be,

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.461
we know that your users are
out there looking for you.

00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:36.210
So I know everyone's
had a long day today.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.293
It's a little bit hot out.

00:24:37.293 --> 00:24:39.217
Let's do a really
quick exercise.

00:24:39.217 --> 00:24:40.800
Everyone close your
eyes for a second.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.930
Think about the best party
that you've ever been to.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:46.370
Maybe it was in college.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.870
Maybe it was last night.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.630
Maybe it was a wedding
or a family affair.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.440
Maybe you remember the
smells, the food, the music.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.520
Now imagine you were never
invited to that party.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.890
So think about your favorite
brands, for example.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.590
Did you take a ride sharing
service here this morning?

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.680
Did you order from a food
delivery service last night?

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.200
Do you have a favorite
game or a retailer?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.870
Now imagine that nobody ever
told you about those brands

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.580
or experiences either.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.220
This is why discovery
is so important

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.080
and inviting someone
to your experience

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.650
is oftentimes just as critical
as building a great experience

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.850
yourself.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:26.190
So where do you get started?

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.680
The best place to start is
with our Assistant Directory.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.390
It lives on both web and
mobile across Android and iOS.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.340
And as a developer, once you
start a project on our AoG

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.050
console, you'll be
able to optimize

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.610
this listing in realtime.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.170
What's really
interesting here is

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.260
that we see 30% of
third-party actions

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.000
get discovered here
in this directory.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.270
So it's really critical to
optimize this first entry

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.135
point.

00:25:49.135 --> 00:25:50.760
Let's talk about a
variety of use cases

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.080
here in the directory.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.610
It starts with browsing.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.040
So here you'll see timely
and personal recommendations

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.740
towards the top and
less contextual content

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.420
as you scroll down the page.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.460
There's a few areas
to highlight here.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.950
First you'll see
contextual suggestions.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.800
These are relevant suggestions
based on the user's context--

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.480
things like time
of day, location.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.750
And for example, here I
can see a recommendation

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.840
for my morning, like playing
my favorite playlist.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.629
Next you'll see
dynamic categories.

00:26:18.629 --> 00:26:20.920
You'll see a total of four
of them that are live today.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.650
What's New, which highlights
new quality actions.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.020
What's Popular, which highlights
overall popular actions.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.070
What's Trending, which is
recently popular actions.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.490
And lastly, which is the most
tailored, what you Might Like,

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.216
which is actions based
on the user's history.

00:26:37.216 --> 00:26:39.840
The second use case that you'll
see that the directory supports

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.780
is categorical
browsing and search.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.480
Here we're trying to really help
our users find relevant actions

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.290
in specific categories and
find their favorite actions

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.022
through a really quick search.

00:26:51.022 --> 00:26:53.480
So let's say, for example, I'm
interested in food and drink

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.524
as a category.

00:26:54.524 --> 00:26:56.940
You'll see all the relevant
actions here in that category,

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.694
but you'll also see some
helpful subcategories.

00:26:59.694 --> 00:27:01.860
So for example, you can see
that you have the option

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.470
to order food from,
perhaps, Domino's

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.840
or from Dunkin'
Donuts, but I can also

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.080
get recipes from Food Network.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.350
Finally and most importantly,
your action page.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.070
Think of this as the welcome mat
to your brand, to your action.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.690
It should reflect
your brand, and it

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.810
should invite users to
really try your action.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.310
You'll see at the
top, here, there's

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.150
a quick summary, which you'll
see imagery, a description,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.080
and sample invocation queries.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.310
This allows the user to really
understand what your app does.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.930
The second section you'll see--

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.120
Readings and
Recently-Launched Reviews.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.120
This allows the user to assess
the quality of your action

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.722
before, perhaps, trying it.

00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:43.180
So what does this
all mean for you?

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.210
How can you actually
optimize this in realtime?

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.010
How do you make your
actions stand out

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.730
with over a million actions
in our directory today?

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.900
Here's a live example
I'll walk you through.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.745
Pretend I'm a
French bulldog lover

00:27:54.745 --> 00:27:56.870
and I wanted to publish an
action on French bulldog

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:57.702
trivia.

00:27:57.702 --> 00:27:59.910
On the left here, you'll
see that we did a few things

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.150
really, really well.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:05.380
You'll see short, concise names;
strong, clear images; accurate

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.380
descriptions, whereas
you'll see on the right it

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.000
gets trimmed off a bit.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.900
And most importantly, a
bunch of sample invocations.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.494
So we maximize the
number of queries

00:28:14.494 --> 00:28:16.410
that a user understands
that they can actually

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:18.240
use to invoke this out.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.550
Instead of just saying, talk
to French bulldog trivia,

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.800
you'll see a variety
of invocations

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.750
such as, ask French
bulldog trivia

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.890
about grooming, for example.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.510
OK, so now you've
built your app.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.052
You're live with a
directory listing.

00:28:31.052 --> 00:28:33.510
Let's talk about how built-in
intents can also help you get

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.310
discovered.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.510
It's a great tool.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.330
The reason we built this was
because we saw three trends.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.790
Firstly, it's really
hard for users

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.770
to find an action for
something that they want to do.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.460
Secondly, it's hard for
Google to actually classify

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.320
what an app can do on our end.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.860
And thirdly, natural language
understanding is pretty hard.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.489
So as you can see here,
there are a ton of languages.

00:28:54.489 --> 00:28:55.280
There are dialects.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.810
There are cultural differences.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:57.830
There's slang.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.690
That all make a
million different ways

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.710
to say the exact same thing.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.590
So look at this
small set of ways

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:08.810
that a user can simply express
to say, I want to de-stress.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.620
Built-in intents can provide
a common taxonomy for actions

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.050
across all of our
Google surfaces.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.460
So in this scenario,
for example,

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.710
you'll see if somebody
says, hey, Google, I

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.069
want to start meditating.

00:29:20.069 --> 00:29:21.860
We can then suggest a
few different actions

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.740
that we know will serve as that
need and are actually, indeed,

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.735
meditation apps.

00:29:26.735 --> 00:29:28.860
So here are some of the
built-in intents that we're

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.734
working on this year.

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:31.930
You'll see the ones
that are starred

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.740
will be soon in developer
preview, so I really,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.185
really encourage everyone to
check this out in Dialogflow

00:29:38.185 --> 00:29:39.810
and see which ones
really make the most

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:40.849
sense for your business.

00:29:40.849 --> 00:29:43.140
Keep in mind, we'll be rolling
lots more out this year.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.120
It's really exciting.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.130
The best part about
built-in intents--

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.650
and lots of these other tools
that I'll talk about today--

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.850
are that they're really,
really easy to implement.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.144
You just log into
your AoG console,

00:29:54.144 --> 00:29:55.560
simply pick from
a list of intents

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.090
that describes your action
best, and describe it.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:03.900
And finally, here's the output
of this new infrastructure.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.940
If somebody has a
very generic ask--

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.176
like I want to play a maps
quiz, or I want to play a quiz--

00:30:09.176 --> 00:30:11.550
here you'll see a bunch of
different relevant suggestions

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.049
for games.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.700
So the last tool that I'll
talk about today for discovery

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.700
is called Action Links,
which is an awesome tool

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.690
to help you promote
your experience.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.640
You'll see, here, in
the Headspace example

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.760
that we, Google,
will actually promote

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.280
these experiences in
our own Action Link

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.490
in our own Assistant Directory,
where a user can actually deep

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.800
link directly from
the app directory

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.724
into your action on the
device of their choice.

00:30:38.724 --> 00:30:40.390
So what's really cool
about Action Links

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.848
is that these
actually can help you

00:30:41.848 --> 00:30:46.600
promote your own action to your
own end-operated audiences.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.640
So everything from
your social sites--

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.790
you can see a tweet, here,
from Brad from earlier today--

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.355
or your own website,
like BuzzFeed,

00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:54.730
where you can
actually see a user

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:58.810
can deep link directly from
their site into their action.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.976
You can promote this on
apps, or even a billboard.

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:02.350
So it's not just
strictly limited

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.377
to digital, which
is really exciting.

00:31:04.377 --> 00:31:06.460
We noticed that this
actually solves two problems.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.760
One, it makes it a ton easier
to deep link into an action

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.630
directly.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.410
And two, once the user's had a
great, high-quality experience,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.910
they can now share this with
their family and friends really

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.050
easily themselves.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:20.290
So think of all the users
cross-pollinating and sharing

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.710
your message out there.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.670
So similar to built-in
intents, Assistant Links

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.340
is really, really
easy to implement.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.060
You can simply generate a
URL really quickly and then

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.572
share across all
of your channels.

00:31:32.572 --> 00:31:34.280
So now let's assume
you've knocked it out

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.930
of the park with discovery.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.910
We'll talk about transactions
and digital goods

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.940
as an awesome way for you
to monetize your business

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.370
and grow your experiences.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.760
So last year, we launched
transactional capabilities

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.770
via the Transactions API.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:51.080
This was limited to a
phone-based experience

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.120
of physical goods and
worked really, really

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.220
well for simple transactions.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.080
Today, you've probably
heard lots of updates

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.930
about transactions in
a few of our sessions.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.180
But you'll see, moving
forward, that transactions

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.130
will be on more devices.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.710
Expanding to more
complex transactions

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.480
will enable the purchase
of digital goods

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.230
and will be available
more globally.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.580
When we talk about
transactions on the Assistant,

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.020
we're talking about
three things--

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.330
the ability for a user
to purchase a good,

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.640
hire a service, or
book a reservation

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.450
with their favorite
brand on the Assistant.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.950
And no matter what type of
transactional experience

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.890
you're trying to build,
the foundational elements

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.200
are always the same,
as you'll see here.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.900
The developer will always guide
the user through their purchase

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.800
process, and we
have lots of APIs

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.290
and other helpers to
walk you through this.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.900
So I'll quickly touch on
two quick announcements that

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.480
were made today which are
really, really exciting,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.367
and I wanted to touch
on them really quickly.

00:32:46.367 --> 00:32:48.200
So as you know, the
growth of voice speakers

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.150
and other Assistant
surfaces in your home

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.610
has been huge this year,
and we're really expecting

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.140
it to continue to grow.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.260
You saw our continued focus
on this in our developer

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.760
keynote today

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:04.650
Users can now purchase goods
and services on voice devices.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.550
This means our users can
now complete transactions

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.880
on surfaces like Google
Home, third-party speakers,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.160
and smart screens, which
was not available before--

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.390
really exciting.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.100
We've also announced
that we will soon

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.770
open up the ability
for app developers

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.230
to sell digital goods
on the Assistant.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.080
This will work across both
phone and voice surfaces

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.030
and will be supported in
multiple languages and markets,

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:31.050
including the US, the UK,
Canada, France, Australia,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.400
Germany, and Japan to start.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.380
And we're thinking of
three key use cases

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.480
here as we launch
this, and we're

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.820
really excited about diving
in deeper here and exploring

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.410
these with our partners.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.750
In-app digital goods-- and
this is super cool for some

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.850
of the gaming developers
that I work with today--

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.210
this is the ability to purchase
gems, extra time, perhaps

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.730
characters or avatars
throughout your experience.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.020
It's really, really exciting.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.720
Secondly, subscription
services--

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.960
so think of things like
streaming music or video.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.000
And lastly, digital media
purchases-- so things

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.160
like audio books or rentals.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.130
So now to our final pillar--

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.719
you've built up this
awesome audience.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:10.489
You've built an
awesome experience.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.547
You've acquired some
users along the way.

00:34:12.547 --> 00:34:14.630
How do you continue to
build loyalty and retention

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.469
with this great audience?

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:19.719
So as we've been
developing the Assistant

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:23.960
over the past few years, we've
thought a lot about when, how,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.647
and where folks are actually
interacting with Google.

00:34:26.647 --> 00:34:28.480
And we noticed that
they do this in clusters

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.679
throughout their day.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.090
So perhaps in the
morning they do

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.310
things like ask the
Google Home about what

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.870
their day might look like.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.811
As they're heading out the door,
they might be using navigation.

00:34:37.811 --> 00:34:40.060
During the day, perhaps
they're searching or listening

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:40.574
to music.

00:34:40.574 --> 00:34:42.699
And then later at night,
when they're winding down,

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.487
perhaps they're
listening to YouTube

00:34:44.487 --> 00:34:46.570
or watching YouTube or
playing games, for example,

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.028
or spending time
with their family.

00:34:49.936 --> 00:34:52.060
So what we know, here,
which is really interesting,

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.111
is that people are
creatures of habit.

00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:55.860
So we've identified
some of these clusters

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.359
and where the
Assistant can actually

00:34:57.359 --> 00:35:00.360
provide extra value in those
instances and micro moments

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.860
throughout a user's day.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.880
This new feature, Routines, lets
users combine multiple actions

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.500
into a single command.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.834
So what does that actually mean?

00:35:09.834 --> 00:35:12.166
When you wake up in the morning
and you say hey, Google,

00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:14.520
good morning, your Assistant
can do a few things

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.930
in one simple command.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.730
It can turn your
phone off silent.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.830
It can adjust your
lights and thermostat.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.040
It can tell you about your
day, the weather, your commute.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.140
And then it can perhaps
play your favorite podcast

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.470
or read you the news.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.970
As a developer, you
just simply need

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.430
to check off a box to
enable this feature,

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.934
and then users can add
you to their routines.

00:35:34.934 --> 00:35:36.350
In addition to
routines, I'll talk

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.840
about two final
reengagement opportunities

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.320
that are really exciting.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.840
So daily updates and
push notifications.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.830
So daily updates are
when Google can actually

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:49.790
share a notification and pull
an update at a specified time

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.970
each day by the user.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.520
One example of this is you
could get transportation or news

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.353
alerts every single
morning at the same time

00:35:57.353 --> 00:35:59.090
if Google understands
that about you.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.870
So as you can see here--

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.110
which is an awesome example,
something that's really

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:03.909
content-fresh--

00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:06.200
is that you can also see if
a user opts in to something

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.470
from Esquire, for example, they
can receive fresh daily wisdom

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.990
tips at the same time each day.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.790
Push notifications
are really exciting,

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.550
because they can help you
do things in realtime.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.070
So things like getting stock
alerts from your favorite news

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.999
publisher.

00:36:20.999 --> 00:36:22.290
This is really exciting for me.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:23.190
I'm a huge nerd.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.290
It's very exciting.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.042
I love the fact that
it's so realtime,

00:36:27.042 --> 00:36:29.250
and it's really exciting,
because it provides a value

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.280
to both users and developers.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.610
The value to users is that it
actually helps give you access

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:39.810
to relevant information which
is immediate, it's content-rich,

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.660
and it's specific to you.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.190
What's really valuable to
brands and some of you folks

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.260
here as developers is
that this can really

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.110
help you enhance your
utility as a partner to some

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.440
of your users.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.470
So this could be
a great experience

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.300
if you're trying to
reengage with someone

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.970
and nurture a relationship
that perhaps has fallen off

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.570
with a user, or if a user needs
a gentle nudge to push along

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.630
something that's timely.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.360
So I know it's been a long
day out there, so we really

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.400
appreciate everyone
coming out today.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.470
If we hope that you take
away a few things from today,

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:14.100
it's one-- think
about your use case.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.050
What's the easiest
way to get started?

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.730
Templates could actually be a
really great solution for you,

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.438
so I encourage everyone
to test this out,

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:21.644
as Adam mentioned tonight.

00:37:21.644 --> 00:37:24.060
And it's a really great way
to dip your toes in the water.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.460
Secondly, please
lean in with us.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.110
Learn more with us this week.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.700
Check out some of
our awesome sessions

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.180
on transactions,
Dialogflow, learning more

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.580
about your audience
basis, building games.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.789
Some of our folks are here,
which is really exciting.

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:39.538
So please check those
out later this week,

00:37:39.538 --> 00:37:41.560
as you can see some of
the sessions listed here.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.518
And lastly, we just
launched two new code labs.

00:37:43.518 --> 00:37:45.634
You can check them out
here throughout I/O.

00:37:45.634 --> 00:37:47.550
So thank you, everyone,
so much for having us.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.778
Enjoy the rest of your week.

00:37:48.778 --> 00:37:50.002
