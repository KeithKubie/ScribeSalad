KEVIN LU: On behalf of talks
at Google and the black Googler

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.870
network, it is my honor to
present Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.610
Just a quick introduction, in
case you're in the wrong room,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.810
he is a six-time NBA champion
and a six-time MVP award

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.500
winner.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.850
In addition, Kareem is
a best-selling author

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.409
and the global culture
ambassador for the United

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.460
States of America.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.910
Thank you for coming.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.451
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Nice to be here.

00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:39.520
Thank you.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.645
KEVIN LU: I think everyone
here knows how great you

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:42.787
are at basketball.

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:45.120
What they might not know is
that you are a huge baseball

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.820
fan too.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.280
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes, I am.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.600
KEVIN LU: Did you ever
try to play or go pro?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.550
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
I did try to play.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.020
I played up through
Little League.

00:00:56.194 --> 00:00:58.110
I also played in the
seventh and eighth grade.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.320
You know, after
you're 12 years old,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.653
you don't play in Little League.

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:03.280
And I play for my
grammar school.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.660
I went to school
in New York City.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.510
And I really had
talent as a pitcher.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.070
No one worked with me
on the issue of control.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.550
So some my pitches went up
into the fence and stuff.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.730
And basketball was just
so much easier for me.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.370
So I decided I'd stick with what
was working real good for me

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.170
at that point.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.610
I had already one a
scholarship to high school

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.780
and got better than
that very quickly.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.580
So I gave up my aspirations.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.740
I didn't have-- what's
his name-- I always forget

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.240
his name at the wrong time.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240
KEVIN LU: Randy Johnson?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.930
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yeah.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.810
KEVIN LU: Big Unit.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.350
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
The Big Unit.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.970
KEVIN LU: Yes.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.345
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
There we go.

00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:47.800
I didn't have him
as a role model.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.940
My role model was Don Drysdale.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.100
Not a bad one, but the Big Unit,
at 6'11" and throwing a ball

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.510
like that-- they put the gun on
me when I was in eighth grade,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.836
and I was throwing the
ball over 90 miles an hour,

00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:04.925
but nobody knew where
it was going to go.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.110
Some of the parents would
come and watch me pitch,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.026
and they were like, get
my child out of there.

00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:13.400
He's going to kill him.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.020
So I stuck to basketball, and
everybody was happy with that.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.530
But I was a Brooklyn Dodger fan.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.330
I've been a Dodger
fan my whole life.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.950
Jackie Robinson and
those guys were my heroes

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.390
when I was a kid.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.260
When I left New York, when
I left Brooklyn, I cried.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.740
My mom had to console me.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.172
I was 10 years
old at that point.

00:02:33.172 --> 00:02:35.630
And then eight years later, I
followed them to Los Angeles.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.897
So that's my baseball stuff.

00:02:40.897 --> 00:02:42.480
KEVIN LU: Speaking
of Jackie Robinson,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.620
he was also very
politically active.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.210
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Yes, he was.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.280
KEVIN LU: Did that
influence you?

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.750
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: It
influenced me a lot, especially

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.180
the stuff he did
after he retired.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.830
You know, he started
a bank in Harlem.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.640
And I went down there with my
$34 and put it in the bank.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.930
I just really thought that what
he was doing about awareness

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.240
really made a lot of sense.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.410
And I really appreciated
what he was doing.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.240
KEVIN LU: Who were
your other role models?

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.860
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Jeez, my
other role models-- Dr. King,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.380
Malcolm X are two
that stand out,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.102
especially at that time,
when I was in grade

00:03:21.102 --> 00:03:22.060
school and high school.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.500
And a lot of musicians-- my
dad was a jazz musician who

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.830
could not-- his dream was
to be in Count Basie's band.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.930
He never made that.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.910
So you know, he was
a police officer.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.140
But music was a big deal for me.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.750
And Miles Davis-- really,
I admired his style.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.940
I admired his music and what
he was about politically,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.250
about being able to be
recognized for his creativity

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.520
and what he was doing to
create America's only art

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.420
form that is totally American.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.510
That really resonates with
me, and I enjoyed that,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.530
and I enjoy his music.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.360
I knew a number of
the guys in the band.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.620
Two of them are still alive--
Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.988
Ron used to play basketball
with me and my boys

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.779
when I was in grade
school and high school.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.820
I didn't know who he was.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.630
He was just one
of the older guys

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.980
that wanted to play with us.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.290
And then I realized, you're
playing in Miles' band?

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.800
Oh my god.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.390
So I got to meet the rest of the
guys-- Wayne Shorter and Tony

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.788
Williams.

00:04:32.788 --> 00:04:34.860
I met Miles.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.690
It was weird, though,
meeting Miles.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.440
The first time I met
Miles was at a jazz

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.050
festival in Orange County.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.810
I was a freshman at UCLA.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.911
And Tony and Ron
introduced me to him.

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:50.160
And he said, look at this guy.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.600
He has to pay $500
to get a tie made.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600
And then he walked away.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.650
This is not really how you dream
of meeting one of your heroes,

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.000
how you want that to go.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.200
So two years later,
after we had won

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.067
the NCAA tournament-- Miles
watched a lot of sports.

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:10.900
He liked basketball.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.070
He like boxing-- but
then he knew who I was.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.920
And I ran into him in
the street in Harlem,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.530
and he was like
Kareem, oh my god.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.880
He took me to his house.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.100
We watched some fight films.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.630
And it was amazing to go
from somebody that he just

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.940
made a weird joke
about to somebody

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.610
that he invited into his home,
and we had a good interaction.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.860
It was amazing.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.095
KEVIN LU: So what motivated
you to write this book?

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:40.970
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
I'm worried about what's

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.690
happening in America.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.500
We're supposed to be trying to
make this a more perfect union.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.410
And it seems like we've
lost our connection

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.550
with what the founding
fathers had in mind.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.840
And basically,
that's what motivates

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.470
me to write what I wrote.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.870
I think that we're
starting to understand

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.850
some of the implications of
what the founding fathers--

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.460
who they were as
people, and what

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.730
their intellectual emphasis was.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.446
In order to make it
a more perfect union,

00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:19.820
they're going to
have to get away

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.400
from some of the ideas that
supported white supremacy.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.260
When our country
started, slavery

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.967
was part and parcel of it.

00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:29.800
Women couldn't vote.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.900
Native Americans couldn't vote.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.350
There were no other
people than Europeans.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.790
And that's changed dramatically.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.910
And we have a big
disparity in, if you

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.510
look at the legal
system, people of color

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.430
are given much greater
sentences, bigger fines,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.320
more punishment
for the same crimes

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.430
that white people commit.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.290
But white people get
less time, less fines,

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.640
and stuff like that.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.740
And it's a bias that
we've all accepted,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.900
and we can't accept that.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.970
So we have to do something to
change that and make the laws

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.680
work for everybody.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.010
And if we can do that, we're
going to accomplish a lot

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.240
and actually make this
a more perfect union.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.660
KEVIN LU: So despite
having a black president,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.030
institutional racism is
still a problem today.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.180
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.964
KEVIN LU: What can
we do about it?

00:07:25.964 --> 00:07:28.130
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Well,
I think one of the issues

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.838
about having a black
president, everybody

00:07:29.838 --> 00:07:32.970
thought it was a sign that
said the end of the road

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.730
has been reached.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.270
We have a black president now.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.680
Americans are able
to judge someone

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.520
on the basis of his
intelligence and what

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.940
he saw as a vision of what
America should be about,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.620
and they elected
him based on that.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.650
And everybody really
got behind it.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:56.160
I remember seeing in 2008, when
Obama finally made it over top

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.970
and got elected, and
they showed some film

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.990
of people on 125th
Street in Manhattan--

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.060
my hometown, my neighborhood.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.772
And they were going
nuts on 125th Street.

00:08:07.772 --> 00:08:09.230
Everybody was
jumping up in the air

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.310
and running around,
because, see,

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.240
it was easy to believe that
we had crossed the line,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.280
and that we were all equal.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.530
It's not a reality.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.450
It was a milepost-- a
significant milepost,

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.440
but we still have a
long way to go, just

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.400
like what Dr. King said about
the things that needed to be

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.610
accomplished after he passed.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.110
And I think we need to focus
on some of those things--

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:42.564
economic equality and making the
criminal justice system really

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:43.355
work for everybody.

00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:47.030
KEVIN LU: In the
book, you also talk

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.750
about something called
wallpaper racism, in addition

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.140
to institutional racism.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.350
What is that?

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.010
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Well,
wallpaper racism is just

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.090
the acceptance of stereotypes.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.820
We believe that all the
police are not biased,

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.060
and they treat
everybody equally,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.100
and they wouldn't
commit any crimes.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.307
Police are just
like anybody else.

00:09:11.307 --> 00:09:12.390
And some of them are good.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.265
Some of them are bad.

00:09:13.265 --> 00:09:15.500
Some of them try to
get away with stuff.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.450
So we have to really eliminate
those types of things

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.570
that we accept just
because it's part

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.946
of the tradition of our country.

00:09:25.946 --> 00:09:27.320
KEVIN LU: Well,
at Google we have

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.090
a lot of training to
try to get rid of bias.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.230
And diversity is a very hot
topic in tech right now.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.160
And you have a
Skyhook Foundation

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.090
that promotes STEM education.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.290
How does that work?

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:40.750
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Well, what we

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.530
do-- I work with the Los
Angeles Unified School District,

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.540
and we take kids
from the inner city.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.880
KEVIN LU: I think
we're good now.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.296
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Are you sure?

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.415
It could be Ming the Merciless.

00:09:59.415 --> 00:10:03.140
We take kids from inner
city, and we send them

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.170
to a camp for five
days and four nights.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.430
And they do a hands
on STEM experiments

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.070
in the field at a camp that
the Los Angeles Unified School

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.680
District has up in the
Angeles National Forest.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.280
It's just north of LA.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.800
You can see it from LA.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.850
A lot of the kids can see
it and have never been.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.060
They've never really
left the circumstances

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.800
of their own neighborhoods.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.300
So we get them up
there, and we get

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:35.370
them to deal with
things, usually animals

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.030
and observations.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.670
They do nighttime
observations of the sky

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:45.220
and get an idea of how
technology affects their lives

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.980
and how technology affects where
the good job opportunities are

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.680
going to be in the 21st century.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.700
And they get this
idea, and they go back.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.790
We do it for kids up through
junior high school, because we

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.120
found that after
junior high school,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.580
97% of females and 92% of
males give up on anything

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.860
having to do with technology.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.670
If you get to them
early enough, we

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.320
can affect that and
give them an idea

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:22.170
of where they can do a great
job in finding a good career

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.540
in a technological field.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.260
So this has had a
really profound effect,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.080
because we found that
a lot of the kids

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.420
have family members
who work in hospitals

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.990
and other technologically
sophisticated places.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.850
They are nurses aides
or lab technicians,

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.920
and stuff like that.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.570
And they start to get
a better idea of what

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.200
they can do with their lives.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.800
So many kids want to be LeBron
James or Beyonce or Jay-Z

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.570
or these kind of people.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.990
And they have no
chance of doing that.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.960
But if they pay attention in
chemistry class and math class,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.750
they can really take that
and make a career out of it

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.160
and do very well for themselves.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.890
So we've done about
80,000 students so far.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.140
We have a three or
four-year waiting list.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.577
And it has put me
on kind of a path

00:12:22.577 --> 00:12:24.910
where I have to keep begging
for money and more funding,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.730
because so many
more of the schools

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.070
want to come and
become involved.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.130
It's had a very, very positive
effect on the kids that

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.710
have been able to take part.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.460
KEVIN LU: Do you want
to plug the website.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.300
I'm sure some Googlers
would love to donate.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.258
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Oh,
KareemAbdulJabbar.com.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.030
Just go to
KareemAbdulJabbar.com,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.630
and you'll will find out how to
make a donation to the Skyhook

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.260
Foundation.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.130
And before you even call, I want
to thank you for your support,

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.117
if you feel like supporting us.

00:13:00.117 --> 00:13:01.950
KEVIN LU: What do you
think of the diversity

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.962
programs in the corporations?

00:13:03.962 --> 00:13:05.920
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: I'm
glad that corporations

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.750
are seeing the need
for diversity programs.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.800
You know, the whole idea of
bringing women and minorities

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.630
into parity with the people who
traditionally do well, I think,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.420
is incredible.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.500
It's necessary.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.090
This is part of
what has to change

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.157
before we make the progress
that we need to make.

00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:30.490
KEVIN LU: Well, this is related.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.990
Why do you think
we need to see more

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.844
minorities on TV and in movies?

00:13:34.844 --> 00:13:36.260
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Well, I think

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.670
that the fact that you
see more minorities

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.250
on TV and in the movies
means that you're not

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.790
shock to see somebody
that doesn't look

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.050
like you doing something
that you didn't

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.840
think that they could do.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.460
For the longest time, there
were no black quarterbacks

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.200
because it was
too intellectually

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.080
challenging for black
people to take the snap

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.840
and throw the football.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.340
Absurd stuff, but
this was accepted.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.350
It was too intellectually
challenging for a black person

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.070
to pitch.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.490
Don Newcombe and people like
that changed their minds

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:11.990
on that.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.590
But it took a while.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.830
So we're still
trying to overcome

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.900
some of the stereotypes that
we just take for granted

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.930
and accept.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:29.870
And it's amazing
how much of a hold

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.980
they have on our
way of thinking.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.760
It's amazing to
me, because there

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.850
have been to many objective
examples of how that is not

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.520
true, and it doesn't work.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.660
But the people
still hold on to it.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.400
KEVIN LU: I think we made
Warren Moon improve himself

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.010
for seven years in Canada before
letting him back in America.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.990
That's pretty awful.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.800
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Warren had the arm,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.490
and he had the intellect to be
a pretty good NFL quarterback.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.490
KEVIN LU: Speaking of
other people on TV,

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.930
Serena Williams is playing in
the US Open Semifinals today.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.679
How awesome is she?

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:12.720
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: I
think she's quite awesome.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.990
And she's done a
little bit better

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.490
than people like Jimmy
Connors and John McEnroe.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.380
And that's hard for people
to get their head around.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.730
But she has.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.300
And she pays a
price for it still.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.590
She doesn't get the endorsements
and other opportunities that

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.850
have nothing to do with tennis
that other tennis players get,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.684
just because they are
pretty white women.

00:15:38.684 --> 00:15:40.350
KEVIN LU: Do you want
to expand on that?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.516
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: No, I
think that's enough said.

00:15:42.516 --> 00:15:43.540
KEVIN LU: All right.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.290
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
I don't have anything

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.205
against pretty
white women, but I

00:15:47.205 --> 00:15:49.005
think Serena needs to
get her chance too.

00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:53.890
KEVIN LU: You're also a
huge advocate for equal pay.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.270
Why is that important?

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.353
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Oh,
it's absolutely important

00:15:57.353 --> 00:16:02.612
that we bring the pay
of women up to par.

00:16:02.612 --> 00:16:04.570
They do their share of
the work, but they don't

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.910
get their share of the pay.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.676
There's something that
stinks about that.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:09.300
And we need to do
something about that.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.270
And I hope if
Hillary gets elected

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:18.550
that she helps speed that
along, because again it's

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.650
maintaining a stereotype
that women do not

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.500
have the intellect
or the tenacity

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.900
to be in leadership positions.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.680
That has been disproven.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.980
Benazir Bhutto and
Golda Meir have

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.690
proven that to be a falsehood.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.450
But that nobody wants
to acknowledge that.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.655
So we just have to keep
pushing on that one.

00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:45.280
KEVIN LU: In the
book, you also mention

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.000
that we also need to address
the issues facing lower income

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.600
women and women of color.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.780
What are their
specific challenges?

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.988
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Well,
I think lower income women

00:16:54.988 --> 00:17:00.770
and women of color have to
lead single-parent homes.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.619
And then they need more help,
because if their kids do not

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:08.420
get the educational
opportunities that they

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.089
need to do well,
they're going to become

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:13.547
a permanent underclass.

00:17:13.547 --> 00:17:15.130
So we need to do
something about that.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.380
We need to remedy that
situation and make it possible

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.079
for them to be effective
parents, because they're

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.010
carrying a very heavy load.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.682
KEVIN LU: Well, why don't a lot
Americans care about the poor?

00:17:27.682 --> 00:17:29.140
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Most Americans

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.389
don't care about the poor
because most Americans don't

00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:32.530
want to be poor.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:38.120
And they see so many examples of
people who come here very poor,

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.000
and they make it.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.850
Andrew Carnegie--
very poor person--

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.400
I think his family were
sheepherders in Scotland.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.860
They came here, and they
did they did all right.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.210
And for certain
reasons, if you have

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.680
white skin and good business
ideas, you get the opportunity.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.380
If you don't have white skin
and still have the good business

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.610
ideas, you'll either get
ripped off for your ideas

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.000
and not paid, or
you'll be ignored.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.196
So that has to change.

00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:08.820
KEVIN LU: Actually,
I really appreciate

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.530
that the book mentions 10%
of Americans in poverty

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.080
are Asian-American.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.660
That's not a fact a lot of
people know or care about.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.576
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
They don't care about it.

00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:19.870
And again, we're dealing
with a stereotype.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.870
Most Asian-Americans come
here, and they open up

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.828
a Chinese laundry, and
they make all this money

00:18:23.828 --> 00:18:27.710
and buy some real estate and
sell it and make billions,

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.695
and they're living
down in Florida.

00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:31.320
KEVIN LU: Wait.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.444
That pays more than Google?

00:18:35.259 --> 00:18:37.300
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: They
have tremendous wealth,

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.250
and they're living in Florida.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.850
And they don't have
to work anymore.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.760
That's all BS.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.400
They work hard for
what they get, just

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.390
like any other ethnic group.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.610
KEVIN LU: The next question--
it's also related to income.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.844
Should we pay our
college athletes?

00:18:53.844 --> 00:18:55.260
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
We absolutely

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.593
should pay our college athletes.

00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:58.490
They're being ripped off.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.270
They make all this money.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:05.810
The guy who runs the NCAA makes
$6 or $7 million a year to.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:11.040
The athletes who put that money
on the table make nothing.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.540
They get room and board
and tuition, and that's it.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.250
There was a gentleman that I
knew when I was going to UCLA.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.340
He explained that to me.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:25.980
He said, in the three years that
UCLA won the NCAA tournament--

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.890
no offense to the Huskies,
please-- but in those three

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.190
years, UCLA made millions off
of you, and what did you get?

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.610
I didn't get anything from them.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.640
I got a couple hundred
dollars each month.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.430
And he said, that
that's not right.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.190
You're like an unpaid
minor league for the NBA.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.680
So we need to change
the situation.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.170
So we would get season tickets.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.680
All the players
got season tickets.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.190
You get two tickets.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.440
And the face value of those
tickets was for $400 or $500.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.820
He scalped my tickets for
me and got me about $3,000.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.410
And that enabled me to at
least take my girlfriend out

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.110
to dinner and to have a car.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:19.000
I'm not saying that we have to
make college athletes wealthy.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.170
But we should pay
the people that

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.130
earn the lion's share of the
money, which are the basketball

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.790
teams and the football teams.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.030
They're the ones that
there's so much support for.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.650
And they supply the
bulk of the money.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.860
I mean, nobody pays money to
go see the water polo team.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.470
And you know they work
just as hard as the guys

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.380
on the football team
and the basketball team,

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.670
but it's not a
revenue-generating type

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.000
of event.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.870
So I think they
need to find a way

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:56.220
to judiciously and
fairly spread that around

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.700
for all of the athletes
that work so hard

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:04.120
and make the people that
support the universities proud.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.250
KEVIN LU: So right now, we don't
have our athletes in college.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.610
And we don't let the ones
who are professional athletes

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.170
speak their minds.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.660
What do you think of Colin
Kaepernick right now?

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.160
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Well, I
think Colin has the right idea.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.810
He should use his
position as a platform.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.350
But I think he has to be a
little bit wiser about what

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.200
he's advocating.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:33.730
He was going to try to portray
all of the police departments

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:34.570
as pigs.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.720
That's not good.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.010
He's defeating his own purpose.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.200
But if he can get
to the point where

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.890
he gets a dialogue going between
communities and their police

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:51.000
forces, and they want
to heal the divide

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.750
and really make it so that
the police have an idea of who

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.530
the people are that they're
there to protect and serve,

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.870
and the people in the
community have an idea of what

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.220
the police are doing
to keep them safe,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.360
when we get that mutual
appreciation of each other,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.140
that's when a bridge
has been built.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.100
And sports heroes can really
pursue facilitate that.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.740
So I'm going to talk to the
guys on the Seahawks today

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.194
later on this afternoon.

00:22:17.194 --> 00:22:18.610
When we were talking
to them, they

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.190
wanted to talk to me
about these issues.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.670
And I intend to bring
this up and help

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.100
them get an idea of how
they can do it wisely,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.850
where they don't
alienate everybody,

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.280
because the people
that have worked

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.660
so hard in our country,
especially police officers,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.790
they don't appreciate
being smeared

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.180
like that with a broad brush.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.370
But there are some
bad cops out there.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.980
But that is not really
what it should be about.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.160
It should be about
making it better

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.390
and finding a way to train the
police better, so that they

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.210
don't react to the
fears that they have,

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.720
because they have
legitimate fears.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.110
Police work is a dangerous job.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.290
They know that.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.390
But sometimes it
gets out of hand

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.410
and their reactions are
totally inappropriate,

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.970
and people end up dying.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.040
And that's the real
shame of all this.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.040
So we're going to
find a way to get

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.210
them to understand
that and hopefully

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.390
build some bridges with the
various police agencies,

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.080
because all cops love
sports, because it's

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.859
a great diversion for them.

00:23:22.859 --> 00:23:24.650
They've got to go out
and risk their lives,

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.400
oftentimes on a daily basis.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.810
So we got to appreciate that.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.520
And if we build
this communication

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.980
and make that possible, I think
it will be a great improvement.

00:23:38.142 --> 00:23:39.600
KEVIN LU: You have
been politically

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.160
active ever since your
playing days at UCLA.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.080
Didn't you boycott the 1968 Ol--

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.064
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
'68 Olympics, yeah/

00:23:46.064 --> 00:23:47.480
KEVIN LU: That was
in Mexico City?

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
It was in Mexico City.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.360
There wasn't really a boycott,
but I didn't go anyway.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.020
I didn't want to go.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.180
The person who ran the
US Olympic Committee

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.020
was named Avery Brundage.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.780
And he was the
individual who did not

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.490
let the Jewish athletes compete
in Berlin in 1936, because it

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.850
was going to make Hitler angry.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.500
So I wasn't going to
do anything for him.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.350
That was out.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.610
So I didn't go.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.610
That's why I didn't go.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.580
I didn't make a
big stink about it.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.510
I just wasn't going.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.270
But I think that Tommie
Smith and John Carlos really

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:28.780
did it in a way that got the
point across without offending

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.835
the wrong people.

00:24:30.835 --> 00:24:32.710
KEVIN LU: But did you
still get any backlash?

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.830
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: I
got a lot of backlash,

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.640
because people thought
that I secretly

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.000
was a communist or some
type of subversive.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.387
And my own tendency to keep
quiet and be shy really

00:24:46.387 --> 00:24:47.470
didn't serve me very well.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.864
I needed to speak
up and let people

00:24:49.864 --> 00:24:52.030
know what my thinking was
all about, because I think

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.870
a lot of them would have agreed
with me on a lot of the issues.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.885
But I had a lot to learn.

00:24:58.885 --> 00:25:00.760
KEVIN LU: How about the
time you demonstrated

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.370
after the assassination of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.890
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Well,
after Dr. King was assassinated,

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.920
I took part in a demonstration
on UCLA's campus.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:16.180
And we just stood on the campus.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.170
We didn't say anything.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.064
But some of us had signs.

00:25:19.064 --> 00:25:21.230
And a number of people--
about four or five people--

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.930
stopped and said, hey,
you're getting an opportunity

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.720
to play in the NBA.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.900
What are you doing out
here demonstrating?

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.880
And they didn't
understand the fact

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.390
that the two had no
relationship to each other.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.730
I was talking about the
unnecessary and horrific

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.060
assassination of a great leader.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.960
And they were talking
about the fact

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:49.930
that a black athlete had
the nerve to protest that.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.518
It was just a total
miscommunication.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.350
But I dealt with it.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.200
It didn't last that long.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.020
But it was something that
really opened my eyes

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:12.650
to how stereotypes and people's
thoughts about the way America

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.030
is could be so distorted.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.760
And they had no
appreciation for the reality

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.210
that we were dealing with.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:25.957
KEVIN LU: Wasn't your very first
article about Dr. King too?

00:26:25.957 --> 00:26:27.790
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Jeez, I don't remember.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.947
It's so long ago.

00:26:28.947 --> 00:26:30.780
KEVIN LU: There's a
section in the book that

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.600
talks about how you were a
student or amateur reporter

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.560
at a King's r--

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.480
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Oh, OK.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.590
I was in high school.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.350
KEVIN LU: Oh, wow.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.350
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yeah,
I was in high school,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.300
and we had a program in Harlem.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.950
It was a mentoring program
and also a summer jobs program

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.380
with different workshops.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.320
And what it was all about was
to show the kids in Harlem

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.500
that they had to have an idea
of what their careers should be

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.390
and how they could make
Harlem a better place.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.830
So I was in a
journalism workshop,

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:05.800
because I had aspirations
at that time to write.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.750
So Dr. King came and
addressed all the participants

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.930
in the program, because the star
of the program, Dr. John Henry

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.750
Clarke, was friends
with Dr. King.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.900
And Dr. Clark was a
sociologist and historian,

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.970
a very, very well known,
very highly respected person.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.630
And Dr. King was
happy to address us.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:33.130
So they gave me, as someone
in our journalism workshop,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:33.930
press credentials.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.080
And I went covered it
with the people from CBS

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.920
and "The New York Times"
with all these people

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.170
I'd seen on TV doing the news.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:46.540
And I'm standing there with
my recorder and my notepad.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.060
And I even got to ask
Dr. King a question.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.020
And just having
him touch my life

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.030
like that-- he
answered my question--

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.190
I was like, wow and covered it.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.460
And it's been part
of what has made

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.598
me motivated my whole life.

00:28:06.619 --> 00:28:09.160
KEVIN LU: You've also written
books on the Harlem Renaissance

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.350
and African inventors
and decorated

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.360
black soldiers of World War II.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.989
Why do you like history so much?

00:28:14.989 --> 00:28:17.280
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: I like
history so much, especially

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.320
black American history, because
black American history is

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:28.080
part of American history,
but it's been marginalized.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.100
And black Americans
have contributed so much

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.790
to what makes America the
great place that it is.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.380
I start with even
the exploration

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.770
of the Western
hemisphere, which blacks

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:45.010
participated in, the
exploration of North

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.650
America, the Revolutionary War.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.600
I try to give a broad
picture, so that black kids

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.660
could have something that
they could relate to,

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.327
a book that they could
open up and find out

00:28:57.327 --> 00:28:58.910
how they fit in--
where do we fit in--

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.620
because American
history has always

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.360
been about white Americans,
what they have done.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.500
And everybody else has been
marginalized, along with women.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.769
And it has to stop.

00:29:13.769 --> 00:29:15.310
If we're going to
paint that picture,

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.770
we've got to put everybody
in it that belongs in it.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:22.330
So that's what that's all about.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.460
KEVIN LU: The book also
dedicates an entire chapter

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.390
to aging and senior citizens.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.020
What are some of the
challenges that they face?

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.440
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Well, senior citizens also

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.580
are marginalized,
because they are

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.170
seen as being useless
and over the hill.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.140
And they're not.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.140
So many of the elderly Americans
still have great ideas.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:48.060
And their wisdom and experience
are very, very useful

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.130
for those of us who don't
want to make mistakes.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.660
So we need to appreciate
our older citizens

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.943
and not marginalize them and
say that they're useless.

00:30:02.362 --> 00:30:04.570
KEVIN LU: You have accomplished
so much in your life.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.326
How do you want
to be remembered?

00:30:07.326 --> 00:30:08.700
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Well, I want

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.470
to be remembered as someone
who cared about my country.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:18.990
And if my kids can remember
me in a positive light,

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.200
I'm happy with that.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.544
Nothing else is important to Me

00:30:22.544 --> 00:30:24.460
KEVIN LU: Well, I think
that's a great answer.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.330
And with that, let's open
the floor to questions

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.070
from the audience.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.611
We have a microphone
stand over here.

00:30:28.611 --> 00:30:31.044
So please line up and ask
a question if you have one.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.780
AUDIENCE: First of
all, welcome to Google.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.850
I think we covered that already,
but it's cool to see here.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.580
We're honored.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.720
As someone from a
different generation,

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.310
I've been really encouraged by
the level of dialogue that's

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.050
going on in our country
now around issues

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.960
of race and racial
equality, but I've also

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.760
been really discouraged
by the tone of it.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.730
Having been through
different civil movements,

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.180
what do you think
of the general tone?

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.100
Are you encouraged?

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.070
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: I'm
encouraged, in so far

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.680
as people of color are
starting to understand

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.180
that they need to do something
so that they can be included.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.900
I'm discouraged when
people want to support

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.240
the idea of white privilege.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.910
That has been part of what the
problems have all been about.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.110
People of color quite often
have been the last hired

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.680
and the first fired.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.430
And that has been
wrong the whole time.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.770
Qualified people do
not get the opportunity

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.020
because they don't look right.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:46.600
I remember they were complaining
about an ad in North Carolina

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.750
during the race that
Michael Jordan didn't

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.160
want to participate.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.740
And one of the people
running for office

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.850
had an ad that showed
black hands handling money.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.900
And that really was
like a dog whistle

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.680
that we don't want black people
having any responsibility.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.890
We just want them to be
here for menial hard labor

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.630
and to accept that and
keep their mouth shut.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:16.130
So I think that that's
what it's all about.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.430
We have to make this
a real meritocracy,

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.400
where people colored
and women are

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.682
able to benefit for what they
contribute to our society.

00:32:25.682 --> 00:32:26.890
AUDIENCE: Awesome, thank you.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:27.330
KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR:
You're welcome.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.830
AUDIENCE: And also, I was
doing some homework for you.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.040
Doug Baldwin of the Seattle
Seahawks just tweeted out about

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.440
an hour ago, "to express
a desire to bring people

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.290
together, our team will
honor the country and flag

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.190
in a pre-game demonstration of
unity." so just a heads up--

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.380
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
That's awesome.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.450
AUDIENCE: --when you
go talk to them later.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:43.510
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
And that's what I want.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.291
Thank you.

00:32:44.291 --> 00:32:44.790
Thank you.

00:32:47.687 --> 00:32:49.270
AUDIENCE: I'm very
excited to be here.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.870
Let me just open by saying,
unlike most people, perhaps

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:53.600
my first introduction
to you was actually

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.250
through "The Game of
Death" and Bruce Lee, one

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.706
of my favorite human beings.

00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:00.330
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
And he went to UW.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.038
AUDIENCE: He did?

00:33:01.038 --> 00:33:02.260
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.343
KEVIN LU: And I learned
more about you from there.

00:33:04.343 --> 00:33:07.090
I'm going to be presumptuous
and talk for just 30 seconds

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.334
about myself.

00:33:08.334 --> 00:33:09.750
I think the
background's relevant.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.270
No, it is.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.240
I promise.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.330
My dad worked in the
civil rights movement,

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.584
briefly, in Harlem.

00:33:14.584 --> 00:33:16.500
I grew up in a black
neighborhood just outside

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.200
of DC.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.250
I went to a public school that
was 90% black and 7% Latino.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.680
I was picked on
for being the only

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.080
white kid in a 42-person class.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.030
When I was 16, I was
stopped and frisked

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.670
and mistreated by
police officers

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.160
for being in a
poor neighborhood.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.610
When my now wife,
then girlfriend,

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.136
gave me $1 for the bus,
it was called a drug deal.

00:33:38.136 --> 00:33:40.730
So I put up against a
lamp post and frisked.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.240
And my eyes started
slowly opening

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.520
to how much that was
happening in that neighborhood

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.460
to everybody, who, of course,
were are all people of color,

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.710
unlike me.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.710
And then in college
I saw Tim Wise speak.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.020
This is, again,
background story.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:00.692
And Tim Wise is a white man
who talks a lot about race.

00:34:00.692 --> 00:34:02.150
But he was very
influential for me,

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.870
because I've had these
moments of slowly waking up

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.050
to these issues.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.550
But he was the first
person who came

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:11.100
from my background of having
experienced privilege and very

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.090
little forms of
prejudice in his life

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.080
but was so passionate
about the issue

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.469
and spoke from a background that
was easier for me to relate to.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.154
But I was very
prepared, in some sense,

00:34:23.154 --> 00:34:25.070
based on a lot of
experiences I had in my life

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.960
that were unusual for, I
think, white straight males

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.270
like myself.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.960
And so I'm curious,
how much have

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.090
you talked to people
about, specifically,

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.600
this issue of making
these issues more

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.630
accessible to people who are
often not directly suffering

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:45.368
from the artifacts of oppression
and racism in this country?

00:34:45.368 --> 00:34:47.659
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Well,
thank you for your question.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.380
I think that issue
is so important,

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.610
because in our country
it seems like it's OK

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.302
if there are a group
of people, and it

00:34:58.302 --> 00:34:59.760
doesn't matter what
color they are,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.520
if someone is in there
that is the wrong color--

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.480
and you went through that.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.810
You were the wrong color
in a bunch of predominantly

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.130
African-Americans,
and you got picked on.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.700
And that was seen as OK.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.850
And it's not OK.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:19.090
Just as it's never OK that black
Americans and other Americans

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.970
of color are picked
on when they're

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.660
the only one amongst a
lot of white Americans.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.150
We've got to treat
everybody, as Dr. King said,

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:31.790
based on who they are and the
content of their character

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:36.670
and who they are, what
they are standing up for.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.460
And we have to stand
up for people who

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.080
stand up for the right things.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:47.480
And we can't have the
blinders on that blind us

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.170
to a person's character.

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:53.200
And sometimes color
can be those blinders.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.930
So we've got to find a way
to remove those and reward

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:01.320
the people who deserve to
be rewarded and discipline

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.880
the people who deserve
to be disciplined.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.940
And you can't be
biased about that.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.410
We can't do that.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.650
But we've permitted that
for so long that it's

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.910
become acceptable behavior,
given the right circumstances.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:18.890
Well, there's a white guy
with all these black people.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:20.360
Well, he's probably
a drug dealer.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.600
Or he's married
to a black woman,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.580
or he's something that the
traditional white society would

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.940
not accept.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.320
And that goes both ways.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.387
AUDIENCE: Oh, for sure.

00:36:32.387 --> 00:36:33.720
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Absolutely.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.050
AUDIENCE: Just as a very
brief follow up to that,

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.720
I guess the main
concern that I have

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.220
that I see regularly
is when we have

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.220
these conversations about
race, diversity, prejudice,

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.430
all of these things, there
tends to be two camps--

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.620
the people who
already understand

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.330
that there's a problem
and are actively

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.930
trying to be participants.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.020
And then there are
people like I once was,

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.739
who were just very blind to
the issues in the first place.

00:36:54.739 --> 00:36:56.280
And I came from this
background where

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.750
I feel that I was a little
more prepared to open

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.540
my eyes to see these issues.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.260
But I also went to
college with a bunch

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.427
of-- all the white people
I knew in college came

00:37:04.427 --> 00:37:06.760
from much richer families
than I did, grew up in totally

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.469
different neighborhoods.

00:37:08.469 --> 00:37:10.260
And they just didn't
see this stuff at all,

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.867
didn't recognize it.

00:37:12.867 --> 00:37:14.450
And I want to know,
how do we actually

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.825
start bringing these issues
to people who are not already

00:37:16.825 --> 00:37:18.632
converts, part of the choir?

00:37:18.632 --> 00:37:20.340
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
I think the only way

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.680
I can do that is to get
these people who don't see it

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.150
because it hasn't touched their
lives-- we got to figure out

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:30.480
a way to get them
to see that issue,

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.050
because that's the issue.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.190
Ignorance often is bliss.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.160
Everything's great.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.740
I got everything I need.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.620
These people don't know
what they're doing.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.550
They don't work hard enough.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:43.091
They're lazy.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.390
And that's not what
it's all about.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:52.230
But until we can point that
out in ways that they get it,

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:57.730
we're going to have a hell
of an educational problem

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:58.650
to overcome.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.420
But this is something
we've got to work on.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:03.961
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Thank you.

00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:05.999
I appreciate your question.

00:38:05.999 --> 00:38:07.540
AUDIENCE: Hi, so
first of all, I want

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.990
to say thank you for
taking the time out

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.614
of your day to come
here and talk to us

00:38:10.614 --> 00:38:12.320
and impart your knowledge on us.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.460
I have a question that
has to deal a little bit

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.030
with wallpaper racism.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:23.010
So I tutor middle school
and high school students

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:23.930
with Solid Ground.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.950
So these are all
underprivileged children, mostly

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.290
children of color.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.020
And what you see is that
when they go to school,

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.010
they have lowered expectations
from their teachers, it seems.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:40.450
And apart from your teachers and
the people that are helping you

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.115
there, usually you get these
expectations from your parents.

00:38:43.115 --> 00:38:45.240
But they don't always have
a great family structure

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.540
for that.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.970
Often times, the child will have
parents that neither of them

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.180
graduated high school,
and they don't really care

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.760
about their child's education.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.640
And so I guess, what
are your suggestions

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.550
for helping put expectations on
them so that they can succeed?

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.050
Because what I see
is that when they

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.700
don't have the expectations,
they don't typically succeed.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.460
And when they do
have expectations,

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.420
they do succeed, because they
are almost always smart enough

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.870
to do what they need to do.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.310
No one's telling them they are.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:20.600
I

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.620
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Well, I think

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.170
the problem that
you're identifying

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:28.280
has to do-- the lowered
expectations are often

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.740
accompanied by teachers
who see lowered

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:37.080
expectations in the poor
kids that they teach.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.760
So they use the discipline
issue to try and deal

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.060
with that to get
them to do something

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.760
instead of giving
them the opportunity

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.920
to overcome the gap.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.600
So if their parents
don't have an education

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.600
and don't see that
as important, you

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:03.160
can still transfer the
values that you have that

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.700
enabled you to get to the
position where you are.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.480
You can transfer
that to the kids.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.610
They don't have to be
like their parents.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:16.480
But so many times, people just
think it's a genetic thing,

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.242
and that's it.

00:40:18.242 --> 00:40:20.200
And some of the brightest
people in our country

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.939
come from absolutely
horrible circumstances.

00:40:23.939 --> 00:40:25.980
And they overcome it just
because they're bright,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:31.210
and they recognize their own
ambition, and they go for it.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:40.330
So I think that you can't ever
have an attitude where you

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.690
won't be pleasantly surprised.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:46.840
You've got to allow for
that to happen as a teacher.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:53.220
And if we can get that
idea across to the people

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:59.130
in power that make all these
things happen or not happen,

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.200
I think we can do a better job.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.710
But raising people up
from poverty and ignorance

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.220
is really a very tough thing.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.280
And it also would
require that people

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.250
are willing to spend money
to get the good teachers who

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.720
don't want to be involved
in it because they're not

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.210
appreciated, and they're
underpaid, and why bother?

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:23.390
I think we've gotten
to this point.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.650
The American education
system, for so long,

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:28.740
was the best in the world.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:33.030
Our high school students
had the best grades

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.300
of all the industrialized
countries in the world.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.350
And now we're down 6th or 7th
place, 8th, 9th, 10th place,

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.640
just because people
aren't going to spend

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.940
the money for the good teachers
and give them the opportunity

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.850
to do the things that they
have done so well for decades.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.760
Sometime in the '70s or '80s,
they just threw their hands up

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.550
and said, forget it.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:56.340
And I think we paid
a price for that.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.930
So I hope that changes.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:58.720
AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:58.970
Thank you.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.011
KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR: Thank
you for your question.

00:42:03.657 --> 00:42:05.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, so in the
introduction to your book,

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.660
you mention how it's
really unfortunate

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.180
that often times
people repeat history

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.230
and the mistakes of history.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.910
But my question--
what I'm wondering--

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:19.022
is why something that's
worked in history

00:42:19.022 --> 00:42:20.980
hasn't been repeated,
and that's your signature

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.540
move, the skyhook?

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:28.724
Why, today, do we not see
that as much in the NBA?

00:42:28.724 --> 00:42:30.140
I mean, obviously,
it's very hard.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:34.160
I've tried to incorporate
it in my game, and I can't.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.530
But I'm sure if I had more
time, I could perfect it.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.050
Is it just that it's hard,
or maybe today the game's

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.590
changed, where people are going
for and-ones and three-point

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.449
plays?

00:42:42.449 --> 00:42:44.490
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Thank
you for your question.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:45.550
It's not that hard.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.020
I think what's happening is that
the guys who are teaching kids

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.760
to play the game--
kids, they don't

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.690
want to work with their
back to the basket,

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.830
close to the hoop,
where, actually, you

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.000
get a high percentage shot.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.510
They don't want to do.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.210
That they want to
shoot three-pointers.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.570
Everybody wants to
shoot three-pointers.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:09.680
They see Stephen Curry.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.760
They say, oh, that's
what I want to do.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.900
And when I was
learning the game,

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:21.082
guys that taught young
kids showed them post moves

00:43:21.082 --> 00:43:22.470
as part of the game.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.970
I had to learn post
moves, and I had

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.600
to try to learn how to
play perimeter stuff,

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.612
just so I understood the game.

00:43:28.612 --> 00:43:29.820
And that's not happening now.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.060
And everybody wants to
shoot three-pointers now.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.730
I'm the leading scorer
in the NBA, all-time,

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.630
I made one three-pointer
in my whole career.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.850
And I can tell you that was a
shock and surprise to everybody

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:49.320
that was there that night.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.060
But the ball bounced
out to the corner.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.980
I went out and got the rebound.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.530
And there was nobody coming
to guard me or anything,

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.610
so I stepped back and shot one.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.220
And went in fortunately.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.990
I'm 1 for 13 in my
career in three-pointers.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:05.240
But I took a lot of
high percentage shots

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.080
at the paint using my shot.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.610
And it worked.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.130
But kids, they don't want
to work on learning it.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:18.470
So I think styles go in cycles.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.400
So maybe at some
point, people will

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.070
realize that getting
high percentage shots

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:24.600
actually balances
out the guys that

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.439
can make the three-pointers.

00:44:26.439 --> 00:44:27.480
And that's what you need.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.729
You need you need versatility
on the basketball court,

00:44:29.729 --> 00:44:34.480
because if you are stuck at
just making three pointers,

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.700
you're going to end up
like the Warriors ended up

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.900
this year, where once
Cleveland figured it out,

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:44.400
they shut them out on the
inside, got all the rebounds,

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.120
limited them to one shot.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.460
They won three games in a row
to win the world championship.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:55.380
And that was just because Bogut
didn't play for the Warriors.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.510
They had nobody that could
compete near the basket.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.110
And Cleveland's
eyes actually really

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:05.970
won that series for them,
despite the wonderful stuff

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:11.700
that you see from
Curry and Thompson.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.857
It just didn't work.

00:45:12.857 --> 00:45:13.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:14.180
I'll keep that in mind.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:14.910
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
You're welcome.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:15.850
Good luck.

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:18.030
Good luck in the gym.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.530
KEVIN LU: We just
have a few minutes

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.022
left for the rest
of the questions.

00:45:22.022 --> 00:45:24.230
AUDIENCE: First of all, I
want to say I really admire

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:28.200
a lot of your op-eds and
writings about issues of racism

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.840
and a lot of these institutional
problems that we see today.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.220
And I have two questions.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.250
One is more on your
experience, and the second

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.480
is kind of advice.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.750
So I grew up in a predominately
black neighborhood,

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.540
and I am what I call the
post-9/11 generation.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.370
I was born Muslim, and
I was raised in the US.

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:53.490
And I was seven years
old when 9/11 happened.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.210
And this kind of ties
into my question.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.480
First, how has your
experience been living,

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.030
I guess, as a double
minority, being a Muslim

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.960
and an African-American?

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.710
And two, for people like
myself, for younger folks who

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:13.210
have kind of lived and grew up
with this experience of having

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:17.974
this kind of tax on expectations
of their behavior or things

00:46:17.974 --> 00:46:20.390
they have, or stereotypes, or
anything they have to put up

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:23.940
with, how do you cope with it?

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.180
What advice do you have to
make it easier to deal with?

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.600
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
OK, I've been

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.440
through part of
the same experience

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.840
as you have, because prior
to 9/11, being Muslim,

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.300
you kind of went
under the radar.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.610
People weren't that
interested in it,

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.005
as long as you
didn't bother them,

00:46:41.005 --> 00:46:42.380
they weren't going
to bother you.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.796
Americans are
pretty good at that.

00:46:43.796 --> 00:46:47.530
I don't know whether he's
about-- he has purple hair,

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:51.790
and he wear shorts and sneakers,
and they'll let you go.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.200
But then, if you start
creating a problem,

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.690
you're going to get a lot
of negative attention.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.450
And that's what happened.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.297
I think for the
Muslim community,

00:47:01.297 --> 00:47:02.630
they're going to have to engage.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.213
They're going to
have to do everything

00:47:04.213 --> 00:47:07.900
they can to show Americans
that they are just

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.710
as happy to be here as
all the other Americans.

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:13.920
Most Muslims are really
happy to be here,

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.040
because if they were
over in the Middle East,

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.560
or wherever that their
families came from,

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.540
they would have to deal with
some type of oppression,

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.000
either political oppression or
sometimes religious oppression,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.550
because that is
commonplace over there.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:30.890
And their wives and
daughters and sisters

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:35.940
get totally abused living
in that circumstance, when

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.810
the Koran says that
women are supposed

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:44.260
to be able to choose their
husbands, petition for divorce,

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.780
own and inherit property,
and that they are partners

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.230
with their husbands.

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:51.630
That's ignored in
the Islamic world.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:52.720
That doesn't happen.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.810
Women have no protection
there, and the Koran

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:58.630
says that those rights are
supposed to be protected.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.600
Yet those Muslim governments do
nothing to protect the women,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.460
because they enjoy chauvinism.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:08.990
So most Muslim families are
happy to be here, especially

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.600
the women, because their
rights will be protected.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.110
If somebody tries to
rape them, or if somebody

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.390
tries to force them to marry
somebody, they can protest.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:23.250
And if they can prove
that to a police officer,

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:24.410
they'll get protected.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.120
And that doesn't
happen over there.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:31.660
So it's a failure, on one hand,
of these Muslim governments.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.460
And sometimes it's a failure of
their families and communities

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.370
to engage.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:38.960
But when Muslims
engage and let people

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.440
know what the Koran is about
and how they are supposed

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.960
to interact with other faiths
and how they're supposed

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.250
to be good citizens, no
matter where they live,

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:51.540
if they live in a
Muslim-majority country

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.930
or as minorities,
they're supposed

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.590
to uphold the laws
of the country.

00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:01.230
As long as the laws of where
they live do not oppress us,

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.950
we're supposed to cooperate
and respect those laws

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.770
and respect the traditions
of that country.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.340
That's what the prophet said.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.150
That's what the Koran says.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.530
So we just have to
let them what's right

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:14.940
and what's wrong in
these circumstances.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.890
And you can change that.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.050
And it all involves engagement.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:25.730
So just have people not
be intimidated by it,

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:28.460
but explain who they
are, what they are about,

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:34.537
and offer their help to
overcome these things.

00:49:34.537 --> 00:49:35.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.840
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
You're welcome.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.965
KEVIN LU: Hey, we're running
a little over on time.

00:49:38.965 --> 00:49:41.340
Let's just take this
as the last question.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.090
And then one more.

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:43.650
You were standing in
line the whole time.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.190
Is that OK?

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.700
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: It's fine.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.421
AUDIENCE: I'll be brief then.

00:49:46.421 --> 00:49:47.920
I wanted to follow
up with something

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.740
you said about the election
of the first black president,

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.480
which to be sure is a
great barrier to cross,

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:59.020
but also doesn't mean
that racism is over.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:05.140
And also, I think if you
look at the Obama presidency,

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:12.340
I don't know that he has
taken on the problems that

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:16.248
face minorities in America,
especially strongly, be

00:50:16.248 --> 00:50:20.050
it racist drug policy
and incarceration rates

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.039
or deportation.

00:50:23.039 --> 00:50:25.330
And I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit more

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:30.700
about what it has changed to
have young black people see

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:34.765
a black president and
what it hasn't changed?

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:36.390
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Well, I think just

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:40.770
seeing a black president
for the last eight years--

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:44.460
and he's tried to
do so many thingg--

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.140
I think that that has been
great for the whole country,

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:51.710
black kids and white
kids, in so far as, hey,

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.330
he has his strengths
and weaknesses.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.020
We can judge him on
those things and not

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.450
on the color of his skin.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.670
And that's a big improvement.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:03.870
But I think President
Obama had to deal

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:08.240
with so much opposition
from the Republicans

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.870
just because he
was a black person,

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:13.050
and he whipped them twice.

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.930
And they can't stand that.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:17.530
That's really what
it's all about.

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:19.820
They can't stand the
way that he beat them.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.100
He was smarter than they were
and understood the issues

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.700
and did a better job in
addressing the American people

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.810
about the things
that concerned them,

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:31.280
and the Republicans haven't
been able to do that.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:36.350
They keep coming up with the
same BS about trickle-down.

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:39.200
We take taxes off of
the wealthiest people,

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.600
and jobs will trickle down.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.320
That hasn't happened ever.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.020
And they keep repeating this.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.690
And it's horse crap you know.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:52.140
So they've used that as an
excuse to oppose everything

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.370
that he's tried to do.

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:58.260
And it's really
hamstrung his presidency.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.460
And in addition to
that, he has to be

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.010
present for all Americans.

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.930
He can't just be the
president for black Americans

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:09.080
and just someone in the
job for white Americans.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.580
He has to do the best job
he can for all Americans

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.670
and can't be seen
as being biased.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:17.240
And I think that, really, is
what you're talking about,

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:21.280
where he could have been
more proactive for issues

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.530
that are important to
minority communities.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:25.910
But if he did that, the
majority of the country

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:30.500
would feel that he was
misusing his position.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:34.580
And you know he was really
handcuffed in that sense.

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.620
But I'm so happy
that he got the job.

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.720
And did what he has tried.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:44.010
And I hope that
people, over time,

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:47.430
will appreciate him more,
just for the patience

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.590
that he showed in
all this opposition.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:53.660
We can't even get another
Supreme Court Justice

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:57.770
in because they don't want
to give him the opportunity

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:00.210
because he might do something
that they don't like.

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:03.830
And he did win that
election in 2012

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.650
that enabled him to do that,
whether they like it or not.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:09.670
But they're not going
to acknowledge that.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:12.800
It's really the
double standard that

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:16.890
applies to most people of
color that has traditionally

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.500
been part of the
American way of life.

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.587
And we got to get away from it.

00:53:20.587 --> 00:53:21.420
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.250
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Thank
you for the question.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:25.416
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:53:25.416 --> 00:53:27.140
I'll try to make my setup short.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.200
This touches on
themes-- you mentioned

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.450
that we need to solve the
problem of income inequality

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:32.820
and wealth inequality.

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.320
And some of the
previous questioners

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.130
also brought up the
ideas of visibility,

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:39.826
that people who are not
experiencing oppression,

00:53:39.826 --> 00:53:41.200
even if they're
well-intentioned,

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.390
may not be aware
of its existence

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.530
and may think that
some of the people who

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:47.985
are speaking about it are
blowing it out proportion

00:53:47.985 --> 00:53:51.310
and that kind of stuff.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:53.709
So because of that,
I think some issues

00:53:53.709 --> 00:53:55.250
that come up that
are very important,

00:53:55.250 --> 00:54:00.230
things like affirmative
action and reparations,

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.862
you see people classify
that as reverse racism

00:54:02.862 --> 00:54:05.070
and that we have this sort
of myth of color blindness

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:09.860
that everybody-- I guess
if they don't experience

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:15.630
the un-level playing field of
lack of opportunities a lot

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.780
of people are experiencing,
they think it sort of propagates

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.210
these myths of if people
just worked harder,

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.350
they would get the things
that my parents had

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:25.520
to work hard to get.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.820
So I guess the specific
question I was wondering

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:30.404
is if you have a position,
specifically, on reparations,

00:54:30.404 --> 00:54:31.820
whether you think
that's something

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.516
that our government should be--

00:54:34.516 --> 00:54:36.640
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: I
don't think that reparations

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.490
are appropriate, because
there's nobody alive now

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:41.690
that owned slaves.

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.660
Those people, they
got away with that.

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.490
So there's nothing
we can do about that.

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:52.450
But I think that because,
especially people of color,

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:58.860
are so economically far behind,
that an educational effort

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.900
focused on the communities
of people of color

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:05.030
to get them to the point
where they can compete

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:08.000
for good jobs and
economic opportunities--

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.950
I think people
could accept that,

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:15.040
because these people
have inherited

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.890
an inferior position
economically for something

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.370
that they didn't do.

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:25.890
And it can be remedied
through education.

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:30.230
Their kids will have the
education and the opportunity

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:33.640
to do much better and
have some catch up.

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:37.470
But there's nothing we can do
about what happened in 1845.

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:39.200
There's nothing we
can do about that.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.620
And I don't feel that I
can hold any white person

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.780
responsible for that.

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.380
It just doesn't work.

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.340
I'm glad people like
Georgetown University

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.390
are acknowledging
their culpability

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:53.620
and doing something about it.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:59.630
And again, they're going to
have some scholarships for kids

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:02.750
from black neighborhoods
that need it to give them

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:06.910
the educational opportunity that
will enable them to overcome

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:08.240
something that they inherited.

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.290
So I think that's
the only way to go

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:13.190
about it without being unfair.

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:19.230
And I hope overall, throughout
the communities in our country,

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:23.235
we start to see that and
make the adjustments.

00:56:23.235 --> 00:56:24.360
Thank you for you question.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.800
KEVIN LU: A quick
announcement-- you

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.425
can get a copy of
the book in the back,

00:56:28.425 --> 00:56:30.220
and Kareem will be signing them.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.360
And with that, let's
thank our guest.

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:39.990
