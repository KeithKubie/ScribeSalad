00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.860
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: My
name's Grant Harris.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.270
I'm Head of the European Reading
Room and thank you all for coming

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.570
to the Library of Congress today.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.340
We've got a really,
really large crowd here.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.050
We should have had a larger
room but this is what we have,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.570
so [laughter] thanks
for fitting in here.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.210
And we're pleased to
have Pat Grimsted

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.300
to come back and talk to us again.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.060
She talked to us about
three years ago I think

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.620
about Nazi-looted materials.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.810
Pat has -- I've known Pat since
1985, maybe 1984, when she came

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.190
and did some research in
the European Reading Room.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.220 position:56%
I know her really has having
compiled a whole shelf worth of book

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.560
on archives in the Former Soviet
Union and then materials that came

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.020
out or after that in the
Former Soviet Republics.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.470
But she's turned her attention to
other materials now, plundered art

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.280
and -- from the Nazi area,
both the art and books.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.660
I should backtrack and say that
Dr. Grimsted is Senior Research

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.040 position:56%
Associate at the Harvard Ukrainian
Research Institute, the Davis Center

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.370
for Russian and Eurasian Studies,
and the International Institute

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.530
for Social History in Amsterdam.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.410
She is the author or numerous
books and articles on Russian

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.970
and Soviet archives and the
founder of ArceoBiblioBase,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300
and several of you
have used that before.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.190
It's an online guide.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.840
So today it's really more about
displaced cultural treasures

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.580
from the Second World War
and restitution issues.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.950
And Pat has written much
about Russia and Ukraine.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.810 position:56%
But today's talk is in another area.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.160
It's going to be about Minsk in
Belaruse and in the Czech Republic

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.340
in the capital city of Prague.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.790
And in both cases it's the national
libraries that are involved there,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:31.720
large clusters of Nazi-looted books
that are in or near the libraries.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.130
And so that's what we'll
be talking about today.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.740
So, Pat, I'm just going to turn
it over to you at this point.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.190
I should say Pat wanted me
to show some of the materials

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.770
that she's been working on --

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.810
this article from the <i>International
Journal of Cultural Property </i>.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:59.410
I told a few of you about this
earlier on this page in the --

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.180 position:56%
just entire article devoted to that.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.360 position:56%
So I'll pass it around for any of
you who want to take a look at that.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.400
There's also an article
that she wrote about Minsk,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.120
"The Road to Minsk for Western
Trophy Books, Twice-Plundered

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.110
but Not Yet Home from the War."

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.980
So I'll pass that around as well.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.280
So --

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.580
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy
Grimsted: And return from --

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.880
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: And
"Return from Russia."

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.730
There are a number of
works concerning Russia.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.090
So, pass those around, too.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.430
Okay. Now I'll turn
this over to you Pat.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.960 position:56%
And this microphone that I'm holding
leads into the amplifier right there

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.090
so people can really hear in the
back of the room, and then the one

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.860
in front of you is for the webcast.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.320
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy Grimsted:
Can they get a few more chairs

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.620
for our -- I hate to see --

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.920
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: I'll
be trying, yeah.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.330
&gt;&gt; I hate to see people standing.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.630
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.930
We'll see what we can do.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.230
But that's the way it is.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.530
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy Grimsted: Okay.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.830
Well, thank you so much, Grant.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.030
And I am exceedingly grateful for
my longtime friends and colleagues

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.210
at the Library of Congress for
inviting me to speak today.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.150
And I'm so gratified that so many
friends and colleagues gathered,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.470 position:56%
some of whom I've known for decades.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.520
But particularly those that
most recently that I've known

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.130
in connection with my work on
displaced cultural treasures

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.960
from the Second World War, what
the Russians call displaced.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.700
But I often call them twice seized.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.900
But I started with archives
and then books, but today --

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.850
I mean started with archives
and most recently here

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.940
at the Library about art.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.380
But today I want to focus on the
long-neglected concentrations

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.690
of Nazi-looted books, particularly
with examples in Minsk and Prague.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.940
But before getting to those two
hotspots, as I call them today,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.010
let me back up just a little
bit to explain the background

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.280
of how things got to there.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.230
Last October at a colloquium
in Paris sponsored

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.860
by the Turgenev Library Association
where I was invited to speak,

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.990
I recalled 100,000
books and archives

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.400
for the Turgenev Russian Library
in Paris that were plundered

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.000
in the fall of 1940,
shipped off to Germany

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.600
by the Reichsleiter Rosenberg or
ERR as I will refer to it later,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.180
a special task force initiated
in Paris after the occupation

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.110
by Adolph Hitler's
ideological henchman,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.540
Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:59.940
Most of those books from the
BRT, or the Turgenev Library,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.510
went first to Berlin and then
were evacuated to [foreign words],

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.410
where they ended the war.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.180
But of those between 6-
and 8000 I've discovered

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.740
and they finally admitted
in the year 2000 are

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.220
in the former Lenin
Library in Moscow,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.970
which is now the Russian
State Library.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.870
Another 3- to 4000 I have
discovered were in Minsk.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.550 position:56%
I wrote many of them in the meantime
were intentionally destroyed

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.610
as unacceptable for
Soviet libraries.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.440
And others were scattered
throughout the Soviet Union

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.160
because they didn't need all
these Russian books from Paris

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.890
in the Lenin Library because they
were duplicates of things they had.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.270
And so they used the media
for exchange or sending them

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.010
to libraries as far away as
Hellene [assumed spelling]

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.880
in Ireland, south of Japan.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.190
But the 3- to 4000, as
I say, are now in Minsk,

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.830
divided between the
National Library of Belaruse

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.420
and the Presidential Library.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.120
Last year on the anniversary
of, the 70th anniversary

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.200
of the Second World War, only 119
of those books have been returned

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.720
to Paris of -- that is, of the
100,000, returned to Paris.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.750
And today, to be sure, the Turgenev
Library in Paris is a shadow

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:50.720
of its pre-war glory as the most
significant Russian library abroad.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:58.000
My monograph on the odyssey of the
Turgenev Library tells that story.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.950
It was published in 2003 by
the International Institute

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.320
of Social History, or IISH,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.730
in Amsterdam where I've
been Honorary Fellow,

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:15.510 position:56%
and that's where my archive, Russian
archive database is now housed.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.090
That institute, together
with its Paris branch,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.990
suffered the largest non-government
wartime loss of books and archives

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.620
in the Netherlands, many
of which today remain

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.480
in the Russian Federation
and in Belaruse.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.700
The ERR actually took
over the building

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.240
of the Amsterdam Institute
on the [foreign words].

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.250
My French friend and
colleague, Martine Perla,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.820
author of the prize-winning study
of French libraries during the war,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.790 position:56%
estimates that 10 million books were
seized from over 2400 individuals

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:02.200
and 400 institutions in France
during wartime German occupation.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.850
A large percentage of
those have never returned

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.520
to their home libraries.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:13.530
While across the continent we now
estimate approximately 12 million

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.190
books were transported to the
Soviet Union after the war

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:24.040
as what they call compensation for
the even more millions of books

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.200 position:56%
that were destroyed and plundered
by the ERR and other German agencies

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.480
in occupied Soviet lands.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.580
An effort today to try to locate
and account for more of the books

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.840
that were looted during the
war and still displaced --

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.970
I think there are four
points that I would

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.570
like to just emphasize in general.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.170
First, we need to determine
the German agency responsible

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.690
for the seizure.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.230
The -- two, the destination
where the books were dispatched,

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.330
and their wartime migration
to the extent that's possible.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.680
Three, where the books
ended the war.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.870
And, four, what country
found them after the war?

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:16.940
Because it's the last two
elements that determine the success

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.440
or failure of post-war restitution.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.200
Today I emphasize two of
largest concentrations

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:32.440
of still displaced books looted in
Europe by two rival Nazi agencies,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.210
one in Minsk and the
second in Prague.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:41.420
But let me back up just a few
minutes and tell you a little bit

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.010
about how they got there.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.990
The ERR that I mentioned
at the outset only operated

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.570
in German-occupied lands
throughout the European continent.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.320
But their rival was the
Reich Security Main Office,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.480
[foreign words], whose looted
library collections in Berlin

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.120
by 1943 may well have exceeded
those collected by the ERR.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:18.970
Those were books seized by both the
[foreign words] and the Gestapo.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.470
But, first, let me just
say a word about the ERR.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:30.500
I'm currently completing, sponsored
by the Jewish Claims Conference,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.960
an updated and greatly expanded
ERR archival guide which sort

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.700
of is a continuation of my
archival reference background.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.170
I think we have this up.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:49.380
Covering this volume -- it's
only on the Internet, is --

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:55.610
covers remaining ERR and related
archival documents in 10 countries

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.310
in 35 repositories as
well as documents hopeful

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.310
in trying to trace the ERR loot.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:11.070
In Western Europe, the ERR was
also responsible for seizure

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:17.550 position:56%
by the [foreign words] which emptied
an estimated 38,000 homes of Jews

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.510
who were deported in Paris alone.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.280
Or either deported or who had fled.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.510
My French colleague, Martine
Perla, as a sequel to her book,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.780
has been posting on a website
thousands of names of individuals

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:41.300
and institutions whose books
were returned after the war based

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.780
on French library restitution
records

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.610
that have only just
recently been opened.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:54.050 position:56%
But in contrast, my point is that
we need to know who took those books

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.710
and where they went, and
why they weren't returned

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.650
and where they might be today.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.640
And so I've been assisting
the French Committee

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:09.580
on Jewish Archives pretend a new
website with 10 original ERR lists

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.740
of priority library seizures,
which is also sponsored

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.400
by the Claims Conference
or ERR Project.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.030
I found those lists in
six different archives

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.910
in five different countries,
the most important being

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.820
in the British Archives,
National Archives [inaudible],

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:37.010
and surprisingly the most complete
one in the Ukrainian State Archives

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.990
in [foreign word] which is
how I started with the ERR

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.230
because there is the largest batch

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.760
of ERR records remaining
anywhere in the world.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.950 position:56%
And they're now all online thanks
to the help of the Claims Conference

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.930 position:56%
in a project I've been working with.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.940
But the -- from these
French lists of the three --

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.520
that are being posted now, three --

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.960
they cover perhaps only
300 library seizures.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.460
But these are the priority ones.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:18.270
And we even have the codes that
the ER used to mark the crates

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.330
that they -- with which
they shipped the books.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.840
And what's interesting,
as a colleague

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.010 position:56%
at the Holocaust Museum was pointing
out to me with meetings on Monday,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.400
these are the same codes that they
had for the particular collections

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.100
of art that were seized from
the same prominent French

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.260
Jewish families.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.530
Why were they seized?

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:49.230
The ERR had a firm
ideological purpose,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:55.440
and I quote from Rosenberg's
own interrogation at Nuremberg

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.610
and his answer, and I quote.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.470
"To organize with the help
from an [foreign word] composed

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.360
of political leaders and
experts and from the [inaudible]

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:10.750
of a thorough examination of items
left behind by Jews and Freemasons

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.540
that would provide a basis for
future intellectual study necessary

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.570
for the political, ideological,
and [inaudible] operations

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.120
of both the NSDAP and
the [foreign words]."

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.260
Rosenberg's protected [foreign
words], as he called it,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.290
was to become the major post-war
university-level training

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.720
and research facility
for the Nazi elite.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.930
The Central Library of the
[foreign words] was operative

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.930
in Berlin starting early 1959.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.240
And in 1940, Rosenberg inaugurated
the Institute for Research

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.410
on the Jewish question, or IEJ
as we call it, in Frankfurt.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:57.660
The only [foreign words] institute
that was operating during the war

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.640
and the main destination
for Jewish books from Paris.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.830
And then the seizures spread
to the Netherlands and Belgium,

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:12.120
and even Greece, the
Baltic countries, in 1941.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.510
By 1943 IEJ Library
could project a total

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:21.410
of half a million volumes
from all over Europe.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:28.510
And by the time the end of
the war, we could project

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.940
over a million-and-a-half
books and journals that they --

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.740
that ended the war in the
town of [foreign word],

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.010 position:56%
70 kilometers northeast of Frankfurt

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.330
where the IEJ had their
evacuation center.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.420
However, they'd been forced to
hand over most of the Masonic books

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.720
to the [foreign words],
that were [inaudible]

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.840
because it was Heinrich
Himmler's offices that won

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.760
out for more serious
investigation of the Freemasonry

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.070
and the Masonic quote
enemies of the Reich.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:11.040
Berlin was the second major
destination for books seized

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.610
from France and Western Europe.

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:18.010
And most of the ERR library
operations were there during the

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.870
first years of the war.

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.680
But then the books went in
two different directions.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.790
Those destined for the Central
Library of the [foreign words]

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:32.910
or ZBHS went to Austrian Carinthia
to the Monastery of Tanzenberg

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.950
where they ended the
war, about 600,000 books

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.370
for the ZBHS from all over Europe.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.270
A year before the planned
invasion of Soviet Union,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.470
ERR also targeted rich East
European immerge holdings in Paris,

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.560
including the Turgenev
Library with which I started

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.290
to serve their purpose of the --

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:01.000
of research on the
quote "Bolshevik Enemy."

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.930
And they set up an [foreign
words] or Eastern Library of --

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.390
as part of the anti-Bolshevik
research operations

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.030
and its very large
Socialist component

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.980
from my institute in Amsterdam.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.510 position:56%
They took over the building and all
of the library including the library

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.280
and archives from the Second
International in Belgium,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.040
all of which are now in Moscow.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:35.060
After Western bombing captured
books were removed from Berlin,

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.850
ordered out of the capital,
most of them to [foreign words]

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:44.950
which by then the Germans had
chopped off from Czechoslovakia.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:49.520
Major ERR research in library
operations went with the Western --

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.360
with the books from Western
Europe, went to the isolated,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.680
or relatively isolated
city of [foreign word].

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:05.010 position:56%
It's now Polish, in Polish, [foreign
word], 70 kilometers southwest

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.690
of [foreign words] or in Polish
[foreign words] in [foreign word].

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.700
And thereafter all the ERR
shipments of books from all

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.470
over Europe were concentrated
in [foreign word],

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:22.440
including almost two million
volumes seized on the eastern front

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.190
that ended the war there.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:31.890 position:56%
Restitution after the war -- many of
you may have heard about Offenbach

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:38.010
which was the major concentration
of ERR-plundered books outside

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.430
of Frankfurt, and one
of the collecting points

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:48.280
in restitution centers in the
U.S. zone of occupation in Germany

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:55.070
where the Offenbach Archival
Depot, or OAD as it's often called,

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.370
or known as [foreign words],

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.790
and there were almost one million
volumes that the ERR had sent

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.870
to Frankfurt for their IEJ
and all of the millions

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.170
from [foreign word]
were brought there.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:14.420
IEJ, as the antithesis to the ERR,
returned almost 3 million books

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.610
to countries from which
they had been looted.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:24.540
But the second major concentration
of ERR books returned to France

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:30.060
and other countries in the West
were still in this Monastery

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.280
of Tanzenberg near [foreign
words], the British zone of --

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.290
ended up in the British zone
of occupation in Austria.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:44.130
And this was where the ERR had
amassed about half-a-million books

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.330
for their Central Library
of the [foreign word].

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:53.140
The British captured some
of the ERR staff there.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:59.350
And forced them to help sort
the books for restitution.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.570
And books were even returned to
the Soviet Union from Tanzenberg,

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:08.960
including 35,000 books from the
former Russian Imperial Palaces

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.590
outside of Leningrad
including others

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.680
from [foreign words] and Kiev.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.340
Although the Soviets never
admitted that the Americans

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:24.570
or British returned any books or
anything else to the Soviet Union

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.830
after the war, and
that's a whole other story

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:30.980
that I've written about
quite extensively.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:37.030
But the Soviets themselves were
not interested in restitution.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:42.060
The estimated two or more million
volumes that the ERR had collected

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.540 position:56%
from Western and Southeastern Europe
that ended the war in Ratibor,

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.050
Silesia, were not subject
to restitution.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.360 position:56%
They became part of the lost memory
of the Prussianal [assumed spelling]

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.190
and private institutional
libraries from which they had come.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:03.350
The roads to Ratibor for books
plundered from Western Europe

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:09.130 position:56%
and the Balkans intersected with the
roads that brought another million

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.610
or two plundered books
from occupied Soviet lands.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.920
And that fact that
the roads converged

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.410
in the ERR Silesian center
determined their postwar fate.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:27.560 position:56%
The Soviet Union, as I say, did not
participate except very symbolically

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.850
in Western allied cultural
restitution efforts,

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.160
and certainly not from Ratibor.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.890 position:56%
The Germans, it turned out, had
moved most of the books from Ratibor

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:43.760
to two warehouses on the
railroad line, conveniently,

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.770
an industrial suburb
of [foreign word].

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:54.010
I read where it -- that was where
a Red Army Trophy Brigade found 4-

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.250
to 5000 German crates

00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:02.400
in two warehouses containing an
estimated 1.5 million volumes.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.420
And they used that warehouse
as a collecting point

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.010
for additional library materials
that they'd found in Silesia,

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:14.200
many from Belaruse
and Baltic libraries.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.280
And it was those books, in the
millions, indeed, from Belaruse

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:24.270
and the Baltic countries were the
pretext for a shipment to Minsk

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:30.830
in October of 1945,
of 57 freight wagons.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:36.670 position:56%
But that was only three or -- one of
the three or four trophy shipments

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.920
of books from Silesia
and [inaudible]

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.510
to many more from Germany itself.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.520
Those 57 freight wagons,
some people say 54,

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.140
transported 1.2 million books.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.160
Over half of them had, in fact,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.450
been looted from Belaruse
and Baltic libraries.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.870
But the other half
million were looted

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.900
from Western and Southeastern
Europe.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.670
I first reported details
about the full 1945 shipment

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:14.440 position:56%
from [foreign word] to Minsk at a
library conference in Minsk in 2003,

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.640
which was rather of a sensation
because it had all been suppressed,

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.520 position:56%
of course, during the Soviet period.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.920
I had discovered those
details quite by chance,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.610
as often my discoveries
are, in my book on the --

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.570
Turgenev Library from Paris

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.920
because the Turgenev Library
had also been found there.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.720
After the conference with
my ERR seizure list in hand,

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.230
including the one from Kiev,

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:49.440
I was able to identify 90
individual French libraries

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.850
and 10 institutional libraries
with books that had been catalogued

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.580
in the Rare Book Department

00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.930
of what was then the
National Library of Belaruse.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.580
And I think -- this is --

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.290
they've since moved to
this fantastic new building

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:11.070
for their National Library
just on the verge of Minsk.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.190
Those books, including
many autographed volumes

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.950
with illustrious French
private libraries,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.860
today remain in several
different libraries in Minsk.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.940
For example, I learned
about 5000 books

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:30.460
from the most important pre-1939
private library of Julius Genss

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.810
from Estonia of -- it's now in the
Library of the Academy of Science.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:40.560
I even found a few from former
Russian Imperial Libraries seized

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.340
from the Imperial Palaces by
the ERR in suburban Leningrad

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.470
that had not been returned to
the Soviet Union or returned

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:54.310
to their home in Leningrad
during the Soviet Union.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:59.480
I learned that 600 books, in
Armenian, from the Armenian Library

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.600
in Paris had been transferred
to [foreign word]

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:08.870 position:56%
because there was no Armenian censor
in Minsk to approve them for --

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.970
to be catalogued in the library.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.600
Some of the Dutch language
books were transferred

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.370 position:56%
to the Library Foreign Literature in
Moscow because there was no censor

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:23.410
in Minsk who could read Dutch.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:31.590
About half of those that were sent
to Moscow, all right, in 1992,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:37.990
608 Dutch books were returned to
the Foreign Literature Library.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.290
This was after the fall

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.750
of the Soviet Union,
the Russian Federation.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:49.900
They were returned to Amsterdam
in, from Dutch, from Moscow.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.470
But many more of the
thousands of Dutch books remain

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.560
in the capital of Belaruse.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.310
And, coincidentally, the
return to the Netherlands

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:09.280
in 1992 included the
first book returned

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.510
to the Turgenev Library in Paris.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:22.370
Namely Dutch librarians identified
the Turgenev Library stamp

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:29.560 position:56%
in a Dutch language bible which they
passed on to colleagues in Paris.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.860
All right.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:37.700
In 2011 the Belaruse National
Library published a CD Rom,

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:43.020
and I'm not sure if it
came to this meeting.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.760
I was showing it yesterday to
the person who handles Belaruse,

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.590
one of the colleagues
in the division.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:58.770
But this CD Rom is entitled
in -- the title is in Russian,

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:04.320 position:56%
French Autographs in the Holdings
of the National Library of Belaruse.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.060 position:56%
The CD which was published
displays the title pages of 65 books

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.400
from Paris with autograph
dedications

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.230 position:56%
to famous French politicians,
writers, and other cultural leaders,

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.960
with images of those individuals.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.890
Those libraries, they found
individuals of all these people.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.510
For example, the full text of --

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:33.090
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:38.300
-- from Paris, 1933, with a
dedication to the Turgenev Library

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:44.390
by the author and the book
that you saw earlier to --

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:49.750
by Chagall to the Turgenev Library.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.730
To be sure, Belaruse Libraries
are very proud to have

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.150
such a valuable collection
of autographed volumes

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:03.750 position:56%
by such French writers and statesmen
-- Marcel Purse, Luis Vice,

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.640
George Clemenceau, Leon
Bloom, among many others,

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.720
including numerous members
of the Rothschild clan.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.590
I have a lot of pictures
of the title pages

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:18.240
that I photographed
myself in Minsk in 2003.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.740
Unfortunately, however, when
Russia -- when the Soviet Union --

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:31.120
Russia, should I say, after
-- in 1940 -- or after --

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:37.600 position:56%
it was in 1956 when the Russian
Federation joined the European Union

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.000
-- not the European Union,
the European Council of --

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.870
they signed a declaration
with the intent

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:53.740
to send home the trophy possessions
of other European member states.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.880
Obviously, two years later
they passed the law that I --

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.040
we were subject to a conference at
Harvard Law School some years ago.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:09.690
But obviously those
signatures on legal -- of --

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.260
they're not really
legal instruments.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:17.820
They would be soft law as
would be called by the lawyers,

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.200
have not been helped bring
home many of the trophy books

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.520
and still archives in
Russia, let alone Belaruse.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.270
Other books from the private
libraries of Luis Vice

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:36.370
and Leon Bloom and the Rothschild
clan were returned to France

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.600
from OID in Frankfurt
by the U.S. Allies

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.180
or from Tanzenberg by the British.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.350
And some of the personal
archives of Luis Vice

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:53.180
and Leon Bloom were returned from
Moscow to France before -- by 19 --

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.510
by 2002 and then described
and listed in the book,

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.040
<i>Return from Russia </i>that
I think was being passed

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:06.140
around that I prepared with
several Dutch colleagues

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.330
and other European colleagues
who had been involved.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.190
But the books with
dedications to those

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.850
and other prominent French
individuals, some who perished

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.960
in the Holocaust, remain in
Minsk as lost memory for those

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.890
to whom they were dedicated.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:27.890
And now, 70 years later,
lost memory for their heirs.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:33.060
One can only wonder, as I do, about
the moral justice to treat all

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:39.380
such volumes as compensation
for the millions of books lost

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.170
from Belaruse state libraries
in the course of the war.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:51.190
Let me turn now to the [foreign
words], the security main office

00:31:51.190 --> 00:32:00.860
in Berlin where they concentrated
their large collection by 1943.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.250
Many of them were also evacuated.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.910
One large group of Masonic
books were evacuated

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:12.770
to Himmler's favorite Silesian
castle on the [foreign word]

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:18.440
where a Masonic Research Center
continued until January, '44.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.360
Those now -- most of the books
that were there are now in a branch

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.170
of the University of
Poznan Library in one

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:34.100
of the [foreign word] castles,
former [foreign word] castles.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:40.600
And -- not from Poznan
and a microfiche catalog

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.070
of that library has been issued.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:52.010
Following a seminar last fall
in Amsterdam, a Belgian friend

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:58.640 position:56%
and colleague, Michelle Vermont from
Ghent and Martine Perla from Paris,

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.790
and I, are organizing, first,

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:07.150
a workshop in Minsk this
coming September with the help

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:11.750 position:56%
of a Russian Belaruse historian who
was in Paris last summer where I met

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.470 position:56%
and participated in this colloquium.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.910
And the -- Wesley Fisher who
unfortunately couldn't be

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:22.850
with us today, the Research
Director of the Claims Conference,

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.310
is providing funding
for this seminar.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:31.250
And we've just received formal
invitations for Belaruse visas.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:35.830
So I think I'll have to come back
here maybe next year and report

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.290
if we've made any progress
in Belaruse.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.620
But we're not trying to
talk about restitution.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.660
At the moment we're more
interested in identifying books

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.150
and more identifying
particularly because it's come

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:53.940
to light there are a lot of Masonic
archives that remained in Minsk

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.310
in some of the cartons of
books they hadn't opened.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:04.410
But other books remain from
the [foreign words] of --

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:10.430
were evacuated after war or
the last years of the war

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:17.900
to four evacuation castles in
what was then the Sudetenland

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:23.310
and also the concentration camp of
Terezin where they evacuated most

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:27.900
of the Hebraic literature that
they had not been able to catalogue

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:36.780
in Berlin and they forced some of
the illustrious Hebraic scholars

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.630
that were interned in Terezin

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:44.960
to catalog the Hebraic
that they had there.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:53.460
But the castles of --
also in Sudetenland of --

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:59.060
this was the Talmud, what they
called the Talmud Brigade in,

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.320
of Terezin itself.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.820
And I -- but there is also a
catalog in one of the castles.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.950
They were preparing a
catalog of occult --

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.680
books on occult disciplines.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:22.340
This is the year of 1944, in
the height of the fighting,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:27.160
that these people are working
on this occult literature at one

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.800 position:56%
of the castles in -- of Sudetenland,

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.900
the castle of Meemon
[assumed spelling] there.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.260
And you'll see next -- I think
the next slide I have the --

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.130
well, I'll come back
to that in a minute.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.720
Leave up the map.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.520
It's fine for now.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.080
Some of those -- there were a
million books that were spread

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:58.500
between those four castle and
Terezin by the end of the war.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.680
And I first announced about --

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.730
first put together the information
I'd collected about these castles.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:10.230
I've actually visited all of them
and have pictures and an article

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.990
that we -- I think
maybe was passed around.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:21.650
If not, it's a article
that could be quoted.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:24.860
And I pieced together this.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.780
And I first published
it, the article --

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:33.130
made a presentation about
these books, the million books

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:37.040
in the castles at a
conference in Liberetz

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.520
in the Czech Republic in 2007.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.250
I purposely wanted to do
it in the Czech Republic.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:51.920 position:56%
And they actually published my
article in both Czech and in English

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.460
in the catalog proceedings.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:58.390
And I think maybe now in another
office in the division here.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:02.440
But it may be of some
interest to some of you.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:08.290
Some of those books were -- for
the research that I was able to do

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:13.580 position:56%
with the help of some Czech
colleagues, and in German sources --

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:19.580 position:56%
some of the books were returned
immediately after the war to Poland,

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:23.270
France, Netherlands,
and to Germany even.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:28.770
Many hundreds of the Jewish books,
an Hebraic from Telecine had

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.700
to be destroyed when they
were transported to Prague

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.970
because of infectious mold,
that they lacked the facilities

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.120
to control after the war.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.460
But the rest of the Jewish
books that survived remain today

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.550
and are very well catalogued
by the Jewish Museum in Prague

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:53.120
in a database that has been funded
by the Jewish Claims Conference

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.140
with careful identification of
provenance, and they are now --

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:03.030 position:56%
when they finish this catalogue they
are now -- are planning to return --

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:08.490
and there is a Czech law that
allows them to return these books

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:15.760
to the communities or
individuals, in many cases,

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.290
from which the books came.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.640
Some of the books from the
castles were distributed

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.440
to various Czech institutions
after the war.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:31.390
And a local example -- I found,
was shown, a local museum

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:34.690
in [foreign word], if you
still have the map there,

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:43.200
acquired about a hundred books that
had been used for insulation in one

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:53.500
of the castles because they had
no other facilities after the war.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:59.380
But the vast majority that
they found and had not returned

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:04.190
or restituted after the war
went to a massive warehouse

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:09.510
in a chemical center of
[foreign word] which is

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.930 position:56%
about 30 minutes' drive from Prague.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.930
And during the next half
century they became intermixed

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.600
with books confiscated
by the Communist regime

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:28.160
in Czechoslovakia started in 1948
from various museums, monasteries,

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:35.170 position:56%
Masonic lodges, other places that
were -- that the Communist libraries

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:41.070
and museums did not need,
unneeded, during those years.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:44.590
So this warehouse came
to [inaudible]

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.750
and I hadn't known all
the details about this

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:50.530
until really just last year.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:57.360 position:56%
Starting in 2015 the Czech
National Library undertook a project

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:03.480
to catalog these books, and
they received EU funding,

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.050
and it turned out to be
mostly Norwegian funding.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:11.390 position:56%
Norway's not a member of the EU, but
it makes a contribution every year

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:15.270
which is usually used for
some cultural project.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:19.370
And the Norwegian contribution
last year was being used

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:25.870
to catalog these books at the
National Library in Prague

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:32.500
that had been relegated to
the warehouse for 70 years.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.760
The Director of the
project contacted me

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:41.770
because he had seen my article that
was written, that was published

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:46.420
in both Czech and English, and
I actually had been in contact

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.340
with the Deputy Director
of the Library who,

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:54.380
of the National Library, who
confided to me at one meeting

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.720
about 10 years ago
that he had been --

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:03.600 position:56%
in his first job when he came to the
Library was helping move the books

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.740
from the castles in Sudetenland to
this warehouse in [foreign word].

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.720
But he didn't know what they
were or where they'd come

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.870
from or anything about them.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:19.630
Since the -- I think we can have
the next picture if you have --

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:25.900
the Director -- I'm afraid
that may not be very readable,

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.730
but it's just a little
sample of what I would

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.990
like to show about this project.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.830
Last October this Director --

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.890
I hadn't met the Director of the
project at the Czech Library,

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.250
but he had been in touch with me,

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:45.160
because they were then saying
they only had 300,000 books

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.160
in this warehouse.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.220
But he finally agreed to take me
out there when I was going to be

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.140
in Prague last October for
an international conference

00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:01.430
that was sponsored by another
group in the Czech capital.

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:08.080
And he even set up a very formal
workshop where they were going

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.770
to tell me about this project and
tell me where the books came from.

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.850
Well, when they gave me
a few minutes to speak,

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:22.070
I showed them pictures
of this catalog that --

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.710
or some fragments of the
catalog that I'd found

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:31.040
in the [foreign words] in
Berlin of a 400-page --

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:36.750
the whole fragments counted to be
about 400 pages of this catalog

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:43.240
of occult literature that was
being prepared in one of the --

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.040
the castle of Meimon
[assumed spelling].

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:53.600
I -- just before coming to Prague,
I'd given a lecture in Berlin

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.650
at the Central and
Regional Library there.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:43:03.800 position:56%
Over the last few years that library
has developed a marvelous database

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:09.280
for what they call [foreign
words] for looted books

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.730
that they have found probably
8- to 10,000, that they found

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.850
in their library that
had been left in Berlin,

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:20.150
many of them by the
Gestapo or other parts

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.830
of the RSS-SHA [assumed spelling].

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.630
And they have been
returning them to --

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:28.990
trying to identify and
return them to their owners.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:35.600 position:56%
Well, when I was talking to these
librarians I had met actually before

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.920 position:56%
about the project in Prague, I
said, well, let me try to get you --

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.130
if you could come a couple of
days early for the conference,

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:46.780
let me try to get you invited also
to this workshop that they've set

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:51.010
up for me at the National
Library in Prague.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:55.680
And I wrote the Project Director
immediately and he finally agreed.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.950 position:56%
But when we got there I found out --

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:03.410
he refused to take the
Germans with me to the --

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:07.000
see [foreign word],
to this warehouse.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.590
He said, first he said, that
security provisions were

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.050
such that -- hadn't been
arranged far enough in advance,

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:16.860
and that they didn't
have a car big enough.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:23.930
But when we went to get in the car
that was going to take me there,

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:26.910
there was a minivan right
beside it that didn't look

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.180
like it was going anywhere.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:35.410
But this is -- I also took with
me, was able to arrange to take

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:42.190 position:56%
at this workshop a Masonic archivist
and library whom I've known now

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.420
for probably about 10 years.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:51.300
And I had helped him in Moscow
where he, over the past few years,

00:44:51.300 --> 00:45:00.420
has identified 4- to 5000 Masonic,
looted Masonic archival files

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:06.680
from Norwegian Masonic
lodges that are still in --

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:11.070
that were still with the collection
in Moscow in this special archive

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.970
because no one had sorted
them out and they couldn't --

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:19.970
he's been going back and forth and
identified these Norwegian files.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:23.410
And, finally, they now
have a formal claim

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:28.390
in to the Russian government
for these files.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:29.690
But, anyway.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.630
He was going to be at
this conference in Prague

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:35.260
and he's been looking for
Norwegian and other Masonic --

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.500
it's his specialist --
throughout the Masonic world.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:43.550
And I asked him to come also, and
particularly that I told him, well,

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.840
you know, that the funding for
this project is from Norway.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.300
And so he very quickly looked
in to find out what was going

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.610
on because he hadn't known
about the Norwegian sponsorship

00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:01.290
for this identification
project in Prague.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.590
But in any case --

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:03.890
&gt;&gt; Ma'am, just one second.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.190
Just five more minutes.

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:06.490
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy
Grimsted: Okay, yeah.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.500
I'm just down to the end.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, very good, very good.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:12.520
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy Grimsted:
Thank you for [laughter] checking.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.470
I've been adlibbing a
little too much in here.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:21.060
But, in any case, I -- what I --
at this workshop I showed them more

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.550
of these [inaudible] because
I had a lot of the fragments,

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.190
and he was saying, well, why
didn't you get -- bring his --

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:28.490
can't you give us copies?

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:32.200
I said, I'm sorry, the
[foreign words] charges a lot

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.810
of money to copy 400 pages.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:39.570
And besides, they wouldn't
allow me to give them

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.980
to you, a national institution.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.170
You have to ask them yourself.

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:49.080
In any case, the National
Library finished this project.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:53.110
And you can go on to the
-- yeah, you have it here.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:57.400
It finished this project
that they were doing.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.990
I, incidentally, got into a
large argument on the drive

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.170
out to [foreign words]
with this Project Director

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:08.000
who told me he does not
believe in restitution.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.890
But the Norwegian colleague
-- they did bring us --

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:18.650 position:56%
they did let us visit the processing
center at their cataloging depot

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:23.370
out -- it's just outside of Prague
where they had brought 7000 books

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:26.520
that were identified
as belonging to --

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:32.360
of individual Freemasons and
anti-Masonic individuals, lodges,

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:37.370
or Masonic libraries, from
-- most of them are German,

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:41.900
but some are from French --
the Benelux countries, Austria,

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.630
Hungary, and Czech Masonic books.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:52.400
The Czech Project Director then was
already announcing no repatriation

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.430
will take place.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:58.020
But when the results of his
trial project were presented

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:06.610
in Prague a month ago my Norwegian
colleague went to the presentation

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:14.600
and he -- it was reported back and
they have now posted this website

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:22.500
on the National Library website
in Prague about the project.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:27.450
But it's a little -- not quite the
story that I was talking about,

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:31.170
the project, and it says
nothing about the foreign books

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:35.780
that were being catalogued in
the castles in the Sudetenland.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:41.080
And it mentions my name, but not
my article that I wrote about them.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.660 position:56%
The day after our meetings at the
National Library I took my German --

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.900
I was able also to arrange for my
German and Norwegian friends --

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.730
we visited the Jewish
Museum in Prague

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:56.970
where the librarian showed us
a marvelous ongoing project

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:02.240
to identify former owners of
the Jewish books that had come

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.220
from these castles in Terezin.

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:14.640 position:56%
But, to conclude, this morning, just
before I came into the room here

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.340
for the talk, I received
another email

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:26.070
from my Norwegian Masonic archivist
friend, and he had just found

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:32.360
for me a picture of the castle
of Meemon that I didn't --

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.540
I went to try to see it myself,
but it was destroyed in 1984

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:42.510
by the Czechs because they
said it was going to burn down.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:44.900 position:56%
I don't know what the problems were.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.200
But anyway, he sent me some --

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.470
a photograph that was taken
just before the destruction,

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:56.000 position:56%
and also photographs of some of the
foreign books that we had been shown

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.230
at this Czech library center in
[foreign word] with ex-libris

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.500
and book markings that
he was helping them --

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.810
that he had identified just --

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:10.100
we only had about 40 books
there -- from Masonic lodges.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:15.440 position:56%
And he could tell almost immediately
which lodge these were from.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:21.480
And earlier he had told me that
they had a presentation in Norway

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.610 position:56%
about the project about a month ago.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.690
And the Norwegians have
now refused further funding

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:34.080
to continue the project with
the current Project Director.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:39.740
And in his message this morning,
[foreign words] wrote me,

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:45.490
"To conclude, the project has
ended without any real conclusion.

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:49.010
None of the chosen
13,000 books have been,"

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.730
that they've already catalogued,
"have been catalogued properly."

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:56.480
And until that has been done
for the whole consignment,

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.270
there's really not much of a
conclusion that can be made."

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:07.850
So, I conclude with that sad note
from Norway, and I'll just --

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:12.630
could remark that I guess I'll have
to come back again in another year

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:18.500
to report about our seminar
in Minsk next September,

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:25.810 position:56%
and possibly another visit to Prague
to see if they've made any progress.

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:30.670
But then, at least, I don't need to
get a visa for the Czech Republic.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:34.570
And I do have some other
friends there that will be glad

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:37.730
to see me even if the
library may not be.

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:39.530
Thank you.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:44.290
[ Applause ]

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:47.910
&gt;&gt; I have a question about the last
point that you made when you said

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:50.880
that your Norwegian friend
had sent you the message

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:56.130
about the project being stopped
because the books that were

00:51:56.130 --> 00:52:00.120
to have been catalogued were
not being catalogued properly.

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.110
What was the expectation?

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.620
How did they expect
the, if you know,

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.900
how did they expect the
books to be catalogued?

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.980
And in what manner were they
not being catalogued properly?

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.120
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy Grimsted: I
don't want to get too technical

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.400
with this, and I myself am not
a technical library cataloguer.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.670 position:56%
But if you come the systems, they
-- database systems, they were using

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:29.430
in the National Library with
the system they were using

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:35.390
in the Jewish Museum in Prague,
you'll see the difference.

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:38.420
They were trying to
register these books.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:45.480
They had no facility to show the
book markings and the ex-libris

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.710
that were in the books
in the catalog.

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.650
Whereas in the Jewish Museum,
they've developed that [inaudible].

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:56.400
They had no fields that they
were filling in for the fact

00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.480 position:56%
that books had the markings and
what markings those might have been.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:06.980 position:56%
It was a project to try to get, just
to get the name and title the way,

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.880
a very preliminary
cataloguing basis.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:15.360
They have the facilities at the
National Library because I know

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.040
that they catalogued and have

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:25.850
on their website the
early Hebrew manuscripts

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:33.270 position:56%
from the Breslow Rabbinical Seminary
that were found there 10 years ago.

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:36.910
They have the facilities
to catalog them properly.

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:38.660
But this man, this head of --

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:44.230
as I say, I had a bit of a in
with him, or an out with him.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:49.110
But he did send me the
website that I could --

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:54.820
the URL so I could see his
website which is in English.

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.460 position:56%
And if you see that, you'll see the
way they're presenting this project.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.180
They're mainly interested

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.320
in the bohemeka [assumed
spelling] that's there,

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.670
the books from Bohemia.

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:10.980
But the foreign ones, they'll
try different -- forget the --

00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:16.130
my Norwegian friend [inaudible]
wrote me at one point,

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:18.460 position:56%
this I have not confirmed, and so --

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:22.890
but it's apparent because if you'll
see one of the things on the --

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:28.450
one of the -- at the
top of the website it --

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:32.140
I think there's something for
the legal -- oh, no, it's not.

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:36.010
Later, if you go down another
step, there's something also,

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:40.650
a legal document that has
been translated into English.

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:45.420
And, apparently, what he said
that the library has used some

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:51.440
of the project funding, which is
why they're not being catalogued

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:59.740
properly, for a legal study
to see how the legal basis

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:04.070
that the National Library
can nationalize these books.

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:09.480
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.710
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Okay, well, Pat
gave us a lot of information there.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.010
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy
Grimsted: I should --

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:17.060
many of [inaudible]
but I can just say

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:21.640
that I hope I can come
back maybe another time,

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:26.780
and I can tell you a little bit
more about how things are going

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:33.660
in the right -- because what's
[inaudible] these are books,

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:37.360
the books that are being found,
they're not many, maybe not many

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:44.090 position:56%
of them that still remain from the
occult sciences [inaudible] for yoga

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:52.330
and astrology and what,
whatever that are being found.

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:56.590
But it's very curious when I
saw lists in Paris of the books

00:55:56.590 --> 00:56:03.470
that had been returned to France
in 1948 from Prague and they --

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:04.770
the French had lists

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.920
in the restitution
records of books returned.

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:12.550
There were a lot of -- many of
them were from occult [inaudible],

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:18.640
the ones that the SD had apparently
taken from French collections

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:22.750
that were about occult sciences.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:26.640
This also is a -- and
there was a project in one

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.710
of the other councils
-- I think I really need

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.400 position:56%
to republish this article that I did

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.600
for the Czech conference
with an update now.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.280
And I am hoping to turn some
of my findings into a book

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:45.830
about the lost libraries that
will have some of these details

00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:48.860
that have not, simply
not been known.

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.450
But I also think that the
issue at the National Library

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:55.170
in the Czech Republic
and I think my --

00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:58.220
the Norwegian colleagues
are going to start this.

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:00.160
I think it's something
that should be brought

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.440
to the attention of [inaudible].

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:06.680
It's one thing in Minsk
because Belaruse is not a member

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.980
of -- maybe they are a member.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.980
Probably are a member of IFLA.

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:13.730
But that's the International
Federation of Library Associations,

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:17.690
the International [inaudible]
of Library Association.

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:21.430
And there have been a very
strong movement in IFLA

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:29.710
about identifying books that
are displaced in foreign --

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:34.650
I mean particularly the valuable
ones and these autographs.

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:36.960
And so I think that there may --

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.310
that it should be brought
to the attention.

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:42.450
And I hope some of the people
here at the National --

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:48.950
our National Library, the
Library of Congress, will all --

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:54.750
may also want to take notice
about these types of problems

00:57:54.750 --> 00:58:00.540
because it's a -- they're
talking about major collections,

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:05.650 position:56%
particularly a more major collection
in Minsk than is the case in Prague.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:08.940
I'm afraid that a lot of the
people aren't going to go

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.520
after the witchcraft books.

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:16.640
I even had a email
last week from a woman

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.520
who runs a witchcraft
newsletter [laughter] just

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.310
because she'd heard there
was 7000 books they found

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:29.230
on witchcraft in one
of these things.

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:33.590
And I assured her, I said, I
think that this is a blowup

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:38.480
that someone wants to criticize
the project from other directions

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.430
to say that there [laughter].

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:43.690
But, anyway, that says it.

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:46.790
&gt;&gt; I was just going to say that
those of us who are bibliophiles,

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.840
and I must -- most of us in
this room I think are, you know,

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.760
value our book as a book if the
binding, the smell, the print,

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.750
and so forth -- but it
seems to me in an age

00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:03.680
when we're going towards
digitization the most important

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.300
thing -- it may not be the book
itself, many of which are 70

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.100
or more years old and are
probably deteriorating,

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:12.450
but it may be the information
in them.

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:15.160
And I was going to ask
Pat, how much of this --

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.970
you all these books are
in the Minsk Library.

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:22.080
Is the information in these
books somehow available,

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.090
maybe in a digital form?

00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:27.070
Or do you have to go to
Prague and go to the library

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:29.640
and actually look at the book?

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.940
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy Grimsted: Well,

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.980
thank you for raising
that question, Jim.

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:36.610
This is very important.

00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:45.780
A Belaruse colleague whom I first
met in 2003, when I was in Minsk.

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:49.720
He's now, I think, close to 90.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:56.060
He had been the Belaruse
SSR, the Soviet Republic

00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.910
of Belaruse UNESCO
Representative in Paris in,

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:04.040
I think he said the
late '50s or '60s.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:10.230
And he just said -- told me, he
said, you know, it was very sad

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:17.820
for me when I met the widow of
Leon Bloom or the Luis Vise,

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.780
who was a leading feminist,
journalist, in France,

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:25.310
that I couldn't return
or even tell them

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:27.760
that they're books were in Minsk.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.770 position:56%
He has written some lovely articles,

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.310
most of them are in
Russian or Belaruse.

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:40.020
There are a couple in English that
I cite in my article about some

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.040
of the relations to the --

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:48.470
the archival, personal archival
information that's in those books.

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:53.130
Because these are books with
very famous French autographs

01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:56.930
of leading statesmen
and [inaudible].

01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:02.630
And he's done a beautiful job
of showing the dedications,

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:11.260 position:56%
in some cases to people who perished
in [foreign word] or Auschwitz.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.400
He's done the research on it.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.560
He was a rector of the School
of Linguistics in Prague,

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.240
a specialist from French
language and literature.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.310
And he's particularly
researched these books.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:32.510
And last summer in Paris I met
one and I think that this --

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:35.470
the young historian,
the Belaruse historian,

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.850
who now is helping arrange
our seminar in Minsk,

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:42.300
was a student of his because
he spoke very good French.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:46.560
And I think it was his
first trip outside Belaruse.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:52.690
But he was on a stipend that a
Paris friend of mine had arranged,

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:56.870
and he gave a lecture at
the Institute of France

01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:04.010
about the anti-Dreyfus documents
and manuscripts of several

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:10.500 position:56%
of the leaders, Jewish leaders, that
were -- about the Dreyfus affair,

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.990 position:56%
because these were books the Nazis
obviously had been trying to capture

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:18.110
from Joseph Reinach and
his family in Paris.

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:22.490
And so this is the kind of
information that is there.

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:27.290
And these were manuscripts from
Joseph Reinach that were --

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:29.750
had never been catalogued
before in --

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:33.480
but Minsk and because
no one wanted them

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.080
or they were all suppressed
during the Soviet period.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.670
And he's writing a
doctoral dissertation

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:43.300
about the Masonic manuscripts
that are there.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.000
And it turns out that
they are fragments

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:56.320
of the same Masonic archives that
were returned from Moscow to Paris

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:03.640
by the year 2000 because archives
that were found in Minsk all had

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:08.400
to be sent to Moscow after the
war, but not all the books.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.110
And so they were all collected
in this central repository

01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:17.620
for the special archive
that I described

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.800
in this book, <i>Return from Russia </i>.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.560
And so these are the
types of materials that --

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:29.960
he's written some lovely -- I just
heard that he is still able to come

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:36.300
and that he's agreed to come to our
seminar next September in Minsk.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.390
We're just keeping it very small,
a mission, that we're trying to --

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:44.050
and I hope to meet him again.

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:47.550
But he has a card file
if sine if the books

01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:53.020
that he found particularly
important for the dedications,

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:57.590
for the interpersonal relations
that they show in these dedications

01:03:57.590 --> 01:04:00.220
in the books, let alone
the books themselves.

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:04.320
I mean, some of these are
from bibliophile collections

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.330
of the Rothschild's
from the 18th century.

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:12.160
I mean they're -- the rare book
department that I had the catalog,

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.730
the only books from rare books,

01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:20.080
and what are these
books needed in Minsk.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.380
There's no one.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:22.790
I think this young man that we met

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:26.690
in Paris last summer is
probably the first to --

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:30.780
who even identified
some of the manuscripts,

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:35.460
a collection of Masonic,
of Napoleonic manuscripts,

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:41.300
I think to Napoleonic period,
that are with these materials.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.600
Sorry.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.000
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: It's time for
[inaudible] cruel time management.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.300
&gt;&gt; Patricia Kennedy Grimsted: Yes.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.600
Okay [laughter].

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.900
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: I have to step in.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.200
So thank you all for coming.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.940
Please help me --

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.370
[ Applause ]

01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:58.030

of the Library of Congress.
