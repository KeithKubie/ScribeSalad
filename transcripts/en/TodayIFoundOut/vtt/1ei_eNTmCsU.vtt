00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.559
There are generally three things everyone
knows about Garfield- it’s all about a cat

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.660
that hates Mondays, loves lasagna, and that
it’s not really that funny.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.480
While the latter point may seem subjective,
according to Garfield creator Jim Davis, the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.280
point of Garfield was never for the comic
to be hilariously funny, but rather be relatable

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.350
and, with that accomplished, serve as a vehicle
to sell Garfield merchandise.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.740
As Davis himself stated in a 1982 interview
with the Washington Post, Garfield was nothing

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.649
more than “a conscious effort to come up
with a good, marketable character.”

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.820
As to why he chose an animal, well, to quote
him again, “Snoopy is very popular in licensing.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.670
Charlie Brown is not.”

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.720
The genesis of Garfield can be traced back
to a failed comic strip Davis created in the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.590
early 1970s named Gnorm Gnat which centred
around the various misadventures of a bunch

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.539
of anthropomorphic insects…

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.700
By 1977 Davis was getting nowhere with the
comic.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.890
He simply couldn’t understand why nobody
else found gnats as funny as him- and yes,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.320
unlike Garfield, Gnorm Gnat was supposed to
be very funny.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.990
For almost five years he had been printing
the gag-a-day comic in a small Indiana town

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.560
newspaper called the Pendleton Times.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.930
The comic, as noted, featured a collection
of sarcastic bugs, like the title character

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.110
Gnorm Gnat, a fruit fly with two weeks to
live, a dumb dense slug, and an intellectual

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.820
worm named Dr. Rosenwurm.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.989
Looking for a bigger audience and a larger
payday, Davis continually attempted to get

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.549
the comic syndicated in newspapers across
the country, but rejection after rejection

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.580
kept coming back.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.280
“I got so many rejection slips, I could
have papered my bedroom wall with them,”

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.200
Davis told the Los Angeles Times in 2001.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.580
Finally an editor who rejected the comic gave
him some frank criticism, “Your art is good,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.680
your gags are great, but bugs—nobody can
relate to bugs!”

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680
This sealed the bug’s fate.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.020
Shortly thereafter he had Gnorm Gnat unceremoniously
disposed of by a foot, and ceased making the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.020
comic.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.110
Now, it was time for Davis to come up with
a new comic strip- one that he hoped would

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.260
be universally relatable.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Described as someone with “the soul of an
ad-man” who cut his teeth in an advertising

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.200
agency before trying his hand at comics, Davis
studied the popular syndicated comic strips

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.490
of the day to see if he could spot a common
thread between them.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.560
During his research, he noticed that comic
strips about or starring dogs, like Peanuts

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.140
and Marmaduke, were especially popular.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.420
This, of course, makes sense because dogs
have literally been bred for centuries to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.420
be what humans consider awesome.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.850
At the same time, Davis noticed that nobody
had yet created a popular comic about a cat,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.310
which he saw as being a huge gap in the market.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.290
After all, a not inconsiderable percentage
of the population prefers cats to dogs, or

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.290
loves both.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.419
He stated, “I felt that, if dog lovers like
dog strips, surely cat lovers would like to

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.010
see a cat out there.”

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.859
Davis also grew up on a farm in Indiana with
a couple dozen cats, so he was familiar with

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.400
their distinctive behaviors, both domesticated
ones and feral, such as their stereotypical

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400
laziness.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.820
He also used elements of himself and his grandfather
as inspiration for the character.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.120
Much like his grandfather, Garfield was large
and grumpy.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.200
Like himself, the cat loved lasagna.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.530
And in homage to his grandfather, James Garfield
Davis, he named the cat after him.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.930
(Yes, contrary to popular belief, Garfield
was not named after U.S. President James Garfield.)

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.510
With the character and his personality more
or less set, Davis came up with, as Chris

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.120
Suellentrop from Slate so eloquently put it,
“a stable of recurring, repetitive jokes

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.620
for the cat”, that he could recycle endlessly,
allowing him to churn out Garfield comics

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.201
with as little effort as possible, which is
amazingly fitting if you think about it.

00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:40.070
It’s at this point that we should also point
out another advantage to having an animal

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.551
as the main character is that animals could
get away with more jokes and not worry so

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.110
much about being politically correct.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.980
“By virtue of being a cat, Garfield’s
not black, white, male or female, young, or

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.850
old or a particular nationality,” Davis
told the Washington Post in 1981.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.890
“He’s not going to step on anyone’s
feet if these thoughts are coming from an

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.890
animal.”

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.790
That said, Davis also very deliberately avoided
political or social commentary in Garfield

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.970
strips, both to ensure they were as inoffensive
as possible and also so that it would appeal

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.290
to the broadest audience both in the present
and over time.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.140
He sagely noted in a Mental_Floss interview
concerning this, “I purposely avoided sociopolitical

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.140
comment…

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.230
30 years from now, people wouldn’t understand
it…

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.800
It’s more important to have a body of work
resonate with the reader than it is to have

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.320
an individual gag [resonate].”

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.690
Davis also went out of his way to make sure
the cat’s appeal crossed borders.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.330
As he said in 1982 interview,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.150
Garfield is an international character.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.950
Therefore, I don’t even use seasons.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.530
The only holiday I recognize is Christmas.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.240
I don’t use rhyming gags, plays on words,
colloquialisms, in an effort to make Garfield

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.510
apply to virtually any society where he may
appear…

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.230
I would like for readers in Sydney, Australia
to think that Garfield lives next door.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.030
Dealing with eating and sleeping, being a
cat, Garfield is very universal.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.200
By virtue of being a cat, really, he’s not
really male or female or any particular race

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.030
or nationality, young or old.”

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.940
Going back to the marketing side of things,
Davis once again drew inspiration from Peanuts

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.970
noting in an anniversary compendium of Garfield
strips that he saw the commercialisation of

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.140
Snoopy in particular as, to quote, “a template
that I could apply to Garfield”.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.410
And this wasn’t just for the animal appeal,
but also because, as he told the Chicago Sun-Times,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.720
“After 50 years, Snoopy was still laying
in that dog house, and rather than getting

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.410
old, it actually has the opposite effect.”

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.700
In other words, the Snoopy template allowed
for continuing the same old gags over and

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.800
over and over again with people still loving
it, and buying the merchandise, eventually

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.800
if nothing else but for nostalgia’s sake.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.280
The scheme worked.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.500
In June of 1978 Garfield found its way into
some 40 newspapers.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.650
Less than two years later it could be found
across the world in over 800.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:07.010
By late 1982, four and half years after the
debut, it was in a whopping 1,400 newspapers.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:13.080
Fast forward a few decades and even in 2013
with the downfall of many newspapers world-wide,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.530
Garfield still showed up in over 2,500 newspapers
and journals.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.860
In fact, Garfield currently holds a Guinness
World Record for being the most widely syndicated

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.500
comic strip in history.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.990
Using this platform of the most read comic
in the world, Davis was able to easily execute

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:35.580
stage two of his, quite frankly, genius plan-
merchandising.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.550
Unlike the creator of Calvin and Hobbes, Bill
Watterson, who famously not only passed up,

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.900
but fought vehemently against merchandising
Calvin and Hobbes beyond the comic material

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.870
itself (and, note, this includes the near
ubiquitous and completely unauthorized “Calvin

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.840
peeing” stickers which Watterson joked of,
“long after the strip is forgotten, those

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.820
decals are my ticket to immortality”), Davis
had no qualms about leveraging his ingenious

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.050
creation to squeeze every dime possible out
of it.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.840
That said, in all merchandising and licensing
opportunities, he does strongly consider how

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.370
something might harm the brand, whether because
of poor association or simply oversaturation

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.889
to the point of people getting sick of Garfield.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:21.700
For example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s
Garfield suction cup plush toys became hugely

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.590
successful to the point of almost achieving
fad status.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.860
He stated of this crisis, “We accepted the
royalty checks, but my biggest fear was overexposure.”

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.620
In it for the long term, to solve the problem,
“We pulled all plush dolls off the shelves

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.620
for five years.”

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.860
But the plush dolls weren’t the only place
money was pouring in from.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.430
In fact, even in the early days of the comic’s
popularity, Davis admitted to only spending

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.541
a little over a dozen hours a week working
on the comic itself, with another 60 or so

00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:53.899
hours spent coming up with and managing merchandising
and licensing deals and ideas.

00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:58.400
This includes everything from your standard
books (which by the way at one point saw Garfield

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.110
with 7 such books on the New York Times Bestseller
List at the same time), cartoon specials,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.480
lunch boxes and stuffed animals, to Garfield
slot machines in Las Vegas, toilet seat covers,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.650
a Garfield Restaurant, and even educational
material, with Garfield licensed in some regions

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.670
for use in textbooks teaching children English.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.050
You might at this point be wondering how much
Davis has made from Garfield given its success

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.710
both as a comic on its own merits and the
behemoth that is the merchandising side of

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.710
the business.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.610
Well, nobody knows for sure but Davis and
presumably the IRS.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:33.630
That said, it is known that sales of Garfield
merchandise grosses in the ballpark of billion

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:39.390
dollars- yes billion- every single year world-wide,
even today.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.520
So we guess you kind of have to hand it to
Davis- not only did he achieve his goal of

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.060
creating an enjoyable comic for the masses,
but also has masterfully run the business

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:54.650
side of things, making him probably the most
successful comic creator in history on both

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.080
fronts, with no end in sight.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.090
Yes, unlike so many other comic artists over
the years who’ve famously very abruptly

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.380
ended their strips when their bank accounts
were large enough and they felt they’d hit

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.960
a creative roadblock, Davis stated he has
no such intention.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.120
However, to save time and risk of burnout,
he’s long since stopped drawing the cartoons

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.300
himself, usually leaving that to employees
of his rather large company.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.550
As for running out of ideas, well, the comic
was designed to be repetitive as a positive

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.550
feature of it.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.890
He further notes, “I’ve never worried
that I would run out of material because I’ve

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.200
never written the material.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.500
I just watch Garfield.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.420
I put him in my head like a TV screen and
watch him.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.850
I ask what he would do, what he would say.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.160
It’s almost like a working meditation.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.310
I just edit the material.”

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.580
That said, in more recent times, Davis has
also leveraged a subset of his many dozens

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.520
of employees to generate rough ideas for future
comics.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.339
Of this process, he notes, “I see gags and
I work with assistants on the strip and stuff

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:51.339
like that.

00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:54.630
We do roughs and it all filters through me
so that it has one voice.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.630
We all get together occasionally in the same
room and draw and work on shapes of fingers

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.550
and gestures and expressions and things like
that so that if any one of us draws it, you

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.950
can’t tell which one did it.”

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.670
In the end, Davis summed up his rather impressive
life’s work (both in the entertaining comic

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:14.500
he created and the amazing business acumen
demonstrated in its creation and growth over

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.100
time), “I think part of the appeal is, you
know, like with Peanuts, you always want to

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.500
go back to see Snoopy on the doghouse.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.550
In such a changing world, [readers] want to
know that some things stay the same, so I

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:31.950
feel a responsibility to keep Garfield loving
lasagna and hating Mondays; he’s never going

00:11:31.950 --> 00:12:31.899
to go

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:44.410
on 
a diet.”

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:56.070
Speaking of the Garfield suction cup dolls
that have made many millions of dollars over

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.030
the years for Davis, it turns out these were
an accident of sorts.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.760
“I designed the first Stuck on You doll
with Velcro on the paws, thinking that people

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.920
would stick it on curtains.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.540
It came back as a mistake with suction cups.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.490
They didn’t understand the directions.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:15.390
So I stuck it on a window and said, ‘If
it’s still there in two days, we’ll approve

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.390
this.’

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.740
Well, they were good suction cups and we released
it like that.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.820
It never occurred to me that people would
put them on cars.”

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.400
Not just being initially inspired by Charles
Schulz’ Snoopy, Davis also noted Schulz

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.010
gave him an invaluable piece of advice at
one point.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.899
According to Davis in a Mental_Floss interview,
“[Schulz] was instrumental in getting Garfield

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.930
to stand up and walk on two feet for the first
time.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.630
I was working on Garfield’s first special
at Bill Melendez’s studio in L.A., and Sparky

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.660
[Schulz] was in the next room working on one
of his specials.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.430
I wanted Garfield to get up and dance through
the opening credits, and…he looked terrible

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.430
standing up.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.070
He just didn’t look natural.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.110
Sparky asked me how it was going, and I said,
“Not so well.”

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.130
I was doing the layout drawings, and I said,
“Look at him.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.140
Garfield, he looks awkward.”

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.440
He said, “That’s because you gave him
these little cat feet.”

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.681
He told me what he did with Snoopy’s.

00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:10.990
Snoopy used to walk on little dog feet, “and
when I stood him up, I made his hind feet

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.779
really big like human feet, and it looked
natural.”

00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:17.700
He said, “Here, do this,” and he took
my pencil and drew over the top of my drawing

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.950
with these big feet like he has today.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.430
He said, “So there!

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.540
Now he’s standing.”

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.019
I go, “That’s it!”

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:25.019
I was blown away.

00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:27.760
Here was Charles Schulz drawing on my drawing.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.649
When Garfield got the big back feet, then
he could walk.”

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:36.470
Not just about the money for himself, Davis
also is noted for being great on collaborations

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.230
and apparently a really cool guy.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.800
For example, we have the case of the web comic
Garfield Minus Garfield, where Davis stated,

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.620
“It was kind of funny—we called Dan, and
the second we identified ourselves, he said,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.620
‘I’m so sorry.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.459
You want me to cease and desist, right?’

00:14:49.459 --> 00:15:04.410
We said, ‘No, we want to collaborate on
a book with you.'”
