ARUN NAGARAJAN: Hello, and
welcome to Google Developers

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.110
Live.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.030
This is Google Apps Unscripted.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.660
And my name's Arun Nagarajan.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.220
ERIC KOLEDA: And
I'm Eric Koleda.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.409
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.450
We're live from New York.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.160
And it's actually
one of the earliest

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.680
we've had our Google
Developers Live episode.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.680
And it feels pretty early here.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.140
Hopefully the folks
in Europe and Asia,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.940
you can finally watch
it without having

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.049
to wake up in the
middle of the night.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.740
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, we're trying
to accommodate all people

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.195
from all parts and
all time zones.

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:36.570
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Excellent, and so

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.569
the folks that are not
familiar with the series,

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:40.660
this is our monthly
series that we run,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.130
where we walk through
our most recent launches,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.030
talk about some of the recent
news in the app script world,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.420
and most importantly
take your questions.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.900
So we have a Google
Moderator page

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.310
where you can post
your questions

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.460
and vote up on other questions
that people have already asked.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.700
And we highly encourage
you to engage with us

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.340
in that mechanism, a great way
for you to ask us questions,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.890
put us on the spot, and try to
get the answers that you want.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.580
But it's also really important
that if there's already

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.065
question that's there,
please vote up on those.

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:13.940
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, and
you can join live too.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.590
Let's not forget.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.350
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.990
ERIC KOLEDA: The live part
of Google Developers Live

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.820
is there.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.060
You can join if you go to the
Events page that hosts this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.920
on developers.google.com/live,
find this event.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.480
You can click to
join a live hang out

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.814
where later on in the episode,
you can ask us questions,

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:32.188
just like you would in the
moderator, but with a bit more

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:33.022
back and forth.

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:34.480
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Precisely, exactly.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.520
So we have a few
interesting launches

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.960
that we want to
talk about first.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.550
And then we'll go into that the
Hangout and answer questions

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.097
as well.

00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:43.680
The very first one is something
that I'm pretty excited about.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.620
I've been working on
this for a few weeks now.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.360
This is the Google
plug-in for Eclipse

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.380
support for Apps
Script, so the ability

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.980
to bring in your
Apps Script code

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.060
into the Google
plug-in for Eclipse,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.710
that we've had out for a while.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.490
The version of the
plug-in, I believe,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.710
is 3.4, if I remember
exactly right.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.330
And you'll be able to add
in an Apps Script project

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.370
and have multiple
projects in a workspace.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.870
So if you can go to the computer
and take a look at the blog

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.750
posts, we talked about there.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.210
We show you a few screenshots
of what this may look like.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.340
And the whole idea
is that you're

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.930
able to bring your Apps
Script projects down

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.950
into your local file
system and edit it locally.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.070
If you're someone that taking
a train to work every day

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.320
and you want to get that
extra 30 minutes of work done

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.152
on Apps Script, you
can do that now.

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:31.610
Now we have
auto-complete built in.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.670
I know, Eric, that's you.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.755
ERIC KOLEDA: That's me.

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:36.255
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And
in fact, we were

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:39.700
speaking with a few folks that
really enjoyed doing that.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.010
And doing the testing
process, we actually

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.530
made some fixes to
improve the performance

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.370
in offline scenarios in
the disconnected state.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.756
So that's why I bring
that up explicitly.

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:51.880
But the process is actually
really straightforward.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.090
So if you already have
an Eclipse installation,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.830
we recommend that you have the
JavaScript development tools.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.170
But from there on, it's really
a straightforward process

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.270
to just go to the
Install New Software

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.780
and be able to pull down
the plug-in, the new version

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.810
of that.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.414
Did I get the right version?

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:11.080
ERIC KOLEDA: I doesn't
list the version.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It
doesn't list the version.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.285
So maybe in the documentation
page you'll see it.

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:15.660
But it's really
straight-forward.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.010
The great thing about this is
that it's built on the same API

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.400
that we released I think
a couple months ago,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.780
the import/export API.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.240
So this is the API
that allows you

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.290
to get at the source code
of your Apps Script projects

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.720
through the Drive API.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.170
So it's a great way
for us to give you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.196
tools using the API that
you already opened up.

00:03:34.196 --> 00:03:35.820
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah,
that's really great.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.100
And I mean the thing
is, this is kind

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.962
of one implementation
on top of the API.

00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:41.170
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.750
ERIC KOLEDA: Now that doesn't
stop if someone else wants

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.375
to build their own
Eclipse integration,

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:47.040
or integration with a different
text editor of some kind,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.100
or IDE.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.920
You can use the same
functionality that we have.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.610
There's no magic in
what we've built.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.880
And you can go build your own.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.088
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:03:55.088 --> 00:03:56.840
And in fact, a
couple of ISVs have.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.630
One of them is called
the Edity, that's

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.790
by company name
Floreysoft, I believe.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.260
And they've done
a really good job.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.177
So if we can take a look
at the computer here.

00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:07.260
They've done a really good
job of building a tool.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.890
And there's the
Plus post where they

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.900
talk about this launch, where
the Apps Script code comes

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.010
into another
browser-based editor.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.700
And if there are things about
that editor that you like,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.890
maybe integrate with
the other web projects.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.110
Maybe it's something that you
prefer the color schemes of.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.110
You can go ahead and build
your Apps Script apps

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.100
through this new editor, Edity,
I believe it's pronounced.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.610
And there it is on the screen.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.240
And there's yet another
one called a Neutron Drive.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.520
And they've also added
in Apps Script support.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.530
And this is based
on the Drive API

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.630
that I mentioned as
well-- and again,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.130
really straightforward to bring
in your Apps Script projects

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.590
from your Drive into other
editors, Eclipse plus these two

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.250
others that we mentioned.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.630
And we encourage you to
go off and try these out.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.520
But also if there are specific
capabilities that are not

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.437
met by these tools, all
the documentation is there.

00:04:56.437 --> 00:04:58.645
So you should be able to
feel free to build your own.

00:04:58.645 --> 00:04:59.430
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.721
So definitely something else
we're looking for feedback

00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:04.305
specifically around Eclipse
as well as import/export

00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:05.636
is is there more you need?

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:07.010
So there's some
known limitations

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.700
about the Eclipse
integration today.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.670
You can edit code.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.540
That means like download, make
modifications, and save it back

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.490
to the web.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.531
But today, it is limited
where you can't actually

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:18.005
do a run through Eclipse,
or look at the logs,

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:19.400
or do debugging.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.800
So we know that there are some
important functionality that's

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.610
still missing.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.989
So start using these different
types of integrations and see,

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:26.530
does it meet your
needs how they are?

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.220
Is there more that
we need to do?

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.700
And is there actually more value
in having these other editors

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.670
built into our system?

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.130
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.440
That's right.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.356
And one of the things
that I know I miss a lot

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:39.930
is the ability to not get at
your container bound scripts.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.800
Today the Drive API
only exposes the scripts

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.600
at the top level,
so the ones that you

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.589
author from script.google.com.

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.630
I know I personally would
like to see that fixed.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.430
So we're always pushing
for those improvements.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.040
But yes, so certainly
take a look at these.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.380
I think it's a great
way to do things

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.880
like source control integration.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.010
So if nothing else,
the Eclipse integration

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.220
allows you to replicate
the scripts locally.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.840
And you can tie it into Git or
other version control systems

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.430
that you may have in order to
work with back end integrations

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.020
that you may already have
for builds and all the things

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.756
that you do.

00:06:14.756 --> 00:06:16.206
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, very good.

00:06:16.206 --> 00:06:18.330
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So Eric,
there's another big launch

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.420
that we had recently.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.336
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, another
one of our launches

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:24.470
was around Form App which
is our service within Apps

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.140
Script allows you to retrieve
and modify your Google Forms.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.820
Now this is tying into
the form editing process,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.369
not the form
filling out process.

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:36.410
And what we did is there's
a couple features that

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.950
launched in the actual Google
Forms product that didn't quite

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.660
make it into our
service on day one.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.937
And so now we have
those available to you.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.520
And so you can see
here what they are.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.960
One of them is the
ability to embed a YouTube

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.252
video within a form.

00:06:50.252 --> 00:06:51.960
A lot of people what
to have instructions

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.840
or other sort of content
within their form.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.350
Now you can programmatically add
YouTube videos to your forms.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.310
Likewise, there's
a progress bar.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.910
This is a nice one, especially.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.749
I know when I'm about to fill
out a survey or feedback form,

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.290
if I get a sense that this is
going to be a two-hour process,

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.077
I might bail out.

00:07:08.077 --> 00:07:09.660
But if I can tell
that it's only going

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.780
to take me a couple
more clicks, I

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.420
may continue on
with the process.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.330
I think that can be an
extra little incentive

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.400
to have people as they go get
a feeling for how much they've

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.270
completed the form.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.420
And then I think the
last one is setting

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.950
a custom closed form message.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.750
So you may want to have a
form open for a certain amount

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.790
of time to get feedback.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.990
But then when a
certain amount of time

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.190
has passed, a day, a
week, whatever it is,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.390
you want to close that form
down for new responses.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.259
And by default,
it would just say,

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.800
this form is closed or some sort
of standard Google language.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.650
Now, however, you can set your
own custom form close message,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.000
something like, please call
us, or wait till next month

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.410
when we'll open up again,
something like that.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.910
So you can now do that,
once again, programmatically

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.460
via the Form App.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.710
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah and the
example in the blog post,

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.950
I think, is a really simple
one to get started with.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.810
I think you can literally
copy and paste it.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.580
And it will build you a form
and highlight all the new APIs

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.164
that we added.

00:08:07.164 --> 00:08:08.538
ERIC KOLEDA: That's
a good point.

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:09.615
This is the full code.

00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:10.990
There's not just
a small snippet.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.890
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I think I was
doing a demo recently where

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.550
I was able to just
copy and paste it.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.440
And it was a great
way to demonstrate

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.340
what Form App is all about,
along with the new capabilities

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.350
that we added.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.850
My particular favorite is the
custom form closed message.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.310
I think that really does give
a bit more polish to your form.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.350
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.600
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And if you're
a T-shirt ordering process,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.309
you can say, all
mediums are taken

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.840
or this process is now closed.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.400
Email us directly for additional
detail, something like that.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.380
It's a much, much
more user friendly,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.630
than putting a generic
message out there.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.270
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh
yeah, definitely.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.670
I mean [INAUDIBLE] next
actions, like actions

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.130
that you could follow up on,
rather than just say, hey,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.810
we're sorry, closed
for business.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.100
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And I know
the teacher and the education

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.280
community are really excited
about the video capabilities.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.630
So if you have like
a Khan Academy video

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.460
followed by couple
of quiz questions,

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.190
something that would
be really cool.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.400
ERIC KOLEDA: That's really nice.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.930
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Yeah, so you could

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.070
build some interesting
scripts around that,

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.910
automate that script
building flow.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.470
And we're looking
forward to seeing

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.970
what you can build with that.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.174
ERIC KOLEDA: Cool.

00:09:12.174 --> 00:09:13.590
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Speaking of demos,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.480
one of the things that I
recently was involved with

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.590
was a Hangout on Air with
the Google Enterprise team.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.102
So Apps Script,
as you know, works

00:09:22.102 --> 00:09:23.560
on any account,
any Google account,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.500
but if you're running
within an enterprise,

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.610
there's some additional
nice things about it

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.700
where you can have your
script run within just

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.360
the organization.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.010
You can restrict access to
who gets the web app URL.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.150
You can also, as an admin,
do interesting things

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.880
around user manager and
domain APIs that we have.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.220
So there's always been a really
nice fit in the enterprise

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.310
space with Apps Script.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.110
And recently I did
a Hangout on Air,

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.450
which is sort of their
equivalent of Google Developers

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.610
Live, mostly meant for end
users to come and learn

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.130
about something new in the
Google Apps and API space.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.440
And it was fun.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.470
It was about 30 minutes.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.630
And that is was
more introductory

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.630
than maybe some of you
guys are already used to,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.170
but definitely check it out.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.610
It's a quick, 20,
30 minute video.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.360
And if you're ever
looking for something

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.895
to get started with Apps Script,
or talk about use cases, what

00:10:15.895 --> 00:10:18.020
are some of the enterprise
ideas that we would like

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.300
to see implemented, and
we're seeing around the world

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.020
partners and customers already
do, this Hangout on Air

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.830
talks about that.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.580
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.890
I think Apps Script is a
great general purpose tool.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.730
But there are a lot
of specific segments.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.520
We mentioned education
and enterprise,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.130
where we have either
certain technologies,

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.470
certain capabilities, or just
certain kind of techniques

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.250
and applications--

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:38.600
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.070
ERIC KOLEDA: --that
we'd love to discuss

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.030
if you guys are interested.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.655
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Definitely, definitely.

00:10:42.655 --> 00:10:46.110
And I think the ideas
are really where

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.820
I think a lot of cool
things come from.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.830
And we often see a script.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.100
Maybe it's 100 lines
of code, but the way

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.100
it solves a particular
problem is really

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.600
where the value of
Apps Script comes

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.490
in, rather than the complexity
of the coolness of the code,

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.730
which in some platforms,
it's fun to look at code

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.470
and be like, hey, this
is so complicated.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.420
But in Apps Script, it's about
the work flow and the use case

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.410
more so than the code.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.900
ERIC KOLEDA: That's
a good point.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.730
I mean, I know Apps Script
pretty much inside and out.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.980
But I see people do things
that I never even imagined.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.360
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.290
ERIC KOLEDA: Because they
come with a set of problems,

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.730
and a set of creativity, and
ideas around a solution space.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.420
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.370
ERIC KOLEDA: You're right.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.470
That's where the interest is.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.540
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Awesome.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.140
So do we have anyone on
the Hangout at this point?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.380
We have a new name there.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.520
I'm not sure if you're if
you're familiar with Jasper.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.221
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah,
I know Jasper.

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:35.220
Jasper, can you hear us?

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.761
And would you like
to ask a question?

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:43.490
ARUN NAGARAJAN: OK.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.820
ERIC KOLEDA: All right.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.070
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Well, if
you have any questions,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.030
feel free to chime in.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.160
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah we're
going to leave the mics open.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.680
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.470
ERIC KOLEDA: All
right, in the meantime,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.553
we do have some questions
on our Google Moderator.

00:11:52.553 --> 00:11:54.890
People have been
diligently posting.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.105
So let's start
with one of those.

00:11:57.105 --> 00:11:58.810
Right here at the
top-- are there

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:04.250
plans to add GAS capabilities
to drawings and presentations?

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.780
And by GAS, I think they
mean Google Apps Script.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.280
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Yeah, it's something

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.400
that we've been looking
into-- no official plans

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.810
at this point.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.650
The idea of Apps
Script is to first

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.100
of all really rock the Google
Docs, Google Spreadsheets,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.260
and Google Forms
experience right now.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.710
We are very much
focused on that.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.870
And certainly spreadsheets
and other tools

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.470
are right in that
suite of capabilities,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.390
but at this point, there's no
plans that we have announced.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.970
ERIC KOLEDA:
Gotcha, sounds good.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.080
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Actually
let me just throw in--

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.560
so there's already a feature
enhancement in our issue

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.290
tracker.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.510
Please go find it
and include details

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.790
on what you want to build, what
are some of the capabilities

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.900
that you're looking for.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.610
I know with slides, the
most common scenario

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.460
is I want to auto create 15
slides from a few bullets.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.650
So if that's what it is,
please put a vote in,

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.435
as much details as you can.

00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:00.977
It really helps us
prioritize things.

00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:02.351
ERIC KOLEDA: That's
a good point.

00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:04.674
Our product manager,
when he's trying

00:13:04.674 --> 00:13:06.090
to decide what's
the next thing we

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.298
should do, where should we
put our energy, if there's

00:13:08.298 --> 00:13:10.200
a whole bunch of
really compelling use

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.230
cases around drawings
or presentations,

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.640
that definitely
helps us as a team.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.990
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And really the
Google plug-in for Eclipse,

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.107
a lot of people wanted
offline access to their code.

00:13:22.107 --> 00:13:24.440
A lot of people wanted custom
source control integration

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.270
with their code.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.840
And one approach we
took was expose the API

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.950
and then give you the
plug-in for Eclipse.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.280
But we do look at
this and nothing

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.780
is out of the realm
of possibilities

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.640
with good use cases
and good details.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.230
ERIC KOLEDA: It's true.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:42.230
All right, so the next
one here is about SAP.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.190
SAP is the leader in
enterprise workflow management.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.809
Do you see Google Apps
Script with Google Apps

00:13:47.809 --> 00:13:49.600
for Business tools
becoming a true business

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.630
platform for ERPs and SMEs?

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.610
That is just
chock-full of acronyms.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.590
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, so SMEs, I think,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.490
is small to medium enterprises.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.390
So and Google Apps has been
very successful in this space,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.660
in the small to medium
enterprises, I think.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.050
Either $50 a user or
$60 a user, whatever

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.084
the rate is, it's really easy
to get started, very powerful.

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:13.250
And with Apps Script, you
have this additional layer

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.220
for permeability on top of it.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.635
However, we're not
product people.

00:14:18.635 --> 00:14:21.974
I know our job is to support
the APIs and capabilities.

00:14:21.974 --> 00:14:23.140
ERIC KOLEDA: And developers.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And
developers, exactly.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.810
And so we don't
really have a comment

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.930
on whether it's going to replace
one product or another product.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.290
It's truly up to you as
to what you can build

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.880
and what problems
you're solving.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.614
So unfortunately, we
would like to think

00:14:37.614 --> 00:14:39.280
it's solving every
problem in the world.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.070
But it's up to the
developers and our partners

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.680
on what they build and
what problems to solve.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.596
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, that's
a really good point.

00:14:46.596 --> 00:14:49.510
I mean, we also do focus a lot
on the ability to integrate.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.160
So we want to make sure that
if there are popular tools

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.400
out there that we have the
integration points via URL

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.040
fetching or other
sorts of technologies

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.570
that you can do to access
those outside systems,

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.510
bring the data, push data out.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.900
We want to make it
so that there's not

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.940
a lot of friction in getting
done what you need to get done,

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.460
but not really commenting
on specific technologies.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.120
All right, great.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.125
The next question
we have here is,

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.800
Is Google Apps
Script a good tool

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.410
for a web app in
the marketplace?

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.650
Can it handle 500-plus users?

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.510
Fausto here has
put a lot of energy

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.249
into his Shared
Contacts app and would

00:15:29.249 --> 00:15:30.540
like to make sure it can scale.

00:15:33.086 --> 00:15:34.210
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Hi, Fausto.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.751
I'm not sure if
you're watching live.

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.930
I know this is a
really cool tool.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.300
I've seen the tool in action.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.560
So a lot of time when people
talk about scalabilities

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.830
around not necessarily
Apps Script

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.930
specifically, as much as
the specific systems or back

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.060
end APIs it's using,
so in this case,

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.080
the contact service has
its set of limitations

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.540
and capabilities.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.120
So it's really a question of can
Contact Service and the quota

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.202
that you get with it, will
that scale to 500 users?

00:16:05.202 --> 00:16:06.910
And I think that's a
really hard question

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.180
to answer live without thinking
about what are the use cases on

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.942
is it pulling every minute?

00:16:12.942 --> 00:16:15.400
Or is it once a day they're
checking these Shared Contacts?

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.067
In general, 500 users
don't sound like that much.

00:16:21.067 --> 00:16:23.150
And I think it's going to
be OK, as long as you're

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:28.740
using so the caching and
sort of pulling every minute.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.947
Maybe you aggregate it for all
users and do one batch call.

00:16:31.947 --> 00:16:34.280
So there are techniques with
which you can support that.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.363
But I don't know if you
have any comments on this.

00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:38.610
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, I think
this question is probably

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.660
in response to the
next question, which

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.930
is how he is experiencing--
I've been working with him

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.360
a lot over the issue tracker--
some occasional timeout

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.020
problems with regards
to calls to the contacts

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.060
service, the Google
Contacts API.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:59.400
And so I think in this case,
you found a bottleneck.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.080
All the parts of
the code perhaps

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.150
are functioning well
and scaling well.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.280
And there's one bottleneck
around the contacts API.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.710
There is something strange
going on in regards

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.970
to how it works sometimes
when you run it manually,

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.239
but not on automative process.

00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:14.030
And it has something
to do, without getting

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.440
too much into it, into
how these kind of requests

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.020
flow through our back
ends at different times.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.190
So yeah, you did
find a bottleneck.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.839
And I think if you were to
scale this up to 500,000 users,

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.636
you'd find other
bottlenecks as well.

00:17:26.636 --> 00:17:28.760
I think part of what we're
trying to do on our team

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.259
is to help identify what
those bottlenecks are and see

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:32.800
if we can't get them
out of your way.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.380
But that said, I think
there is eventually

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.260
an upper bound to
when it makes sense

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.680
to no longer be using Apps
Script for a certain task.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.110
Obviously, you wouldn't
want to run a brand

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.690
new social platform
on Apps Script.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.620
For millions and
millions of users,

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.640
it's just not the
right tool for the job.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.090
But I think 500 users sounds
like it's a reasonable.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.580
I think it fits what
Apps Script aims to be.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.420
And I think we'll
keep working with you

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.946
on the specific problem and
hopefully get it resolved.

00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:04.320
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's a very
complicated problem to debug.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.370
So we're certainly aware of
the issues that you're facing

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.770
and we're trying to do our best.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.430
When you think
about Apps Script,

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.404
so Google Contacts has had
an API for a long time.

00:18:15.404 --> 00:18:17.070
And what we're trying
to do is just wrap

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.214
that in this really
nice JavaScript API

00:18:19.214 --> 00:18:20.130
and offer that to you.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.650
So a lot of times
the problem might

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.770
be in the back end API itself
or in our implementation

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.130
of the wrapper
logic, or somewhere

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.680
in your code in the way
things have sequenced.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.050
There's a lot of
different moving parts.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.450
In general, web apps, few
hundred users, no problem,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.850
specific bottlenecks, we have
to dig in and figure out.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.790
Similar issues might
have with spreadsheets.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.610
So if you're serving the
same spreadsheet for hundreds

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.340
of users, depending
on what you're

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.756
doing with that
spreadsheet, there

00:18:48.756 --> 00:18:50.840
might be some
issues-- so certainly

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.187
something that we need to dig
in and do some debugging on.

00:18:55.187 --> 00:18:57.020
ERIC KOLEDA: All right,
I think there's only

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.150
one more question we have
here in the moderator,

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.300
and it's about
Google Maps and not

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.160
related to Apps
Script whatsoever.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.590
So I think we'll just
bypass that one for now.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.560
But you can we reach
out to the Google Maps

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.702
team for specific
questions about their APIs

00:19:08.702 --> 00:19:09.660
and the products there.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.380
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And I think they
have a Google Developers Live

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.485
series as well.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:16.061
So it might be
developers.google.com/live/maps.

00:19:16.061 --> 00:19:17.602
ERIC KOLEDA: That
sounds about right.

00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:18.785
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:19:18.785 --> 00:19:20.160
ERIC KOLEDA: And
yeah, maybe this

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.930
was just a matter of
turning to the wrong channel

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.680
at the wrong time.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.370
But hopefully you can get
your question answer there.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.460
I believe that's it
for our moderator.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.040
Let's just check back
in on the live Hangout.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.400
I see we have some people there.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.122
Does anybody have a question
they'd like to ask live?

00:19:36.122 --> 00:19:37.330
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Or a comment.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.940
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.130
Tell us what you've been
building with Apps Script

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:42.630
recently.

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:47.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Well, there's
one other announcement

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.560
that I want to make.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.220
I forgot to mention earlier.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.070
ERIC KOLEDA: Surprise
announcement.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.445
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's not really
that surprising, I guess.

00:19:52.445 --> 00:19:55.950
So I'm going to actually be
doing a Google Developers group

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.400
presentation to the group
in London this Friday.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.350
I think it's part of
their Dev Fest programs.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.180
So I'll be joining
in via Hangout,

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.830
using our great technology to
present remotely for the folks

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:09.740
in the UK.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.570
If you're in the
area, definitely go.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.970
I forget the exact offices
where they are in London.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.000
But check them out.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.110
The GDG London group
is running this,

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.200
so looking forward
to presenting to you

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.340
and giving you some
background on Apps Script.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:21.640
ERIC KOLEDA: It's great.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.660
Now have you presented at
other groups in the past?

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.160
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Yeah, so I presented

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.010
to the group in Bogota
in Columbia remotely.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.370
And it's a lot of fun
to present remotely.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.300
And sometimes I get
really good questions,

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.240
even though I feel
like I can't see them.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.390
And the technology
works really well.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.110
And it's a great
way for us to not

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.810
have to travel out
everywhere but also provide

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:47.060
any content and demos that
we can to get the group

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.520
to think about Apps Script and
build some interesting things.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.680
I'm trying to present
as many as possible

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.580
and also more importantly
find local authorities,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.090
local experts, that
they can take on.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.270
So my goal for representing
the Google Developers

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.520
group in London is to
find folks in London that

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.700
can deliver that
same presentation

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.857
and become a local
expert for us.

00:21:07.857 --> 00:21:08.940
ERIC KOLEDA: That's great.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.510
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So if you're
interested in running Dev Fest

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.050
sessions, let us know.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.370
And we'll put in touch with you
with the local GDG folks that

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.080
can help you organize,
polish your content.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.650
And of course, we're here to
help you with any presentation

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.109
ideas or any set
of slides as well.

00:21:24.109 --> 00:21:25.816
ERIC KOLEDA: There's
a lot of great perks

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:27.790
too as you get
involved in Dev Fest,

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.100
or maybe even if you can
graduate into our Developer

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.852
Expert program.

00:21:30.852 --> 00:21:32.060
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.435
ERIC KOLEDA:
There's really a lot

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:35.910
of capabilities to get
involved with Google more.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.012
There's giving talks, lots
of other great benefit.

00:21:38.012 --> 00:21:39.220
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.303
So the program is called
Google Developers Expert.

00:21:41.303 --> 00:21:46.277
So developers.google.com/expert,
I think is the URL.

00:21:46.277 --> 00:21:47.985
And if you go there,
you can find out all

00:21:47.985 --> 00:21:48.776
about this program.

00:21:48.776 --> 00:21:51.470
So that's sort of the
top tier of involvement

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.320
with Google Developer
technologies.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.690
It certainly takes a while
to get to that point,

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.250
but we recommend that if you
are really passionate about Apps

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.020
Script, let us
know first of all.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.110
And let us know
about your projects,

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.910
and let us know about your talks
or blog posts on Apps Script.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.260
And we'll keep monitoring it and
nominate you for this process,

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.200
if that makes sense.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.070
But the perks are huge.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.040
Maybe it starts with just
a t-shirt here there.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.490
But it could graduate up
to visits up to the Google

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.027
offices, direct channel
to Google engineers to us,

00:22:24.027 --> 00:22:25.610
and a lot of really
interesting things

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.950
that if you are passionate about
a particular Google technology,

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.470
it's a great way
to get recognized

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.010
and get benefits from it.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.510
ERIC KOLEDA: I remember at I/O
last year just how much power

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.590
even just a t-shirt had.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.890
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.130
That's right.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:36.930
ERIC KOLEDA: T-shirts
are very powerful.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.221
But it goes so far beyond that.

00:22:38.221 --> 00:22:39.740
So yeah, definitely
we're looking

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.910
to recruit more folks into
our Apps Script world,

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.166
get them excited, spread
the good news to everybody.

00:22:45.166 --> 00:22:46.540
But I don't know
about you, Arun,

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.490
but I feel like Apps
Script has so much power

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.372
and is still pretty unknown
to a majority of developers.

00:22:51.372 --> 00:22:52.830
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
That's right, yeah.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.260
It's often times, and
I give presentations,

00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.250
and everybody knows about
Gmail, and Docs, and drive.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.940
And there's probably
about 10%, 15%

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.820
of the room that has
heard of Apps Script,

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.330
and even small percentage
that has actually tried out

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.910
even our simple five
minute quick starts.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.559
So you get help us
spread the message

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.350
and get more people to
at least try it out,

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.510
see if it's right for them.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.749
ERIC KOLEDA: That's great.

00:23:17.749 --> 00:23:19.790
All right, well, I'm going
to give one more crack

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.460
at the people live
in the Hangout.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.166
This is your last chance to
ask a question to two Google

00:23:25.166 --> 00:23:25.665
engineers.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.775
All right, going,
going, gone-- I

00:23:31.775 --> 00:23:33.650
think that does it for
today's episode, Arun.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:34.520
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All
right, thank you

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.320
very much for anyone
who joined live

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.510
and for the questions they
were asked on moderator.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.560
And I think we already scheduled
the next one, I forget.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.500
But we'll be doing
this again in November.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.710
And I think it will be deep
into the winter by then.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.787
So talk to you guys then.

00:23:47.787 --> 00:23:49.120
ERIC KOLEDA: Thank you, goodbye.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.970
ARUN NAGARAJAN: See you.
