Adriene Hill: Hi I'm Adriene Hill.
Mr. Clifford: And I'm Mr. Clifford.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome to Crash Course Economics.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.120
Adriene: Here at Crash Course, we recognize
that difficult subjects are sometimes fraught

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.869
with truly unintelligible vocabulary that's
difficult for us regular people to understand.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.819
Mr. Clifford: But it doesn't have to be that
complicated. Remember, economics is the study

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:20.160
of scarcity and choices. We have limited resources,
so we need a way to analyze the best way to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.360
use them. We need economics to make wise decisions
in the future, but it also helps us understand the past.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.100
Adriene: Most empires, wars, and human endeavors
can be explained using economics. All you

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.960
have to understand is who wanted what. The
American Civil War wasn't just about freedom,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.140
it was fought because southern states wanted
to keep using cheap slave labor. It was economics.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.539
Mr. Clifford: Econ can explain so much about
the world, and that's why we love teaching

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.640
it, and that's what makes it the greatest
subjects of all time.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.980
Adriene: Take that physics! We're comin' for
ya!

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.640
[Theme Music]

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.280
Adriene: Let's stick with this history theme
and talk about the progress of humanity throughout

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.500
the ages. Using measurements like life expectancy,
child mortality, and income per capita, we

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.890
can show the majority of humans that ever
lived had terrible lives. Statistically speaking.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.760
It wasn't until the industrial revolution
that people saw significant and sustained

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.660
increase in their standard of living. Populations
skyrocketed, but so did life expectancy and

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.520
food supplies and hospitals and eventually
toilets and refrigerators.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.630
Mr. Clifford: It was at the beginning of the
industrial revolution that Adam Smith, the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.600
first modern economist, wrote his book An
Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.780
Wealth of Nations or AIITNACOTWON. He wasn't
great at naming books, but he was really good

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.270
at explaining the source of prosperity. Smith
concluded it was specialization, or what he

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.560
called the division of labor, that made countries
wealthy. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.800
Adriene: When I think of specialization, I
think of a pizza restaurant where different

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.280
workers have specific tasks like preparing
the ingredients, making the pizza, putting

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.530
it in the oven, taking it out and putting
it in the box. This division of labor makes

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.380
each worker more productive since they can
each focus on the thing they do best, and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.800
they don't waste time switching between jobs.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.190
But specialization goes beyond the assembly
line for pizza. To produce the cheese, there

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.150
was a dairy farmer who specialized in raising
cows; the oven was designed and manufactured

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.510
by people who specialize in engineering ovens;
the friendly moustache guy on the pizza box?

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.500
Someone had to stamp him on there. I love
that guy!

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.260
Adam Smith observed, "in every improved society,
the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer;

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.370
the manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer.
The labour... necessary to produce any one complete

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.739
manufacture, is almost always divided among
a great number of hands."

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.459
Imagine what it would be like to make a pizza
completely on your own. From scratch. You

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.180
would have to grow the wheat and tomatoes
and raise the cow, you'd make the flour, the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.019
cheese, the oven, the pan, and then draw the
moustache guy on the box. Without specialization,

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.950
if you want something, you have to make it
yourself.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.340
And for thousands of years of human history,
specialization was, well, pretty minimal.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.200
Of course humans specialized prior to the
industrial revolution, it's one of the marks

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.019
of civilization that we mentioned in our World
History series, but the modern era has taken

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.670
this to the extreme. Think of how many people
from how many different specialized fields

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.480
it takes to make a smartphone, all of them working
in harmony so I can tweet my super profound thoughts.

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:12.840
Thanks Thought Bubble! So specialization makes
people more productive, but Adam Smith said

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.200
that it's trade that makes them better off.
Assume that John can produce either pizza

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.129
or t-shirts. If he's way better at making
pizza, then he should specialize in making

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.149
pizza and then trade with someone else like
Hank who's way better at making t-shirts.

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:30.320
Everyone knows Hank's better at making t-shirts,
right? With trade, each of them can end up

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.609
with more pizza and shirts than if they tried
to make them on their own.

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.640
To fully explain this idea of the benefits
of trade, we need to show you an economic

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.550
model, but before we go any further, know
that economists geek out over models and graphs.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.480
Don't get all worked up about the numbers;
they're not that complicated. Models are just

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.040
visuals to help us simplify and explain concepts.
It's time for the model! So let's go to the runway.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.440
Mr. Clifford: Now this is the first graph
you'll see in an economics textbook. It's

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.269
called the production possibilities frontier,
or PPF. The PPF shows the different combinations

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.519
of two goods being produced using all resources
efficiently.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.400
Now here's a made up example. If the United
States uses all of its workers and factories

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.950
to produce airplanes, it can produce 500 per
day, but they can't produce any shoes. Now

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.950
if they use all their resources to produce
shoes, they can produce 1000 tons per day,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.480
but they can't produce any planes.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.400
Now because the United States has limited
resources, they can't produce any combination beyond

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.040
the production possibilities frontier, so it's impossible
to produce 500 planes and 1000 tons of shoes.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.950
Adriene: Wait wait wait, Mr. Clifford, I want
to stop you here for a second. We don't live

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.160
in a world where there are only two things
that a country can produce. There are like

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.850
a million things that US workers can choose
to make: toilet paper, zippers, adorable stuffed

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.010
kitty cats holding hearts, artisanal sauerkraut
-- we don't live in a world of just shoes

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.980
and airplanes, so what's the real world value
of the production possibilities frontier?

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.650
Mr. Clifford: The idea is once you really
understand that there's trade-offs between

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.820
producing two goods, that same logic applies
for any number of goods. Adding additional

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.700
goods makes it more complex but doesn't really
add any more insights, so economists usually

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.780
just stick with two goods.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.260
Now, what if American companies mismanage
their resources and try to produce planes

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.430
in shoe factories and shoes in plane factories?
Well, they'd be at a point inside the production

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.700
possibilities frontier, showing an inefficient
use of resources. So every possible combination

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.220
inside the curve is inefficient, and on the
curve is efficient and outside the curve is impossible.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.180
Now let's compare this PPF to China's. China
can produce 100 planes per day or 800 tons

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.170
of shoes. Since the United States can produce
more planes than China, they have an absolute

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.480
advantage in the production of planes. The US also
has an absolute advantage in the production of shoes.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.610
Since the US can produce more of both goods,
you might think there's no reason to trade,

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.210
that they should just produce both on their
own. Well, no. Remember, specialization and

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.440
trade makes people, and in this case countries,
better off.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.260
Now stick with me, let's calculate the opportunity
cost for the United States to produce one

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.940
plane. Every single time they produce an additional
plane, it costs them two tons of shoes. China

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.440
on the other hand gives up 8 tons of shoes
for each plane they produce, and since the US

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.120
has a lower opportunity cost, they have what's
called a comparative advantage. China has

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.390
a comparative advantage in the production
of shoes.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.830
But here's the best part, if the US specializes
in planes, they can import shoes from China

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.240
at a lower opportunity cost than if they produce
shoes themselves. For example if these two

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.200
countries make a deal to trade one plane for
four tons of shoes, The US would be better off.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.520
They would rather get four tons of shoes per
plane from China than only get two tons per

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.210
plane by making shoes on their own. Now, China
is also better off. They would rather trade

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.090
four tons of shoes for a plane than give up
8 tons for producing a plane on their own.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.430
Now hopefully your head isn't spinning. Being
able to do these calculations is good, but

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.900
it's more important to understand the main
idea. Individual and countries should specialize

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.530
in producing things in which they have a comparative
advantage and then trade with other countries

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.530
that specialize in something else. This trade
is mutually beneficial.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.290
Now that's the production possibilities frontier.
In the real world, it's way more complicated

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.760
than this simplified model, and we're only
in the beginning.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.120
Adriene: So this graph is super simplified,
but the idea that countries should focus on

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.100
producing the products for which they are
better suited is huge. Way huge.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.860
In reality, the US is the world's leading
manufacturer and exporter of airplanes. It

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.500
produces more than 40% of all planes. At the
same time, the US produces less than 2% of

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.230
the world's shoes, electing instead to import
them from countries in Asia. The graphs aren't

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.230
real, but the concepts are.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.740
Another reason you should learn this is because
you might hear a politician or someone on

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.020
the news argue that international trade destroys
domestic jobs, and even though it may seem

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.810
counterintuitive, economists for centuries
have argued that trade is mutually beneficial

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.880
to whoever's trading. Now you know why.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.960
Now to be fair, there are all sorts of other
intolerable issues associated with international

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.900
trade, like child labor, dangerous working
conditions and pollution, and we promise to

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.000
address these in a future video. But if there's
one point on which most economists agree,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.400
it's that specialization and trade makes the
world better off.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.220
No country in recent decades has achieved
sustained improvements in living standards

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.950
without open trade with the rest of the world.
Countries like Cuba, Venezuela, Zimbabwe,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:52.830
and Iran that are voluntarily or involuntarily
cut off from the world remain less economically

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.420
developed than they could be.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.060
On the other hand, countries that have opened
their doors to trade like Japan and Taiwan,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.920
or, more recently, China and India, have seen
massive improvements in their standards of living.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.580
Mr. Clifford: Adam Smith was on to something.
Self-sufficiency is inefficiency and inefficiency can lead to poverty.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.020
Adriene: Next time we'll show you how some
of these ideas get turned into economic systems

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.260
and how these systems contribute to
the differences between countries.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.460
