exabytes of data that's a lot
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.190
exabytes of data that's a lot
it's 22 trillion gigabytes and I know

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
it's 22 trillion gigabytes and I know
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.350
it's 22 trillion gigabytes and I know
we're playing big number bingo here so I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
we're playing big number bingo here so I
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.999
we're playing big number bingo here so I
want to try and bring that back to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
want to try and bring that back to
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.740
want to try and bring that back to
something more concrete so in 2005 the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
something more concrete so in 2005 the
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.539
something more concrete so in 2005 the
global traffic on the Internet

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
global traffic on the Internet
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.999
global traffic on the Internet
was 22 exabytes and that's the year that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
was 22 exabytes and that's the year that
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.429
was 22 exabytes and that's the year that
YouTube launched so we like to think of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
YouTube launched so we like to think of
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.990
YouTube launched so we like to think of
this that the Google Play app

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
this that the Google Play app
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.119
this that the Google Play app
distribution network last year was the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129
distribution network last year was the
 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.760
distribution network last year was the
size of the Internet back in 2005

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
size of the Internet back in 2005
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.820
size of the Internet back in 2005
so this is why we care about the amount

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
so this is why we care about the amount
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.590
so this is why we care about the amount
of data that we end up delivering to

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
of data that we end up delivering to
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.720

come through the Play Store looking for
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.850
come through the Play Store looking for
apps to install and they might be

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860
apps to install and they might be
 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.590

either way at some point they end up on

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
either way at some point they end up on
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.760
either way at some point they end up on
your app listing page they're going to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
your app listing page they're going to
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.590
your app listing page they're going to
read the reviews they're going to look

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600
read the reviews they're going to look
 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600
read the reviews they're going to look
at the screenshots the videos your store

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610
at the screenshots the videos your store
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.430
at the screenshots the videos your store
listing and hopefully they'll make the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
listing and hopefully they'll make the
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.990
listing and hopefully they'll make the
decision to click that install button

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
decision to click that install button
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.390
decision to click that install button
but that is not the end of the story

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
but that is not the end of the story
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.030
but that is not the end of the story
that is not an acquisition until that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040
that is not an acquisition until that
 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.920
that is not an acquisition until that
app has been downloaded and installed

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
app has been downloaded and installed
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.560
app has been downloaded and installed
onto the device there's a lot that can

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570
onto the device there's a lot that can
 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.300
onto the device there's a lot that can
happen between those two steps let's

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
happen between those two steps let's
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.390
happen between those two steps let's
take a look at some of them when we

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400
take a look at some of them when we
 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.750
take a look at some of them when we
looked at our data we found that 30% of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
looked at our data we found that 30% of
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.390
looked at our data we found that 30% of
the time that installation doesn't fully

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400
the time that installation doesn't fully
 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.350
the time that installation doesn't fully
complete so that means that one that a

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
complete so that means that one that a
 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.540
complete so that means that one that a
third of the time that a user decides to

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550
third of the time that a user decides to
 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.340
third of the time that a user decides to
install your app they don't end up with

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
install your app they don't end up with
 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.120
install your app they don't end up with
it on your device so what happens and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130
it on your device so what happens and
 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.870
it on your device so what happens and
what can we do to improve this turns out

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
what can we do to improve this turns out
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.340
what can we do to improve this turns out
when we look into it that there are

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350
when we look into it that there are
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.580
when we look into it that there are
three main reasons for this drop-off

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590
three main reasons for this drop-off
 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.470
three main reasons for this drop-off
there's the internal free space on the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480
there's the internal free space on the
 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.230
there's the internal free space on the
device there's the time it takes to

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240
device there's the time it takes to
 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.800
device there's the time it takes to
download the app and there's the cost of

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810
download the app and there's the cost of
 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.170
download the app and there's the cost of
the data involved I'm going to go into

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180
the data involved I'm going to go into
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.810

it's fairly obvious I think that the

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210
can actually work with and perform even
 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.510
can actually work with and perform even
better so we will talk about five

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520
better so we will talk about five
 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.310
better so we will talk about five
features today we will start talking

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320
features today we will start talking
 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.310
features today we will start talking
about one for space show for time and

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320
about one for space show for time and
 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.340
about one for space show for time and
then shoe for cost great so let's jump

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350
then shoe for cost great so let's jump
 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.830
then shoe for cost great so let's jump
straight ahead and talk about space as

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840
straight ahead and talk about space as
 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.200
straight ahead and talk about space as
Dominic was saying space is a huge

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210
Dominic was saying space is a huge
 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.020
Dominic was saying space is a huge
barrier so out up there we have three

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.030
barrier so out up there we have three
 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.790
barrier so out up there we have three
out of ten users that don't have a ton

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800
out of ten users that don't have a ton
 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.110
out of ten users that don't have a ton
of space they only have one gigabyte

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120
of space they only have one gigabyte
 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.200
of space they only have one gigabyte
left so even if cost is not an issue

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210
left so even if cost is not an issue
 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.600
left so even if cost is not an issue
even if time is not an issue we know

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610
even if time is not an issue we know
 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.040
even if time is not an issue we know
that these users might simply not be

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050
that these users might simply not be
 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.270
that these users might simply not be
able to install your app and that's a

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280
able to install your app and that's a
 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.850
able to install your app and that's a
shame so what we do here is we have a

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860
shame so what we do here is we have a
 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.500
shame so what we do here is we have a
feature called the uninstall wizard that

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.510
feature called the uninstall wizard that
 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.140
feature called the uninstall wizard that
you can see here on the screen that says

you can see here on the screen that says
 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.270
you can see here on the screen that says

improved this feature quite a bit in

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340
improved this feature quite a bit in
 

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.760
improved this feature quite a bit in

do one we change the UI so that it's

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.040
do one we change the UI so that it's
 

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.170
do one we change the UI so that it's
much easier to use

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180
much easier to use
 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.060
much easier to use
so we've highlighted the relevant

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.070
so we've highlighted the relevant
 

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.800

result next we also change the ranking

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:20.640
result next we also change the ranking
 

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.060
result next we also change the ranking
so that we highlight apps they're large

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.070
so that we highlight apps they're large
 

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.730
so that we highlight apps they're large
apps are not used and users can easily

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740
apps are not used and users can easily
 

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.060
apps are not used and users can easily
find them so success rating proves why

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.070
find them so success rating proves why

feature to a large apps are more likely

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740
feature to a large apps are more likely
 

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.010
feature to a large apps are more likely
to be uninstalled so that's actually

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020
to be uninstalled so that's actually
 

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.330
to be uninstalled so that's actually
something that you should think about

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:47.340
something that you should think about
 

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.580
something that you should think about
because if your app is larger used to

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:49.590
because if your app is larger used to
 

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.190
because if your app is larger used to
suffer more with uninstalls and as Tom

monitor this and understand how we can
actually make our app smaller so now

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:01.770
actually make our app smaller so now

what happens what we can do here is we

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:20.790
what happens what we can do here is we
 

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.360
what happens what we can do here is we
can make the artifacts make the apk is

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.370
can make the artifacts make the apk is
 

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.700
can make the artifacts make the apk is
smaller and we do that using compression

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:25.710
smaller and we do that using compression
 

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.000
smaller and we do that using compression
for new installs we automatically on

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.010
for new installs we automatically on
 

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.760
for new installs we automatically on

without anything different and for
 

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.220
without anything different and for
updates the improvement is even more

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.230
updates the improvement is even more
 

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.470
updates the improvement is even more
dramatic we use patching comparing the

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480
dramatic we use patching comparing the
 

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.120
dramatic we use patching comparing the
version that is available on the device

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.130
version that is available on the device
 

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.040

versus the version that's got to be
 

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.900
versus the version that's got to be
downloaded and when we do that we

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:47.910
downloaded and when we do that we
 

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.519
downloaded and when we do that we
actually reduce the total apk size

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:49.529
actually reduce the total apk size
 

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:53.030
actually reduce the total apk size
download by 85% so updates are much

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040
download by 85% so updates are much
 

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.590
download by 85% so updates are much
smaller and much more likely to be

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600
smaller and much more likely to be

related to uncompressed native libraries
 

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.220
related to uncompressed native libraries
because of compression if there are

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.570
something different and in that
situation try now it's now you we need

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580
situation try now it's now you we need
 

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.550
situation try now it's now you we need
to make this really fast and this is

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560
to make this really fast and this is
 

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.320
to make this really fast and this is
really important so that it's really

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.330
really important so that it's really
 

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.590
really important so that it's really
small how we can do this we were looking

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600
small how we can do this we were looking
 

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.300
small how we can do this we were looking
at a few options in what we notice is

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.310
at a few options in what we notice is
 

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.670
at a few options in what we notice is
apps I actually have a lot of share

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680

boxes which are actually content that is
 

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.670
boxes which are actually content that is
specific to each app so in the example

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680
specific to each app so in the example
 

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.579

they may be sounds there are things that
make the game unique

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:04.910
make the game unique
 

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.090

on a device now we went to recently like

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:26.150
on a device now we went to recently like
 

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.360
on a device now we went to recently like
we didn't do this actually we everything

we didn't do this actually we everything
 

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.790
we didn't do this actually we everything
was like a black box we really will just

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800
was like a black box we really will just
 

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.160

inside each apk what we could do there
 

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.680
inside each apk what we could do there
is something much different and much

is something much different and much
 

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.740
is something much different and much
more interesting is we could tell that

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:44.750
more interesting is we could tell that

so data is not such a big issue for
these folks and then what we can do is

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:51.890
these folks and then what we can do is
 

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.520
these folks and then what we can do is
we prefetch a library and we keep it on

the cache and then when we go and click
 

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.590
the cache and then when we go and click
on try now what happens is we download

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600
on try now what happens is we download
 

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.290
on try now what happens is we download
only the specific game assets and we'll

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:02.300
only the specific game assets and we'll
 

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.720
only the specific game assets and we'll
reassemble the apk on the device so that

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:04.730
reassemble the apk on the device so that
 

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.610
reassemble the apk on the device so that
the download size is much smaller and

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:06.620
the download size is much smaller and
 

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.990
the download size is much smaller and
the user can jump into the experience

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000
the user can jump into the experience
 

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.020
the user can jump into the experience

limited data plans and they need to be
 

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.240
limited data plans and they need to be
very careful with every megabyte these

that okay so before we see how to

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680
that okay so before we see how to
 

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.220
that okay so before we see how to
optimize your app let's talk about what

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:54.230
optimize your app let's talk about what
 

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.340
optimize your app let's talk about what
you should measure so you're hopefully

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:57.350
you should measure so you're hopefully
 

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.440
you should measure so you're hopefully
convinced by now that the size of your

00:15:59.440 --> 00:15:59.450
convinced by now that the size of your
 

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.980
convinced by now that the size of your
app matters but what apps are we talking

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:02.990
app matters but what apps are we talking
 

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.890
app matters but what apps are we talking
about it's important to note that there

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:05.900
about it's important to note that there
 

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.020
about it's important to note that there
are different types of sizes you can

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.030
are different types of sizes you can
 

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.510
are different types of sizes you can
measure for your app and not all have

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:10.520
measure for your app and not all have
 

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.900
measure for your app and not all have
the same importance the line practiced

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:13.910
the same importance the line practiced

the same importance the line practiced
three ways to measure the size of your

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:15.800
three ways to measure the size of your
 

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.610
three ways to measure the size of your
app we have the app upload size the app

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:18.620
app we have the app upload size the app
 

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.340
app we have the app upload size the app
download size and the app size on device

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:21.350
download size and the app size on device
 

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.530
download size and the app size on device
and I'm going to explain each little bit

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:23.540
and I'm going to explain each little bit
 

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.300
and I'm going to explain each little bit
more details but I want to start with a

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:25.310
more details but I want to start with a
 

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.180
more details but I want to start with a
bit of a show of hands raise your hand

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:28.190
bit of a show of hands raise your hand
 

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.430
bit of a show of hands raise your hand
in the audience if you measure the size

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440
in the audience if you measure the size
 

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.160
in the audience if you measure the size
of your app by looking at the file size

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.170
of your app by looking at the file size
 

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.350
of your app by looking at the file size
of the apk you upload to the Play

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360
of the apk you upload to the Play
 

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.670
of the apk you upload to the Play
console alright almost everyone yeah

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680
console alright almost everyone yeah
 

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.380
console alright almost everyone yeah
that's indeed quite a common practice

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:41.390
that's indeed quite a common practice
 

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.770
that's indeed quite a common practice
because it's easy to do that's what we

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:44.780
because it's easy to do that's what we
 

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.440
because it's easy to do that's what we
call the app upload size because that's

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:47.450
call the app upload size because that's
 

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.840
call the app upload size because that's
the size of the on disk of the file that

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:49.850
the size of the on disk of the file that
 

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.350
the size of the on disk of the file that
you upload to the play console it turns

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360
you upload to the play console it turns
 

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.110
you upload to the play console it turns
out it's it isn't such an important

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120
out it's it isn't such an important
 

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.270
out it's it isn't such an important
metric because not what your users will

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:58.280
metric because not what your users will
 

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.210
metric because not what your users will
see it's neither the size of what they

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:01.220
see it's neither the size of what they
 

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.760
see it's neither the size of what they
download and it's neither this nor the

well you can I say it's still quite a
 

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.450
well you can I say it's still quite a
big range so how can we know in more

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:12.460
big range so how can we know in more
 

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.900
big range so how can we know in more
details where this which devices gets

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:15.910
details where this which devices gets
 

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.900
details where this which devices gets
what size so we can break down the

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:18.910
what size so we can break down the
 

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.840
what size so we can break down the
result by various device dimensions and

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:21.850
result by various device dimensions and
 

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.669
result by various device dimensions and
this is done through the dimensions flag

00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679
this is done through the dimensions flag
 

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:25.830
this is done through the dimensions flag
so here we asked to break down the

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840
so here we asked to break down the
 

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.799
so here we asked to break down the
results by SDK version and we get a bit

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:28.809
results by SDK version and we get a bit
 

00:19:28.809 --> 00:19:31.080
results by SDK version and we get a bit
more details we get a breakdown by SDK

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.090
more details we get a breakdown by SDK
 

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.780
more details we get a breakdown by SDK
version we see in this example that the

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:33.790
version we see in this example that the
 

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.060
version we see in this example that the
download size of my app is bigger on

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.070
download size of my app is bigger on
 

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.580
download size of my app is bigger on
older versions of android JMK and

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:38.590
older versions of android JMK and
 

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.090
older versions of android JMK and
smaller on l and above that's because

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:42.100
smaller on l and above that's because
 

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.640
smaller on l and above that's because
pre L Google Play doesn't generate

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:44.650
pre L Google Play doesn't generate
 

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.740

language splits so all languages are

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:46.750
language splits so all languages are
 

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.930
language splits so all languages are
included in the apk served to the user

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940
 
 

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.790
 
now we can get into even more details we

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:53.800
now we can get into even more details we
 

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.530
now we can get into even more details we
can break down on more dimensions such

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:55.540
can break down on more dimensions such
 

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.340
can break down on more dimensions such

do that then I will output a lot of rows

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.330
do that then I will output a lot of rows
 

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.539
do that then I will output a lot of rows
but you will get to see the download

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:03.549
but you will get to see the download
 

00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:06.320
but you will get to see the download

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.649
used second the native libraries when
you compress the native libraries in

00:21:46.649 --> 00:21:46.659
you compress the native libraries in
 

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:48.690
you compress the native libraries in
your apk the Android platform needs to

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:48.700
your apk the Android platform needs to
 

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.909
your apk the Android platform needs to
uncompress them which takes additional

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919
uncompress them which takes additional
 

00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:53.730
uncompress them which takes additional
space on your users devices fortunately

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:53.740
space on your users devices fortunately
 

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.740

you can avoid this by leaving native

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:55.750
you can avoid this by leaving native
 

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.080
you can avoid this by leaving native
libraries and compressing your apk which

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.090
libraries and compressing your apk which
 

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.760
libraries and compressing your apk which
allows the Android platform to read them

00:21:59.760 --> 00:21:59.770
allows the Android platform to read them
 

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.590
allows the Android platform to read them
directly from it without having to

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600
directly from it without having to
 

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.600
directly from it without having to
extract them and that's available since

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:03.610
extract them and that's available since
 

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.360
