00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.010
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.310
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.270
And I'm really delighted
to see you all here.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.480
Especially with the circumstances,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.620
with the Jefferson
building being closed.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.780
And it really is, and
with our speaker coming

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.180
from London to be with us.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.640
So, I'm delighted to see
such a large audience.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, chief of
the African-Mid-East division,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.900
and I want to welcome you to
our division, and to invite you

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.420
to return as often as possible.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.520
We are a division made up of three
sections, as most of you know.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.240
The African section, the Hebraic
section, and the Near East section.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.030
We cover 78 countries, and
we cover of them in the sense

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.770
that we are responsible
for collections,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.430
and for serving those
collections in this room.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.570
And we don't simply
collect books and journals

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.300
and newspapers and so forth.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.250 position:56%
But we also like to invite people
to do research in this reading room.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.400
And we use our collections, and
we consult with our specialists,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.250
all of whom are scholars
and specialists

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.820
in the region that they cover.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.230
We like to have them come here
and share with us the product

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.560
of their research, the books

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.610
that they have done,
that they have written.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.390
The articles and others.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.760
And other products.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.100
We also like to invite
people from outside,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.780
who have not necessarily
used our collections,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.010
but who like the gentleman
today, Mike Mackonen,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.990
can give us an insight into
the culture of the societies

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.860
from whose collections,
this division,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.390
this division's collections
is made up of.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.340
So, we invite people who bring
in films, who have photographs,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.620
who have artwork, that
illustrate and that speak

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.290
to the culture of our 78 countries.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.750
So today we have Michael
Mackonen, and he's the director

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.060
of a wonderfully beautiful
type of film, Heaven and Earth.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.420
And we are very much looking
forward to his, to the film.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.700
There's a special aspect
of the Ethiopian Society,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.010
and here to introduce
him is our own scholar

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.870
and specialist, Fentahun Tiruneh.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.580
A program designed
to focus on the life

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.920
of African immigrants
in the United Kingdom.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.730
In his radio broadcasting career
with the BBC World Service,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.350
Mackonen produced and

and other African musicians
and artists.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.790
Mackonen made three
documentary films,

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.660
including the Ethiopian

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.230
on the brief history of
Ethiopian philosophy, in 2009.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.790
In 2011, Secret Art, a history
of modern art and art education

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.240

perspective of the biography

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.710
of Aller Felagasalam

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.890
And Heaven and Earth,
Church Education

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.550
and Monastic Culture
in Ethiopia, in 2015.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.040
Mackonen at the moment
is doing research

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.950
to make a two-hour documentary
on the political history

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.600
of Ethiopia from 1900 onwards.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.020
Mackonen is also a qualified
youth and community worker,

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.780
who involves in different
ethnic minority community

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.650
and youth projects in London.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.880
Mackonen Mikhail is married
and is a father of three.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.680
Please welcome Mackonen Mikhail.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:22.090
[ Applause ]

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:30.260
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much for your
generous description of me.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.560
Wonderful.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.110
Thank you very much.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:44.780
My experience in the visual
media has started since 2005,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:52.540
when I was involved with the
different youth community projects,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.840
video projects.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.510
And after that, I was involved
in lots of community projects,

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.410
video projects, in London.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.610
And that was the beginning.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.420
But I came across with
the African cultures,

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.830 position:56%
I'm a cultural documentary filmmaker
at the moment, independent.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:18.310
Mainly focused on northeastern
African history and culture.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.420
This particular documentary,
Heaven and Earth,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.430
is a fifteen-minute documentary
on the philosophical aspect

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.830
of Ethiopian history,
which is church education

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.520
and monastic culture.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.280
The reason why I call it Heaven
and Earth, on my research,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.640
when I travel around, to the
northern part of Ethiopia,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.480
the highland Ethiopia,
the landscape,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:48.840 position:56%
the beauty of the country, the
color, the society, and the devotion

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:56.850
of the people who lived in the
monastery, the nuns and the priests

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.790
and all that, is very heavenly.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:04.620
And their day-to-day life
and hardship is also earth.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.510
So, I tried to just
make some comparison.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:16.530
Heaven and Earth, so all
together in that part of the land.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.070
Traveling to do this documentary
in Ethiopia is very easy,

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.320
because the roads are now really
really good, especially when you go

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:31.880 position:56%
to the mountains and to the remote
part of the church, the monasteries.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.950
But it is life-changing, and
such a privilege and wonderful.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.530
I am privileged to
involve with such kind

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.830
of amazing documentarian journey.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:53.770
And I met very, very interesting
individuals, spiritual people,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:00.730
priests and nuns and
monks, and Ethiopianists,

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.680
Ethiopian historians
and intellectuals.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.630
And with all that I have
privileged to involve

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.650
in such a wonderful project.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.740
So this particular film,
Heaven and Earth, as I said,

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.910
dealing with the factual
account of the Church education,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:32.240
which is the quality in Amharic,
and the monastic culture,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.150
which is back to 2000 years.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:43.020
And it is very difficult to
compile everything in 15 minutes,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.440
the architecture, the
literature, the music,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.700
all together to make a
15 minute documentary.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.320 position:56%
All this together is very difficult.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.710
But it is an introductory,
very informative,

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.880
and give some very
selective ideas what is going

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.080
on in the past 2000
years in Ethiopia.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.560
And the fundamental education
and the fundamental philosophy.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.070
You will see on the
documentary that it can show

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.330
that which is a continuation.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:24.720
So I'm going to have a plan to
make Part 2, and then Part 3,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.690
probably apart from
focusing on the literature

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.750
and choreography and the language.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.950
Part 3, I may go to the deeper
understanding and research

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.130
on the Ethiopian music, from
Yared [assumed spelling] to today.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.750
That's my next project.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:54.200
I hope you will enjoy the film,
and we are going to have a question

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.400
and answer after the session,
and thank you for coming.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.510
Thank you very much.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:28.510
[ Applause ]

00:12:28.510 --> 00:56:54.510
[ Inaudible video ]

00:56:54.510 --> 00:57:00.920
[ Applause ]

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:04.040
&gt;&gt; Hope you enjoyed it.

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:14.540
It's -- before we go into the
question and answer session,

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:20.630
I just want to give a little
appreciation to people who help me

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:25.010
when I do this documentary film.

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:29.770
As you can see, I travel a lot,

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:35.560
because to make different
captures from different areas.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:42.480
And I didn't really
made it as I want,

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.050
because as an independent
filmmaker, I fund myself.

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:51.260
Most of the funding come from
my own, and my family money.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.810
And my wife is here.

00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:55.500
I'm sure she really
appreciate this now.

00:57:55.500 --> 00:58:01.120
And it's a struggle at
the moment, at the time.

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:07.590
I really thank the Habitat
Preservation Authority in Ethiopia.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:16.660
It's a brilliant team there
with [inaudible] my good friend,

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:23.760
the former director, and Yonas
Distat [assumed spelling],

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.240 position:56%
his successor, and some other people

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:34.350
who actually helped
with this documentary.

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:41.340
And little funding from the UNESCO.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.820
I really appreciate that.

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:49.570
And the Ethiopian Airlines.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:58.980
They been through help me
even for my trip today here.

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:07.810
They give me travel, they
cover my travel costs.

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:17.990
And they are willing to use
this film to their in-flight,

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:21.750
in negotiations at the moment.

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.280
That's brilliant stuff.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:30.120
And I already talked with
Dr. Johann [inaudible],

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:34.010
without our time I
couldn't come here.

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:41.790
A fellow brother and an academic.

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:49.390
We have a plan to do
more work on this,

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:58.370
because he has more
content knowledge.

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:00.670
I'm a filmmaker.

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:01.970
I'm an artist.

01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:06.060
But with the collaboration
with both of us, I hope,

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:10.050
together to more documentary
to count.

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:16.750
And I am really, really humbled
and honored to show my film

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:20.140
in this prestigious
center, [inaudible]

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.730
and my [inaudible] as well.

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:25.300
It is a privilege and I
hope our relationship will,

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:30.210
and this kind of work
will be continued.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:40.010
And my friend Mat Andreas
[assumed spelling] also here,

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:41.310
photographing me.

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:50.690
And never know if I look
good or not for you.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:57.230
Show me later.

01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:00.060
That's brilliant.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:13.020
I'm so privileged to
do this documentary.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.700
Although it's my own idea.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:23.910
I wrote it and directed
it and produced it.

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:34.740
But lots of people -- I can't
name everybody, call everybody --

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:44.510
but lots of people helped
me to do this documentary.

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:50.680
My cinematographic technician
is a wonderful cameraman,

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:59.780 position:56%
and the soundtrack music made by
Terry Mack is an Ethiopian composer,

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.700
and I really thank him as well.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:09.350
He's been there with me throughout.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:13.750
And thank you.

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:18.810
So I'm here to answer
any question you have.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:20.110
Thank you.

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.960
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to
thank you [inaudible].

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.420
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.470
&gt;&gt; So I have just a
general question,

01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:31.640
but I thought it might
capture [inaudible].

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.660
And he said something which
I thought was striking.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:41.700
He said, those traditions
[inaudible] ancient times,

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.900
but there's always something new.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:50.910
And I was wondering
if there's something

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:56.980
that will come again and again.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:06.720
It's all a tradition, but
there's also something new.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.020
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:13.890
&gt;&gt; I wanted you to elaborate
on the old and the new.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:17.030
&gt;&gt; Yes. As you can see, when I --

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:21.720
from the lake and cut to these
small cottage student houses,

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:30.240
and you see this door, when it
is shut down, you see that tells

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.310
that the religious
school, in English.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:37.110
Never been there before.

01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:38.740
It was there.

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.240
That's one of the modernities.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.100
And Amharic -- it used to be
but it is now, even on liturgy

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:50.550
in the church ceremony,
on the worship also.

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:52.190 position:56%
They are now Amharic also take over.

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:55.410
So, people now learn
English in very fast paced.

01:03:55.410 --> 01:04:00.260
Youngsters in that area are
speaking very, very good English.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.890
Probably better than me.

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:04.080
That is also a sign of modernity.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.020
And of change.

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:09.750
And on that particular premises,
when I talked to the teacher,

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:15.730
he explains in details about
the levels, the criterias,

01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:21.130
of being a colo tamani [assumed
spelling] or traditional student.

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:24.420
So it is very, very
fascinating, because I stayed

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.380
about three four days
there with the students.

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.180
And I didn't put lots of pictures,
because I kind of put everything

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.480
for forty-five and
fifty minute film.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.780
But it's so fascinating
how they are really,

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.080
the system by itself is very
fierce, and then you have

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.380
to really prepare yourself,
read every day.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.680
Every second.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:35.980
So with a very strong
repetitive reading,

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.280
then you start reciting by heart.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.580
So that's one of the criteria.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.880
So difficult.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.180
That didn't change till then.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.480
There's no much difference.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.780
But the system, a little
bit changed.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.080
I don't know to some
extent, they said that back

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.380
in the days it was
very, very difficult.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.680
It was very strong.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.980
The life, the daily
life is still the same.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.280
Very difficult for them.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.580
Even back in the days [inaudible],
everybody, all the students,

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.880
youngsters, all are
surviving with begging

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.180
and supported by the community.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.480
That's the same.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.780
But now and then, there are
elements of things are really new.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.080
And still the same for the
past 1,500 years as well.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.380
And in my next project,
which I am already prepared,

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.680
is to focus in detail
on the education system,

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.980
and the [inaudible], and
the very, very fascinating.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.280
And mind-blowing investigation
we're going to do when we do that.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.580
This is as an introductory.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.880
The beginning, the first
part of the whole content.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.180
So that's the way.

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.480
Thank you.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.780
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:59.100
[ Inaudible comments ]

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.480
&gt;&gt; Yes, a very good question.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.780
It is declining.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.530
I'm the witness.

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:10.890 position:56%
Because on my -- from research till
I travel all this magnificent places

01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:16.380
and film and talk to the people
who live there, it is declining.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:24.250
And my film is not only informing
the heritage, the African heritage,

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.940
the identity we have, to
the rest of the world.

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:36.630
Or those stereotypes, the
Eurocentric ideologies.

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:40.020
Africa is rich in knowledge.

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.670
It is not always telling us

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:49.970
that without external agents,
we cannot move forward.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:51.650
That's not really right.

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:55.920
That's not true, and
we have to show that.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.760
These documentaries as an
internalist approach --

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:03.460
I am an Ethiopian,
although I live over 23,

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.120
24 years in England,
since my young age.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.420
I'm an Ethiopian.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:12.380
So such kind of documentary
in detail never been done

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:15.410
by an African filmmaker,
or documentary filmmaker.

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:18.870
So for me, is a kind
of research as well.

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:23.360
This documentary, or the idea
behind this documentary's identity,

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.250
is not of showing all the
beautiful landscape only.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:33.680
But look, we have this for the
past 1,500 years, or 2,000 years.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.510
And we should promote that.

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:38.290
We should embrace that.

01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.630
We should show to the
rest of the world.

01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:43.850
Identity is a key, I
think, in my concept.

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:49.470
We should know where we come
from, to know who we are.

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:53.740
And that is why I am
doing this documentary.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:58.320
It is -- as you can see, I
didn't really emphasize it is

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.620
just Ethiopian.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.920
It is Africa.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.940
It is black.

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.360
And we have country,
and we have philosophy,

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.980
and we have education system.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.730
And that should be the
center for our existence.

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:14.470
And to move forward.

01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:18.360
And we should come
together and work on that.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:25.220
I am always baffled when I
see that it's no a single,

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:30.640
not a single feature film made
about the Battle of Accra.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.340
We always say that we're
black, we have culture.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.750
We have to fight.

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.050
We have to research.

01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:39.350
We have to do that.

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:41.170
Why would it show that?

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.320
That is the beginning.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.070 position:56%
You did so many things in the world.

01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:52.700
The British made so many things,
including the colonialism.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.980
The colonial fight.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:09:00.490
Their fight, as a positive
acknowledgement.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:04.110
A single thing didn't do --
all this production companies

01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:08.130
and big black producers didn't do
anything about the Battle of Accra.

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:09.430
It's a shame.

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:13.820
I'm so angry, and I'm so really,
really baffled about this.

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.590
So this documentary is nothing
but to create awareness.

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:19.030
Let's get together.

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:20.590
Let's show this.

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:25.510
Why do we always talk about the --
the Battle of Accra is a triumph

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:36.190 position:56%
of black people against imperialism,
against the racism, probably.

01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:38.150
And Fascism.

01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:41.310
And everybody work for that.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:49.090
If we see the past history, the
number of black African-Americans

01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:53.660
who registered to go and fight
with Emperor Highness is amazing.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.520
If we go and check the
history about this.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:00.060
So I am always baffled about that.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:05.360
So this particular film
is to create awareness.

01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:11.090
&gt;&gt; Any more questions?

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:15.000
I was very intrigued by one section

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.120
where you showed the monastery
[inaudible] participating.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:26.070
And these kids have [inaudible]
very strict segregation

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:30.130
in monasteries and convents.

01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:38.410
And so I'm just wondering
how that comes about,

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:45.320
and if there's an intention
in traditional, where there is

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:50.140
that segregation by sexes, and
this one particular monastery

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:53.200
where this seems to coexist.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.340
&gt;&gt; Yes, well-spoken.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.380
I did it deliberately.

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:00.230
Because I select places,
when I do my film.

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:04.850
For example, people who know
the prestigious centers,

01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:12.800
and people who knows that the,
the well-known priest and monk.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.590
They say that why you
didn't go there?

01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:16.070
Why you didn't go here?

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:18.800
Because they know where
is it the best.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.830
But my film is for
the wider audience.

01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:26.460
And I see things in a way my
camera sees, what is nicer

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:32.750
and how I'm going to put or
give my message on the screen.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:35.040
But as you said, yes.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.890
I selected that particular
both sexes coexistence.

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:42.720
And they have no problem.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.780
They live together in peace,
and they pray together.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.080
There's no problem.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:54.660 position:56%
Of course there are some monasteries
that are very, very divided and only

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.570
for men and only for women.

01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:57.870
Yeah. There are as well.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:04.590
But this is my personal selection,
just to show the harmony.

Thank you for your comment.

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.180
Now as I see, on my research
as well as my filming,

01:14:54.180 --> 01:15:00.800
more than education is
now a universal thing.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.260 position:56%
I'm not advocating to change
everything in the educational system

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.490
of Ethiopia to bring
it to the quality.

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:07.790
That is impossible.

01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:10.050
That is just, you will know.

01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:16.490 position:56%
But what I'm trying to do, advocate,
is as a classical language of peace,

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:18.710
should be at [inaudible]
tried to mention that.

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:23.020
We should really give
just a subject,

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.260
because it is history,
culture, identity.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.320
We should really preserve that.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.300
That is the main thing
we have to rethink.

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:32.470
Like Greeks, they preserve
their language, you know?

01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:33.770
We should do that.

01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:38.350
That language is the same classic.

01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:43.100
So my point is that not to
change to the high school level.

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.960
No, it's not.

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.870
But I understand your comment.

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:52.160
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think we
have to close it here.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.030
And thank you all for coming.

01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:15:57.510 --> 01:16:11.190
