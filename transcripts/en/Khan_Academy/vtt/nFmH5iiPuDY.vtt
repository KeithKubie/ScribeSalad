00:00:00.657 --> 00:00:02.572
- A student was given a piece of rope

00:00:02.572 --> 00:00:04.731
and told to cut it into two equal pieces,

00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:06.867
keep one piece, and pass the other piece

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:07.947
to the next student.

00:00:07.947 --> 00:00:10.432
Each student was to repeat this process

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:11.732
until every student in the class

00:00:11.732 --> 00:00:13.972
had exactly one piece of rope.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.155
Which of the following
could be the fraction

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.150
of the original rope that
one of the students had?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.797
So the key realization
here is that each student

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:22.829
is going to have--

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.351
The first student's going
to have half the rope,

00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:25.408
and then each student after that's

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:26.986
going to have half of that.

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:28.750
So all of the possible fractions

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.329
are going to be powers of 2.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.929
So one-half, one-half times 2,

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:34.811
one-half times one-half is one-fourth,

00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:36.993
one-half to the third power is one-eighth,

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:40.209
one-half to the fourth
power is one-sixteenth.

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:41.334
And we could keep going,

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:44.272
but lucky for us we
already see the choice.

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:45.746
One-sixteenth.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:47.488
Now, just to make that
a little bit clearer,

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:49.043
let's work it out a little bit more.

00:00:49.043 --> 00:00:50.251
Just in case that seemed a little bit

00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:52.585
too hand-wavey for you.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.452
So the first student,
you have the whole rope,

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:59.166
cuts it in half and keeps half of it,

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.351
and hands that half--

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.592
So, they get to keep half,

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:04.507
and then hands the remaining half

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:05.343
to the next student.

00:01:05.343 --> 00:01:08.443
So the next student has that half,

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:10.589
but then has to cut it in half.

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:13.143
And so that student is
going to be able to keep

00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:15.222
what I just circled, one-fourth,

00:01:15.222 --> 00:01:17.382
and then that's half of a half,

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:18.473
which is one-fourth.

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:19.970
And then hand that one-fourth over

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.271
to the next student.

00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:23.349
The next student is going
to keep half of that,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.311
which I just circled,

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:25.485
which is one-eighth.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:26.286
And I think you get--

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.688
You see the general idea here.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:32.507
This is one-half, this is one-fourth,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.482
this is one-eighth.

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:35.886
One-half to the first power,

00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:37.140
one-half to the second power,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.371
one-half to the third power,

00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.031
and you could keep on going.

00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:42.388
And of course, one-half
to the fourth power

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:43.989
if we go one more step.

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:45.325
We go one more step,

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:47.066
so now you have one-eighth of a rope

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.191
and the student cuts it in half

00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.515
and keeps half of it.

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:53.975
That's one-sixteenth right over there.

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:55.671
Which is what we actually picked.
