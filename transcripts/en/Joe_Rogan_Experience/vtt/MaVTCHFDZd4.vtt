WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.760
Boom, and we're live. Yeah.

2
00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:06.180
The first guy with a high top ever to wear these mind.

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:09.010
I was wondering whether or not the microphones were gonna sit with perfect.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.880
Yeah. This is right in this little crevice fluffy like a little rest area.

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.490
Does that help? This haven't that much here on the top of your head.

6
00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:19.510
Is there any benefit of that?

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.030
I think when you get like elbowed or anything like that,

8
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:23.680
I think it helps out a ton. Like if someone,

9
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:26.320
if you have someone in their guard and they're trying to elbow the top of your

10
00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:29.290
head, I would imagine. Yeah, it's a little cushion on it.

11
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:32.500
So I think it protects you and I kind of grew up the bed for that.

12
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.770
Kind of that same reason. But it doesn't get as burly as I kind of wanted to.

13
00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:39.430
But it works. I think in boxing they used to make people shave their beard.

14
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.570
Yeah. That's probably why impact I, you know that kid desi green,

15
00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:46.710
I used to live with him, he's in the UFC also. And, um,

16
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.050
whenever I put that guy in the g cause he has these big dreads and he would

17
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:54.460
always get out of them because the dreads were like it gave his head and made

18
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:55.900
his head appear like it was bigger.

19
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.290
So you wrap around it and you squeezed the cushion and it just compresses and

20
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.550
then he just, his head just slides out of it completely. Ah,

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.160
so it's like a cheat code. Slippery, slippery dreadlocks.

22
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.420
I would also imagine though that having a bald head if you get sweaty would make

23
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:14.530
it a little grease here. Like if you have stubble like on the top of your head,

24
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:17.590
that would provide like a little bit of friction. Yeah, it makes sense.

25
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.520
I follow you. I follow you on that. I haven't had a bullet head though,

26
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.730
so I don't, I I start for me to know.

27
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.260
I like how your shirt even has a gold chain on it.

28
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.110
I was going to wear the big boy chain today but as done, I dunno. I Dunno.

29
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.070
You only carry that out when you fight. I usually do.

30
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:35.770
I try to keep it not like too ridiculous all the time, you know?

31
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.920
Try to be like only in character, like make it for like,

32
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.180
like a special occasion type of thing. There's even,

33
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.920
I would consider this a special occasion,

34
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:45.040
but I try to make it more of a like a MMA thing. Oh,

35
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:47.920
there's something extra special about a tee shirt with gold chain on it at all.

36
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.730
It might be more special than an actual gold chain itself. Hey works.

37
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.510
So it's kind of silly. You got man up. How much does that thing weigh?

38
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:58.270
The real one. I'm not very heavy.

39
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.730
[inaudible] it's like 10 pounds now.

40
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:03.340
I wish it was 10 pounds every 10 pounds of gold. But uh,

41
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.240
it's not as nice as like an Easter, uh, Easter Bunny Combo.

42
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.780
Yeah, it's holidays. That thing is massive. Right? Susan Hollow.

43
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.190
They're like hollow tubes. Yeah. You think that'd be so heavy you think?

44
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.830
I get a lot of people that come up to me and start grabbing my chain. I'm like,

45
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.540
Yo, this is supposed to be a mystery. You know today that you have in mind,

46
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.900
you're not supposed to know what this feels like. You know, it's really like

47
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.350
them. The illusion that I spent like $25,000 on the vas go rope chain.

48
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:36.310
But uh Nah.

49
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.330
Well you remember when rampage used to where the motorcycle chain links? Yeah.

50
00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:45.100
Real heavy links around his neck. I was gonna actually go, there was two routes.

51
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:47.590
I was gonna go the old school rail with my chain,

52
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:51.310
like the way my dad used to wear it and how we used to wear when we were kids or

53
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.720
rampage Jackson and be like the new generation of rampage Jackson.

54
00:02:55.721 --> 00:02:57.040
Even though I wasn't like slamming people,

55
00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:00.120
but I would have to like somehow work that of this. Yeah,

56
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.630
<v 1>that's rampage still fighting crazy. Crazy. You know,</v>

57
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.300
it's still competitive after all these years.

58
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:11.260
I mean rampage was a fucking pioneer man. Yeah.

59
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.070
I remember his fight with Chuck Liddell has fights with Vandelay Silva.

60
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.000
Even the one he lost in our pride when he went through the ropes and then he

61
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.490
came back and got redemption. I was like, God, that's gotta feel so good.

62
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.320
Cause that's like the bad highlight.

63
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:24.970
And he came back and got a highlight of his own.

64
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.090
So I think he lost a Vandelay twice and yeah,

65
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.560
he got stopped twice in pride and then flat Vandelay in the UFC. Yep.

66
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.580
I also think, man, it's hard, it's speculation.

67
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.210
But I also think that the Vandelay that he fought in UFC was the one that got

68
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:44.180
drug tested. Yup. 100% different. Vandelay yeah.

69
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.300
I think there's a lot of that for a lot of people too. Um, a lot I don't like,

70
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.150
don't like saying, I don't like saying it cause you know what it is.

71
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.600
I feel like I see these people and then it's like,

72
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.700
I know you might've heard me say this,

73
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.450
so it's like that little awkward tension and I don't like that man. I know.

74
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.700
Yeah. Yeah. You're a good guy. It gets weird.

75
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.800
But it is a thing that if you look at it historically,

76
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:07.450
if you look at the sport in terms of like,

77
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.230
like when people look at Barry bonds and when they look at Jose Canseco or when

78
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:18.130
they look at, uh, what's that other dude's name? The Dude Mark Maguire.

79
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.140
Yeah. Or Sammy Sosa.

80
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.150
Everyone knows those dudes were juice heads. That's just a part of the thing.

81
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.040
So you go, well, they're amazing baseball players.

82
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.340
Incredible athletes also were on the sauce. Yeah.

83
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.320
Fact does that take away from it though? That's, that's my o's. That's,

84
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.940
it's hard to say, right, because everybody was on it. Yeah.

85
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.420
Do you know there's a great documentary that's out right now by Billy corban.

86
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:44.050
He's the same guy who did a, he did cocaine cowboys one and two.

87
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.470
He's got a new one out about a rod. Okay. What is it called?

88
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.890
I gotta check that up. Screw Ball. Screw Ball.

89
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.120
It's hilarious. But it's about the fighter, the, the players that uh,

90
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.610
it was about how a debt,

91
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.880
how owing a roid doctor some money who will turned into this horrible revelation

92
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.430
where they found out how,

93
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.760
how these baseball players were getting their juice from that guy.

94
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.290
Cause they owed somebody some money. This guy and that guy didn't get paid.

95
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:15.550
So he went public with everything.

96
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:19.360
So it was like a small amount and they had a bunch of kids,

97
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:23.500
like these little kids play the doctor and play a Rod.

98
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.170
So like in the movie, the reenactments,

99
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.940
the reenactments were all done by children. That's hysterical. I'll do that.

100
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.330
You got to check that out. It's hilarious. It's a funny movie. This is fun.

101
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.050
Yeah, they, he gets really fun.

102
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.340
That's a rod as a child. It's fucking really funny man. Um, man,

103
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.680
what's it called? Just a screwball. Screwball. Yeah.

104
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.100
Well Billy corban is a genius. He's a really,

105
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:50.410
really great director and he, like I said,

106
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.740
he directed two of my favorite cocaine documentaries of all time,

107
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.830
cocaine cowboys one and two. Have you seen those? No. Okay.

108
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:01.610
Don't even look at screw ball yet. I haven't even seen narcos. Oh Geez.

109
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.800
I'm like, I'm trying to catch up. There's so much.

110
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.400
So much content out there is hard. Do you fuck with stranger things?

111
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.840
I've got to get into that too. A Guy, I just started black mirror.

112
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.310
I'm on season three and that just started like opening my eyes. I'm like, man,

113
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.060
technology is like, it could be used in such fucked up ways. It's crazy.

114
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.390
[inaudible] bomber was right. The Unabomber was correct. Yeah.

115
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.160
That show fucks me up more than any show because it's so close to possible.

116
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.960
Yes. Especially episode one. Season one with the pig. Oh yeah.

117
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:36.650
That was the one that got me most was crocodile.

118
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.220
The one where there's the,

119
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.360
the car accident and they hide the body and then the lady one's up doing all

120
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:45.920
these different things to cover up her crime. Now. Read People's memories.

121
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.650
You can get people's memories and you'd watch them play. Oh,

122
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:52.250
rewatch that one I saw freaky. Yeah. Well the one,

123
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:56.980
the lady did terrible things. Yeah. I'm like, ah. Oh. It's a seasonal way.

124
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.460
Oh. Oh, okay. Well I don't want to tell you anything. You're going to,

125
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.140
you're going to shit, but I didn't even ruin it. It's that good.

126
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.590
There is one though with the, with the memory. Yes. The guy and the girlfriend.

127
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.460
The girl's cheating. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fucked up. Yeah. That's fucked up.

128
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.000
It's all coming, man. That's all coming. I've been talking about this on stage,

129
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.780
like how good is your memory? You know, cause my memory's not that good.

130
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.850
Like if I tried to remember things that happened yesterday,

131
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:23.480
if I had to draw everything I saw yesterday, it's not that good.

132
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.340
Like even if you say your memory's good,

133
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.500
it's your recollection of actual things. So you don't have a video memory.

134
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.020
But if you had a video memory, wouldn't it be like that's,

135
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.710
that would be a first thing that we surrender.

136
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.020
If they could put a champion second, the aljamain listen,

137
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.260
wouldn't it be amazing if you could pull every technique and see it exactly as

138
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.820
it should be done. You could see it play out in front of your head.

139
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.600
You could see all of your memories. All of them. Exactly. So you have no,

140
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.530
like if your girlfriend says, you told me, Yo don't know. I didn't say that.

141
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.450
This is what I said, I'll play it for you right now.

142
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.380
That that's gonna they're gonna. That's how they're gonna get us. Yeah.

143
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.220
But it's Kinda scary. And they showed it. The guy was able to freeze frame the,

144
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.570
the the guy's memories with his wife? Yes. And then it was like,

145
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.350
that's my, that's my picture in the background. And she was like, oh,

146
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:14.850
it was only like a one week thing and then it's like, oh,

147
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.400
do you like a one book thing that turned into like yesterday? Yeah.

148
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.460
That's fucked up. That was fucked up good though. Yeah.

149
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.060
I don't think I want that. That would be, I want it as it used to be.

150
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.790
I want to know, I want to know what I'm dealing with.

151
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.790
I think we're going to, I don't think it's, I don't think we have a choice.

152
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.790
I think it's common. I think it's inevitable. I'm going to rebel.

153
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.100
You're going to have great rebellion. I'll be the leader. Imagine if like a,

154
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.290
they just figured out way. I mean,

155
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.160
when you're thinking about people that have CTE and brain damage and car

156
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.590
accidents and football and fighting and all these different things,

157
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.200
what if they say, listen to some week, we'd fix all that,

158
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.060
fix all that with this chip. It

159
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.500
<v 0>just, it rewires the whole brain. You're fine.</v>

160
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.390
And it provides you with that video memory.

161
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.830
So you could have your entire MMA career never worry about CTE.

162
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.880
You could just swing for the fences like right.

163
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.780
Like lamas and Max Holloway did this down in the middle of the octagon swing.

164
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:16.620
No worries. Just Bang. Yeah. But then if you did that,

165
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.260
then what about like Parkinson's or anything like that?

166
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:23.190
Would that still be a thing? Or if that wasn't a thing, then I'd be all for it.

167
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.380
But also, oddly enough,

168
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.330
I think that part of what makes MMA so exciting is that there was crazy

169
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:31.170
consequences.

170
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.890
That's part of the reasons why when you see like Mazda doll knocks out.

171
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.510
Ben Ask for him without flying knee. Part of why I was so excited, like, oh,

172
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.530
he's hurt bad. It's not that he's going to be fine.

173
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.120
Nothing's no damage from this whatsoever. Like, no, that's real damage.

174
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.360
Like he went out cold instantly and then he got punched in the face twice as

175
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.410
part of what, it's terrible.

176
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.490
But it's part of what makes this sport so exciting is that you realize these

177
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:03.750
guys are so brave to face these potential consequences. Yeah, makes it,

178
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.890
it makes it, this is like an added element of danger that makes it exciting.

179
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.990
It's very true, but it's, man, I feel so bad for him when that,

180
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:15.900
when I saw that because it kind of brought back memories for myself. I was like,

181
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.970
ah, I know exactly what that moment feels like.

182
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.940
I don't remember it but I know exactly what that moment feels like.

183
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.900
When you fought Mariah's, do you remember what happened up to that? Yeah,

184
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.670
and you just don't remember it landing.

185
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.810
I S I saw like right before lens and it was like, you know when those movies,

186
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:34.970
when it goes, it was at this very moment he realized he fucked up.

187
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.140
That's exactly what that was for me and out like a light man and I didn't like

188
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:43.470
come too and like,

189
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.400
I mean I woke up but I didn't come to like actually remember like shit.

190
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:51.870
I was in a fist fight and I lost like really bad like really quick when I got

191
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:54.370
into the hospital and like that's when you realized, yeah,

192
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.300
I heard Ben say the same thing. I was like, oh, this is not just me.

193
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:58.920
I guess he's just a really bad knockout.

194
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.330
Him shooting forward and Mazda dog jumping into him like a car crash man and

195
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:08.331
Mazda dolls running full clip that was a 40 yard dash running full clip and

196
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.070
perfect placement of the knee. I mean you don't get a cleaner knockout. No.

197
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.720
And uh, just the way he did it,

198
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:19.710
like he was showing a video of him practicing it and saying he had like three

199
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:21.990
different scenarios of how that situation could have went.

200
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.930
That's like masterful thinking tactical.

201
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:28.050
Like there's not a lot of people who are that cerebral when it comes to the

202
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:29.870
game. And I think the way he broke that down,

203
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.000
it was just super impressive and he kind of lowered him to sleep like his hands

204
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:35.790
behind his back and I loved every second of that cause you'd want to show what

205
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:38.850
was about to happen. I was on the edge of my seat, that was my main event fight.

206
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.280
And then he just comes out, takes a side step,

207
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:45.960
like just drifts off to the right and at boom 40 yard dash and fly me Kale.

208
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.950
It was just as much a main meant for me too because it's so important for the

209
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:54.220
welterweight division. Whereas like John Jones versus Tiago Santos,

210
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.950
it was an interesting fight and it turned out to be a great fight,

211
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.170
but it was an interesting fight because you're like, okay,

212
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:02.980
how is John Jones going to beat this guy and is this guy going to be wild enough

213
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:05.410
to catch Jon Jones? But when you looked at it on paper,

214
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:09.030
John was a prohibitive favorite when you looked at aspirin versus Mazda Denali.

215
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.510
You like, man, I don't know. Yeah. When I looked at Holly and Amanda, I'm like,

216
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.640
Holly's a great champion and she's a great fighter,

217
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:17.380
but Amanda is so God damn good.

218
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.690
It's almost like she doesn't have anybody else left to fight.

219
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:23.500
It's not like Holly had made this incredible case for her being the one to

220
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:24.700
challenge Amanda next.

221
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.440
It was just that man is kind of cleaned out that bantamweight division. Yeah,

222
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.350
she fought one person.

223
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.070
She beat Megan Anderson and I felt like she struggled with that fight.

224
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.670
The only way she, I felt like she'd done really well when she was able to get,

225
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.880
uh, Megan down to the ground. But when she was in a clinic,

226
00:12:38.881 --> 00:12:42.580
she ate a lot of knees. This is Holly. And then she tried to do the same thing.

227
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.210
The previous fight was Cyborg and she ate a lot of knees into clench trying to

228
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:48.490
slow cyborg down it, it just didn't work out in her favor.

229
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:50.110
So when that matchup was announced, I was like,

230
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.290
he's going to either stay on her bike the entire time and just try to appoint

231
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:57.610
fight or it's just not gonna end up good. And sure enough, that's what happened.

232
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.061
Yeah,

233
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:00.880
I thought she was gonna probably try to stay on her bike as well and throw kicks

234
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:03.400
from the outside. But I guess Amanda had planned for it.

235
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.360
That's why she caught her with her leg up. You know,

236
00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:09.460
if you see the way she landed that round kick, she caught her with her leg up,

237
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:12.820
like she was like, like pressing with that sidekick and then boom,

238
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.920
kind of that roundhouse kicked right across the top.

239
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.980
And Holly's such a good girl. She's such a good person yet.

240
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.940
That was almost too nice. But then you feel bad for yeah,

241
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:25.720
but I know what you mean. And she, she did, she didn't make a great case,

242
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:29.950
like you said, for the title fight, but there was really no one else for her to,

243
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.001
there's nobody. Well,

244
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:34.990
once she beat up Raquel Pennington the way she did and then once she goes up and

245
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:37.930
destroys Cyborg, it's like who else is there?

246
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.700
We were at cal painting is like as tough as they come. Yeah. And she,

247
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:45.160
she was battering her. Which way she put away Ronda,

248
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.000
the way she put away Misha, she just smashes people. It's scary. I think it's,

249
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.160
it's her HSA, Vanko sideboard and then everybody else.

250
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.040
I think you're 100% right. And I think that's an interesting fight.

251
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.640
She might decide, I don't know if she can make one 25 but if she just,

252
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.620
I don't know, she's a big girl,

253
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.780
but if she decides or if she chanko decides to step up one more time to one 35

254
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:10.060
and tries to become champ champ and beat her,

255
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.240
I mean they had a really fucking close fight, especially that second fight.

256
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.580
That second fight was very, very close.

257
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.100
I didn't know who to even really score for it, but uh, yeah.

258
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:20.590
And Valentino made a case at the end that she thought that she had one,

259
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.940
but it was a very good fight.

260
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.570
His point is Shevchenko obviously when you see her knockout Jessica high who

261
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:27.370
used to be a top band and way contender herself,

262
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:32.670
she's one of the rare girls that like Amanda and like Cyborg can flatline women

263
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:36.340
with one shot. The scary man is scary. W those,

264
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.760
those ladies hit hard. Yeah.

265
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.490
And her kicking technique is just exemplary. You know,

266
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.010
Valentina is so good on her feet. Her kicking is so nasty, man.

267
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.410
She has one of the cleanest spinning back kicks in the sport.

268
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.670
You don't even see a comment. Yeah. The way she just,

269
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.170
I liked the way she hops up and down.

270
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:57.820
It kind of reminds me of like a little Cooper and a Mario brothers cause she's

271
00:14:57.821 --> 00:15:01.550
like hop and then she move inside. Step in check, hug. Like boom, boom,

272
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:03.590
spinning back kick out of nowhere. Yeah.

273
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.860
It's like she's a weird combination of Moitai and karate. Yeah.

274
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.450
She's got traditional martial art techniques but the like rock solid Moitai too.

275
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.410
It's the dancing I think for system. Yeah. Things. The dancing.

276
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.980
Well you know that's Loma chicos secret. That's one of his secrets.

277
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.420
I heard amazing boxing techniques. His Dad made him dance like traditional.

278
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.420
I think Ukrainian dancing make. Make sure that's right.

279
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.830
I don't want to fuck that up.

280
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.960
It's like some kind of traditional rushing dancing for like four years. Yeah.

281
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.990
Now I heard that he made him stop boxing for a bit so that he could focus on

282
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.420
dancing. That's what he did for four years.

283
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.870
That's a crazy makes sense.

284
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:44.330
I guess the footwork and everything cause going to do that though.

285
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:46.550
If they said aljamain listen, how old are you now? Hold you.

286
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.640
Now I'm 30 at the end of this. Okay, 34 is your prime.

287
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.010
This is what we're going to do next four years. You just get to dance.

288
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.430
He be like, what the fuck are you talking about? Wait a minute.

289
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.980
The hunt for the title right now, that close that close,

290
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:05.390
especially after Henry. So Hutto just beat Marlon. Arise like, Holy Shit.

291
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.810
There was, well, where are we? Where are we? Yeah, this is a hole.

292
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.860
We got a double champ situation here, right? You've got this crazy, crazy,

293
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:14.780
so crazy. That division is wide open.

294
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.190
I love how much the Bantamweight Division has heated up.

295
00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:24.191
It's been such a crazy ride for myself and just being a part of this and being

296
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:27.230
able to see like the wave and generations of different fighters coming in and

297
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:31.520
out. You know, I, you know, I was talking about it like El Nino,

298
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.520
you know Gilbert Melendez and seeing like when he was on the top and now he's

299
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.980
Kinda like his fight last fight. We'll all know. Alan's Kinda like,

300
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:41.030
you can just kind of see like the passing of the guard or maybe maybe he's just

301
00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:44.360
not. Uh, cause I know he popped a some type of PD also,

302
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:48.470
so maybe that was something to do with it or maybe 35 I think.

303
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:53.420
Or sold six. Yeah. And Arnold Allen's 25 and fucking nasty.

304
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:57.170
So young bull. Yeah. And he's being trained by Barraza Hobie who, I mean,

305
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.990
I don't think there's anybody better. Yeah. In terms of trainers,

306
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.230
I think there's like just as good or in the neighborhood of good,

307
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.480
but he's the fucking man as far as I'm concerned. Yeah.

308
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.620
And there's just this a lot of,

309
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.930
there's just a lot of hot prospects just coming out.

310
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.430
And I know you've got the Corey stand Hagens even Rivera.

311
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.960
I know Rivera lost two fights in a row now, but he still is tough as they come.

312
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.770
He was beating PD on until he got dropped that Yup. Rounds One and two.

313
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.440
He won round three even having his nose busted up and everything.

314
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.010
Got Pyotr Yon though, man. He is a seasoned Stryker.

315
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.540
It's really interesting to see him with a guy like Jimmy who relies on his power

316
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:31.110
and his toughness and you know,

317
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.670
it was bulldog tenacity to see him get lit up in those two rounds.

318
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.910
And so yon just set traps and look for openings.

319
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:41.000
And then when he finally found them, he just called him rack some. Yeah,

320
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.410
I mean it's a really exciting division right now. Real exciting.

321
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.200
That might be my next fight though. Him for the belt. I would hope.

322
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.940
I would think that would be the next fight and I'm, I'm,

323
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.240
I kinda liked that match up.

324
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.410
He actually tried to punk me at the EPI center last week. It was kind of,

325
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.530
it was funny. At the same time I was like, dude, I am not really understanding.

326
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.520
And then on my left side I got, I'm getting worked on, I got know [inaudible],

327
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.880
whatever her name is, she's on my left side and she's getting worked on.

328
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.580
And then I didn't know there were teammates. So he comes in,

329
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:11.640
he's like the mirror he's doing like the thumb things like slashing his throat.

330
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.100
I start busting out laughing and I show him the bell and,

331
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.320
and I started slashing my throat and I'm like, yeah, you know,

332
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:18.750
I'm going to get the strap, whatever. So he, they, he comes in,

333
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:21.270
he comes in with his camera crew and uh,

334
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.130
it starts to go a little bit back and forth,

335
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:25.020
but I can understand he doesn't really speak English,

336
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.500
so I guess he said something and then she translate out of nowhere. So I'm like,

337
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:31.650
I'm getting ganged up on right now. And she's like, he says,

338
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:34.530
why are you afraid to fight him in Moscow? And I was like, Whoa,

339
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.900
what did I just come from? But I looked back at him like,

340
00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:39.480
no one's ever told him no one's afraid to fight him. And then I thought,

341
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:42.810
I thought about it. I was like, wait, motherfucker, who is ranked higher?

342
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:45.900
You don't call the shots. I call the shots. I was like, you're not dean away.

343
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:48.000
You're not showing Showbie or you fight where I said,

344
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:50.220
you're going to fight or wherever Dana says we're gonna fight. So don't,

345
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.550
don't sit here and try to like act like everyone was afraid to fight you.

346
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:56.310
I'm like one, I don't want to go to Moscow to fight. That's one.

347
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.240
I will hopefully admit that he live in Russia.

348
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.620
He tr he lives in, I thinks he's from Siberia. She what? I know,

349
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.400
but I know he trains Taiga Moitai okay, that's right.

350
00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:13.050
So he trains in Thailand and he lives or he's from the coldest,

351
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.060
most dangerous part of the world. Great. Yeah.

352
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.280
I'm not looking to go there and fight their guy and like, I mean if I have to,

353
00:19:20.281 --> 00:19:22.410
I will. Is there a Moscow cards scheduled?

354
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:27.690
There was talkings of it and I think November. Oh, upcoming. Yeah. Yeah.

355
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.660
Oh Wow. Cool experience. But it's not,

356
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.040
not an ideal thing for me in terms of financial situation. Getting out there,

357
00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:36.870
paying the taxes. I'm like, dude, this, that's just,

358
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.220
I just rather be home somewhere. Yeah. Like I don't care. Fuck worry.

359
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.440
If I find him in the fucking bathroom,

360
00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:45.900
I would have fought him in the PII center if he was acting, you know, if he,

361
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:49.050
if he deserved it. But it is what it is. I'm like, dude, no one's afraid to,

362
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:50.640
I'm a fighter. I don't understand what fighters.

363
00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:54.260
Try to intimidate fighters and make it look like it'd be fighting a cage. Right.

364
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.300
You know? It's like, dude, but it does work.

365
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.350
The thing is like fucking with people's heads is real. Yeah. This is true.

366
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.650
It is true. Like best example chosen,

367
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.050
y'all was one of the greatest fighters of all time. I really believe that.

368
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:10.470
He was out of his composure when he fought Connor and that's one of the reasons

369
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:13.920
why I charged after Connor and Connor cracked him with that straight left.

370
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.370
It's like Connor was in his head that he was working in the back room when he

371
00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:21.540
was like, yeah, that's unreal. Unreal, unreal.

372
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:23.190
I mean he planned it out. He knew it was coming.

373
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.910
It's like Mazda doll practicing that flying knee against aspirin.

374
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.230
It's really similar. Yeah.

375
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.400
It's like you know tendencies and you also know emotions and he just wanted to

376
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:36.960
get at Connor so bad that he kind of knew he was coming. So you're like,

377
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.740
get him some faints, hot brown, throw some sidekicks, hop around,

378
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.920
knows he's coming back and as he's coming catches on me.

379
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.210
Perfect scent coming in. Like again,

380
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:47.710
similar because they're both coming at each other. Yeah.

381
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:51.700
Charging in and getting caught. Crazy car crash. But I don't think,

382
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.500
I don't know if he really thinks he's going to intimidate me.

383
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:57.220
I don't know if that's what he thinks or I'm to do it. He's trying it.

384
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.660
It's a tie. A time honored, proven tactic. Yeah.

385
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.820
If you get inside someone's head, they get angry and one of two things happens.

386
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:07.090
Either they fuck you up more because now they're really personal about it.

387
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.160
You know, like, like Mazda doll. Yeah. Or it bothers them and they lose.

388
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:15.730
Some people lose, genuinely lose their composure if they don't like a fighter.

389
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.450
But say that the cowboy and Nate Diaz, that was an insane fight and that was,

390
00:21:21.451 --> 00:21:24.380
I think that's last time he probably ever let himself get mad. He said so,

391
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.110
but how's the learning experience? You know,

392
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:29.470
he realized that like that shit talking fucked with his head and you know,

393
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.570
but there's some guys who do better when they should talk. Yeah,

394
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.000
I think I perform better when there's more in the line.

395
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:38.080
Like when Pedro was talking shit to me, I didn't really understand it.

396
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:38.531
I was like, dude,

397
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:42.430
all I did was ask whatever happened with the results of your drug tests and that

398
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:45.560
turned into all fuck him. He's a bitch if he said that. And what happened?

399
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.290
Did he have a gay pop for something in 2015 when he was fought in Nova Scotia?

400
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.980
Um, it was, it, was it a diameter? It was that year.

401
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.160
There was like three or four guys from Black House and we made that all pop for

402
00:21:57.161 --> 00:21:59.530
something. And I can't remember all the names.

403
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:00.910
I know Kevin Casey was one of them.

404
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.670
Pedro was one of them and I think it was like two more other guys.

405
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:07.060
I think silver might've been one of them. Yeah. And it was one more guy.

406
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:12.220
Did you ever see Anderson's trainer? No, not Jackson Dude.

407
00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:16.180
He's not just Jack, he's Jack. Then he's like 68. He uh,

408
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.120
he's uh, he's old as the pyramids and built like a brick shit house.

409
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.690
This dude is fucking stacked. I mean full six pack,

410
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.070
giant packs arms. I got to see the wall is fuck Jamiel pull up a picture of him.

411
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.540
I should have doing a selfie. I mean look at that guy. Come on. Ah,

412
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.750
come on son. That dude is Jack Modified.

413
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.470
Do his absolute like a turtle shell look like a Ninja Turtle. Yeah.

414
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:44.680
Like you'd roundhouse kick him there and he would go nowhere. He left for you.

415
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.090
Huh? That's like a dude in 300. It comes down your head with an axe. Dude.

416
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.810
That's serious. So that was Anderson's trainer.

417
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:57.760
That dude is most likely aware of some Mexican supplements.

418
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.110
Probably like I would say so. I would say so. Yeah.

419
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:07.180
Let me come on man. That guy. Oh yeah.

420
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.700
Apparently a very good trainer too. So uh,

421
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:12.940
he was the strength and conditioning guy for Anderson for a lot of the black

422
00:23:12.941 --> 00:23:16.500
house guys, giving them a lot of strength. It gave him a lot of strategies

423
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.260
to speak in a straight to here.

424
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:24.220
And Mark Coleman and Ken shamrock are on a fight in some new band knuckle boxing

425
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:28.360
promotion. I didn't even see that announcement just today. Oh my Lord.

426
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.220
You know, I was like, oh no, how do we save this security? Bravo send it to me.

427
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.120
And I just looked at that, took a deep sigh like, oh,

428
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.260
I don't like seeing stuff like that. It makes me sad and I it,

429
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.300
it makes me wonder if I'm going to be like that when I get older and I'm like,

430
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:49.220
I hope to not hope when I walk away I just fucking walk away. I hope so too.

431
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:50.090
But then again,

432
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.780
if they're in a situation where they need money and something comes up like this

433
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:55.940
and they're willing to do it, why do I give a fuck? Like why?

434
00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:01.310
Why is it a thing where I am cool with young guys doing it if they need money,

435
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:04.940
but I'm not cool with guys that are 5,200 if they need money, like what is it?

436
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.670
I see your point, what I'm saying,

437
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.470
but it's like seeing the guy in their physical state and you're like, dude,

438
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:16.040
you should not be doing this right. So he's like, Yo, you, you're watching.

439
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.530
I don't know. It's almost like, I dunno. It's hard.

440
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.390
I don't really have an analogy for this right now.

441
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.220
I know exactly what you're saying though.

442
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.140
It's like you hope that they find a better life and they, they, they,

443
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.910
they hit the finish line. They're like,

444
00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:31.790
thank you very much during the hall of fame and then they move on.

445
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.150
That's what your hope. I'm hoping that's what I do. Get the fuck out.

446
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.600
Some people can do it, you know, make my money.

447
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:42.260
My favorite example in all combat sports is marvelous. Marvin Hagler,

448
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.580
Marvin Hagler,

449
00:24:43.581 --> 00:24:47.180
when he lost the sugar ray Leonard and a very disputed decision said that's it.

450
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.180
I'm done. Just walked away. Never came back.

451
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.850
A rematch with sugar ray Leonard would have been bananas.

452
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:53.750
He would've made so much money.

453
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:56.840
He was a middleweight champion and this is one fight and he's like, I'm done.

454
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.160
I'm going to be a movie star in Italy and moved to Italy and is never fought

455
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:03.830
again and he talks perfect. Now when you hear him talk,

456
00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:07.400
he's got no brain damage or if he does, you can't tell by the way he's talking.

457
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.110
He sounds fine. It's probably,

458
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:12.620
I mean a lot of this stuff they say like sets in like later on in life.

459
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.080
So it might have been in his late sixties [inaudible] I hope to be him. Yeah.

460
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.330
I hope to be that guy, you know? Yeah. I try to do it. You know,

461
00:25:20.331 --> 00:25:23.540
I try to do a good job of bobbing and weaving and moving my head and slipping

462
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:26.810
off the center line. We just look guys. Hicks too. You keep guys on the outside.

463
00:25:26.811 --> 00:25:29.690
You have a weird style man. It's a close month. Yeah,

464
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.020
that's what it is. [inaudible] close about that. Go Fuck. Oh,

465
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:41.330
did you start out from a, I mean, I know you have a wrestling base too. Yeah.

466
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.750
What did you, what did you start out with? What was your first martial art?

467
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:49.730
I didn't have any. We, we, you know the karate come from like VHS tapes.

468
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.270
I Shit you not, I have a family of theirs. I think there's 20 of us now.

469
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.860
Your Dad, my dad just had a newborn son. I shit you not, he's 57.

470
00:25:57.861 --> 00:26:00.790
The guy's out of his fucking bird. Wow. But uh, it just had any boys,

471
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.610
I hadn't even met him yet. That's one. And uh, all the boys grew up,

472
00:26:04.611 --> 00:26:05.680
we had these karate taste,

473
00:26:05.681 --> 00:26:08.750
VHS tapes and we would imitate the characters and we'll be like,

474
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.090
we're the drunken master or where the white tiger,

475
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.560
white lion and we have to do their fight styles and when I little kid,

476
00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:17.900
so we're still flexible and malleable and we like don't break as easily,

477
00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:20.150
so we just start beating the shit out of each other.

478
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.710
But we'd do like spinning back cakes,

479
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:23.450
jumping off the couches and shit like that.

480
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.550
And I think that might've traded like,

481
00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:27.200
cause that was like we did definitely years,

482
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.370
but that was the most combat we did. We didn't do any like wrestling. No,

483
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.280
nothing traditional at all before I ever got into martial arts.

484
00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:36.830
I used to do that same thing. I used to throw kicks with my friends.

485
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:39.050
I didn't know what I was doing, but it was fun. But yeah,

486
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.290
you like watch a Bruce Lee movie and start throwing kicks or some Chuck Norris

487
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:43.530
film or something like that. Yeah.

488
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.570
You learn how to do stuff by watching the beat.

489
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.820
You'll also develop some terrible habits. Yeah.

490
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.340
But you don't look like you developed any bad habits. Like if I had to guess,

491
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:53.100
I would say you have a traditional martial arts background in what?

492
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.860
The way you throw kicks, like you throw kicks,

493
00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:58.800
like a guy who started throwing kicks when you were really young. Yeah,

494
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.370
but they, right. You throw them right. Which ones would you say?

495
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.270
Like all your shit, your roundhouse kicks, your front kicks you,

496
00:27:05.271 --> 00:27:09.090
you have great front kicks, man. You're really good at keeping guys off of you.

497
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.290
You have good movement. You know like you're,

498
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:16.140
you got a style that's a unique style. Like so when when guys have to fight you,

499
00:27:16.141 --> 00:27:19.260
they go, oh, this guy is going to be kicking at me from the outside.

500
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:21.930
He moves a lot. He bobs and weaves. It's hard to hit.

501
00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.230
You've got a lot going on with your style. It's very tiring.

502
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.880
I was going to ask you that too cause we called that in your last fight.

503
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.250
Like the third round he were kind of slowing down a little bit.

504
00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:39.720
I'm like imagine all the energy this guy's using because you're always bobbing

505
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:43.020
and weaving and moving and kicking and moving and kicking and moving and Moon

506
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.700
Joe's is just, you know,

507
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.740
Bob and towards you and and just throwing juditional type shit.

508
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.530
Bobbing his head too. He looked at like energy output,

509
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.920
like how much more energy you must've put out in that fight than he did.

510
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.580
Just incurrence of the amount of kicks you throw and amount of jumping back and

511
00:27:56.581 --> 00:28:00.120
forth and leaping in leaping out like this. That's all like a cylon tricks.

512
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.990
It's a ton. And the good thing is credit to like the training that we do,

513
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:06.450
you know we get the, I get the the right work. I got that Guy,

514
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.500
I'm a rob Devachetti who's a freaking psycho. That guy does not get tired.

515
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:12.120
We call the machine for a reason. The Guy,

516
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.540
he will finish the with me and I'm like, I did my rounds, championship work.

517
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:18.480
I'm done with going get on the bike or hit the pads, whatever it is,

518
00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:21.870
or band work just to get a little extra cardio push and he'll be in there and

519
00:28:21.871 --> 00:28:25.350
grab two, three, sometimes full more bodies to spar with it. I'm like,

520
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.450
this guy doesn't fucking stop. He's out of his fucking brain.

521
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.560
This is no exaggeration, this guy is out of his fucking bird.

522
00:28:31.561 --> 00:28:34.110
But it's the reason why my cardio, I'm like,

523
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:36.840
you want to get your cardio top notch, get yourself a fucking Mirage,

524
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.560
get yourself one of those do. He's a man. He's a good dude. He's a good dude.

525
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.440
Sometimes too much of a good deal. I'm like, Rob, I can carry,

526
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.450
I could carry my own wallet. You know, it's like,

527
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.000
it gets to the point like that. Like, dude, thank you. I appreciate it.

528
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:51.980
But you know, but um, yeah, it's a very tiring style. Um,

529
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.680
but we do a lot of work and I do my own start to conditioning just from having a

530
00:28:55.681 --> 00:28:59.190
background in physical education and SUNY Cortland. So do your own.

531
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.640
Yeah so I've been doing it since I was amateur, like writing my own thing,

532
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:03.390
my own program.

533
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.260
Cause they told us how to like work on like isometric squeezes and different

534
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:10.770
type of like explosive muscle and dorms workouts and stuff like static holes

535
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:13.830
like holding all them on a puller bard and going out to punches. So I,

536
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.790
I put together a pretty decent program. It's been working, I can't complain.

537
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.440
So when you do it, how do you design it uses a designer for the entire camp.

538
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.090
Like do you set it out every day?

539
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:27.750
Like where you want to be and you adjust it depending on how you feel and

540
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:30.360
injuries. Like how do you have your schedule all that exactly like that.

541
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.180
So when I'm further off from the camp or not in camp at all,

542
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:37.740
I'll do more lifting and I'll lift heavy and I don't really do like benching no

543
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:40.200
more that I think that shit's like stupid for four fighters.

544
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:42.130
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm not going to bench press

545
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.670
<v 2>somebody off my back, you know? Right. You know, I don't know whatever.</v>

546
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:49.750
But I'll do that. And I would just to training camp and just the, the a,

547
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.430
the programs when I get close to the fight,

548
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:55.420
and I don't mind to like sharing this because I think guys,

549
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.270
they make it more complicated than what it should be.

550
00:29:58.271 --> 00:30:00.070
Like I sometimes I see all this crazy shit, I'm like,

551
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.930
I just don't understand the whole necessity behind union that. But I'm, no,

552
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.260
I'm no physical strength conditioning, doctorate or anything like that.

553
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:10.390
But from what I've seen that works for me.

554
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:14.320
I just try to mimic everything that I feel in a fight and implement it into a

555
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:17.020
workout. And I figured out which ways I could do that, whether it's bands,

556
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:22.360
push ups, box jobs, wall sits, I do wall sits, get ups with two plates.

557
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.720
So I'm sitting down on my butt and I'll do like a technical standup and I use

558
00:30:26.721 --> 00:30:29.300
the wall and I've pushed up. So it's a lot of leg works, a lot of cool work.

559
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.530
And two plates with two plates is fucked up.

560
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.150
Sometimes I come there and I can do it by myself.

561
00:30:34.151 --> 00:30:38.380
In the morning I go to Loma Mae by myself, 9:00 AM and I'm like,

562
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.940
why am I putting myself through this?

563
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:43.750
Like it can be so much easier and more simple like just to do the other stuff,

564
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:47.530
like the plyometric stuff and which is a little, not as much impact on the body,

565
00:30:47.531 --> 00:30:50.380
but this is what I enjoy. I think this was what translates to the fight.

566
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.050
Cause this is what I feel and I feel when I do this,

567
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:56.560
I notice a drastic difference from one sparring session to the next.

568
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.360
But to answer your question, like I adjusted,

569
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.410
I'll do if I'm my legs on fire and I feel like they really beat up from

570
00:31:02.411 --> 00:31:04.930
sparring. I'll do more upper body. And then if my field,

571
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:07.870
my upper body is more beat up, I'll switch it off to the lower body.

572
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.950
And if I feel like I'm fresh, like I had a good week, I'd maybe identity, um,

573
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.400
on a Saturday and I'm coming in fresh on a Monday, I'll hit it hard.

574
00:31:15.401 --> 00:31:18.280
And do full body everything and I'll give myself five rounds of pushing it,

575
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:21.260
but I separated into rounds, simulate the fight around.

576
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.260
So I do every single minute, but I'll do about 40 40,

577
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.600
depending on how far I am from the fight. If I'm like just on a train case,

578
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.080
I don't want to kill myself, I want to ease my way into it.

579
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:37.110
So I'll start like anywhere from like 30 35 seconds to like 50 seconds and that

580
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:42.580
ten second window or that other 32nd window is my time to recover and get to the

581
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:45.870
next station. And I'll just rep whatever I'm doing, burning out, burning out.

582
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.640
I'll do um, the med ball between my legs.

583
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.100
I'll do the foam roller in my arms and I'll squeeze it.

584
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:53.680
I'll simulate the rear naked choke and I do it for two minute intervals and I'm

585
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:56.830
just squeezing the piss out of it. And obviously you can't do it,

586
00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.800
but you do it to failure and your arms get tight.

587
00:31:58.801 --> 00:32:01.240
You switch and go to the other side and you switch your legs, you figure for it,

588
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:02.230
you scissor the legs.

589
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.910
So you give yourself different type of stimulation to your body to kind of

590
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:09.730
account for everything that you may possibly be in for the fight.

591
00:32:09.731 --> 00:32:11.290
And you never know. It was like this fight.

592
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.890
I did a lot of grappling but I also did a lot of punching because I thought to

593
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:19.450
myself there might be a chance that it might be a possibility that do not get

594
00:32:19.451 --> 00:32:20.284
pager to the ground.

595
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.590
And I was happy I didn't force to take downs cause that would've fatigued me

596
00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:26.680
even more. And I was like if it comes it comes. But we did it.

597
00:32:26.681 --> 00:32:30.000
I did a lot of output just burning out their arms, getting that muscle indoors,

598
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.310
kind of using that Floyd Mayweather structure of a workout.

599
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:37.270
Just get into the heavy bag count like high punch count in a five minute round.

600
00:32:37.271 --> 00:32:39.980
And I'll do that for a couple of rounds and we did a couple of times a

601
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.501
<v 0>week and I,</v>

602
00:32:40.501 --> 00:32:43.610
I think you implement that with the lateral foot work that we do in a cage and

603
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:45.380
just staying on your bike and having people like,

604
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.920
like stalk you and like just not going crazy.

605
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:51.680
But it's a control like that don't punches like hooks or that Dolan,

606
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.920
I'm a one two and you got to like bounce side of the side and get out the way.

607
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:55.880
So there's a lot of like,

608
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.510
I at least I think is practical for what you're gonna actually see when you get

609
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:01.580
in a fight. And I think sure enough,

610
00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:03.920
a lot of the things we did pretty much happened in a fight.

611
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.890
Just your toes long squeezes. It is a great idea.

612
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.490
I wasn't seen cause that's something that comes up often in a fight where you

613
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.250
maybe got a gun,

614
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.390
an arm triangle or something like that and it's that close to whether you get it

615
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:18.500
or he escapes. It's like how much to squeeze, how long can you keep it down?

616
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.790
You know when you're caught in something and it's like you're almost kinda

617
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.730
tapping the guy, let's go. You're like wait a little bit long.

618
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.690
Squeezes a, like my friend Scott Epstein, Einstein,

619
00:33:29.691 --> 00:33:31.700
he teaches at a 10th planet west La.

620
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.320
He's always been a big fan of slow, slow workouts.

621
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:39.050
Like he'll do chin ups like this, like super slow.

622
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.110
I think that's what they call it, super slow and he'll do chin-ups.

623
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.520
Like he's doing a chin up.

624
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:47.000
It might take him two minutes to do a fucking chin up or the entire time.

625
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:49.670
So like when you're grappling with someone's like you were trying to squeeze it

626
00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:54.220
a poem in here just so that long term squeeze endurance like quicksand. Yeah,

627
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.710
makes sense. Because if everything is fast and exploding,

628
00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.520
but then you get a rear naked and you have to like continue to compress or a

629
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:05.750
good team when you can to a squeeze. It's different. It's such a different,

630
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:06.561
such a different field.

631
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:10.130
It's kind of not kind of reminds me it is exactly like my Brian Caraway fight.

632
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.970
Although I did do three workouts on the day of that fight before the fight even

633
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:15.600
Matt told me in the back room, he was like, oh Joe,

634
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.640
save something for the fight. I was like, no man, I'm good.

635
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.840
And I was just going crazy. I was like, in my head I'm like, I did all the work,

636
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.920
but I just wanted to be so prepared cause I knew it was the biggest fight of my

637
00:34:24.921 --> 00:34:26.810
life. I knew if I beat him and finished him,

638
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.450
I was probably going to get a title shot was for no undefeated coming off three

639
00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:32.690
finishes. And I knew if I finished him I'm more than likely going to get,

640
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.590
and they lined me up too because the next week I went to Fox and I was supposed

641
00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:39.590
to talk about the dominant Cruz fight versus your ifa fight,

642
00:34:39.591 --> 00:34:41.900
which I went but the fight didn't go my way.

643
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.210
So it Kinda had like a bittersweet taste to it.

644
00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:47.150
So do you think it had anything to do with the extra rounds you put in or the

645
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:49.460
extra work times? 100%.

646
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.460
I think if I had just done my one morning Shakeout,

647
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.260
1520 minutes is what I do now.

648
00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:57.770
Just get the food moving through my system so that my body can get like,

649
00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.920
just feel like it's more alive again like it does during training camp. I think,

650
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.370
uh,

651
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.330
I think that fight easily done first round or even a second cause he survived

652
00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:07.730
the first, but I think the second round I think I get them out of there.

653
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:09.470
But it's just experience, you know,

654
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:12.470
learning and becoming more mature about the game and trusting your training.

655
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.870
Do you think that has anything to do with you training yourself?

656
00:35:14.871 --> 00:35:15.590
Do you think that you've had,

657
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.100
if you had a legit strength and conditioning coach who's monitoring your heart

658
00:35:19.101 --> 00:35:21.740
rate? Like do, are you monitoring your heart rate and all that stuff? No,

659
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.800
I just started doing stuff with the PII center and I tried to,

660
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.690
because I saw that guy, Brendan Davis, he's, he's 45 foot to beat and he's a,

661
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.220
he's a big, he's one 35 now, which is insane to me.

662
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.170
So I don't know how he makes it. That's what I said. So I'm like, dude,

663
00:35:37.171 --> 00:35:38.070
if I'm going to have to be, find

664
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.220
<v 2>these giant guys, I need to figure something out. I'm like they,</v>

665
00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.650
they explain how he was able to cut the weight.

666
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:46.490
Like he was running like 10 miles or something and a date,

667
00:35:46.491 --> 00:35:49.050
which was insane to me. I know he was saying like some of it was like walking,

668
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.300
but it's all about your heart rate, your resting heart rate,

669
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:55.200
where you burn the most fat and calories or whatever you want to call it.

670
00:35:55.201 --> 00:35:56.940
He's so big. When I was standing next to him,

671
00:35:56.941 --> 00:36:00.960
I couldn't believe he makes one 35 it's insane. I was actually pretty upset.

672
00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:02.130
I was like, fuck this guy.

673
00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:05.700
Go back out to your way class and didn't he say to me, wait,

674
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.210
I think I asked him what he weighed in the cage.

675
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.580
I think he said somewhere around one 60 yeah, I don't get that big.

676
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.230
What does he say? I'll look up. I'll check his bananas. Man, he's,

677
00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:19.580
he's so gigantic and he's what? He's like six one or something like that. Yeah.

678
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.430
I don't want to weight class. Yeah.

679
00:36:21.431 --> 00:36:24.500
I don't want to fight a guy that's six one you've gotta I gotta.

680
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.070
I got the unfair advantage right now.

681
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.210
You take your ass back out to 45 there's a device that I've been using called a

682
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.770
whoop

683
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:35.060
<v 3>and it measures your heart rate variability and measures your heart rate and</v>

684
00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.410
measure like your sleep cycle.

685
00:36:36.411 --> 00:36:39.110
You wear it while you're sleeping and if they think they say that,

686
00:36:39.111 --> 00:36:42.620
that's one of the things that really determines whether or not you can push hard

687
00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:46.130
is monitoring your heart and on a daily basis so that you see what it's like

688
00:36:46.131 --> 00:36:49.640
when you wake up [inaudible] you wake up and your resting heart rates like 40

689
00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:53.630
beats per minute or something like that. If one day it's 50 you need to chill.

690
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:58.400
Yeah, that that day was maybe active recovery. Maybe just do some light drills.

691
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.181
Nothing crazy,

692
00:36:59.181 --> 00:37:02.000
but you can't push it that day because you're already 10 so you might be getting

693
00:37:02.001 --> 00:37:03.770
sick or you might be,

694
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.340
you might be worn out and you need to give yourself enough recovery.

695
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.510
<v 2>I've gotten sick a lot and my last three training camps,</v>

696
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.530
which is something I've never like experienced with, dealt with before.

697
00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.070
Tonsillitis twice. I'm like this unreal.

698
00:37:18.071 --> 00:37:20.440
I've never had to deal with anything like that before in my life

699
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:21.871
<v 3>do with it, man.</v>

700
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:26.250
I bet if you just had monitor your heart rate and make sure that when you wake

701
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.520
up in the morning it's not too high because sometimes you just say, look,

702
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:34.770
you're a fucking professional fighter man. You, you're tough. There's just no,

703
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.633
you have to assume,

704
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.600
assume that maybe sometimes you're too tough for your own good because fighters

705
00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:42.180
are so fucking tough. They're not complaining about shit. They're like,

706
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:43.530
time to go to work. I'm not a pussy.

707
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.940
<v 2>I don't feel like going to work. I'm going to work. That's my mindset. Yeah.</v>

708
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.610
I even talked to Tony Ricci. He does some of this drug,

709
00:37:49.611 --> 00:37:52.530
the conditioning with like Katelyn Kagan and some of the other fighters,

710
00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.350
OCHA Sasaki and the other guys at the gym.

711
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.620
And I always pick his brain like whenever I have questions because I say I'm

712
00:37:57.621 --> 00:38:00.920
not, this is not my field, my expertise. I just been using the same program,

713
00:38:00.921 --> 00:38:03.560
just changing it up and I still work out from other people, not,

714
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.240
I'll ask them questions and ask them.

715
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:09.230
So for some things I could tweak within my training session, but of late,

716
00:38:09.231 --> 00:38:11.900
I've been, I've been doing better with taking more days off,

717
00:38:11.901 --> 00:38:13.040
like two days back to back.

718
00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:16.130
There's one time I even took three days off and I was like so nervous.

719
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.420
Like you get in your own head like, dude,

720
00:38:17.421 --> 00:38:22.160
you're taking off way too much time and sometimes ray has a way of like breaking

721
00:38:22.161 --> 00:38:26.660
my balls and he'd go, I don't know. I'll show. It was like,

722
00:38:26.661 --> 00:38:29.390
this is a big fight. I don't know, Julie, you're going to take another day off.

723
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.460
I'm like, God, don't do it though.

724
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.760
They'll do that too because then I feel like I know he's just playing,

725
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.920
but sometimes I feel like

726
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.890
<v 1>it's hard to know if he's playing or not. I think you're being serious,</v>

727
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:43.270
so he's so old school, he really does. Him and Matt Serra,

728
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.240
Ray Longo and Matt Serra in the corner of the most entertaining corner of all

729
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.730
time. They're the best there. Larry is the best guys.

730
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.550
They should have a reality show. She dumb in the corner.

731
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:54.700
Give them a fighter's instruction. Yeah, they're amazing. I'm hoping.

732
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:56.170
I'm hoping they could get some that'd be sick.

733
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:58.630
If they ever got a reality show or something with like the team.

734
00:38:58.631 --> 00:39:01.760
I think that'd be fun. We've got a bunch of characters. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah.

735
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.520
I mean every fight camp does, right. I mean,

736
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:07.660
be an interesting person to want to do that for a living. Yeah, there they are.

737
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.920
Sometimes I would just listen to the eye.

738
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:14.400
Looks like listening to the feedback so I can hear them screaming in the corner.

739
00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.760
You could just hear Matt going off like,

740
00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.280
<v 4>yes, our job. That shit. Oh Joe, show who you are.</v>

741
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.610
<v 1>It was never there in the corner together. I always say, oh,</v>

742
00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.970
just tell the guy in the boot, go, go, go to Sarah and Longo. Go, go, go.

743
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:29.360
I'm going to want to hear them, dude. That last one was great. Uh,

744
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.320
the ESPN guys,

745
00:39:30.321 --> 00:39:33.290
they posted like a little clip of them in the corner when Matt comes in and Ray

746
00:39:33.291 --> 00:39:36.740
comes in, he's like, fuck yeah. Joe Is like, dude, I got pumped up.

747
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.540
And they tweeted something like,

748
00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:43.460
get yourself a corner like Matt and Matt and ray best. That was the best.

749
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:47.690
They're amazing people. They're just, they're just great guys too. You know,

750
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.400
there's so many great corners now.

751
00:39:49.401 --> 00:39:51.620
It's really interesting to see the sport evolve.

752
00:39:51.621 --> 00:39:54.680
And that's why when you get a bad corner, it stands out like a sore thumb.

753
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:56.540
When someone gets bad advice,

754
00:39:56.541 --> 00:39:59.300
they don't get good technical advice or they don't get honest advice in their

755
00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:00.710
corner. It's like, wow.

756
00:40:00.711 --> 00:40:04.430
And all the other fighters get the chance to see that that's your advertisement,

757
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.220
right? Like when you're like, for us a hobbies,

758
00:40:07.221 --> 00:40:09.270
like probably one of my all time favorites. We should have these.

759
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:12.470
He's really abusive. When you hear him in the corner between rounds.

760
00:40:12.471 --> 00:40:15.290
In many ways it's an advertisement to go train at his gym.

761
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:17.510
If you're a top fighter, cause you hear him talk,

762
00:40:17.511 --> 00:40:19.310
he's so technical in his description.

763
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.310
He's so aware of what should happen and when it should happen.

764
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.280
Then he just knows what to do and when to do. And it's like,

765
00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.220
that's excellent advice. Yeah. Jamie, shut your mic off

766
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.020
here and you're fucking rapper. You don't, your Mike's got beyond this.

767
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:34.873
That loud.

768
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:42.620
I heard it too. I did hear it. What are you doing man? What's that made out of?

769
00:40:42.621 --> 00:40:47.570
Paper chips. That was a rapper made out of a potato chips. Um,

770
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:51.920
yeah, it's like a corner is in many ways just the advertisement for the gym.

771
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.910
So you, when you hear you're winning, you're winning, you're definitely winning.

772
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:58.160
Just go out and box. I'm like he's not winning like we in the corner.

773
00:40:58.161 --> 00:41:00.080
Like that is not good advice. It's not,

774
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:04.490
and my thing is you got to give some type of instructional feedback,

775
00:41:04.491 --> 00:41:08.420
something to correct or something to do better or encourage them to keep doing

776
00:41:08.421 --> 00:41:10.430
the same things that they're doing or something.

777
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.900
Something where there's instruction. Not like get up. Oh really?

778
00:41:14.901 --> 00:41:17.060
You think I need to get up? I think I know I need to get up,

779
00:41:17.061 --> 00:41:19.850
but like how the hell do I get up with a weirdest shit?

780
00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:23.600
Was Diego Sanchez Oh dash centers in his last fight.

781
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:26.780
I don't know who we trained with. He left Jackson Winkle.

782
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:31.520
Winkeljohn I don't know if he had training partners. I don't know what he did.

783
00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.120
I feel the one guy in his corner telling him be like Tyson,

784
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.670
go out in there and be like Tyco fucking wait. He said,

785
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.980
I'm just giving a weird advice. Oh Diego was getting,

786
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.940
Michael Cassa was just full blowing on him. Yeah.

787
00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.970
Cause flowing and every time Diego was able to capitalize on a position,

788
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.690
like a uh, a slip up or and window of opportunity to get on top.

789
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.680
He just fucked it up and then got right back up. Created a scramble and,

790
00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:00.680
and he was right back in a dominant position once again. And I was like, yeah,

791
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:03.550
this is not gonna end. Well I thought he was gonna get the finish. But Dude,

792
00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:08.580
the way you saw like Diego Sanchez manhandled Mickey Gall crazy.

793
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:13.850
Then the way you see Michael [inaudible] man handled Diego Sanchez.

794
00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:18.230
He levels wow levels and size key essa.

795
00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:20.600
It is in case you want to talk about the guy would cut too much weight.

796
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:25.160
It is incredible that that dude ever made a 155 pounds. He's so large.

797
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.810
That is a big man big. And when you put your hand on, I'm like I'm interviewing,

798
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:31.630
it's like a fucking piece of wood man. Yeah.

799
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.350
That's some grappling constrictor strength, you know. Yeah.

800
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.430
He's a big dude man.

801
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.730
I saw him before the fight in the PII sends out like to it and I told him the

802
00:42:40.731 --> 00:42:41.720
same thing. I was like, dude, I don't know.

803
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.950
I really do not know how the fuck you ever made one 55 it's like probably

804
00:42:45.951 --> 00:42:49.190
counterproductive for you to even go down there cause you just got such a big

805
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:52.610
frame. You, I think he would excel at 70 I think so too.

806
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:57.050
But what's interesting is like he's done way better at 70 than Kevin Lee has and

807
00:42:57.051 --> 00:42:59.330
Kevin Lee beat him at 55 yeah.

808
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.480
So it's crazy how like you got to go up and wait,

809
00:43:02.481 --> 00:43:04.310
but you also got to do it the right way.

810
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:08.210
I think he did it the right way when he's at one 70 he's super healthy. Yeah.

811
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.380
Strong dude, man.

812
00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:14.381
So fan fit any flows like the way he was flown with Diego,

813
00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:18.710
he just, he didn't like tighten up. He was in total control.

814
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.190
He would take chances, he would roll into crucifix positions.

815
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.660
He would lose it and get ahold of him again. Again, take them down.

816
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.160
It's like it was like a black belt roll in with a blue belt.

817
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:31.280
That's what it was like. I was like, wow, this is crazy to y or purple belt.

818
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.800
Crazy to watch. It's different man.

819
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:37.310
It's really levels to the game and it's also size.

820
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:41.720
Size to waist one 69 like the day before the fight wasn't,

821
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:43.310
didn't have to cut any weight at all.

822
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.850
Whereas kiss or probably would in the one nineties you were huge.

823
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.810
I wonder what makes him want to go down to 55 they didn't.

824
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.080
That's not as easy to go down to 55 this is Jamie. This is Voodoo coach. Oh,

825
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:58.400
this is coach. That would be do Sanchez this corner. No one else.

826
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.670
This dude has no experiences in MMA coach by the way. So this is,

827
00:44:01.671 --> 00:44:04.640
the dude is telling them to be like Tyson. He's being like water right now.

828
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:09.470
You just got to slip the slip, Bro. Well touch but touch. But Diego,

829
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.000
such a strange guy, man.

830
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:14.350
He might believe that this dude has mass magic powers because he's,

831
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.410
he was talking about,

832
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.330
but I think a big part of Diego's success is his belief system,

833
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:25.400
right? Diego just believes things. Dude, this guy's amazing. What technique?

834
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:30.630
Oh, come on son. Show me that. Oh, knocking people out bro. Good.

835
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.950
Imagine looking at this guy and you go, listen, Fuck Longo and Sarah.

836
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.350
That's where I need to be. That would be that.

837
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.580
I would actually be a good like skit. Like Yo, I'm going out to train.

838
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:44.380
Like just had the whole thing leading up to it and then let them know like, Oh,

839
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:45.510
I'm just fucking around. You know?

840
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:48.380
But I think that's what Anderson Silva did when he brought in Steven's a gall

841
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.870
complete joke. I'm like, people were buying it.

842
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:59.690
Well, well gall was selling it. He was selling it, you know? It was like,

843
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.280
that's a technique that I taught Anderson brow.

844
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.910
Everybody knows that one j one white belt class.

845
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.930
Oh Man. That I can't believe people bought it for so long.

846
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.290
It's almost like the Ronda Rousey's did too. There he is. Look at this. Oh,

847
00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.940
karate. Chad's the head son.

848
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.110
Imagine these dudes standing there while he practices all this shit.

849
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:26.070
There's George George. They all had to do with a straight face,

850
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:30.780
like you understand? It's like the ultimate troll. Look, Anderson's practicing.

851
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.460
It is acting so good though. My God, this is like a, you know what this is like,

852
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.510
this is like,

853
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:42.110
like a breakthrough circus clown given Dave Chappelle comedy technique.

854
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.860
Like some dude who has a, it's like a, Hey Scott,

855
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:49.230
you gotta get a nose [inaudible] and he was like, okay. Haha.

856
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:50.790
It's really what it's like.

857
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.990
It's like Dave Chappelle getting comedy technique from a clown that reminds me

858
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:57.420
of the Napoleon dynamite when he's like,

859
00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:01.440
would you want to get kicked by me and his pants? Break the wrist.

860
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:03.630
Walk away. Yeah,

861
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.650
but the thing is Seagal was a legit at Quito specialist. I'll give you,

862
00:46:07.651 --> 00:46:08.071
it was just,

863
00:46:08.071 --> 00:46:12.090
I [inaudible] like that's what people like just because the guy seemed kind of

864
00:46:12.091 --> 00:46:12.720
silly.

865
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.720
You forget like he had a real legit history with a key though.

866
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:21.990
He was the first American to ever teach at a Dojo in Japan.

867
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:26.160
Speaks fluent Japanese and he's a legitimate IQ master,

868
00:46:26.161 --> 00:46:30.390
like 100% absolute legitimate Akita master. The thing is I,

869
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:35.130
Kido is just not something that translates perfectly to a,

870
00:46:35.131 --> 00:46:39.960
to MMA. What is it? Seagal Best Akita with Russian National Akiko team.

871
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:44.670
Yeah, Bro. I'm not bullshitting man. His Eye Quito is 100% legitimate,

872
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.260
but you see, I would have,

873
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:51.270
I would like almost discredit everything just based on that one parody thing.

874
00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.180
Know a joke. That shit show of a joke. Yeah,

875
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:56.760
but I mean break the wrist walk away, but this is all nonsense.

876
00:46:56.761 --> 00:47:00.300
Someone's going to give you their armor, but if they did,

877
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:03.420
he would fuck you up better than this because this is Seagal.

878
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:07.710
As an older man who's overweight, go to Steven Seagal when he was really young.

879
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:11.850
There's black and white footage of him teaching at a Dojo in Japan. There it is.

880
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:17.210
He is 100% legit and Aquino's not the best martial art for self-defense.

881
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:22.650
It's just not. But it has its applications and in its applications,

882
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.520
he's a master at it. Much like Jujitsu has its applications,

883
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:30.550
but it's not great for kickboxing. Right. Taekwondo has its applications,

884
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.730
<v 3>but it doesn't work if you kick the legs and punched the face. Yeah,</v>

885
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.080
but if you learn how to do it, those techniques can apply.

886
00:47:35.081 --> 00:47:38.020
If you know all the other stuff. Well, if you know all the other stuff,

887
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.300
this motherfucker has some real shit.

888
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:44.230
It's just whether or not you'd have to be so good at all the other stuff that

889
00:47:44.231 --> 00:47:45.930
you could utilize. This [inaudible]. No.

890
00:47:45.931 --> 00:47:49.480
Obviously he's showing in this technique he's showing knife defense and stuff

891
00:47:49.481 --> 00:47:53.230
like that, but this is all 100% legit technique.

892
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.360
He's good man. I mean, not good. Not Good. He's outstanding. He's like,

893
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.540
Quito is outstanding. The real question is how effective is I? Quito.

894
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.180
I'm still like,

895
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.950
I can't get past the jokes of the front kick and this is how I get past that

896
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:10.820
part. Well, it's hard. I didn't know this. I didn't know this.

897
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:15.640
It's hard to get past someone who doesn't have an objective understanding of how

898
00:48:15.641 --> 00:48:17.990
people view them. You're like, I just,

899
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.910
me and George St Pierre Jordanian pier wanted to learn how to throw a turning

900
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:24.220
sidekick for me. You're an animal at that, by the way.

901
00:48:24.221 --> 00:48:28.570
I felt embarrassed teaching them. No, because I'm just a comedian and I'm a,

902
00:48:28.571 --> 00:48:32.260
you know, I'm a commentator. But I was like, I know this sounds crazy,

903
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:35.770
that really know how to do it. And then when I did it, he was like, Holy Shit.

904
00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:39.760
I was like, yeah, this is what I used to do. So, but, but me showing them that,

905
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.110
I mean I'm under no illusion that I could kick George Saint Pierre his ass.

906
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:47.440
He would fuck me up every day of the week. But I was like,

907
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:50.560
I have this one thing that I can show you that I bet you can't do the way I

908
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.640
could do it and I can show you how to do it. But I'm not like, you know,

909
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:57.550
like with Savalo's doing like that's a front kick man.

910
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:02.540
I know I was gonna throw up front kick, you know, and even a spinning back kick,

911
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:04.330
you can teach someone that. But having them,

912
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:07.930
having the confidence to confidence to execute that, to choose to do that.

913
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.810
Like you're in a situation that guys can forth, you choose to spin,

914
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:14.470
you gotta be so rock solid with your understanding of that technique,

915
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:18.100
you're not going to get that without years and years and years and years and

916
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:18.890
years of drilling it.

917
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:22.880
<v 2>That can be a death sentence in a, in a live combat fist fight. Yeah.</v>

918
00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:27.770
So even like when I throw sometimes I'm like, man, I do a lot of shit man.

919
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.980
Like I do like the tornado kicks and shit now. And uh,

920
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:35.780
and I do like I did one time to Pedro on this fight where he came at me and I

921
00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:38.180
stepped back and I did like a hopping, spinning back kick,

922
00:49:38.181 --> 00:49:41.600
like the one you ride a hole, hit a gay Guy Musashi. Oh yeah, I did that.

923
00:49:41.601 --> 00:49:45.110
But it hit him like right on the belt, not exactly where I wanted to hit to a,

924
00:49:45.111 --> 00:49:47.240
to land and a pitcher, my foot slides down,

925
00:49:47.241 --> 00:49:50.000
it looks like I kicked him in the balls, but it was like right above,

926
00:49:50.001 --> 00:49:51.320
like the belt line. I was like, aw man,

927
00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:54.380
if I just got a little bit more to the side and I with the heel I would've

928
00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:57.770
probably dropped. You practice that like in front of the bag. Oh yeah.

929
00:49:57.771 --> 00:50:00.220
But then I will have someone holding the shield and can,

930
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.640
I'll just go for like 20 minutes.

931
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.680
I just have it like controlled like I'm like Yo,

932
00:50:03.681 --> 00:50:06.710
cause I want to have like a stationary target but also somewhat moving.

933
00:50:06.711 --> 00:50:09.950
So it was more practical cause no one's just going to stand in front of you and

934
00:50:09.951 --> 00:50:12.830
be like, Hey, just spinning back, kick me to the ribs all the way.

935
00:50:12.831 --> 00:50:14.240
I learned how to do it with swing you [inaudible]

936
00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.430
<v 3>bag. I would swing a bag. Then the bag was coming close to me.</v>

937
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:20.190
I would jump up in the air and spin and stop and do it that way.

938
00:50:20.191 --> 00:50:25.040
The only fight that I have from taekwondo at all was me winning by knockout with

939
00:50:25.041 --> 00:50:28.380
a jump spinning back kick one on Youtube. Yeah.

940
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.400
That's the only one where I was like 19 Jamie could probably find it.

941
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:34.640
But that technique, if you do it right, if you do it right,

942
00:50:34.641 --> 00:50:35.540
it's fucking devastating.

943
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:38.720
But you open yourself up whenever you turn and you spin. Especially.

944
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.230
So I'm doing an and talk one. No, well you can't punch to the face. It's,

945
00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:45.680
it's less risky. You can't kick to the legs. You can get away with it more.

946
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.620
You can't punch it at face, but you could kick to the face kick to the face,

947
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:54.920
which is ridiculous. What do you got? What happened? Oh, here,

948
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:59.240
this is me when I'm 19 Ooh, that's you. Yeah, that was me.

949
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.870
But it's like the same thing,

950
00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:06.860
like he's coming forward and I caught him as he's coming forward, but that,

951
00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:11.330
that technique in MMA mean if you've got like Valentina does it better than

952
00:51:11.331 --> 00:51:13.070
anybody. She does it. You don't even see it.

953
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:17.660
Common Valentina Shevchenko throws for that guy climbed.

954
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.990
If you hit somebody with that, it's like getting hit by a car. I mean,

955
00:51:20.991 --> 00:51:23.300
that's what I was telling George. I was like, if you do it right, your,

956
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.330
your weight is going towards it. The problem with the way most people do it,

957
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.280
they're hitting it and bouncing off of it.

958
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.010
You're not even like going all the way through it. You're not following through.

959
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:34.220
They're going bang like that. They're hitting it and going back, I'm saying go,

960
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:39.860
go kick through it. Your weight should be going through it and it seems awkward,

961
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.610
but once you develop the technique and do it properly, it's not awkward.

962
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:46.670
It's the best way to do. And you get so much weight going forward.

963
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.370
<v 2>That's another problem I have and I was talking about this earlier today with</v>

964
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.680
some of the guys. Um, uh,

965
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:57.660
like I normally try to like rewatch all my fights and then take like a notebook

966
00:51:57.661 --> 00:52:01.140
or my phone and jot down notes and things I could do better or things that I

967
00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:04.590
think I fucked up or I want to clean up that type of stuff. And, um,

968
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.530
one of the things I'm noticing, I mean I've, I've noticed it for a while,

969
00:52:07.531 --> 00:52:11.160
but now I think that's gonna be like the next evolution of my game is sitting

970
00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:14.640
down on my punches and my strikes more so that it has more of my body weight

971
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:18.120
behind it. Cause I punch a lot and transition and it's cool. It's fancy,

972
00:52:18.121 --> 00:52:20.790
it's hard to hit. I'm super loose with that way. But again,

973
00:52:20.791 --> 00:52:23.790
like we were talking about minutes, a lot of the work rate is just high.

974
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.150
You got to be constantly moving, but it's fun to watch.

975
00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.790
<v 3>Do you think you're going to stick with doing all your strength and conditioning</v>

976
00:52:29.791 --> 00:52:33.570
yourself or do you think you will move to like a professional like strength and

977
00:52:33.571 --> 00:52:37.110
conditioning group? I mean, as you move into five rounders too. Yeah, right.

978
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:40.100
<v 2>Well I trained for five round fights when I was doing this too.</v>

979
00:52:40.101 --> 00:52:43.880
But I mean obviously the level of competition was in the same round that was on

980
00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.200
the regional circuit before I came up. And I mean,

981
00:52:47.201 --> 00:52:49.850
I had success in training while I was sparring with five different bodies,

982
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.560
five different individual rounds, you know, and I,

983
00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:54.440
and I did pretty good in terms of my cardio,

984
00:52:54.441 --> 00:52:56.740
but I was also a young bull back then. Now I'm a little older,

985
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.930
so I still think I'm a young bull, but it's a difference when you're 21,

986
00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:02.650
22 compared to 29 even though, you know,

987
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.150
I think I'm right now on my prime years getting into also,

988
00:53:05.151 --> 00:53:08.390
you're aware of like all the damage you're doing to your body all the time.

989
00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:12.140
Yeah. Where you're 21, you barely aware of it. I just, you just go nuts. Yeah.

990
00:53:12.141 --> 00:53:13.520
Your brain's not even fully formed.

991
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.680
This strong kicks and punches and going crazy. Yeah. But I, I mean, maybe,

992
00:53:18.681 --> 00:53:21.110
I mean that totally Ricci Guy at the gym, he's pretty, he's pretty good.

993
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:21.380
He says,

994
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.900
I feel bad taking up his time because he helps out so much and volunteer.

995
00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:26.400
So of his time I feel bad

996
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.550
<v 0>because, uh, it's not like I'm, I'm not, he doesn't really,</v>

997
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.990
he doesn't ask for money. So it's like,

998
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.940
I feel bad if I'm not paying you for your service.

999
00:53:32.941 --> 00:53:36.300
I don't like it doesn't ask for money. Nah, not Tony. Not from the,

1000
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:37.500
not from the fighters. You know,

1001
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:40.410
he has some money he likes just seeing like the local guys do well and he likes

1002
00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:42.660
helping out. That's amazing. Yeah. He's a professor.

1003
00:53:42.661 --> 00:53:46.760
I forgot the school he's a professor at, but I'm really, really smart dude. Uh,

1004
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.860
I know he goes down to the PII center from time to time to like, uh,

1005
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:52.170
I think share some knowledge and learn some stuff from those guys as well.

1006
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:54.360
So maybe, maybe I'll go that route.

1007
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.720
It would be nice if I was able to train at the PII center.

1008
00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.810
You have the entire staff on hand. Like Oh God, those guys,

1009
00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:03.870
that's such a thought about doing a camp there. I mean if you did,

1010
00:54:03.871 --> 00:54:06.240
what do you think Longo and Sarah would be interested in doing that or they

1011
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:10.410
know, right? They really can. They can, they got family, they got the kids,

1012
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.410
they got their gyms. Yeah. I always tell them like, Yo,

1013
00:54:13.411 --> 00:54:16.830
can we like move to like somewhere warmer? Like a Florida or something. No,

1014
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:20.010
no state tax. You know, bring the whole team, bring the whole team,

1015
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.540
bring the whole family, we'd get a bigger house.

1016
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.290
They don't want those little shacks, those Long Island dudes. Man,

1017
00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:28.080
they got roots. I know that. That's what it is. Very. It's like

1018
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:34.020
I got money, he's got everything here. You know, they both do.

1019
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.440
They were so used to their community too. It's like that's their family,

1020
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:40.650
their friends, everybody's there. All the guys who come to the gym, it's like,

1021
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:45.300
yeah, I get it, I get it. But man, if you're a professional,

1022
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:49.650
it seems like every little edge that you can get can mean a little bit of

1023
00:54:49.651 --> 00:54:50.350
something.

1024
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:55.020
And that performance institute is a real edge that places amazing.

1025
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.420
Well, I look at it like I got my striking from Ray.

1026
00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.910
I got my Jujitsu for Matt and all the other guys,

1027
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:02.000
Jason around those guys and the Henzel Jim will not,

1028
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.810
if I go to Hensley's in the city. And then I had the wrestling,

1029
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:06.960
my own background. And then, um, you know,

1030
00:55:06.961 --> 00:55:10.950
I teach the wrestling classes at the gym and then I go down to harsher sometimes

1031
00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:12.480
and I bought some of those guys, some of the,

1032
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.020
I mean did not like the Penn state,

1033
00:55:15.021 --> 00:55:16.620
but there's still a solid rustlers and all that.

1034
00:55:16.621 --> 00:55:20.430
They give me pretty damn good word compared to what a lot of the wrestling looks

1035
00:55:20.431 --> 00:55:23.250
like in a may now. You know, so I'm getting solid work there.

1036
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:26.640
I think the main part is my nutrition and I, I really don't sleep.

1037
00:55:26.641 --> 00:55:29.670
I have my sleep. I'm so fucked up. I really don't sleep. I mean,

1038
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:33.120
I'll send me the CBD helps me to most, but everything else,

1039
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.450
unless I'm like hammered and I just pass the fuck out. But then I'm like, dude,

1040
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:39.270
I'm like fucked up the next day. You know? That sounds like counterproductive.

1041
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:43.250
Totally counterproductive. Yeah. Have you heard of that chill pad? No.

1042
00:55:43.251 --> 00:55:48.090
This is something I haven't tried but mark Sisson is who's a, he's the guy from,

1043
00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:51.990
he wrote that book, the primal primal blueprint and um,

1044
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:57.080
he's a like a nutrition expert and he was a former endurance athlete but he's a

1045
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:02.660
giant believer of this thing where you put it as like a mattress pad and it

1046
00:56:02.821 --> 00:56:05.400
chills your body to a certain temperature.

1047
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.250
You could set it for whatever temperature makes you most comfortable.

1048
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:12.750
But apparently he said it is a game changer in terms of your ability to sleep

1049
00:56:12.751 --> 00:56:14.920
through the night. Like I woke up in the middle of the night last night,

1050
00:56:14.921 --> 00:56:18.240
I must have been having a crazy dream. I was sweating like a pig and I woke up,

1051
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:20.820
man, I'm drenched with sweat. I'm like fuck, why am I so sweaty?

1052
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:24.220
Like what's Fuck's wrong with my brain? But with this apparently when you keep

1053
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.050
<v 5>you at a chilled temperature,</v>

1054
00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:30.670
you just snooze and he said he sleeps hard. What do you got? I got that bad.

1055
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:33.370
It is, it's coming down and chill. Pass. I don't have it yet,

1056
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:37.360
but we'll be here by the time I get back into another show and have a review for

1057
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:41.110
you on how it works. Amazing. Yeah. So you ordered one full bed though.

1058
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:41.980
It's not just a pad,

1059
00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:45.760
like literally there's a tube that got like an air conditioner to goes into the

1060
00:56:45.761 --> 00:56:50.761
mattress and it's connected to an app and it can regulate your body like a sleep

1061
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:54.260
number. But this one is called like eight sleep I believe. Or sleep aids.

1062
00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.620
The same thing very yet. Same thing. So this is the actual mattress itself? Yep.

1063
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.980
So how much is that thing? Not It's, I looked at the prices.

1064
00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.250
I was surprised that it was not as expensive as I would think it would be.

1065
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:08.020
Especially compared to like I heard this past day,

1066
00:57:08.021 --> 00:57:11.200
she bought one of those like a sleep number bed. Yeah. It was crazy.

1067
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:15.880
I'm funny as fuck by Micah that last episode.

1068
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.330
Oh my God. It starts at 2000 bucks I guess,

1069
00:57:19.331 --> 00:57:22.300
which I probably goes up depending on size, but they give it to you for free.

1070
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:27.340
I do have a promotional offer, I believe. Shit. Jamie,

1071
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:28.810
working in the promotional game.

1072
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.860
I don't have a coat or anything to give anyone that's, I don't have a bed.

1073
00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:35.680
Why not? I have a test. I have a pullout couch.

1074
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:40.890
<v 0>What do I have a very unique way of thinking once you're a top bantamweight</v>

1075
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:44.200
contender in the fucking UFC, it's fucked. How do you sleep?

1076
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:47.250
He's sleeping on a pullout bed. Yeah. What?

1077
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.060
Aljamain that's outrageous. You need to be able to sleep.

1078
00:57:52.061 --> 00:57:54.000
No wonder where you have a problem sleeping. Well,

1079
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.010
I feel like I still always had the problem I got,

1080
00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:59.410
I think I might have sleep apnea by smile. My girlfriend Rebecca, she's,

1081
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.700
she's had me, she's recording me like, oh my God. I was like,

1082
00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.620
yeah baby, you just got to deal with it.

1083
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:09.340
You just gotta deal with it or do you have it dudes with big next kid?

1084
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:13.120
I have it a thing that I put a mouthpiece in that I got from this guy.

1085
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:16.720
Does your Caribbean. It pushes my tongue down. No,

1086
00:58:16.721 --> 00:58:20.230
the mouthpieces like sits on your bottom and it's got like a tongue,

1087
00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:24.250
like someone like touching your tongue, pushing down on it.

1088
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:28.330
And it keeps my tongue from sliding back your throat and it's hovering over my

1089
00:58:28.331 --> 00:58:32.280
air hole. Okay. So how, how much I want to, cause I, I mean I got,

1090
00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.110
I just got one from a dentist that I'm working with and um,

1091
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:39.010
he has the one that pulls your bottom jaw forward like these bands.

1092
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.360
Is it helping you? It's been helping but um,

1093
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:43.990
it's just my jaw just really tight in the mornings. I'm like,

1094
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:46.420
oh that's not good. Then you gotta wait for like,

1095
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:49.450
like half an hour for it to kind of reset and adjust back. But man,

1096
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:50.231
being able to sleep,

1097
00:58:50.231 --> 00:58:53.110
I felt like I could be so much more efficient with my day cause I always hit

1098
00:58:53.111 --> 00:58:56.530
that mid day question, which I'm not sure if that's normal, but I wake up,

1099
00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:59.950
I have the most energy cause like I'm just taking a bunch of power naps because

1100
00:58:59.951 --> 00:59:02.740
I wake up so many times in the middle of the night with this accompanied that I

1101
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:06.670
know that sells them that you could just buy and it's like a boil and bite

1102
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:10.090
mouthpiece ton of thing and it has a bar that keeps your tongue from sliding

1103
00:59:10.091 --> 00:59:12.100
back. That's what you use? No, this is different

1104
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.720
<v 5>one. There's a couple of different ones.</v>

1105
00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:16.000
There's a couple of different versions here and I don't know which one you want

1106
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:18.910
to. I never seen these different ones or these are different.

1107
00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.920
There's one that I'm here, I'll, I'll pull it up real quick.

1108
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.530
<v 1>This one goes around. Your tongue looks like a pacifier as real world looking,</v>

1109
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:30.050
but it looks really weird. Yeah, it was like a octopus. [inaudible] octopus.

1110
00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:32.180
What's those things? Jellyfish. That's weird.

1111
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:35.180
I don't think what you're saying about that. Like you bite down on that.

1112
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.030
Now there's one that's different. Hold on a second. I'll find it here.

1113
00:59:38.031 --> 00:59:38.880
I'll go into my old.

1114
00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:42.470
This one is the one I guys mold it to my teeth and in the bottom jaw just gets

1115
00:59:42.471 --> 00:59:44.990
pulled forward. So when I just relax my jaw,

1116
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:48.530
my tongue is not like fought like it's not covering my, my airway.

1117
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:53.830
It's a really conscious thing with guys who are like football players and power

1118
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:58.410
lifters and wrestlers. You Develop, oh, here it is Jamie. It's a, Oh,

1119
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.450
hold on one second. It's called a z. Y p.

1120
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:08.480
A. Z much. I've heard that by further. Z. Y P p. Z.

1121
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:12.950
Y p. P. A. H. Is it two p's or one p? One,

1122
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.770
two PS. [inaudible], z. Y. P. So that's it.

1123
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.960
So you see that thing there that has that band.

1124
01:00:17.961 --> 01:00:22.460
That band sorta lays on your tongue and it keeps your tongue from sliding back

1125
01:00:22.461 --> 01:00:24.560
and then you breathe out of the top and bottom.

1126
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:28.400
Just like an over under mouthpiece. I'm trying to like envision this right now.

1127
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.880
It's just keeping your tongue from sliding back. That's,

1128
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:36.620
that's how it helps you know there's be end at the bottom, the band,

1129
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:38.630
the back. That's what it is.

1130
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.700
I remember I went to a dentist and they tried to tell me like, yeah,

1131
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:42.530
we can get you a mouthpiece for like five grand. I was like,

1132
01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:46.640
get the fuck Outta here dude. Some guy in the city and my friend,

1133
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:48.560
my friend is the one who connected me with him. It's like, yeah,

1134
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:51.770
this guy's going to do right by you. As the guy told me five pants like, dude,

1135
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.880
get the fuck out of here. Five grand for a mouthpiece. That's so crazy.

1136
01:00:55.881 --> 01:00:58.730
And then he made me two mouth guards and they were both shit. Anyway.

1137
01:00:58.731 --> 01:01:00.860
He was like, oh he mighty mouth guards. I don't want to bash you.

1138
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.890
Let me not bash this guy, but well shout out to the mouthpiece guy.

1139
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:08.060
He made mine. You guys awesome. Yeah, he's got a Instagram page.

1140
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:13.220
We do shark factors as your book. Oh, he makes it

1141
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:17.720
[inaudible] definitely has sleep apnea. The size of him do.

1142
01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.390
I can't imagine what's Shaq snoring sounds like

1143
01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:26.330
be a reality show and you can fall asleep in the row.

1144
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:30.500
You wait for shack to sleep and then you gotta go in the room. It falls like,

1145
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:34.250
think about how long would it take you for a, if it was like a game show,

1146
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.140
like if Shaq is owl coke,

1147
01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:39.563
<v 6>no way.</v>

1148
01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:47.860
<v 1>And you gotta lay next to him and it's like a time or ready go falsely across</v>

1149
01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:50.710
sleep. I'm tired. I'm not going though.

1150
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.490
And he's 800 pounds and he's 17,000 feet tall and he's laying next to you yet

1151
01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.880
it's just not happening. It's not happening.

1152
01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.660
That would be a whole Arius like fear factor type show.

1153
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:04.210
Try and fall asleep next to shack.

1154
01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.910
Could end up in a hotel room next to him and play that game on accident.

1155
01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:11.940
Accidentally make those walls shake and hear the chandelier's Klingon every time

1156
01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:18.030
you breeze out. [inaudible] Queensland Clink Lincoln. Yeah. Yeah. Giants.

1157
01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.160
Dudes like him. He must have a crazy

1158
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.230
<v 0>snore Andre. The giant is probably like, yeah,</v>

1159
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.100
must be means Yo Ming.

1160
01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.420
That stuff takes away so much from your recovery because if you're snoring and

1161
01:02:30.421 --> 01:02:32.220
you're not getting the proper oxygen in,

1162
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:34.440
you know this Dr Caribbean that I go to,

1163
01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:37.710
he puts this thing in your mouth and he has you breathe in and out.

1164
01:02:37.711 --> 01:02:40.170
It actually literally measures the output of your breath,

1165
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:43.260
like how much comes in and comes out and he devised this thing to hold your

1166
01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:45.420
tongue in place to open up your airway.

1167
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:50.570
Almost like a resting field to Max kind of thing. Yeah, similarities.

1168
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.560
Yeah, and some guys wind up getting up.

1169
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:55.830
I know a couple of guys have gotten an operation where they open up your throat

1170
01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.210
hole better and they remove your tonsils and they remove your adenoids and that

1171
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:02.670
opens up the area. Yeah.

1172
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:05.640
They literally get their fucking neck operated on.

1173
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.620
They cut some of the meat out so that you have more, more air. I want to,

1174
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:15.210
how does that work in terms of being an athlete? Like would that be,

1175
01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:17.960
you definitely wouldn't be able to get choked for a long time. I find that,

1176
01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:19.830
fuck me up for a long time.

1177
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.830
Imagine someone getting you in a guillotine after you've had your tonsils and

1178
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:25.710
adenoids and all that shit. You'd be months, months afterward.

1179
01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.640
We'd be able to really train hard, I would imagine. Yeah. Maybe I'll heal up.

1180
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.480
Not going to do that. Maybe I won't go that route. But if it works.

1181
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.730
But the thing is like, doesn't your tonsils,

1182
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:39.150
don't they play a part in your immune system? I don't know.

1183
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.040
I mean they're there. They're just hanging out. I did not like an appendix.

1184
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.890
Right. They're there for a reason. It's not like a,

1185
01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:50.850
a leftover vestige of a different time. And people get it removed to,

1186
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.750
yes. What Jamie [inaudible] part of the [inaudible]

1187
01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.300
<v 5>immune system. A location at the back of the throat.</v>

1188
01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:01.610
Stop Germs from entering the body through the mouth or nose. Nice.

1189
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.750
And they contain blood, wiped a lot of, lot of white blood cells.

1190
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.840
<v 0>I need those. Yeah. So maybe just get a mouthpiece,</v>

1191
01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.630
but yeah. Well I got this guy, this Guy Andrew,

1192
01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:17.070
he's making these new dental mouthpieces. Um, it's like,

1193
01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:21.420
it's called dental impact. So it's supposed to help you for like MMA fight,

1194
01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.830
supposed to have like a little extra cushion for you cause you know the,

1195
01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.750
you ever have you ever tried the double padded mouthpiece and it had like that

1196
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:30.360
little slit and you're supposed to be expected to breathe through that.

1197
01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.580
But once you open your jaw, the mouth piece falls out.

1198
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.250
So this one is supposed to have like a little bit of a layer,

1199
01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:39.380
like a gel where you bite into it and it helps like almost like pull the jaw

1200
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:43.680
forward so it gives you like a little bit more room for impacts so you could

1201
01:04:43.681 --> 01:04:47.550
bike down. And I think it's going to just be better for like combat.

1202
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.473
I haven't tried it yet.

1203
01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:51.150
He supposed to send me one so I could try it out like and give some feedback and

1204
01:04:51.151 --> 01:04:54.900
see how it all works. It used to be a company shock doctor.

1205
01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.770
Are they still around? Um, I know they do like cups and shit like that.

1206
01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.880
I think there was like a shock doctor mouthpiece that had the same, um,

1207
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:08.010
the same idea behind it. But I was super skeptical. Oh, there it is. Yeah.

1208
01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:10.860
Shock doctor. But I think there's real science to that.

1209
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:14.430
Look at that fucking thing. What is that shit? It's like lip guard.

1210
01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.040
The mandible man for like football players usually use that

1211
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.270
<v 1>[inaudible] shield. Oh, lip guard. Oh, so you don't get your mouth,</v>

1212
01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:26.260
your lips busted. But there's a, what's that?

1213
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:29.110
Airflow one screwed up a little bit there. The white one. What does that say?

1214
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.810
Max Airflow. Football Mouth Guard. Huh? That looks stupid.

1215
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.930
Let's air through the middle. I get the whole, yeah,

1216
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:38.500
but that's fine with football. That's not fine for a five minute round.

1217
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:40.120
It looks small. You know what I mean?

1218
01:05:40.121 --> 01:05:44.290
Like it doesn't the hole get to like go all the way. Well, the part you bite on,

1219
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.890
right, right, right. It's not a far enough back. Dig into it.

1220
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:51.250
Like what are you biting on? Just the top part with your first few teeth.

1221
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:55.330
But I think they used to have these kinds of things and they were making some

1222
01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:58.300
claims, maybe not shock doctor, but maybe another company.

1223
01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.850
I think it was another company that was making a claim to do it.

1224
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:03.190
Allow you to take shots better reduce concussions.

1225
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:07.640
I think it has something to do with the that those two like nubs on top of the

1226
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:11.620
jaw, the mandible bone like I guess it looks like clips to nerve and that's what

1227
01:06:11.621 --> 01:06:14.720
shuts the lights off in the brain. What does that one that says Fang?

1228
01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:18.270
Double braces. Scroll back up for brace. Like people have braces. Oh is that,

1229
01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.520
I always want it, cause my daughter had braces and she was going to Jujitsu.

1230
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.700
She get choked and her mouth would get cut off with a bunch of holes in it.

1231
01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:27.970
Not just one big one. Oh, you know a lot of Russell's without,

1232
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.830
if you have braces and wrestling in high school,

1233
01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:31.600
you're not allowed to compete unless you have a mouthpiece.

1234
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:34.090
It's like a new rule that should, they should,

1235
01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:35.920
they shouldn't be allowed to compete without mouthpieces anyway.

1236
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.120
You don't wanna fuck up your lips.

1237
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.900
Even now when I wrestled and I bite down when I'm shooting sometimes and I get

1238
01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:45.180
my jaw like smashing into my teeth, I like poke steps. I'm like, yeah,

1239
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:48.520
tips on my teeth that way. Yeah. It's not good now. I wear mouthpiece always.

1240
01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:51.490
I always wear a cup too. And I wear a cup cause uh,

1241
01:06:51.491 --> 01:06:56.230
I got meat in the Dick once and my dick was bleeding. Ah, yeah.

1242
01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:01.600
Again, my friend Scott Epstein, Einstein, same dude, he goes past my garden,

1243
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:04.630
just an accident, slammed his knee into my Dick,

1244
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.540
flatten my dick out on the Dick.

1245
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:12.370
It's just sometimes it happens where it's like you zig, they zag pop.

1246
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.600
And when I took my jock off at the end of the Roland,

1247
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.600
there was blood in my jockstrap. I'm like, oh no. Was He,

1248
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:22.630
where are you guys drilling? Are you going to lie? Cause if you truly live,

1249
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.650
we're going live. It just understands it. Then it was just an accident.

1250
01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:28.780
It's just shit that happens. But it was,

1251
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:32.380
if I had it now I wear one of those diamond MMA cups.

1252
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:34.330
You ever fuck with those are the compression shorts.

1253
01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.300
So here's my thing with those guys, and I was going to say something earlier,

1254
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:42.220
but I didn't want it to, I just don't think one cup fits all. I just can't see.

1255
01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:45.760
Trying to say Dick's too big. I understand. I understand. Algo.

1256
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:52.200
My crotch. She just, the dye becomes too big for my crotch, man.

1257
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:56.890
They make it like chiefs. It's like it's not comfortable and I tried it.

1258
01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:59.950
I was like, dude, maybe I'm wearing it wrong. I tried it upside down. It's like,

1259
01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:03.160
just be making different sizes. They told me no dude is one size fits all.

1260
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.560
I'm like, dude, this just doesn't make any sense. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1261
01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:08.620
What Franchising Cano, Francis and Ghana and Henry.

1262
01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:13.090
So Hutto once I seen a cop get in the fuck Outta here,

1263
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:17.480
that's what they told me. That you say that's not even possible. Yeah,

1264
01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.790
they not right. They've come up to like the fight events.

1265
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.850
I've actually seen him in uh, Chicago. I saw him in Chicago again,

1266
01:08:22.851 --> 01:08:25.690
like handing out like samples and stuff and he asked me like,

1267
01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.560
how did you like the cup? And I'm like, yeah, I don't want to be a dick.

1268
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:30.560
I don't like being a mean guy. But you asking me this question,

1269
01:08:30.561 --> 01:08:32.660
I feel like I got to tell you the truth. I'm like, aw man, just didn't like it.

1270
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:34.690
He was like, oh, what was wrong with it? Told me I was like,

1271
01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:37.700
one size just doesn't fit all. I just always, that's what I told him.

1272
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:40.070
I was like, it just doesn't fit. It's too big. It's too big down there.

1273
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:43.010
You don't want something that's comfortable so he could kick and lift your leg,

1274
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:45.590
squeeze your legs together and Nah man,

1275
01:08:45.730 --> 01:08:49.130
that's just going to be crushing my sack all over the place. I get it.

1276
01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.610
Well for me it fits perfect, but I get it. Everybody's small guy,

1277
01:08:52.611 --> 01:08:56.900
different size junk area and if you have fat or thighs too, right?

1278
01:08:56.901 --> 01:09:00.410
Like white dudes with like, you know, giant like Sean Jordan,

1279
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:04.280
guys with giant thick ass legs. Like how are you going to get, you know?

1280
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.110
Yeah it's going to rub against it. But those,

1281
01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.030
the compression shorts would help with that.

1282
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.080
Cause that's the whole idea is that instead of like the way everybody used to

1283
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.110
wear it was just like a jockstrap. Right?

1284
01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.930
You'd have a cup in the jockstrap and it kind of floated around like I remember

1285
01:09:17.931 --> 01:09:18.960
in a Taco on don't turn him around,

1286
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.850
got kicked in the balls once and my cups slammed into my nut. Uh,

1287
01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.100
and I was convinced,

1288
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:30.460
I was convinced my balls were useless after that cause my shit swole up like two

1289
01:09:30.681 --> 01:09:34.160
times the size it should've been and it was all purple and I was like,

1290
01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:34.971
I broke my balls.

1291
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:37.460
Did you have to get it drained or did you just like go down these?

1292
01:09:37.461 --> 01:09:40.880
I was 18 I didn't do it. God, I didn't do it. God,

1293
01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:45.770
I think I jerked off to make sure it worked once it still worked.

1294
01:09:45.771 --> 01:09:49.460
I'm like, we're good. Have it.

1295
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:53.510
That's what I did after I started broke my Dick. I weighted that.

1296
01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:56.990
Not a beat off too, just to make sure it worked. I were like, we're good,

1297
01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:58.573
we're good.

1298
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.030
There is funny man that looks like chicken embryos and my toilet bowl,

1299
01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.930
my baseball coach, gender, like

1300
01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:14.720
it just came out. Piss came out bloody too. I piss blood for a couple of days.

1301
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.320
That's the worst pissing blood. Well, I knew it was all just dick blood.

1302
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.831
I was just like,

1303
01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:22.940
the moment I feel like any sort of infection or it feels like it's sore,

1304
01:10:22.941 --> 01:10:25.400
it didn't hurt. So I was like, I'm not going to be nervous.

1305
01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:27.350
I'm going to treat it like my nose. I'm like,

1306
01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:29.840
I don't want my nose to fall off either, but if my nose is bloody,

1307
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:33.400
I don't freak out. So I didn't want to freak out if my dick was bloody unlike,

1308
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:37.470
let me just treat it like it's a normal thing. Just don't,

1309
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:40.670
don't freak out. And it was fine. It's like a northern line in the room.

1310
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:47.780
Don't freak out. Keep moving. If I'm pissing blood, I'm freaking the fuck out.

1311
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.140
I know. I was a little freaking out. It wasn't like I was not nervous at all,

1312
01:10:51.141 --> 01:10:53.420
but I W I was trying to rationalize and I was saying, okay,

1313
01:10:53.421 --> 01:10:55.160
this is no different than my nose.

1314
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.220
If my nose was bleeding right now and I ran to the hospital,

1315
01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:02.600
freaking the fuck out, it'd be a bitch. Right, right. Oh, can we type this?

1316
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:05.270
You knows big bloody a lot. Get Dick.

1317
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:10.490
You got gotta need that for some things. You definitely do. I definitely wasn't,

1318
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:12.530
I mean I wasn't ignoring it. I was like,

1319
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:16.200
the moment it feels like if my nose was infected, I'd probably walk it off it.

1320
01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:19.750
My Dick is infected. I am going straight to the ER. Um, man,

1321
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:23.190
it's dangerous man. Infections are fucking dangerous.

1322
01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:26.560
They scared of shit on there anywhere. Infections are terrible.

1323
01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.080
A football coach today,

1324
01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:31.810
I guess he publicly stated he would cut his dick off for a super bowl win. Oh,

1325
01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.261
don't say it.

1326
01:11:32.261 --> 01:11:37.261
That didn't end up going to have the female Superbowl league when the female NFL

1327
01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:40.920
comes along. You could, you could join up. You could be a champ.

1328
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.750
It's nowadays you can just do that.

1329
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:47.580
You can just decide I'm a woman and I'm a champion.

1330
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:50.940
Someone make that argument that they said Dennis Robbins should be considered

1331
01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:54.240
like the first NBA player, gay player. No, he's still,

1332
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.320
it was Dick [inaudible] bangs girls.

1333
01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:00.870
He doesn't even pretend to be addressed or cross, I guess. I don't know,

1334
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:05.430
cross dresser, but even that's like more for show. He does it for fun. You know,

1335
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:09.360
he's still big to be doing all that shit. How crazy is that?

1336
01:12:09.361 --> 01:12:13.410
He's just to North Korea. He friends with a dictator.

1337
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.790
They fly him over there.

1338
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.690
He's playing basketball with that dude partying with them and even giving them

1339
01:12:18.691 --> 01:12:23.150
advice on like how to get along with Trump and everybody should get along. Yeah,

1340
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.370
I guess. I mean, if it's working, they're not going to bomb us and shit.

1341
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:29.270
He was my favorite dude. Him and uh,

1342
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.670
Eric Roberts were my favorite dude on celebrity rehab because neither one of

1343
01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:35.790
them had a real problem. Like Eric Roberts would smoke weed,

1344
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.610
so he stopped smoking weed. He's, you see him every morning.

1345
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.180
He's fucking reading the newspaper and drinking coffee to no problem in the

1346
01:12:42.181 --> 01:12:45.000
world. Fucking Dennis Rodman's on the treadmill.

1347
01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:49.020
He's running miles and she's a professional athlete man. So he's not drinking,

1348
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:52.170
he's not partying anymore. He likes to party. Was he going to live forever?

1349
01:12:52.171 --> 01:12:55.020
If he doesn't party, then Eric Roberts smokes a little weed.

1350
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.470
What's the big deal? So both of those guys on that show with like,

1351
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:03.300
I don't see the problem. You guys are okay. Like really cute.

1352
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:06.180
Can you check again? Briden's doing miles on the treadmill.

1353
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:08.250
Everybody else is going through seizures,

1354
01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:12.420
detox and they're freaking the fuck out. And Rod was there sweating. Whew.

1355
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:17.400
Get it in. Yeah, he's fine. As funny. That is funny man.

1356
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:20.070
How crazy is it that the Kim Jong wounded loves him?

1357
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:26.790
That's a weird relationship at work. There's a lot of guys who live there.

1358
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:31.770
He is Pardee. Not Crazy. The guy loves basketball, man. Crazy.

1359
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:35.400
What happened to his lip though? Rodman yet doing a bunch of stuff.

1360
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:38.310
Putting Barb's and stuff. No,

1361
01:13:38.311 --> 01:13:42.120
but it looks like something happened like it got bit by like a rattlesnake or

1362
01:13:42.121 --> 01:13:46.410
some shit. You know what I mean? Shit. Swollen. Well,

1363
01:13:46.411 --> 01:13:49.590
he's always had big lips and then on top of that he's got a hole in it.

1364
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.860
Look at that fucking hole that, that ring that's pushing down on his lip.

1365
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:56.670
That's crazy. But I feel like when he was in his prime years in the NBA,

1366
01:13:56.671 --> 01:13:58.470
it didn't look, his lips didn't look like that.

1367
01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:01.620
They looked like burnt out look like if it looks infected.

1368
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:06.750
I think that Barb makes it look crazy. They're crazy. Yeah. Crazy,

1369
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:09.190
crazy earth. I think it's like that picture right there.

1370
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.820
Look at Trump with his lips and it's like a fucking witch lip.

1371
01:14:12.821 --> 01:14:14.990
Would you have for the rest of your life, do you have any trees

1372
01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.830
of like weird downturn lips?

1373
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:25.480
Gigantic infected lips on little tiny tiny tiny lips. Yeah,

1374
01:14:25.481 --> 01:14:27.160
I don't know. That's a hard call.

1375
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:31.570
It's a hard call if you have to take who's look for the rest of your life?

1376
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:32.560
Kim Jong Moon.

1377
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.320
I'm going to go with Rodman cause he at least sees a professional athletes.

1378
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.450
Got a great body, you know

1379
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:45.520
[inaudible] well it's weird when dictators get really into athletics, right?

1380
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:48.430
Like that Chechnyan guy sends a lot of MMA fighters out.

1381
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.600
I heard you talking about this. Yeah,

1382
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.620
why they was telling us the story that guys like nuts. I heard,

1383
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:57.220
oh I'm sure he's nuts. Like he likes, he said he talked,

1384
01:14:57.221 --> 01:14:59.770
I don't know if this is like okay to talk about or not, but he thought powerful,

1385
01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:03.690
powerful man. Yeah. But he said he liked Andrew's powerful man. He told that.

1386
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.340
He told why me to like fight the other guy.

1387
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.470
And it was like dead serious about it. I don't know if they like had a, I don't,

1388
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:12.910
I think he figured out a way to like get out of it or something.

1389
01:15:12.911 --> 01:15:14.920
And then like one of his guys,

1390
01:15:14.921 --> 01:15:18.340
I think it was either one of his guys or very doom fight either Verdugo Duma,

1391
01:15:18.341 --> 01:15:20.560
one of his guys. I think that's what he says. Something crazy like that.

1392
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.990
I was like, Yo Bro, tonight's pay him to do it. Ah Huh.

1393
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:28.930
I think so, but it was kinda like one of those like just super powerful.

1394
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:32.140
Just kind of like what he, he gets what he wants, you know? Holy Shit.

1395
01:15:32.141 --> 01:15:34.270
It's like, dude, you, that's like something, get the fuck out it.

1396
01:15:34.271 --> 01:15:36.940
Enter the Dragon Shit. Right. He flies out to an island.

1397
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.060
You fight,

1398
01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:45.040
fight and he sits there in his fucking giant throne. That's crazy.

1399
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.930
Asking people to fight. Yeah. Yeah.

1400
01:15:47.931 --> 01:15:50.140
I guess if you're that rich and that powerful,

1401
01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:52.600
you can kind of get away with that. But it's happened before.

1402
01:15:52.601 --> 01:15:54.880
We've had dudes out there and they made an agreement. All right,

1403
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.040
let's fucking fight. Just go after it. Right.

1404
01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:00.340
There's stuff like that makes me nervous to go to places like that. I'm like,

1405
01:16:00.341 --> 01:16:04.990
I just came here to enjoy the culture, not to do all this extracurricular shit.

1406
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:08.680
Imagine if you can go to Moscow and you knock out pure true Yan. Oh,

1407
01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:10.110
I'm running the fuck out in it then.

1408
01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:15.380
Then Putin wants you to come over [inaudible] come [inaudible] come over to

1409
01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.690
castle. Yeah, I dunno. That's happened.

1410
01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:22.790
Go in there and Pedro Munoz is there in shorts. They're like,

1411
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:27.180
what the fuck is going on? Like rematch. Rematch. Yeah.

1412
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:31.780
Fuck yeah. That's a crazy, oh, I was saying the bed though, man.

1413
01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:34.430
I gotta pull out couch. Yeah. Why do you have a block

1414
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:41.080
here from the pullout couch? The uh, yeah, I, so I, it'd be,

1415
01:16:41.081 --> 01:16:43.360
it'd be my house. I got my real estate license back in March.

1416
01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.900
I finally finished my, uh, I did like one flipped before in Arizona.

1417
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:49.290
It didn't go so well, but I gained experience like,

1418
01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:52.630
let's use that as like the cost of doing business. So I learned a lot, man.

1419
01:16:52.631 --> 01:16:54.280
Learn a lot about like developing.

1420
01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:58.720
And you looked at yourself now we took the course together the same year.

1421
01:16:58.721 --> 01:16:59.680
How to flip houses.

1422
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:02.680
There's actually a bus tour going on right now and I guy hit me up,

1423
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:03.880
Nicole Manya he wants me to,

1424
01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.130
he wants me to come down [inaudible] probably tomorrow in Irvine.

1425
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:10.280
But those guys, they kill it man. [inaudible] doing like crazy commercial stuff.

1426
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.280
<v 2>They're doing stuff in just residential Hawaii Quintas doing thousands,</v>

1427
01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.170
right? Yeah. That's awesome for him. I got my license.

1428
01:17:18.171 --> 01:17:23.120
I haven't sold a single house yet since March that was traded for a fight,

1429
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:25.160
you know, so it's gotta be hard. Yeah.

1430
01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:29.180
Well I don't even know how to use the fucking mos yet. So that's the problem.

1431
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.360
So you asked me to show you something like send you houses like listings.

1432
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.560
I should be able to like comprise like some data of like things that fit your

1433
01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:39.500
criteria and then send it to you on like an automatic email.

1434
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.020
But I gotta learn how to do that. So kind of just sit in there.

1435
01:17:42.021 --> 01:17:44.740
But to get back to about saying I like I bought the house, um,

1436
01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.090
after the Cody statement fight before the Cody statement fight.

1437
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:48.380
So I'm like shitting bricks.

1438
01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:50.930
I'm like trying to close that house was about to um,

1439
01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:53.030
the deal was about to fall through the day of closing. I was like,

1440
01:17:53.031 --> 01:17:56.270
get the fuck Outta here. You're going to close this deal one way or the other.

1441
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:59.000
Even if I got to shell out extra money, I was shut out the extra money.

1442
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.000
So I get the house next year. No, my mortgage is three grand.

1443
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.860
So three grand plus my utilities, I'm looking at about like 35, 3,600.

1444
01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:10.430
Now when you equate like the salary that I make from fighting and everything in

1445
01:18:10.431 --> 01:18:14.990
New York taxes and all that, it's just not very, um, lucrative.

1446
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:16.610
Yeah, it's not sustainable.

1447
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:19.820
There's no way I could do it unless I'm fighting like three, four times a year.

1448
01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:22.970
Like guaranteed. If I'm not, I might be in some trouble.

1449
01:18:22.971 --> 01:18:25.240
I don't have health insurance right now. We all, yeah,

1450
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:29.330
that's I and this is like crazy. That's crazy shit. That's crazy.

1451
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:32.270
You're fighting in a cage without health insurance. Get hit by a car.

1452
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:35.420
Just talking about your car today. If you get injured in a fight though,

1453
01:18:35.421 --> 01:18:38.520
you're compensated, right? I'm compensated. But if this is like an illness,

1454
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.210
I'm not compensated for nothing like that. So it was a little different.

1455
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.280
So that's why I'm like, yeah, I gotta I gotta make sure I like,

1456
01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:45.980
I don't get sick, I gotta make sure I'm doing the right things.

1457
01:18:45.981 --> 01:18:49.550
Look both ways before across the street, like little things like that. But uh,

1458
01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.450
yeah, so I bought the house, whatever I managed it managed to close.

1459
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:55.880
So I'm trying to figure out ways to sustain this.

1460
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:59.300
Cause then my mom's in a situation where she's like facing an eviction at the

1461
01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:02.330
time. Uh, she's going through a five year divorce now is going to be,

1462
01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:06.090
October is going to be five years. And uh, it's just my dad's, he's a fuck.

1463
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:10.310
He could be a pain in the ass to deal with in terms of just using his rational

1464
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:13.660
humanly side of thinking. He just doesn't get it. And, uh,

1465
01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:18.500
I've been trying to like somehow be like the, the, the bridge between the two.

1466
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:20.510
Cause you know, it's been a lot of fucked up years,

1467
01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:21.920
like domestic abuse and shit like that.

1468
01:19:21.921 --> 01:19:25.130
So I grew up with a lot of that man and um, my dad,

1469
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.850
and not to get off subject but that shit fucked me up in terms of like my

1470
01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:32.540
confidence like as a kid, I mean he would just call a stupid and,

1471
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:34.940
and all these names for whatever reason.

1472
01:19:34.941 --> 01:19:39.860
And I felt like even till like dating in middle school and high school was tough

1473
01:19:39.861 --> 01:19:42.350
for me because yeah it was the good looking kid.

1474
01:19:42.351 --> 01:19:45.080
But at the same time it's like I didn't know how to hold a conversation cause I

1475
01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:49.610
was never taught, I was never taught by my dad how to do certain things and um,

1476
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.420
that made me like very self conscious and like approaching females and stuff

1477
01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.280
like that. Like they didn't approach me with my friends,

1478
01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:58.550
didn't start the conversation, forget about it. If I see any chick that I liked,

1479
01:19:58.551 --> 01:20:00.170
I had a crush on him. Forget about my talking to her.

1480
01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:02.180
Even my girlfriend to this day, went to the same high school,

1481
01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:06.260
never talked to her, we never spoke. And I thought she was wanting the sexiest,

1482
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:09.060
prettiest, most beautiful females out there in the whole high school.

1483
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:12.090
And I didn't, I just never talked to her. I just always see her.

1484
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:15.300
I was smiling like, yeah, I want to talk to you, but I can't.

1485
01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:19.140
I just can't do it. I just can't do it. But now we're dating whatever. But um,

1486
01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:22.650
yeah man. So I had to learn how to do a lot of that stuff on my own, but I'll,

1487
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:22.801
yeah,

1488
01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:25.530
I'm trying to bridge the gap between the two of them and it's just been really

1489
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:27.030
tough. So she's facing the eviction.

1490
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.510
I got to figure something out now and I ended up, long story short,

1491
01:20:30.511 --> 01:20:34.320
I don't want to like go too crazy into details, but um, long story short,

1492
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:36.690
I won the fight with Cody statements, so that was huge for me.

1493
01:20:36.691 --> 01:20:37.524
If I didn't win that fight,

1494
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:40.290
I would have been fucked in terms of like really trying to help my mom cause I

1495
01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:41.280
wasn't trying to take my money,

1496
01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:44.630
my hard earned money and throw it into something like a rental. I'm like,

1497
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.980
it just doesn't make any sense cause she doesn't have a green papers.

1498
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:50.160
So she wasn't working. My Dad paid for everything. He was like,

1499
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.800
he was a sugar daddy, you know, he fucking, you know,

1500
01:20:52.801 --> 01:20:54.780
he did his street pharmacy stuff.

1501
01:20:54.781 --> 01:20:58.200
He had his street pharmacy ways and so he made his money the way he made his

1502
01:20:58.201 --> 01:21:01.440
money, you know, and um, she never had to work. I mean,

1503
01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:04.050
she's an interesting way of putting it. It's treat pharmacy. I don't know,

1504
01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:07.190
like what's like, okay to say, you know,

1505
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:10.200
before there's people knocking at the door. So yeah,

1506
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:13.860
you're saying just confessed to like years and years and years of no,

1507
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:15.380
no bandaids. Yeah.

1508
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:20.550
But my mom would help them and I just felt obligated as a, as her,

1509
01:21:20.551 --> 01:21:21.810
one of her oldest kids.

1510
01:21:21.811 --> 01:21:25.800
I know she's got two kids older than me on her side alone. She has 10 kids.

1511
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:29.790
Just with my mom, not with my dad, like just her alone and then with my dad,

1512
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:30.480
she has eight.

1513
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.840
I'm the oldest of the eight with my dad and then the two other kids are from

1514
01:21:33.841 --> 01:21:35.130
another two different guys.

1515
01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:38.430
So it's just our family trees like just fucking wacky.

1516
01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:39.630
It's just all over the place.

1517
01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:44.360
Like my family has even met my girlfriend's family. It's just like, it's, it's,

1518
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:46.320
I don't even know how the wedding's going to go if we, you know,

1519
01:21:46.321 --> 01:21:48.950
we have to decide to get married. Like do I have, yeah.

1520
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.760
Do I invite like who do I invite?

1521
01:21:50.761 --> 01:21:55.170
Who do I not invite to make sure there's no like, oh this is just a little,

1522
01:21:55.171 --> 01:21:58.740
we did it last minute. Guys ran off to Mexico and have a party though.

1523
01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:01.050
This way the wedding doesn't get ruined. Yes.

1524
01:22:01.051 --> 01:22:03.870
Then you have a party afterwards and then everybody goes sideways.

1525
01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.230
We had a great wedding. Yeah. You just go, you just,

1526
01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:10.830
you and her and maybe like a couple other people just go to fucking The Bahamas

1527
01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:12.310
or something. She, that's what I want to do. But push.

1528
01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.700
You see what she wants to do. She has a huge family too,

1529
01:22:14.701 --> 01:22:17.220
so she wants everybody there.

1530
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:22.210
She's got family in California and Texas back in Salvador. I'm like, Yo,

1531
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:24.583
it is.

1532
01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:29.630
It is that I'm probably going to be paying the entire bill for it isn't that

1533
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.910
special day is so nuts.

1534
01:22:32.911 --> 01:22:36.660
You spend so much money like shouldn't we not spend this money and just go on

1535
01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:41.310
vacation? That's what, that's the way I live my life. And also more than that,

1536
01:22:41.311 --> 01:22:44.080
like you have a lot of weddings are like a fucking car. Yeah,

1537
01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:45.900
the costs like a brand new car.

1538
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:48.570
It was a kid's tuition should feed your child's tuition that you're spending on

1539
01:22:48.571 --> 01:22:51.930
a wedding. You know, what are we doing with all this money? Society, man,

1540
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:55.260
I think you see everyone it got they the way they dressed it up and they

1541
01:22:55.261 --> 01:22:56.790
programmed our brains to,

1542
01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:59.340
and if you kind of like stuck in your ways and that's what you want,

1543
01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.880
that's what you want and I get it. I want it to be,

1544
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.700
everyone wants to be their princess moment. I get it. I get it. This is to me.

1545
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:06.280
Yeah,

1546
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.500
<v 1>exactly. Very important to me. I'll do, mate. That's very important. Yeah,</v>

1547
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:14.110
I can imagine her listening to this right now. We're just joking. I'm sorry.

1548
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:17.560
I probably look, I'm married too. Look, I should shut the fuck up. Yeah,

1549
01:23:17.561 --> 01:23:20.440
you want to be happy. This a that expression. Happy wife. Happy life.

1550
01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:23.290
Just whatever. What do I gotta do? I was just like my house.

1551
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:25.720
I don't have a God damn thing on the walls of my house. I didn't,

1552
01:23:25.721 --> 01:23:27.820
I didn't put nothing up. It's all my wife deck.

1553
01:23:27.821 --> 01:23:30.570
That's why this place is so crazy. This she did this too.

1554
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:34.920
This place is free. This is where my fucking house should look like.

1555
01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:39.850
B Elk Goals and American flags and Mitzi shore and Tie Buddhas. Richard Pryor.

1556
01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:43.640
That ghostbuster gun. That's what my fucking house. If you like this,

1557
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:46.960
this podcast studio, but if you go over my house, you'd be like, oh,

1558
01:23:46.961 --> 01:23:50.020
we're in the wrong place. Joe Doesn't live here. That's funny.

1559
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.580
This is like a a woman or a gay guy. Hey,

1560
01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:58.300
I hear you man. That's how my house is set. My, my girlfriend hasn't,

1561
01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:59.740
she doesn't, she hasn't moved in yet,

1562
01:23:59.741 --> 01:24:02.950
so she hasn't been able to like put her own special touches.

1563
01:24:02.951 --> 01:24:06.160
Ring her mattress and get the fuck over. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much.

1564
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:08.130
I need a fucking bed. I'm like, dude, we need new best site.

1565
01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.270
We were just going to take yours. I bet he's actually pretty comfortable,

1566
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:11.111
but what about one of these,

1567
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:13.570
maybe make a deal with this company that gave Jamie that bed.

1568
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.320
What's that company again? Let's call it eight sleep. Go brother sleep. Listen,

1569
01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:22.190
reach out to me. Reach out to aljamain. That's make something.

1570
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:26.260
Listen, if there's something that really does work like that,

1571
01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:29.830
I mean I need to try it. The chill pat is one that Marxists and recommends.

1572
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:33.490
He said it's incredible. He said it's a game changer to cools your body down.

1573
01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:36.010
You sleep way better. I don't know if it's gonna hold my apnea,

1574
01:24:36.011 --> 01:24:38.380
but it might feel better while I'm sleeping.

1575
01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:41.350
The other thing that'll help you apnea is if you can get to a position where

1576
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:45.160
you're got a pillow where your, your mouth is down, like falling forward. Yeah.

1577
01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:47.830
Like if you, if you can instead of sleeping on your back,

1578
01:24:47.831 --> 01:24:50.020
which is your tongue is going to fall back, sleep boy,

1579
01:24:50.021 --> 01:24:53.100
your mouth is kind turned forward. Cause if I forget my mouth,

1580
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:55.960
so I go on the road, that's what I do and it's fine.

1581
01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.390
As long as I make sure that my head is pointing down,

1582
01:24:58.780 --> 01:24:59.740
it's like an awkward angle.

1583
01:24:59.741 --> 01:25:03.790
I wake up my next killing me and I got bad neck like from like voting disc and

1584
01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:06.970
herniated disc in my neck just from wrestling and orange Jujitsu.

1585
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:10.090
So everybody does. Right. And yeah, it's fucked up.

1586
01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.530
Do you ever use one of those harnesses?

1587
01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.700
We hang from your neck a little bit until it's spinal decompression.

1588
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:18.160
I think he's talking about one that, that, that sleep mask thing. Oh yeah.

1589
01:25:18.161 --> 01:25:20.560
I was like that too. You breathe out of your nose and it looks ridiculous.

1590
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.860
I tried that. Everyone was laughing at me. I can't sleep, I can't go to bed,

1591
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.550
you know. But if you breathe out of your nose cause does your nose work good?

1592
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.540
Yeah, I think so. I don't think it's deviated. It might be, I don't know.

1593
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:35.470
Can you go? Do you do a yoga class ever and just breathe out of the nose only?

1594
01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.800
Mm. I've done I think one yoga class and that was in college.

1595
01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:44.290
That was a long time ago. But if you can, um, these,

1596
01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:47.550
uh, neck things, if you can, you can find them on Amazon. They just,

1597
01:25:47.551 --> 01:25:52.060
a neck harness saw expensive straps to a door. The top of the door,

1598
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.950
decompress, click, click, click.

1599
01:25:53.951 --> 01:25:56.800
You pull it and it pulls your neck and you can just relax and it just stretches

1600
01:25:56.801 --> 01:26:00.140
your neck out. What's it called? It's home. I mean, I might,

1601
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.530
I know decompression harness. Yeah, I probably could get of those.

1602
01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.393
They'll help you.

1603
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.000
I feel good to relax your neck when you do like the incline bed and you can hang

1604
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:10.850
upside down. Even all the plug rushes to your head, which sucks. Yeah.

1605
01:26:10.851 --> 01:26:13.670
I have one of those too. Yeah. That's the only thing I don't like lower back.

1606
01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:16.550
Yeah. Thing right there. That's what I have no things that shit.

1607
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:20.210
I gotta do that in a safe setting. My safe space. Yeah.

1608
01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.490
Quinoa was looking at me. Yeah. It's definitely that.

1609
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:25.590
But you pull on it and it click, click, click, click, click, and it,

1610
01:26:25.591 --> 01:26:29.880
it relaxes your neck. What's the clicking? Is that the spine? It's like the ugh.

1611
01:26:30.090 --> 01:26:34.280
The lover. A little notches. Each notch. It like pulls it a certain amount.

1612
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:36.830
Yeah, click click and you pull it more click, click.

1613
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.160
And then when you want you just sit up and you release all the tension.

1614
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:44.450
I just had a terrible thought in my head with that jerking off now cause that's

1615
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:48.350
what like people die from. That's how David Carradine from Kung Fu, he died,

1616
01:26:48.351 --> 01:26:51.500
strangled himself, always beaten off. Allegedly might've got killed.

1617
01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:55.880
I heard he might get killed by the mob. Heard. Yeah. He um,

1618
01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.850
he died of what they call auto erotic x fixed creation.

1619
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:05.210
Do you remember the band? [inaudible] not annex. NXS Yeah,

1620
01:27:05.211 --> 01:27:09.650
I was thinking of the car and the sex in excess. The lead singer, same thing.

1621
01:27:09.651 --> 01:27:11.930
He died from autoerotic fixation.

1622
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:16.230
There's dudes who try to choke themselves where they beat off [inaudible]

1623
01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.253
<v 7>pure</v>

1624
01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.700
level shit was a preacher,

1625
01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.140
<v 1>a preacher. They caught this preacher wearing a wet suit.</v>

1626
01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.510
He had a dildo up his ass and he was choking himself and he blacked out while

1627
01:27:32.511 --> 01:27:37.340
he's beaten off and died. Ray Donovan. Yeah. Something like that might've been,

1628
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:41.270
they might've set him up to, who knows? He might've been banging some kids.

1629
01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.680
That's all I got back at him. Yeah. Nah, I'd never heard of that. That's that's,

1630
01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.650
that's a different way of erotic association.

1631
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.200
That's a different kind of a s it was what's called a SMS or yeah,

1632
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.140
that mess is sadomasochistic. Right. That's sadomasochism and bonding. S,

1633
01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:01.880
m whatever the fuck it is. Bonded next level, man.

1634
01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:06.470
I can never get off on that. They say that something about being, being choked,

1635
01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:10.910
that it accentuates the orgasm so well, I mean, come on,

1636
01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.980
say Babe Ben.

1637
01:28:18.630 --> 01:28:20.380
<v 7>Fucking ridiculous. Give me that look. You</v>

1638
01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:24.600
<v 1>know, you know strangle. Can we get that little lasso?</v>

1639
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:28.920
Stop roping cows and wrap it around your neck will give you a full report.

1640
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:30.180
When I get back.

1641
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:35.260
It's just Alabama minister who died in June of accidental mechanical fix you.

1642
01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.260
It was found hogtied wearing two complete wetsuits, including a face mask,

1643
01:28:40.410 --> 01:28:43.830
diving gloves and slippers, rubberized underwear.

1644
01:28:43.831 --> 01:28:46.410
And a head mask according to the autopsy report,

1645
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:49.350
51 year old pastor Monica, what does it say?

1646
01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:54.870
Montgomery's cause death was not caused by foul play. If that is not foul play,

1647
01:28:55.410 --> 01:29:00.120
how do you play and can I read your rule book? Does this shit seems foul?

1648
01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:02.280
Yeah. He had a dildo

1649
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.100
<v 5>up his ass, right? Didn't he covered this bomb reason.</v>

1650
01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.320
Kingdom covered deal though. Hey, you don't want to get pregnant, right?

1651
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:13.870
Condom covered dildo up his ass while he was beaten up.

1652
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:14.520
I mean that's,

1653
01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.380
that's from like trying to like hold back all your sin pretending that you don't

1654
01:29:19.381 --> 01:29:22.470
have any sin cause you're a pastor and it just bubbles up to the surface.

1655
01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:25.830
You would had to special order that too. It's illegal to sell those in Alabama.

1656
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:29.670
Good legals to serve. What those? Yeah. Really?

1657
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:32.730
Oh stop hating on dildos.

1658
01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:36.180
Oh just didn't have a Dildo in Alabama. I just heard to like,

1659
01:29:36.181 --> 01:29:38.790
I think Mississippi is the only state you're allowed to drink while you're

1660
01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:43.500
driving. As long as you don't cross over the 0.08 Gat is God damn hilarious.

1661
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.040
Beer in your front seat. Wow. Mississippi.

1662
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:52.170
Mississippi also has the fucking confederate flag. It's in, it's a state flag.

1663
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.220
Yeah. Part of the state flag. It's like yikes. Wild laws down there.

1664
01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.280
The wild, wild west. Wild, wild south. I don't think

1665
01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:05.560
<v 2>if I've ever been to Mississippi I have it. I don't know if I've ever been,</v>

1666
01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.070
I haven't even been to New Orleans. I still want to go there.

1667
01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:12.430
New Orleans is wild to hear nothing but good things. Great people, man.

1668
01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:16.600
I can't wait. Nice friendly people and the food is outstanding. Yeah.

1669
01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:21.070
I got this idea that I've been trying to do for like years now and I haven't

1670
01:30:21.071 --> 01:30:23.860
been able to make this happen because of financial situations.

1671
01:30:23.861 --> 01:30:25.870
The whole thing like with my mom and shit like that,

1672
01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:30.490
like trying to get the house for and whatnot. Um, but I want to hit like every,

1673
01:30:30.491 --> 01:30:33.150
do like a cross country tour and hit every state,

1674
01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:36.850
every capitol and document the entire fucking thing.

1675
01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:40.090
Like a one two month like escapade or some shit.

1676
01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.490
Maybe after the next fight I would like to.

1677
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:47.230
But then I'm also thinking like I would have some point like to maybe have kids

1678
01:30:47.231 --> 01:30:48.280
or something, but then I'm like,

1679
01:30:48.281 --> 01:30:51.610
if I have a kid and I can't leave her while she's pregnant and unless she just

1680
01:30:51.611 --> 01:30:55.540
comes along like, but then she works and she's in school. I'm like, damn,

1681
01:30:55.541 --> 01:30:58.120
does everything, just nothing ever works out unless I just go

1682
01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:03.040
workout. I feel bad. If I were to just leave for that long,

1683
01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:06.760
you got to win the title 10 I'm like, y'all, I'm out. Could we get that?

1684
01:31:07.090 --> 01:31:11.710
<v 5>That's big. Scratch about like, come on. What would you do if you won the title?</v>

1685
01:31:11.711 --> 01:31:13.750
Would you, would you vacate and just say enough?

1686
01:31:14.230 --> 01:31:16.270
What do you have an idea of when you want to stop fighting?

1687
01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.370
<v 2>Oh, I see. You know, it was very interesting that you asked me that.</v>

1688
01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.233
It's always been,

1689
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:25.040
I got asked the guys at the gym too has always been a 30 to 32 so we're close.

1690
01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:25.933
I'm close.

1691
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:29.890
Whether or not I'm gonna feel the same when I'm 32 being that I'm about to be 30

1692
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:32.570
I'm realizing how close that is. If I, you know,

1693
01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:35.300
realize my dream and I got the real estate thing,

1694
01:31:35.301 --> 01:31:39.110
I got a college degree in physical education. I'm trying out for the FT and Y.

1695
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:42.650
Um, I'm still unsure how that's gonna work out.

1696
01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.440
It's just the flexibility of the schedule and actually being able to have

1697
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:49.730
healthcare benefits for myself and my family. Whoever that is. You know,

1698
01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:53.900
talk to Steve Pay. Um, no, but I have firefighter friends back home. I know.

1699
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:58.010
I actually, I think I have one time and he told me he love it. Uh,

1700
01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.040
Eddie Island too, right? Yeah. Eddie won

1701
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:00.970
<v 3>that as well. Yeah, they fight.</v>

1702
01:32:00.971 --> 01:32:03.130
I think I was talking to him about that briefly in Chicago.

1703
01:32:03.131 --> 01:32:07.930
Shout out to the mustache Mafia. Yeah, he gave me one of those things. Yeah.

1704
01:32:07.931 --> 01:32:10.210
I don't even know he was fighting on the car until I seen it pop up and I'm

1705
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:13.930
like, Holy Shit. And then you know, he had a crazy ass fight. That car crazy.

1706
01:32:14.170 --> 01:32:18.940
Then you guys, yeah, wild. It's a wild fight, man. Eddie Weiland's a tank.

1707
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:22.270
He's one of the more unusual fighters when you watch him move.

1708
01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:25.720
Like he's one of those guys where you could see him in a silhouette. You Go,

1709
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:29.970
oh that's Eddie Wineland. Yeah. Cause shades and everything. Crazy, crazy,

1710
01:32:29.971 --> 01:32:33.940
like weird style to try to sort out. Like he's,

1711
01:32:33.941 --> 01:32:38.520
he's so unusual in his movement. First WEC champion, right? Yes. Yes.

1712
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:40.210
Way Back in the day. That's show.

1713
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:44.790
That's back when it was in northern California, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1714
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:47.110
Where was that? The little cage? Yeah.

1715
01:32:47.111 --> 01:32:52.111
It was like where the fuck was the original original WEC was like,

1716
01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.790
I don't want to say Lodi, but, well I don't think it was low Dodd,

1717
01:32:55.791 --> 01:32:59.440
but it was like some more look more California or something like that.

1718
01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:01.390
Well those weird spots.

1719
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:03.350
<v 2>Yeah. I, I never looked at the location.</v>

1720
01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:05.660
Like now I start to pay attention to things like that now.

1721
01:33:05.661 --> 01:33:07.190
Like more like where I fall,

1722
01:33:07.191 --> 01:33:09.200
where the fight is going to be held and things like that.

1723
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:11.420
Cause I always end up going to the events from time to time.

1724
01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:15.840
<v 3>It is Lamar WBC 20 with Sony. One was in La Moore, California. Yeah.</v>

1725
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:17.370
That's where they used to have them out there.

1726
01:33:17.371 --> 01:33:21.150
That's when Reed was running at Rio Reed Harris. Yeah. I love that dude.

1727
01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.540
He's a good dude. He's a great dude. Yeah. Yeah. I mean those,

1728
01:33:24.570 --> 01:33:27.780
those pioneers of the game man, those guys who, you know,

1729
01:33:27.781 --> 01:33:31.800
like Bud Brotzmann used to run king of the cage and these people that run these

1730
01:33:31.801 --> 01:33:34.990
little small organizations where everything started. Yeah.

1731
01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:38.790
When we used to do it in California, um, when um,

1732
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.810
the first started doing MMA shows in California,

1733
01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:47.040
they had to do 'em on native American reservations cause you couldn't have it

1734
01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:49.380
anywhere. It wasn't sanctioned in California.

1735
01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:53.100
So like when we would go to see king of the cage and Eddie Bravo used to work

1736
01:33:53.101 --> 01:33:56.040
for king of the cage and I would go with him out to these events.

1737
01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.120
We would have to go to the middle of nowhere. Man. These weird ass casinos.

1738
01:34:00.150 --> 01:34:03.900
That's the only place we could go to see the fights. Yeah.

1739
01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:07.220
<v 2>I formed my reservation couple of times in New York cause we couldn't find it in</v>

1740
01:34:07.221 --> 01:34:07.910
New York. Yeah.

1741
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:12.620
I still came in fight in New York because I got some like medical thing. They,

1742
01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:14.150
they're not sure if I was born with it or not,

1743
01:34:14.151 --> 01:34:18.110
but I didn't even know about it until I got my, my had my UFC debut in Vegas,

1744
01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:22.250
UFC one 70 and um, yeah, I had to get a cat scan,

1745
01:34:22.251 --> 01:34:24.410
got the cat scan and I had like two spots on my brain,

1746
01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:28.100
so they just kept monitoring it and I had to go see a neurologist and all that

1747
01:34:28.101 --> 01:34:31.130
and they just want to make sure it wasn't going like bleeding out and I wasn't

1748
01:34:31.131 --> 01:34:34.600
gonna like just die in the octagon randomly. And um, you know,

1749
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:35.870
so they were looking out for me,

1750
01:34:35.871 --> 01:34:39.140
but I've been able to fight everywhere except for New York and I'm just hoping

1751
01:34:39.141 --> 01:34:43.040
that these guys do the right thing so I can at least fight one time before my

1752
01:34:43.041 --> 01:34:46.580
careers or southern all sudden and done in my home state.

1753
01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:51.440
I think that would be something that I've dreamed up for like a very long time.

1754
01:34:51.441 --> 01:34:51.591
You know,

1755
01:34:51.591 --> 01:34:55.010
I never knew this would have happened until my debut and kind of just do a

1756
01:34:55.011 --> 01:34:58.100
wrench into everything. Do the, the neurologist, it's okay.

1757
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.920
<v 0>Yeah. Um, clarify. It's just the wording in the,</v>

1758
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:05.060
in the New York bodies sanctioning rule, whatever. And I'm like,

1759
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:07.240
so what do you guys have to do to change it? I'll just,

1760
01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.450
I think they say just a doctor has to go like rewrite it or some shit like that.

1761
01:35:11.451 --> 01:35:14.210
I'm like, but why does this taking so long? It's been years now. I've been like,

1762
01:35:14.211 --> 01:35:16.400
just every time I see Kim, Hey Kim,

1763
01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:19.610
hey is the doctor gonna go like change the rule or something so I can fight in

1764
01:35:19.611 --> 01:35:22.760
New York and uh, nothing, you know, I don't know. They're not,

1765
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:27.170
I guess the not moving the needle from me. So that sucks. I guess New York,

1766
01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.780
they're probably don't want to take any chances because it's so recent that they

1767
01:35:29.781 --> 01:35:33.530
even got it approved, right? Yeah. Something that's like years, right.

1768
01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.700
How many years? Three now.

1769
01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:40.130
2016 2016 I was there for the bill when they signed it. Yeah,

1770
01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.060
that was a fun time. Those fucking Madison Square Garden Cards are bananas.

1771
01:35:44.061 --> 01:35:47.780
Yeah. They always put bananas cards on MSG. Yeah,

1772
01:35:47.781 --> 01:35:50.700
I was there live for the condom. McGregor, Eddie Alvarez. Oh,

1773
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.510
just the Wayne's were electrifying. I was like, Yo man,

1774
01:35:54.511 --> 01:35:57.770
chills sells me out that building. Yeah. Me,

1775
01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.590
you think about all the amazing boxing fights that happened in that building.

1776
01:36:01.591 --> 01:36:05.000
I mean that is the most famous arena and all of combat sports.

1777
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:07.160
Madison fucking square garden.

1778
01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:10.310
I remember the first time I walked in there for the UFC, I got chills.

1779
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:14.660
I was like, I can't believe we're here right here. I get chills.

1780
01:36:14.850 --> 01:36:16.730
I'm getting goosebumps right now. Just thinking about it.

1781
01:36:16.731 --> 01:36:19.440
Like you walk in that place, it has a special feeling man. Yeah.

1782
01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:24.730
And I just hope to God I could get to feel that one day at least one day.

1783
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:28.080
Come on New York. I hope I'm on.

1784
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:32.570
So right now you're dealing with a, a bit of a thumb injury, right? You have a,

1785
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:35.150
this cast that you have on your arm right now is, um,

1786
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:38.420
this is to isolate your ligament. Yeah. So in the fight,

1787
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:41.270
I don't know at what point where one of the punches I threw,

1788
01:36:41.271 --> 01:36:43.430
I guess I landed with the thumb cause the UFC gloves,

1789
01:36:43.431 --> 01:36:45.770
they don't protect the thumb. There's no padding on the thumb.

1790
01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:48.870
I don't know if I like it or don't like it, but whatever.

1791
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:51.050
It had been fighting like that with these guys for so long. Now at this point,

1792
01:36:51.051 --> 01:36:53.090
I don't really even notice it. Just the first time I really,

1793
01:36:53.091 --> 01:36:55.700
really banged up my hand, but it's like the, uh,

1794
01:36:55.701 --> 01:36:59.510
the ligament on the radio and the owner side that hold the thumb to keep it from

1795
01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:01.970
like turning out like my thumb on this side. They,

1796
01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:05.570
they compared it and he saw how lax, it wasn't this side. He was like, dude,

1797
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:08.870
is it, does this hurt? I was like, Nah, that's just normal. That's my thumb.

1798
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:12.530
So they think my thumb being able to do that on the other side.

1799
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:17.000
Maybe it's just my anatomy. Do it again. But um, yeah, it's like,

1800
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:20.480
it's kind of freaky. Yeah. Button locks. Oh my God. Yeah.

1801
01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:23.220
But does it hurt it like 15 degrees more movement,

1802
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:27.380
but I'm double jointed in my tums, so I don't know if that's what it is.

1803
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:30.230
That looks like it hurts. I got a tap right here.

1804
01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.950
Did you see Craig Jones and Anthony Rumble Johnson? Had a grappling match I saw,

1805
01:37:35.050 --> 01:37:37.000
but I didn't get to, I didn't get to catch a match. Try Google,

1806
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:40.610
go to Craig Jones Instagram. He wrapped him up quick rumble,

1807
01:37:40.611 --> 01:37:43.700
took him down and Craig Jones got ahold of that leg and was, it's gorgeous.

1808
01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:47.080
It's a beautiful transition. If you're a fan of leg locks, it's just scary.

1809
01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:52.070
And Jones who was a rumble, Johnson's obviously a gigantic man.

1810
01:37:52.071 --> 01:37:56.010
He's in like, he's like two 60 now and Craig Jones is probably about two 10,

1811
01:37:56.370 --> 01:38:00.290
<v 1>but when they rolled, but there's a video of it on a Craig's um,</v>

1812
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:04.680
Instagram if you find it. Yeah, it's right. Um, that,

1813
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.550
that's probably it. Try it right there versus Goliath. Yeah.

1814
01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:13.090
Kai Jones versus your life. Is this it? Let me see it.

1815
01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:15.390
It's a repost he put out. Here's the damn for you. Okay.

1816
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:19.380
Make it like a little larger presented by [inaudible] sun in submission

1817
01:38:19.381 --> 01:38:22.250
underground. This seems like just to advertise on

1818
01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:28.350
Ortho Oreo. You're right now. Is it just to advertise? I sent it to him.

1819
01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:32.970
I sent him a congratulations in a, a set date. Well, maybe, maybe,

1820
01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:36.210
maybe it's not on his, maybe it's something, let me find that real quick.

1821
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.010
Cause we could, we could do that. Imagine about the fight.

1822
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.190
So when that big and the big guys like I'm gonna fuck you up.

1823
01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:43.650
And then all the guys just like, I'm going to break your fucking ankles.

1824
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:46.440
It's like damn, that's a, yeah.

1825
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:51.300
And then he goes out there and he actually does it, you know? No, it says here,

1826
01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:56.270
I'll send it to you Jamie. Hold on a second. Yeah, hang on a second. Two,

1827
01:38:56.450 --> 01:39:01.260
two, two. Correct. All right, Joe,

1828
01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:02.203
I sent it to you.

1829
01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.553
<v 5>Um,</v>

1830
01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:10.120
<v 1>do you get on the Instagram? It's actually from Craig Jones BJJ.</v>

1831
01:39:10.121 --> 01:39:14.890
From his Instagram. Yeah. I don't know. Well it wasn't showing.

1832
01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:19.090
Yeah, it wasn't showing me. Here it is.

1833
01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:25.360
So watch this. So rumbles on top and Craig elevates with that, right.

1834
01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:30.320
Passing passes on. Boom. Locks the hole gets the heel hook. Tap. But he,

1835
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:34.000
he even fight the hands. Did not bite the hands.

1836
01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:37.570
He didn't even rap the whole of the heel. Yeah. They were still in transition.

1837
01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:41.170
He had the legs like laced up. He had inside control. You see this watch,

1838
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:45.760
he gets it, flips, rolls it. He's got the leg and rumbles like, I get it.

1839
01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:50.290
Fuck that. Fuck that. I'm walking out of here. Exactly. He's like, alright,

1840
01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.350
well now I know I walked in here and I'm walking out.

1841
01:39:53.410 --> 01:39:58.410
That's the more amazing thing about leg locks is smaller people can get away

1842
01:39:58.991 --> 01:40:03.130
with things from the bottom that it's very difficult to get away with because

1843
01:40:03.131 --> 01:40:06.130
you're using both of your legs to control a person's leg.

1844
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:11.020
It's like you have so much strength in the leg locks and so much control with

1845
01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:12.730
those two legs around one leg.

1846
01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.600
I mean you are obviously one from the [inaudible] team,

1847
01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:20.740
which is that that is the where it all started with John Don her with Dean

1848
01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:22.100
listers, so the dawn,

1849
01:40:22.101 --> 01:40:26.290
her and dawn her refined that system and Eddie Cummings and and all these

1850
01:40:26.291 --> 01:40:27.970
fucking animals that are coming out of there now.

1851
01:40:27.971 --> 01:40:31.360
There's so many leg lock specialists out of that part of the gym or that part of

1852
01:40:31.361 --> 01:40:33.740
the world like that one gym. That Hens, Oh,

1853
01:40:33.741 --> 01:40:37.740
Gracie gym is responsible for a gigantic evolution in,

1854
01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:40.720
in leg locking. Yeah. Those guys are phenomenal to work with.

1855
01:40:40.721 --> 01:40:42.850
Whenever I could get down here to get some training and it's always fun.

1856
01:40:42.851 --> 01:40:47.540
It's always a battle that Nicky Ryan kids, super young, still grind. Gary, Tony,

1857
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:52.600
Gary, tone in leg lock machines. Yeah. Damien, Jason Raod, nick, Nick,

1858
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:54.040
nick, those guys

1859
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.540
<v 2>or those guys are animals. Saturday's scary ripping knees apart,</v>

1860
01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.790
but you know, they say, why would you ignore 50% of the human body?

1861
01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:08.470
Like why would you want 50% of the human body?

1862
01:41:09.090 --> 01:41:12.320
He's such a weird guy to talk to. He's tardy. He's Xavier.

1863
01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:16.040
Donna is too smart. He is.

1864
01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:20.320
He makes me feel like a shit like [inaudible] nothing done.

1865
01:41:20.321 --> 01:41:21.830
What do you do from here? I'm like, what dude?

1866
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:26.380
Don't tell me you're making me nervous, man. Say nothing wrong.

1867
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:31.900
He was making fun of the whole, you have a 10th planet black belt. Come on man.

1868
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:37.180
Just tell me what to do. Don't mock me. I'm here though. Oh,

1869
01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:41.020
I want to know. I want to learn. John. This is a judge free zone. Damn it.

1870
01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:42.160
But he's so smart

1871
01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:47.120
<v 3>in his analysis of positions instead of just rolling and getting better and</v>

1872
01:41:47.121 --> 01:41:48.380
drilling and comparing,

1873
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:52.820
he's done just like a systematic analysis of various positions.

1874
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:56.000
What you need to do, what you need to master, where are you going from here?

1875
01:41:56.150 --> 01:41:58.250
And I, I, from what I understand from everybody,

1876
01:41:58.790 --> 01:42:01.340
Eddie Commons is a big part of that as well. Let him out. Yeah.

1877
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:04.760
Eddie coming some master. He's a master, just so good at leg logs.

1878
01:42:04.761 --> 01:42:08.240
So I've watched that guy compete multiple, multiple times online.

1879
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:11.780
It's just like, well his transitions are so smooth. It's like it's a,

1880
01:42:11.781 --> 01:42:14.900
it's amazing. Yeah. I think I saw him competed the uh,

1881
01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.930
Eddie Bravo's invitational to it. Ebi.

1882
01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:22.280
Pretty sure I was there for him like that. Um, that rule set is a,

1883
01:42:22.281 --> 01:42:25.460
an interesting rule set and I think that's the best rule set for. Like,

1884
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:29.510
if you get a stalemate at the end of, you know, initial time period,

1885
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:32.090
then from there you have a chance to, uh,

1886
01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.810
you go at it for a certain amount of times til someone gets tapped and you start

1887
01:42:35.811 --> 01:42:37.010
out in different positions.

1888
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:41.120
You started either for with back control or what you call spiderweb or you like

1889
01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:42.710
have your own side control,

1890
01:42:42.711 --> 01:42:46.520
your legs are crossed the face and you have the arm trapped inside but you don't

1891
01:42:46.521 --> 01:42:49.070
have an arm bar fully extended and you're like ready go.

1892
01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:50.241
Can you start from there?

1893
01:42:50.241 --> 01:42:54.290
And then they calculate how long it takes to escape versus whether or not

1894
01:42:54.291 --> 01:42:56.330
somebody tapped. So if you tap somebody,

1895
01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.990
they have a chance to tap you and they have a chance to get back in that same

1896
01:42:59.991 --> 01:43:02.660
position. But if you tap them quicker than they tap you, then you win.

1897
01:43:02.770 --> 01:43:04.540
<v 2>Yeah, it's great. It's great.</v>

1898
01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.280
The only position of that I just really didn't like that much was uh,

1899
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:10.480
the back control position.

1900
01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:14.080
Cause you see a lot of the times the guys will escape and let the guy ended up

1901
01:43:14.081 --> 01:43:16.930
in Mt. And then that would be considered an escape. But it's like,

1902
01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:20.500
but was there really an escape? If you're in a fist fight,

1903
01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:25.120
do you really want to be there? That position melted. You didn't escape Shit.

1904
01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:27.880
[inaudible] get fucked up. It's cool. It's a good point. Like right.

1905
01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:29.910
You should have to escape. Escape. Yeah.

1906
01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:32.620
Or You should have to get out of mountain. But did you, that's what I'm saying.

1907
01:43:32.621 --> 01:43:34.630
It's like when you think about it and the concept, like are you,

1908
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:36.280
are we training guys to set them out?

1909
01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.340
<v 3>Right. Is that what happens?</v>

1910
01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:43.400
So I'm not 100% sure on this Geo Martinez Geo,

1911
01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.050
who's a beast. He's one of Eddie's black belts,

1912
01:43:46.051 --> 01:43:48.360
actually caught Cummings in an armbar.

1913
01:43:48.630 --> 01:43:51.220
He's one of the few guys that have ever seen tap Eddie. Yeah.

1914
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:54.440
And this was from spiderweb. But you notice when he goes to spiderweb,

1915
01:43:54.441 --> 01:43:58.520
he controls that right leg. Yep. That's a very, I noticed that. It's very,

1916
01:43:58.521 --> 01:44:03.290
very important that a bridging. Yeah. What's also you, you just,

1917
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:05.870
you could keep control of one part of the body.

1918
01:44:05.871 --> 01:44:07.820
So there's no movement side to side, right? Yes.

1919
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:11.210
He's not moving around towards the head. He stuck in that spot.

1920
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:14.000
So whether or not he extends or doesn't extend, you know,

1921
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:16.760
whether any catches the arm there, I mean, you could still defend.

1922
01:44:16.761 --> 01:44:19.460
It's possible, but it cuts out a lot of the pathways.

1923
01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:23.990
He creates a lot of control. There's no rocking. Yeah, exactly.

1924
01:44:24.170 --> 01:44:27.470
Like even here, even here, he still got that leg, he's still got that leg.

1925
01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.940
And you're always in a bad spot with a guy like Chico who's a,

1926
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:34.310
he's an arm bought while he's at just a Jujitsu master.

1927
01:44:34.311 --> 01:44:38.570
But what wait is this bomb ass 45, I think it's 45, I believe.

1928
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.460
And Geo, like his brother Richie [inaudible],

1929
01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:44.150
they started out as a break dancers.

1930
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:48.530
So these guys are strong as fuck. They're crazy physical dexterity.

1931
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:51.050
They could do all kinds of nutty shit with their bodies.

1932
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:55.500
Now he's got the near side leg. I'm just going back to the far. Yeah. And uh,

1933
01:44:55.670 --> 01:44:58.520
this is a bad fight to showcase Eddie Cummings cause you want him getting

1934
01:44:58.521 --> 01:45:02.090
caught. But he got caught here because they started off from spiderweb.

1935
01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.500
You know, he's not starting out from a, from a neutral position.

1936
01:45:06.501 --> 01:45:08.360
They're starting out from a disadvantage.

1937
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:10.310
And this is one of the rare times he's,

1938
01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:14.240
so he's got the arm and that spiderweb and now he's got like a figure for what

1939
01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:16.660
he had to think for us, like a little loose now. But he was, yeah,

1940
01:45:16.661 --> 01:45:18.690
it's really loose. It's called the arm crush. Yeah,

1941
01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:21.770
he was going for like a biceps. Okay.

1942
01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.090
And then it really is almost snaps your forearm. No socks. Tremendous.

1943
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:29.750
Tremendous pressure on the forum. It's awful. Especially wouldn't go big guys.

1944
01:45:29.751 --> 01:45:33.110
Yeah, but it could be a bicep slicer as well that uh,

1945
01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:36.950
those positions are terabytes up. Just a crushing of the limb like that.

1946
01:45:36.951 --> 01:45:40.130
It's a terrible feeling, but he eventually catches him here. Dude,

1947
01:45:40.131 --> 01:45:42.740
your arm is so shot after getting out of that.

1948
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:46.280
I know you don't want so compressed, you know,

1949
01:45:46.281 --> 01:45:47.930
it's a horrible feeling too.

1950
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:52.010
It's like forearms and you're legging in the leg.

1951
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:56.630
The back of the calf is crushing it and the other leg is squeezing down like a

1952
01:45:56.631 --> 01:46:01.490
triangle. It's, oh, it's awful. Jujitsu's amazing man. It really was amazing.

1953
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:06.310
Amazing martial art. I would probably forever do it to him.

1954
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:10.130
Like my late forties, 50s songs. I'm like still able body and all that.

1955
01:46:10.131 --> 01:46:11.720
You know, if you find good training partners,

1956
01:46:11.721 --> 01:46:15.320
you can do it as long as the thing about the human body is like,

1957
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:18.380
you only got so many explosions in you. You know,

1958
01:46:18.381 --> 01:46:22.070
so many times you could push a guy off you so many times you could die forward

1959
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.890
so many times you could just thrust up from the bottom.

1960
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:28.730
But if you do things with the right technique, like John Jackman Shadow,

1961
01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:33.560
I think he's at least 50 John jocks still rolls and you don't have any injuries.

1962
01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:34.640
You still roll. But he's,

1963
01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:38.530
you'd never see John Jock just like he never goons at anything.

1964
01:46:40.230 --> 01:46:44.030
A guy can goon at us. I've gooned out of things before.

1965
01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:48.020
If somebody catches you to stop me just fucking raw, I just explode. And,

1966
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:49.830
and you catch them when they're

1967
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:54.000
<v 0>maybe resting a little bit and you'd goon out of it never goes out.</v>

1968
01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:59.100
Smooth and technique. It's all defense. It's perfect. Yeah. Yeah.

1969
01:46:59.230 --> 01:47:02.310
And it's just flow. It's not like, oh yeah.

1970
01:47:02.610 --> 01:47:06.360
Well that was what's interesting about watching Michael Kia San Diego Sanchez.

1971
01:47:06.361 --> 01:47:10.860
Like he flowed, it just flowed. There was no, like,

1972
01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:14.460
he didn't have to do anything crazy. He was in control.

1973
01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:18.510
Like from the moment he clenched him, got ahold of 'em. He's just moving,

1974
01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:23.180
constantly changing, you know, changing control, submission attempts,

1975
01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:27.770
control submission attempts. It was just beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. I,

1976
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:31.290
I got to rewash that fight. I was at a wedding when I was watching those fights.

1977
01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:34.680
Ah. I was like partially when my dancing shoes,

1978
01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:36.000
cause I didn't want to be like disrespectful.

1979
01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:38.910
So we got the fights up and we're like hovering over the table. Oh,

1980
01:47:38.911 --> 01:47:40.860
speaking of which shit, I told Eve Edwards,

1981
01:47:40.861 --> 01:47:44.640
we would watch that shit while it's on in the background. Oh, turn the TV on it.

1982
01:47:44.641 --> 01:47:49.050
Put It on ESPN too though. If it's on ESPN two or is it on 'em?

1983
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.800
Eventually it goes to ESPN plus. Let's see if it's on ESPN two right now.

1984
01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:01.460
He'd say, okay. Word to your mother and other motherfuckers.

1985
01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.910
Doug Jitsu. I told them we should watch it. I love that dude.

1986
01:48:07.170 --> 01:48:11.850
I'm glad he's making his way into transitioning into a commentary too.

1987
01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:13.560
He's excellent. Really good.

1988
01:48:13.730 --> 01:48:17.400
Well you're so such a technical fighter that uh,

1989
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:21.550
he's a really good at transitioning into, uh, what's happening with the tone,

1990
01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.370
by the way. Just, I forgot we didn't, I never finished my, um, bed stories.

1991
01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.990
Well, not even the bed like so let's go back real quick and just to finish it,

1992
01:48:30.991 --> 01:48:33.720
cause I, people are probably gonna ask me like what ever happened with your mom.

1993
01:48:33.721 --> 01:48:38.520
And so, so after, after the Cody stamen fight,

1994
01:48:38.521 --> 01:48:39.870
I needed to, I needed to win that fight.

1995
01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:43.140
Otherwise I would have been in a really bad spot because of all the renovations

1996
01:48:43.141 --> 01:48:45.990
I did t to my house cause my house smell like cigarettes. It was like,

1997
01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.010
it was really fucked up.

1998
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:51.300
But I got in a short sale in a really nice neighborhood and a mass pico I'm in,

1999
01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:54.030
I'm in the hood, the hood of Mass Pico now. It's not the hood,

2000
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.450
it's really people. That's really nice. It's really nice.

2001
01:48:57.550 --> 01:49:00.510
It is nice to have a lawn. Um, yeah.

2002
01:49:00.511 --> 01:49:04.290
So that's nice that you get the short sale like some other ones.

2003
01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:06.210
Folly and fuck up. Yeah.

2004
01:49:06.211 --> 01:49:10.140
I can sneak in and take a nice house in the same suspectful literally play.

2005
01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:13.440
Oh Bet they were there. They were kind of happy to get rid of it to be honest.

2006
01:49:13.441 --> 01:49:16.200
I think they were struggling with the payments or whatnot. So it was cool.

2007
01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:19.890
But I loved my neighborhood. I don't have real neighbors.

2008
01:49:19.891 --> 01:49:24.090
I have side yard so I'm not in anyone's way but to to make ends meet.

2009
01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:27.210
I airbnb my house so I sleep in a basement.

2010
01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:30.480
So that's why I had to pull out cuts cause I didn't want to make it all packed

2011
01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:30.781
up.

2012
01:49:30.781 --> 01:49:34.020
I mean like you know like the little cricket guys that'd be jumping around all

2013
01:49:34.021 --> 01:49:34.471
over the place.

2014
01:49:34.471 --> 01:49:37.770
I didn't want like a ton of shit for them to hide and start like making a little

2015
01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:39.540
cricket babies. So,

2016
01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:45.270
so I just got the pull out couch. It's like easy to clean and got a rug.

2017
01:49:45.271 --> 01:49:48.100
Whatever crickets in your house are so fucking annoying.

2018
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.900
<v 3>If you can't find them, they're the worse. They are the fucking word.</v>

2019
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:52.830
I will find you. I and I will,

2020
01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:56.620
but I don't kill crickets when you at the time,

2021
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.600
most of the time I grabbed when I throw him outside,

2022
01:49:58.601 --> 01:50:01.450
I don't know why I grabbed with your hand prejudice against certain bugs.

2023
01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:06.340
If I find a spider, it's dead. Dead. You're dead. But if I find a cricket,

2024
01:50:06.341 --> 01:50:09.390
I'm like, ah, little fella. Come on, let me get you. They don't bite her.

2025
01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.470
They bite your hands. No

2026
01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.840
cricket. Just trust me bro. I'm just trying to get you outside.

2027
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:19.450
I'm trying not to kill you. Yes. I get the little traps,

2028
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:23.440
the sticky traps and I feel so bad because they just wither away and I'm like,

2029
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:26.920
it's such a fucked up way to go. But I'm like, you came into my hood,

2030
01:50:26.921 --> 01:50:29.530
you came into my territory. This is my land. That's right. You know.

2031
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:34.180
So snakes in my yard dead. All of them. They have snakes. Yup. Rattlesnakes,

2032
01:50:34.630 --> 01:50:38.850
rattlesnakes, dead, dead. All of them. People say you shouldn't kill it.

2033
01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:43.840
Shut the fuck up. I have kids. Never had a yard yard here,

2034
01:50:43.841 --> 01:50:47.320
man. Yeah. Out here in California for sure. Rattlesnakes are everywhere.

2035
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:52.030
I went to look at a house and um, I stomped a rattlesnake to death in the,

2036
01:50:52.031 --> 01:50:56.620
in the front yard of the House of this House that we were looking at poisonous.

2037
01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:00.910
Yes. There was a fucking rattlesnake sitting there in the front yard. And uh,

2038
01:51:00.911 --> 01:51:04.060
I just, I just saw it. I said, okay, I'm just gonna let's just go.

2039
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:07.230
This is what I would do if I lived here. I'm gonna stomp this mother fucker.

2040
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:10.570
I knew I was in there not that fast. Okay.

2041
01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:12.460
That they're fast when they strike.

2042
01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:16.300
But if a rattlesnake is flattened out and he can't see you,

2043
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:19.510
he doesn't see you coming out. Stomped that motherfucker.

2044
01:51:21.090 --> 01:51:25.960
I just crushed his head. Dumped him. That's bad ass.

2045
01:51:25.961 --> 01:51:29.000
Cause I would not fuck with that thing. I'm like, oh I didn't, I wouldn't,

2046
01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:30.760
I wouldn't if it was like pulling back. I was like,

2047
01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:35.920
but I saw where it was and like these people live in this house that they were

2048
01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:38.440
selling and I was like, they don't want this fucking thing here.

2049
01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:42.520
No one wants a rattlesnake there. Fucking yard shit man. It's just fucking,

2050
01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:44.470
I would've been scared shitless man. I'm like,

2051
01:51:44.471 --> 01:51:46.000
I'm going to sound called the exterminator.

2052
01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:49.120
Well I developed a real anger for them when they bit my dogs.

2053
01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:52.430
I've had three times I've had to take my dogs to a,

2054
01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:56.110
the veterinarian with their face all swollen up like a water balloons grown out

2055
01:51:56.111 --> 01:51:56.944
of the cyber head.

2056
01:51:57.250 --> 01:52:01.270
Cause I got bit rattlesnakes are fucked up too because what their venom does is

2057
01:52:01.271 --> 01:52:04.330
it digest your tissue. It's one of the,

2058
01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:09.100
it's something about their venom is how it helps them like eat rabbits and

2059
01:52:09.101 --> 01:52:10.830
things that they kill. Cause the,

2060
01:52:10.831 --> 01:52:15.580
the venom not only does it kill you but it kinda breaks down your tissue. Yeah.

2061
01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:18.760
So when, when people get bitten by it, it's real bad man.

2062
01:52:18.761 --> 01:52:22.780
They have to get these horrible skin grafts and they get necrosis where all the

2063
01:52:22.781 --> 01:52:25.630
tissue around where the bite was all dies off.

2064
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:30.220
So like sometimes you could see the bone [inaudible] bone. Yeah.

2065
01:52:30.221 --> 01:52:31.001
Not for the weak heart.

2066
01:52:31.001 --> 01:52:36.001
That's why stop it still those motherfuckers out you guys to go fuck you sound

2067
01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:39.460
like me or you. Yeah. And I see,

2068
01:52:39.461 --> 01:52:42.550
I'm not big into like the Wilderness surprisingly cause my parents are from

2069
01:52:42.551 --> 01:52:46.010
Jamaica. So you know, we have like that Caribbean upbringing.

2070
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:50.420
<v 2>We weren't like raised in a traditional American home, like the lifestyle.</v>

2071
01:52:50.421 --> 01:52:53.300
So we have a different like rules and everything and uh,

2072
01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:56.510
we never really experienced like that type of stuff in like Jamaica and shit

2073
01:52:56.511 --> 01:52:57.050
like that.

2074
01:52:57.050 --> 01:52:57.883
<v 5>What's going on, Jamie?</v>

2075
01:52:58.310 --> 01:53:01.400
Oh one I can't figure out why the DIRECTV is not coming through the TV,

2076
01:53:01.401 --> 01:53:04.540
but two it doesn't even start for another 25 minutes, so, oh, okay.

2077
01:53:04.810 --> 01:53:06.050
Starts at five 30 all right,

2078
01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:08.540
well we'll check it out in five minutes or 25 minutes.

2079
01:53:08.850 --> 01:53:12.620
Is it start on ESPN plus in 25 I was just, I was looking for ESPN plus.

2080
01:53:12.621 --> 01:53:16.570
It's not on there. It says ESPN two at five 30 I don't know. Oh fuck.

2081
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:20.660
I'm sure must be the previews though or the prelims.

2082
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:24.530
Maybe there's prelims I would think, but it's not. Oh, here we go. Well,

2083
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:26.660
I liked it. The PFL is doing what they're doing. Well go,

2084
01:53:26.740 --> 01:53:30.320
but just go up to the machine and see if he could your remote control with him

2085
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:32.600
plus won't work on that TV. I'd have to get it through my laptop.

2086
01:53:32.710 --> 01:53:37.580
It will will be IEPs. ESPN plus at five 30 no, ESPN Tuesday at five 30 right.

2087
01:53:37.581 --> 01:53:40.100
This is that probably had to be done with him and we were trying to explain it

2088
01:53:40.101 --> 01:53:45.101
so it should be on ESPN plus right now I'm trying to get it on there and then

2089
01:53:45.141 --> 01:53:48.530
ESPN too. Right, which would be on the TV, but I can't even get,

2090
01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:51.140
I don't know why Directv is not working on it. We'll figure it out.

2091
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:53.150
We'll figure it out. Eve Edwards shout out.

2092
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:56.090
I like the fact that doing that though, the PFL is given away all that money.

2093
01:53:56.150 --> 01:54:00.260
I love it. I love it. Six or eight people each year.

2094
01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:05.340
<v 2>Was it six or I think it was 60 cents on the show. Put a $1 million.</v>

2095
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:07.650
If you win the season, that's amazing. More money.

2096
01:54:07.651 --> 01:54:10.080
I think there's more money that I've made in 13 UFC fighter

2097
01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:16.320
thinking about jumping ship. Uh, Nah, go. You know what it is.

2098
01:54:16.770 --> 01:54:20.700
I would need to, before I would ever do that, I would want to win the belt.

2099
01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:24.520
And I think that is a very obtainable and realistic thing for me to, to,

2100
01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:29.250
to be able to realize, um, that dream before I would ever jump ship.

2101
01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:31.770
Because it's almost like what mighty mouse did. He was like,

2102
01:54:31.771 --> 01:54:34.710
okay with leaving because he was a UFC champs, super dominant.

2103
01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:37.380
He didn't really lose that, say unify in my eyes.

2104
01:54:37.381 --> 01:54:39.600
I don't think he lost that fight. I think at worse,

2105
01:54:39.930 --> 01:54:43.590
at best it was a draw on all. I don't think there was any real clear cut loser,

2106
01:54:43.591 --> 01:54:47.500
but I didn't think so. Udall one, I didn't think mighty mouse loss, but uh,

2107
01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:50.520
for him to go to another organization and if he does win the belt,

2108
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:54.780
it's like arguably like you really can't deny the guys one of the goats if not

2109
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:56.730
the ego, you know? So that's the way I kind of look at it.

2110
01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.320
And I'd probably be retired anyway cause 32 is close to this class now.

2111
01:55:02.610 --> 01:55:05.670
<v 3>You can't deny him anyway. I mean, no matter what happens from here on out,</v>

2112
01:55:06.370 --> 01:55:10.260
Martin Mouse in my opinion technically is the best ever. The best ever.

2113
01:55:10.261 --> 01:55:10.711
Technically.

2114
01:55:10.711 --> 01:55:14.510
The thing about him versus John Jones in my eyes that John has faced different

2115
01:55:14.511 --> 01:55:18.150
competition. Yeah. I think John just fought more dangerous guys.

2116
01:55:18.151 --> 01:55:21.360
And also John is completely undefeated.

2117
01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.250
The only has that one loss to Matt Hamill,

2118
01:55:23.251 --> 01:55:26.760
which is a disqualification in a fight where he was totally dominant in what,

2119
01:55:26.761 --> 01:55:28.350
I think it was a bad call anyway.

2120
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:30.540
<v 2>Yeah. I thought Matt was fucking them up, man.</v>

2121
01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.040
You can keep that shit up. I was like,

2122
01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:40.480
it was my memory completely shot. Fuck no,

2123
01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:44.010
but did I look at it like this? See now that mouse is removed

2124
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.780
<v 0>and there's new life at the flyweight division.</v>

2125
01:55:45.781 --> 01:55:49.170
Everything is super competitive now. Right? So it goes to show,

2126
01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.820
maybe it speaks volume on just how good my emails just really is compared to

2127
01:55:53.821 --> 01:55:56.520
everybody else. Maybe that's why the division just looked like that.

2128
01:55:56.521 --> 01:55:57.930
And people are like, oh, you're just a little guys.

2129
01:55:57.931 --> 01:56:00.150
Not like fighting the big guys. I get that.

2130
01:56:00.151 --> 01:56:02.550
But it's like the same thing with Jon Jones,

2131
01:56:02.551 --> 01:56:04.260
but now there's like closer competition.

2132
01:56:04.261 --> 01:56:07.620
Now you see John Jones going into decisions a lot more as opposed to finishing

2133
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:11.940
the older veterans. Who were the pioneers? Who were the, uh, the Shogun?

2134
01:56:11.941 --> 01:56:15.300
Who is the rampage? Jackson's the,

2135
01:56:15.690 --> 01:56:19.050
who else has he murdered that? Um, Maddy, you're saying?

2136
01:56:19.051 --> 01:56:22.740
I mean he wasn't a champ, but um, Vito Belfort, like those guys,

2137
01:56:22.741 --> 01:56:25.170
even though veto almost snapped that arm in half, that was crazy.

2138
01:56:25.230 --> 01:56:26.940
Fucking insane. I jumped out of my fucking, I

2139
01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.560
showed you what an animal John Is. He didn't tap,

2140
01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:36.300
just let his arm get fucking jacked and then wound up tap and v tore the next

2141
01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:40.080
round. Yeah. John is, he's not just talented.

2142
01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:45.030
His mind is just unstoppable. He's just got incredible.

2143
01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:48.960
His ability to overcome adversities,

2144
01:56:48.961 --> 01:56:51.720
ability to get out of bad situations. The ability to press on.

2145
01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:54.840
We saw that in the Gustafson find me. He wasn't in shape for that fight at all.

2146
01:56:55.230 --> 01:56:59.790
He, they said he was barely training. Well ice. I've partied with John,

2147
01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:02.700
not like the hardcore party that he does that he has done.

2148
01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:04.530
Let me say he has done, I'm not sure if party,

2149
01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.360
I'm not sure if he's still parties like that,

2150
01:57:06.361 --> 01:57:10.890
but when he was partying I would see him at the bar in Ithaca or he'll come out

2151
01:57:10.891 --> 01:57:13.110
to Courtland college cause Ethica was right down the road.

2152
01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:16.290
This was like when he was kinda going back and forth between Jackson's and our

2153
01:57:16.291 --> 01:57:17.400
gym. Um,

2154
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:20.460
when I was upstate at bomb squad right before he like officially left and then

2155
01:57:20.461 --> 01:57:22.690
he was just coming home and going back to Jackson and coming home,

2156
01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:26.670
going back to Jackson's and it'd be like a couple of weeks before he's fighting,

2157
01:57:26.671 --> 01:57:31.110
this guy would be out there shots and he'll be like asking me if I want a drink.

2158
01:57:31.111 --> 01:57:34.830
I'm like, Yo Dude, I'm fighting like full like four weeks. I can't,

2159
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:38.490
I can't do that. I have to, I have a hard time cutting weight for him.

2160
01:57:38.491 --> 01:57:39.750
I was like, dude, you don't like, you don't,

2161
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:41.910
it's not hard for you to cut if you get fucked up like this.

2162
01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:45.360
I didn't mean I didn't ask him that, but I was like, I told him like, no,

2163
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:47.470
I've got a fight coming up. I'm like, but I know you got to fight criminal.

2164
01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:49.650
But clearly it does not fucking matter cause you're John Jones,

2165
01:57:49.651 --> 01:57:51.450
you just going out there tooling people. Anyway,

2166
01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:53.400
I'll find it was what he said to Daniel Cormier,

2167
01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:56.940
I've beat you when I was on cocaine.

2168
01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:02.610
Cocaine is a hell of a drug. So it's a crazy thing to say to someone,

2169
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:07.110
I beat you. And I did cocaine. Yeah, that says laughing.

2170
01:58:07.890 --> 01:58:11.310
That says a lot though, man does DC's a fucking animal, you know?

2171
01:58:11.311 --> 01:58:15.990
So it was like, this is just John Jones DC and then everybody else, you know,

2172
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:18.330
he's that good man. But I'll tell you what man,

2173
01:58:18.331 --> 01:58:22.860
that Tiago Santos is a mother fucker. He kicked the shit out of John's legs,

2174
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:25.380
put 'em in real danger. And you know,

2175
01:58:25.381 --> 01:58:28.320
I think John would've made a way easier fight if he decided to take him to the

2176
01:58:28.321 --> 01:58:29.810
ground, but he never did. Yeah,

2177
01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:32.670
she and I talked about that fight on my podcast this morning.

2178
01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:36.150
I do it on Wednesday. Everybody, what your podcast is where they get it. Oh,

2179
01:58:36.151 --> 01:58:38.520
the weekly scraps. You can get it on iTunes. Spotify,

2180
01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:41.590
Google play tune in and my website, me store on that cup.

2181
01:58:43.130 --> 01:58:46.750
I'll a bag young you. So what'd you say? But I was,

2182
01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:48.550
see the way I broke that fight down,

2183
01:58:48.610 --> 01:58:51.730
I was like John was always the guy that the aggressive pushing forward,

2184
01:58:51.731 --> 01:58:53.760
walking him down, cutting him against, cutting them,

2185
01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:56.680
cutting him off and pushing him back towards the cage.

2186
01:58:57.010 --> 01:58:59.830
And then Tiago looked like he was just kind of waiting and waiting to pounce.

2187
01:58:59.831 --> 01:59:04.000
Like he was looking for John to take a half step where he could time it while he

2188
01:59:04.001 --> 01:59:06.040
was off balance and try to rush him in blitz.

2189
01:59:06.150 --> 01:59:08.830
And with those big bungalows he was doing as a rampage,

2190
01:59:09.130 --> 01:59:13.780
Jackson calls him so I didn't feel like he connected or anything significant

2191
01:59:13.781 --> 01:59:16.270
besides the leg kick early in the first round where it kicked his leg.

2192
01:59:16.290 --> 01:59:16.720
I was like, all right,

2193
01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:19.240
this fight is going to be interesting cause he's attacking the legs early.

2194
01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:21.190
But then he started attacking the legs more.

2195
01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:23.440
But I felt like some of it wasn't really like,

2196
01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:28.980
it didn't seem like it was really affecting John the way people like watching it

2197
01:59:29.851 --> 01:59:30.684
live.

2198
01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:34.060
I thought it was landing a lot more and then when I rewatched it I was like,

2199
01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:34.601
I don't know.

2200
01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:38.110
I have to really like I'm looking at it and I put it in Slowmo and I'm watching

2201
01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:40.470
the fight. I'm like, well at that punched it in, connect that punched it,

2202
01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:41.330
connect to,

2203
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:44.380
and then he did the one head kick that John got his hand up at the very last

2204
01:59:44.381 --> 01:59:45.610
second and was able to block it.

2205
01:59:45.611 --> 01:59:48.850
The one Dana White posted like a pitch on Instagram. Um,

2206
01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:51.610
was saying how tough he was fighting on the torn ACL,

2207
01:59:51.611 --> 01:59:56.080
the PCO and [inaudible] and MCL and meniscus. His fucking knees gone.

2208
01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.170
What was that, the first or second round? Was that six round? First round.

2209
01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:00.430
[inaudible] round. It might've been a second,

2210
02:00:00.431 --> 02:00:04.900
but did kick and we noticed his knee buckle. Yeah. Okay. And um,

2211
02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:08.620
I was the first round was the first one, so I was fractured shit. Yeah,

2212
02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:11.980
for Shit. Alright. Fuck. Oh, well that was one thing too.

2213
02:00:12.130 --> 02:00:16.380
When he buckled and he threw up, he was still thrown that mother fucker crazy.

2214
02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:20.520
Like Tibia Tibia. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I, that's hardcore. Yeah.

2215
02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:25.150
That's the big one. That's the big shinbone not the smaller one. The Fibula.

2216
02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:27.980
Oh yeah, they'll the CC's of blood. I sold them drainage shit.

2217
02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.880
They're pulling out a quarter of milk out of his fucking me who look at it and

2218
02:00:33.881 --> 02:00:36.940
they've already got a bunch in that little bucket. Yeah. Dr. Sanders did that,

2219
02:00:36.941 --> 02:00:40.360
right? Holy Shit Man. From the UFC. Yeah.

2220
02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:41.890
I think it was him who did that operation.

2221
02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:45.173
<v 8>Ah, ouch.</v>

2222
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:48.070
<v 0>Oh my God. Yeah. That knee is mangled.</v>

2223
02:00:48.071 --> 02:00:51.010
So he had to immediately go into surgery after that. Yeah.

2224
02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:55.990
His knee was mangled and pastored, but I, tough guy. Yeah.

2225
02:00:56.230 --> 02:01:00.670
I just felt like John was still controlling, dictating like the control,

2226
02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:04.700
like the walls. Like it looked like there was moments where it's like, oh, ah,

2227
02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:06.100
but he didn't really hit them well.

2228
02:01:06.101 --> 02:01:07.750
He definitely kicked the shit out of his legs.

2229
02:01:07.751 --> 02:01:12.010
John had to be carried out in a wheelchair and landed some shots to the head

2230
02:01:12.011 --> 02:01:15.220
with punches. But John moved with them. Yeah, like rolling a little.

2231
02:01:15.221 --> 02:01:19.420
He rolled with them. He kept his hands up. He got caught, but he moved back.

2232
02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:20.351
He's still good at that back.

2233
02:01:20.351 --> 02:01:23.830
He's amazing at it and he's the best ever at controlling distance. He does.

2234
02:01:23.831 --> 02:01:28.831
The finger at the finger range pokies the pokey rate but a hit your left foot.

2235
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:35.910
But he's so good at that. It's really about [inaudible].

2236
02:01:36.490 --> 02:01:39.950
I'm like, dude, no one's going to get past those long fucking

2237
02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.650
<v 3>go go gadget inspector arms. You know what I mean?</v>

2238
02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:47.210
But it's dangerous when the eyes get in them cause they have ha and it happened

2239
02:01:47.211 --> 02:01:49.790
to a bunch. Why don't you guys, he's he's, he's claimed,

2240
02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:52.310
you know how they have run a Razzie collecting arms on the shelf?

2241
02:01:52.311 --> 02:01:54.900
Like they did those pitches. John's got like eyeballs from every single,

2242
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:56.663
oh this thing is

2243
02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:02.480
the whole light heavyweight division is in a strange state right now because

2244
02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:05.840
it's like you got John Jones and then who else?

2245
02:02:06.210 --> 02:02:10.790
You know you got Johnny Walker who wa who looked fantastic when he knocked out

2246
02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:14.030
meat shirts or cone off. But then he fell down and fucking Silva,

2247
02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.970
his shoulders still fucked up man. This,

2248
02:02:16.210 --> 02:02:20.870
they've showed him doing rehab like real recently on his Instagram page and I'm

2249
02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:24.950
like, whoa. This was like six months later, if that's all he can lift.

2250
02:02:25.330 --> 02:02:28.730
Like that's like stabilizer muscles and the stuff that's around the shoulder.

2251
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:32.170
That shoulder might be, fuck you did just show that I did my shoulder, my labor,

2252
02:02:32.690 --> 02:02:32.931
yeah.

2253
02:02:32.931 --> 02:02:36.740
I've had all a bunch of a stem cell shot into my shoulder that healed it up,

2254
02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.640
but I had some pretty significant shoulder injuries. You did,

2255
02:02:40.670 --> 02:02:43.460
you did the Labor on surgery. Rotator cuff, no surgery.

2256
02:02:43.461 --> 02:02:48.461
I put out a full length rotator cuff tear and they used exosomes and it was

2257
02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:53.660
gone. The next MRI I had, the tear was gone. Just it goes,

2258
02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:55.370
it just seals up.

2259
02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:59.180
They did exosomes with platelet rich plasma and they mix it together and shoot

2260
02:02:59.181 --> 02:03:03.980
it into the injury and I went through the Rehab and then I got another Mr MRI

2261
02:03:03.981 --> 02:03:06.800
like six months later, eight months later, whatever it was.

2262
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:09.770
When it started feeling good, they said, well, let's take a look at it,

2263
02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:10.970
and they were like, Holy Shit.

2264
02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:14.960
Like Dr Roddy McGee from Vegas who does a lot of the UFC stuff. He goes,

2265
02:03:14.961 --> 02:03:17.660
do you know how crazy that is? He's like, your tear is gone.

2266
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:21.260
Doesn't exist anymore. That's, I got to see that.

2267
02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:23.330
It's like fucking next level shit.

2268
02:03:23.331 --> 02:03:26.240
Why don't they offer that to us when we have fucked up injuries?

2269
02:03:26.241 --> 02:03:29.570
I'm like my neck, my back, like I'm going to help you. Well,

2270
02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:32.570
I mean if they really think that you need it and they,

2271
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:34.880
I don't know if they know that you have this injury,

2272
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:37.100
like maybe you have to ask for it. I bet.

2273
02:03:37.101 --> 02:03:39.500
I feel like if you were one of your top guys,

2274
02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:43.790
you would want us to be back healthy, best as we can possibly be.

2275
02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:46.980
Prohibitively expensive for the UFC either if you, uh,

2276
02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:50.170
talked to Dr. Davidson or uh, talk to Don.

2277
02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:52.360
I mean I'll connect you with Dr. McGee and no,

2278
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:56.130
they were my good shows with McGee. Yeah, he's got the good shit. Please.

2279
02:03:56.420 --> 02:04:00.050
Dr Roddy McGee in Vegas is always at the cutting edge. That guy is like,

2280
02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:03.350
every time I talked to him, he, there's some new thing that's going on.

2281
02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:08.380
There's new stuff now called Wharton's jelly that is even more powerful than any

2282
02:04:08.751 --> 02:04:10.130
of the, the previous stem cell ones.

2283
02:04:10.131 --> 02:04:12.920
And I had that shit shot into my shoulder too. And that's all in the states.

2284
02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:14.330
All in the states. Yeah.

2285
02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:17.480
Cause stuff in the states now is way more potent than it was just five years

2286
02:04:17.481 --> 02:04:18.920
ago. Okay. Because I have way more.

2287
02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:23.120
You had a guest on and they were talking about going to Dr Neil Riordan. Yeah.

2288
02:04:23.121 --> 02:04:26.210
Panama, Panama. Dang, they're on another level down a panel.

2289
02:04:26.211 --> 02:04:27.600
I sent my mom down there. Yeah.

2290
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:31.610
My mom has a pretty bad knee and it sent it down to and it helped it.

2291
02:04:31.611 --> 02:04:35.060
But she's going to go down again. It's a, it's a heavy shit man. They can,

2292
02:04:35.061 --> 02:04:38.160
they do ivy stem cells too. They do a gang shit down there.

2293
02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:41.460
<v 0>So. So let me ask you, so what exactly does it help?</v>

2294
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:43.740
Does it help with like regenerate soft tissue?

2295
02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:47.280
So like would that be like a tendon or ligament? Tendons, ligaments,

2296
02:04:47.281 --> 02:04:50.850
muscle injuries, things along those lines. They can regenerate ligaments,

2297
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:53.460
regenerate tissue tears, you know,

2298
02:04:53.461 --> 02:04:57.540
like a [inaudible] stuff where you ordinarily would have to get things sewn up.

2299
02:04:57.541 --> 02:05:01.860
Like here's a perfect example. My friend John, his wife had a labor room tear,

2300
02:05:01.890 --> 02:05:06.090
so she had a tear in the Labor move her hip and the doctor was saying like,

2301
02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:09.030
most likely we're going to have to fix this. It's going to be a big deal.

2302
02:05:09.031 --> 02:05:11.970
It's going to be like months off your feet, like you have to,

2303
02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:14.910
you can't put any weight on it for I think like six to eight weeks or something

2304
02:05:14.911 --> 02:05:15.990
like that. Well,

2305
02:05:15.991 --> 02:05:20.430
she got exosomes shot in there and then when they went in for the second MRI,

2306
02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:24.990
there's nothing, no injury to freaky freaky.

2307
02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:28.020
So she had a little bit of a deformity in the bone of her hip that was causing

2308
02:05:28.021 --> 02:05:29.490
an irritation against the labor room.

2309
02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:33.540
They sanded down that part of the hip that was kind of bothering her. They,

2310
02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:36.200
they like cut away the part of the bone that's uh,

2311
02:05:36.210 --> 02:05:38.820
intruding on the labor them so that it clears the path.

2312
02:05:39.070 --> 02:05:42.000
And so it's not that invasive a surgery.

2313
02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:43.860
And then six weeks later she's good to go.

2314
02:05:43.861 --> 02:05:46.890
I mean she's rehabbing and everything and she'd still like,

2315
02:05:46.891 --> 02:05:48.330
they still had to cut her open a little bit,

2316
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:51.450
but the big one was the labor and tear and all that was fixed.

2317
02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:56.190
So I had a bicep tendon repair. Now my bicep rolled up.

2318
02:05:56.191 --> 02:05:58.230
I don't know if you see Matt. Sarah's arm is like rolled up.

2319
02:05:58.231 --> 02:05:59.550
He never got his face. He never got it done.

2320
02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:01.740
He just took the fight and whatever. Um,

2321
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:05.580
and I was contemplating doing the same thing as after I lost like Brian Caraway.

2322
02:06:05.690 --> 02:06:08.160
That was like the most devastating time in my life. That was like, uh,

2323
02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:11.790
I went off the fucking rails, but I gonna go off the road. That's another story.

2324
02:06:11.791 --> 02:06:16.680
I was just binge drinking. I was just out partying nonstop.

2325
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:18.000
But my girlfriend,

2326
02:06:18.001 --> 02:06:22.830
I went through a pretty bad breakup at the point too and it was like,

2327
02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:27.660
it was two fights in a row. We got into fights. It was, I beat Johnny Eduardo.

2328
02:06:27.670 --> 02:06:30.480
We got into a fight at the hotel and he got bad,

2329
02:06:30.930 --> 02:06:35.250
like real bad to the point where like my brother seen it like she got,

2330
02:06:35.251 --> 02:06:38.130
she has a nice, she has a good right hook. Let's just say

2331
02:06:40.050 --> 02:06:44.630
to the back of My skull, Dad got physical, they got physical and Zack.

2332
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:45.810
But isn't that unfair?

2333
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:48.960
It's super unfair because she knows that you can't do it back. Yeah.

2334
02:06:49.290 --> 02:06:51.380
But she knows how I kind of grew, not kindness.

2335
02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:55.020
She knows how I grew up and it's good thing. My one of my brothers were there,

2336
02:06:55.021 --> 02:06:59.280
Troy. Um, he fights all cs pro. Um, I just, he's,

2337
02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:02.050
that's another story. He's actually a pretty good rapper, but, uh,

2338
02:07:02.051 --> 02:07:05.520
I think that's more of his call. And then fighting in my personal opinion, um,

2339
02:07:05.610 --> 02:07:09.650
he's more dedicated, would just, I would just say that, uh, so he saw it,

2340
02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:13.230
but he s I remember I would tell him stuff like, Nah, man, sometimes he's gone.

2341
02:07:13.231 --> 02:07:16.590
I was crazy, but I think that's all females, whatever. But, uh, he was like,

2342
02:07:16.591 --> 02:07:18.450
dude, if I had never, if I wasn't in the room to see that,

2343
02:07:18.451 --> 02:07:21.240
I would never had believes you that she would ever do anything like that.

2344
02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:22.410
I'm like, no you don't.

2345
02:07:22.450 --> 02:07:24.810
I'm not fucking lying on my fucking crazy for my Phyllis shit.

2346
02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:28.830
But it was like I had one girl swinging at me ever. Yeah. I couldn't believe it.

2347
02:07:28.890 --> 02:07:31.710
As she was swinging at me, I was like, oh, cut, but right hook, right hook.

2348
02:07:32.050 --> 02:07:33.690
I said, I don't believe this is happening.

2349
02:07:34.050 --> 02:07:36.050
It was real telegraph had zero training.

2350
02:07:36.850 --> 02:07:40.480
<v 2>I just ducked on it. I was like, I can't even believe this.</v>

2351
02:07:40.481 --> 02:07:43.900
I had duck under it and just get ahold of him. Like, what are you doing? Yeah,

2352
02:07:43.901 --> 02:07:47.020
it's, it's, it's, I covered up cause I didn't want to fight anyone argue.

2353
02:07:47.021 --> 02:07:48.310
I'm like, y'all just came with the biggest,

2354
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:50.440
when I finished Johnny had the water. I was like, it was a boring fight.

2355
02:07:50.441 --> 02:07:54.470
But I got the finish is when I did the light that the cavitating hang thing and

2356
02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.620
then I started doing the Milly rock or whatever on any block.

2357
02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:00.790
So I was on cloud nine, you know,

2358
02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:03.700
I'm like celebrating and the way the fight started,

2359
02:08:03.701 --> 02:08:08.701
she kinda like she got more drunk than me at my own after party and I was,

2360
02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:09.830
I was like Yo pay,

2361
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:12.640
I'm not in the mood to be holding your hair tonight in the toilet cause it's

2362
02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:14.860
mine. It's my night and I get it. You,

2363
02:08:14.861 --> 02:08:17.790
you're happy for me but let me be more happy than you like be like,

2364
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:20.470
let me let me be the one really, really enjoying this moment.

2365
02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:23.620
And I just told my baby slow down. Like can you drink a little water?

2366
02:08:24.070 --> 02:08:26.050
And that turned into it just spiraled out of control.

2367
02:08:26.190 --> 02:08:29.740
You don't think I know how to Trey when it got crazy, hey got crazy.

2368
02:08:29.770 --> 02:08:33.160
But then a long story short, she right hook, right hook, left hook,

2369
02:08:33.370 --> 02:08:35.560
one of those hands. I think her hand is still fucked up from,

2370
02:08:35.590 --> 02:08:39.130
from my fight till this till this day. Till this day to this day.

2371
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:42.310
He puts that Hashtag on his posts everyday.

2372
02:08:43.090 --> 02:08:47.020
It's the greatest fucking thing today. It's great hashtag show people too,

2373
02:08:47.770 --> 02:08:52.300
especially since to flatlines everybody to this day. But then,

2374
02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:56.270
then the next fight, caraway, another big fight. And we were still like shaky,

2375
02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:58.990
you know, get into arguments a lot. And I think we were kind of like,

2376
02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:01.960
I was like six years in at this point, no, like five years and sold it.

2377
02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:03.760
We're still figuring things out, you know,

2378
02:09:03.761 --> 02:09:07.300
we're young figuring things out and I'm still like enjoying the, the,

2379
02:09:07.530 --> 02:09:10.030
the fruits of my labor. Like I'm on top of the world right now.

2380
02:09:10.031 --> 02:09:13.390
I'm ranked fourth in the world about to have the biggest fight against Brian

2381
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:18.130
Caraway, um, potential title implications on the line. And, uh, I'm, you know,

2382
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:21.440
I did a lot of dumb stuff, you know, I was like talking to other people. I was,

2383
02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:26.080
I'm a very flirtatious guy, but I don't, I try not to cross the line, you know,

2384
02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:29.980
and sometimes, sometimes he's just something, whatever.

2385
02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:33.430
Sometimes you cross the line a by accident. It's not like an intentional thing,

2386
02:09:33.431 --> 02:09:37.750
you know, I love her or whatever. And, um, but then after that fight,

2387
02:09:37.751 --> 02:09:40.720
I lost my first loss. And you know, I, I cried in the fucking,

2388
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:45.640
the half my after-party. I was at drays. All my boys and families were there,

2389
02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:49.810
my, some of my sponsors. And it was, it was a hard moment, you know,

2390
02:09:49.811 --> 02:09:51.430
cause it wasn't, I mean, it wasn't devastating loss,

2391
02:09:51.431 --> 02:09:54.130
but it was a split decision loss. I'd never thought it would happen like that.

2392
02:09:54.131 --> 02:09:57.260
And especially not to that motherfucker. I was like, dude, I talk so much shit.

2393
02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:59.650
I tried to build that fight up. Oh it was so it was like,

2394
02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:04.600
I can't believe I did all this work and then came up short because I just fucked

2395
02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.250
. I just shot myself in the foot, whatever.

2396
02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:10.780
And the next day we went to the pool because it was early and she likes to sleep

2397
02:10:10.781 --> 02:10:13.660
in. She, when she gets the opportunity to work, she's on vacation.

2398
02:10:13.661 --> 02:10:17.320
She could sleep. She sleeps at fucking me. I'm like, I'm up eight, nine o'clock.

2399
02:10:17.450 --> 02:10:19.270
I'm, I'm, I'm out. I'm having a drink and by the pool,

2400
02:10:19.271 --> 02:10:21.670
feet up and I'm under my umbrella cause I try not to Tan.

2401
02:10:21.671 --> 02:10:26.170
I already got enough of that. And um, she comes up where you at?

2402
02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:26.910
And I,

2403
02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:29.920
I think I go back to the room and then he turns into another fucking fight.

2404
02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:31.990
And at that point, that's when I kind of like, you know what?

2405
02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:34.100
I don't give a fuck. I'm talking anybody, any girl

2406
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.260
<v 0>I see, I think there's, hi, I'm going to talk to them. And if I get called,</v>

2407
02:10:37.261 --> 02:10:41.600
I get called. I don't really give a shit anymore and I could get caught. And uh,

2408
02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:45.530
it w we, it was a rocky, very rocky time and I was just, like I said,

2409
02:10:45.531 --> 02:10:48.530
I was just drinking nonstop and I was just,

2410
02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:50.420
I was just kind of being a fuck up man. I didn't mind.

2411
02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:52.790
I never did like hardcore drugs, anything. I, you know, I was smoke,

2412
02:10:52.791 --> 02:10:56.990
but this is hard psychologically to handle like a big loss like that.

2413
02:10:57.020 --> 02:11:00.080
Is that what it is? He just throws you off. You know what,

2414
02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:03.800
you know, I've lost a lot of my life. You know,

2415
02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.190
I would think that I battled back from a lot of adversity just dealing with the

2416
02:11:08.191 --> 02:11:11.580
stuff when my dad and my parents, um, them going through mold,

2417
02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:14.940
my dad going through a few divorces and uh, the, the,

2418
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:17.180
the domestic abuse and you know,

2419
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:21.740
being the first one to go to college and finish college becoming a two time all

2420
02:11:21.741 --> 02:11:22.011
American,

2421
02:11:22.011 --> 02:11:26.270
like I have a lot of things to be proud of and a lot of things that set me back.

2422
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:31.080
But I was able to overcome those obstacles and then to have that happen.

2423
02:11:31.130 --> 02:11:31.300
And you know,

2424
02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:33.980
I thought this was my call and I thought it's gonna be the Floyd Mayweather of f

2425
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:35.810
a MMA man. Well you know,

2426
02:11:35.811 --> 02:11:40.010
sometimes when you come from a background where you've had a lot of losses and a

2427
02:11:40.011 --> 02:11:41.960
lot of bad things have happened, but then all of a sudden,

2428
02:11:41.961 --> 02:11:44.960
great things are happening. You're moving forward and you got progress.

2429
02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:48.380
Setbacks are sometimes even more devastating cause you started thinking about

2430
02:11:48.381 --> 02:11:53.381
going back to the way things used to be or the way maybe your parents lived or

2431
02:11:53.871 --> 02:11:55.370
the way other people you know lived.

2432
02:11:55.371 --> 02:11:57.620
And when you see that life and you're like fuck this,

2433
02:11:57.621 --> 02:12:01.550
I can't believe I lost because you had anticipated that you were just going to

2434
02:12:01.551 --> 02:12:04.760
keep moving forward. So when it does happen,

2435
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:09.290
sometimes it's more devastating than someone who doesn't have high aspirations

2436
02:12:09.291 --> 02:12:12.080
and isn't on a roll. You know, sometimes when you're on a roll,

2437
02:12:12.081 --> 02:12:15.800
like a real roll and you lose, it's like the worst thing that can happen. Yeah.

2438
02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:18.350
Cause you think fuck, I thought everything had changed.

2439
02:12:18.351 --> 02:12:22.210
I thought I had re just reshaped my future. Yeah.

2440
02:12:22.770 --> 02:12:24.640
Now you're 100% right. And I thought,

2441
02:12:24.641 --> 02:12:28.040
I thought I was on the cusp of really changing my family's life.

2442
02:12:28.041 --> 02:12:31.820
This was before things really got crazy with like the, the divorce and my,

2443
02:12:31.821 --> 02:12:36.821
my dad and my dad can't came out of jail 2014 and October.

2444
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:39.800
And from there it just been a shit storm. Like damn,

2445
02:12:39.801 --> 02:12:43.700
calling the cops on each other and getting orders, orders of protection.

2446
02:12:43.701 --> 02:12:46.520
I had my brothers even like writing like you know what Jamal,

2447
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:48.830
the guy on gcs smell.

2448
02:12:49.090 --> 02:12:52.730
So smell lay or the guy who made up that fake thing like he got,

2449
02:12:52.731 --> 02:12:54.860
he got a smaller yeah with the,

2450
02:12:54.861 --> 02:12:59.270
with the hanging thing and say like people jumped him and a whatever.

2451
02:12:59.270 --> 02:13:02.960
So that guy, they would put like his like draw him on my,

2452
02:13:02.961 --> 02:13:06.050
on my door like on a picture and posted on my door whenever I would leave for

2453
02:13:06.051 --> 02:13:07.340
fights or leaf, their training,

2454
02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:10.910
I'll come home and me and my brothers were bumping heads and um,

2455
02:13:11.210 --> 02:13:13.820
it was like my dad and like his side of my,

2456
02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:16.580
not my mom's kids like the other side, like the other half,

2457
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.240
it was like them against like me cause I was such a,

2458
02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:23.930
it was like they will fuck with me in the house and it was like, dude,

2459
02:13:24.170 --> 02:13:27.110
I don't understand how you guys see one person, like really,

2460
02:13:27.111 --> 02:13:30.260
really trying to do something and push for like to be successful with something

2461
02:13:30.261 --> 02:13:31.980
and you guys just want tear it down. I

2462
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.740
<v 2>mean, our relationship is so much better now. So let me make sure I say that.</v>

2463
02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:38.520
But back then it was so toxic, man. And I was dealing with that at a point.

2464
02:13:38.521 --> 02:13:40.080
Eventually I had just get the fuck out of the house,

2465
02:13:40.530 --> 02:13:44.970
but my girlfriend was there. She was there for, from all that chaos and shit.

2466
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.650
So when she was like being the negative Nancy and I felt like, Yo,

2467
02:13:49.651 --> 02:13:50.341
this is just so,

2468
02:13:50.341 --> 02:13:53.130
so much burden going on in my life and now you're sh you're adding to it by

2469
02:13:53.131 --> 02:13:55.170
stressing me the fuck out. And I was like, dude, I just,

2470
02:13:55.590 --> 02:13:58.100
I just rather just be alone, you know, and uh,

2471
02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:00.070
just be a fucking bachelor with a bachelor's. And I'm like,

2472
02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:02.610
this is the way life was supposed to play out. It's like,

2473
02:14:02.611 --> 02:14:04.410
I guess this is what happened. Like I thought she,

2474
02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:05.850
she like showed her true colors,

2475
02:14:05.851 --> 02:14:08.790
but I knew deep down she just cared about me and she just wanted me to do the

2476
02:14:08.791 --> 02:14:12.240
right thing and she didn't know how to handle a boyfriend being in the

2477
02:14:12.241 --> 02:14:13.090
spotlight. You know, I'm,

2478
02:14:13.130 --> 02:14:16.080
I'm pretty sure you've probably had your fair share of like battles coming up.

2479
02:14:16.081 --> 02:14:20.190
Like it's challenging. And for the, for the male,

2480
02:14:20.250 --> 02:14:23.400
the person I even a male guy or female, whoever's in the spotlight,

2481
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:25.380
being able to handle that and do the right thing.

2482
02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:29.220
And in certain situations it can be very, very tough sometimes. You know,

2483
02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:32.760
and I think a person in your position to where you're so close

2484
02:14:32.890 --> 02:14:33.850
<v 3>shot at the title,</v>

2485
02:14:33.851 --> 02:14:38.851
there's so many things that could go wrong that could fuck you up or go right

2486
02:14:39.310 --> 02:14:40.420
and could elevate you.

2487
02:14:40.421 --> 02:14:45.100
And it's a delicate balancing act with personal life economics,

2488
02:14:45.190 --> 02:14:49.630
your health training trainers, training partners,

2489
02:14:49.631 --> 02:14:51.460
like everything has to kind of be in place.

2490
02:14:51.610 --> 02:14:55.810
If you're eventually gonna make that next step and, and gain the title,

2491
02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:56.500
it's like, yeah,

2492
02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:00.100
there's that weird and there's a lot of stress involved with something like

2493
02:15:00.101 --> 02:15:00.790
that.

2494
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:04.450
Well you are managing all these things and so any problem that you might have in

2495
02:15:04.451 --> 02:15:09.451
your relationship goes sour that fucks everything up because then the whole

2496
02:15:09.970 --> 02:15:13.920
system is all wacky. If the system is smooth like you,

2497
02:15:13.921 --> 02:15:17.440
you and your girl get along good. You and your training partners get along good.

2498
02:15:17.441 --> 02:15:20.830
Everything's good. We're all positive and moving in the right direction.

2499
02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:24.520
Do you have less ripples in the water? We're good. We're good. We're good.

2500
02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:29.580
And then that good or bad can have a significant impact on your future right

2501
02:15:30.101 --> 02:15:30.500
now?

2502
02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:34.930
<v 2>Yeah. No, I, I, I agree 100%. It's a, it's, it's,</v>

2503
02:15:35.110 --> 02:15:37.660
it's just been a really crazy roller coaster, like, uh,

2504
02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:41.690
eight and like even going on in that range. I, that's when I had the injury.

2505
02:15:41.691 --> 02:15:44.600
I remember trying to spot, I was like, you know what? I looked at my life.

2506
02:15:44.601 --> 02:15:47.990
I was like, dude, I've just been partying since my loss. It was,

2507
02:15:48.070 --> 02:15:52.310
was it May 29th or 27th Memorial Day weekend on a Sunday.

2508
02:15:52.311 --> 02:15:53.111
And ever since then I,

2509
02:15:53.111 --> 02:15:56.600
I think I probably drank like almost every single fucking day for how many

2510
02:15:56.600 --> 02:15:57.290
months? Um,

2511
02:15:57.290 --> 02:16:02.290
all the way to July when I had had this surgery and no one really knows me and I

2512
02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:05.300
was like, I was in a bad way, like mentally.

2513
02:16:06.110 --> 02:16:10.880
And to be able to pull myself back together was, it was tough man.

2514
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:13.580
And uh, I'm just happy I was able to do it.

2515
02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:15.680
But then like I remember I came back, I was like, you know what,

2516
02:16:15.681 --> 02:16:17.210
let's get out of this guy shit together. I think,

2517
02:16:17.211 --> 02:16:19.670
I think it was maybe owl or somebody else had a fight coming up.

2518
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.060
And that was like kind of like the catalyst for me to have the new found

2519
02:16:23.061 --> 02:16:24.200
motivation to get back.

2520
02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.520
And then I come back and I tried to spar and I popped my,

2521
02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:31.990
I popped my bicep tenant cause I'm just, I'm just on this binging drink,

2522
02:16:32.170 --> 02:16:34.000
I'm just going nuts. Your body is probably,

2523
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:37.870
we dehydrated and I go and I throw a long check hook, which I always do.

2524
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:38.920
I don't know if you've seen it in the fights.

2525
02:16:38.921 --> 02:16:43.150
When I stepped back and I always counted with the opposite hand and I hit guys

2526
02:16:43.151 --> 02:16:47.050
on my own, that transition going backwards and that's all I did. Connected,

2527
02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:51.880
flush, pop. And then from there it was a, another setback. And I was like,

2528
02:16:51.881 --> 02:16:54.610
how many wants to take for that to Rehab? Three I didn't,

2529
02:16:54.611 --> 02:16:57.160
I didn't feel comfortable taking a fight until probably like the third month.

2530
02:16:57.161 --> 02:16:58.000
And then I was like, all right, let's,

2531
02:16:58.330 --> 02:17:01.630
I didn't fight for the rest of the 2016 so I didn't fight again until I fought a

2532
02:17:01.950 --> 02:17:02.783
sunset in January.

2533
02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:06.390
It's what do you do during that time when you have like a giant gap like that we

2534
02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:09.640
not making any money. I went back to teaching for a little bit.

2535
02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:14.500
I was coaching the wrestling team and I was coaching at the high school program

2536
02:17:14.501 --> 02:17:18.250
at a Baldwin High School doing that and it was cool, but you know,

2537
02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:23.270
you're not making any real money so to speak because it's not like a real full

2538
02:17:23.321 --> 02:17:25.390
time job. Um,

2539
02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:29.440
so I had figured I had to figure things out real quick and that's why I always

2540
02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:33.940
thanked myself for not being like when these guys who mixed their money and just

2541
02:17:33.941 --> 02:17:36.730
go on these spending sprees and just blow their money.

2542
02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:40.030
Like people see me like traveling up there. We fight, which I do enjoy,

2543
02:17:40.630 --> 02:17:43.930
but I'm smart about it. I always try to do it on like the UFC is diamond.

2544
02:17:43.931 --> 02:17:46.930
I try to be, be a guest fied for every single event. I enjoy these things.

2545
02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:47.551
It's not a,

2546
02:17:47.551 --> 02:17:50.770
it's not a burden for me to go out and sign pictures to get a free flight to go

2547
02:17:50.771 --> 02:17:55.290
to Liverpool and just extend my trip and have everything paid for. I see that.

2548
02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:58.460
Just let you do that. If you want to go, well you ask and if they have,

2549
02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:02.120
if they have room to pay for it. And I went to Poland doing that. Oh that's bad.

2550
02:18:02.510 --> 02:18:05.290
Yeah. So I take advantage of these things, you know. How long do you go for?

2551
02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:10.210
It depends. I was in a London for seven days, but I went, I ex,

2552
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:13.600
that whole trip was two weeks. So I started in London cause I had,

2553
02:18:13.601 --> 02:18:15.910
my grandma still lives out there and some of my cousins and uncles.

2554
02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:20.290
So I went out there and visited them, hung out, we got shit face. And then, uh,

2555
02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:21.124
we went to Liverpool,

2556
02:18:21.330 --> 02:18:25.180
watched the fight when the boy versus out Darren till crazy, crazy fight.

2557
02:18:25.510 --> 02:18:28.310
And then, um, the last three days I saw Kevin.

2558
02:18:28.390 --> 02:18:29.740
I actually have a video on my phone.

2559
02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:32.080
I don't know if it might not be on my phone, might be on my laptop,

2560
02:18:32.081 --> 02:18:37.081
but I have a video of him and I grappling drunk in the lobby of the hotel in

2561
02:18:37.661 --> 02:18:41.020
Liverpool after the fights. And I told him I was coming out to a,

2562
02:18:42.130 --> 02:18:45.580
I told him I was coming out to Ireland and that was like my introduction to him

2563
02:18:45.970 --> 02:18:48.030
and I, we became like pretty cool ever since.

2564
02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:51.890
And then I went out to Ireland to go train and got to work with Brad Catona uh,

2565
02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:57.130
James Gallaher her for a little bit and get some work in and tour the island a

2566
02:18:57.131 --> 02:19:00.310
little bit. So that was fun. But then I went to Poland,

2567
02:19:00.550 --> 02:19:04.210
so I've done a lot of these trips and even courting a OCHA Sasaki when he fought

2568
02:19:04.211 --> 02:19:04.751
in Singapore,

2569
02:19:04.751 --> 02:19:08.290
I extended my trip and I went to Bali right after cause I have some long island

2570
02:19:08.291 --> 02:19:11.440
friends and I stayed out there for a week. That's an amazing place.

2571
02:19:11.441 --> 02:19:13.420
That's the place I want to go to flight is Bali luck.

2572
02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:16.270
Cause I almost went there last summer. We decided to go to Thailand instead.

2573
02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:20.140
But have you served before? No. It's a, it's, it's a great place for surfing.

2574
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:24.970
You're not scared of sharks? Not Shark yesterday.

2575
02:19:24.971 --> 02:19:28.250
No. Don't do this through Jamie. 25 to 30

2576
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:31.880
<v 5>feet long. 5,000 pounds. Wow. What? Yeah.</v>

2577
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:35.750
[inaudible] at this like jaws is real shit. This, I chose this route.

2578
02:19:35.770 --> 02:19:40.190
The biggest shark ever, right Scott to be. What did, when did this get solved?

2579
02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:42.660
Someone said it to me yesterday as I just remember watching it on my phone and

2580
02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:45.830
you just like set it and popped right in my head. That's done baby shark ever.

2581
02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:50.690
It's like the shack of human beings for the sharpish put in exaggerating those

2582
02:19:50.691 --> 02:19:52.790
numbers, but that's what it says here. Here's the tweet.

2583
02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:57.440
What is this from Twitter? Twitter. Martha's vineyard shows does exist.

2584
02:19:58.610 --> 02:20:01.870
Watch how big this fucking thing is. Okay, here it go.

2585
02:20:03.630 --> 02:20:07.490
There's the tail right here. Martha's vineyard. Isn't that split? It was, yeah.

2586
02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:12.140
Oh my God. Dude. It's so big. Oh my God. Wow.

2587
02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:16.940
Oh my God. Oh my God.

2588
02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:22.400
That is so big. Do not just fuck with people. It's hard.

2589
02:20:22.401 --> 02:20:26.290
Perspective wise, those numbers could be slightly exaggerated.

2590
02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:31.220
Listen that that 25 to 30 feet, 5,000 pounds. How do you know who's saying this?

2591
02:20:31.221 --> 02:20:35.330
Who's posting this? What is this group? Gregory Long. What does he do?

2592
02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.430
I don't know. I'll look up. And what do you do, Gregory?

2593
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:41.990
What is his actual credentials at that? He doesn't seem like to be a shark guy,

2594
02:20:41.991 --> 02:20:46.430
but it's his Wednesday wisdom. How's that wisdom? All right Greg,

2595
02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:49.920
what are you talking about? Great Guy. Great. You drop it.

2596
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:51.620
Find out that Greg's drunk at work.

2597
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:57.050
That might've just been 15 feet. It might be a regular grade. Either way.

2598
02:20:57.140 --> 02:21:02.140
Fucking giant might not have been really one in Hawaii that they monitor.

2599
02:21:02.301 --> 02:21:02.570
Right?

2600
02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:05.270
And they have a chip and it's called like deep blue or big blue or something

2601
02:21:05.271 --> 02:21:08.090
like that. Something like that. Yeah. And that's the biggest one they know of.

2602
02:21:08.091 --> 02:21:12.670
Correct. But I thought that was significantly smaller. Like 20 feet us.

2603
02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:17.770
A bunch of websites ran the story. Oh, but Twitter user,

2604
02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:21.790
Gregory Long posted a video. But there's no perspective though. It's, it's,

2605
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:25.250
there's not a boat that you can look at. We can say, oh, this is a 15 foot boat.

2606
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:28.520
Look at it. It's 10 feet longer than the boat. Yeah. Come on Greg.

2607
02:21:29.810 --> 02:21:30.830
Stop being drunk at work.

2608
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:36.290
Either way. Fuck sharks.

2609
02:21:37.370 --> 02:21:40.270
<v 2>Yeah, but you, I think you would enjoy it cause it's, sure. I love it.</v>

2610
02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:44.260
There's training there too. Uh, my Guy Anthony Leoni, Donny, Donny,

2611
02:21:44.830 --> 02:21:46.900
Carla Kloss and his brother Andrew Leoni, different long island,

2612
02:21:46.901 --> 02:21:48.400
but they just been moving,

2613
02:21:48.401 --> 02:21:50.770
hopping around to different places and they set up a gym and bar.

2614
02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:52.300
They started in Thailand,

2615
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:56.170
I guess they had like a little fallen out and he told me like they tried to

2616
02:21:56.171 --> 02:21:56.640
like,

2617
02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:59.800
they threaten to kill him or like threatened to tell them like you can't leave

2618
02:21:59.801 --> 02:22:02.230
like in a way where it was like threatening like you,

2619
02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:04.750
you're not leaving this place. But they left,

2620
02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:08.400
they got out of there and I guess in Bali they have like a law where outside is

2621
02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:13.420
foreigners can't buy property unless there's like an Indonesian like uh,

2622
02:22:14.290 --> 02:22:18.690
leasing it to you or like joint partners or something like that. Huh.

2623
02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:19.990
Something interesting like that,

2624
02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:22.450
which I thought was pretty cool because they have some,

2625
02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:26.250
you can live in a very nice too bedroom,

2626
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:28.740
<v 0>very nice place with a pool, with a garage,</v>

2627
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:32.190
get a scooter for like $2,000 for the year,

2628
02:22:32.370 --> 02:22:37.110
which is like insane and for a year for like, yes for you.

2629
02:22:37.111 --> 02:22:40.590
I asked the guy, Donnie, how much he paid. I don't want to misquote him,

2630
02:22:40.591 --> 02:22:43.920
but I want to say he had to pay 2,500 for the year or for two years,

2631
02:22:43.921 --> 02:22:46.860
something like that. While I was like, Yo Bro, I could come here right now.

2632
02:22:46.861 --> 02:22:50.970
Live like a fucking cake as black parents, everybody, I'll see you later.

2633
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:54.630
Well I think it's really attractive to these young guys that go to Thailand and

2634
02:22:54.631 --> 02:22:57.360
do their camps out there. Well not just young guys. This isn't Valentine.

2635
02:22:57.361 --> 02:23:00.680
Shevchenko didn't she do a lot of our training down in Thailand to Tyga Moitai

2636
02:23:00.690 --> 02:23:04.380
was it thing she did? It was either that or who kept top team.

2637
02:23:04.381 --> 02:23:07.980
I forget which one, but I'm in an Aka mom, Mike Swick,

2638
02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:10.020
he's got Aka Thailand now too.

2639
02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:14.910
There's so many places down there where guys go and train and you see like a

2640
02:23:14.911 --> 02:23:15.990
great result too.

2641
02:23:15.991 --> 02:23:19.890
Like Kahlil Rountree he went down there and came back a fucking assassin.

2642
02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:22.320
That was a fun episode you guys had when he was talking about his training.

2643
02:23:22.321 --> 02:23:25.470
Yeah, it was great. Yeah, but these are all these destinations.

2644
02:23:25.650 --> 02:23:28.200
Gyms are popping up but that's what they have over there in Bali they called

2645
02:23:28.470 --> 02:23:32.730
Bali MMA but it's been, they got the food like right on site so you don't,

2646
02:23:32.850 --> 02:23:35.100
you don't need anything. You go there. There's the showers,

2647
02:23:35.370 --> 02:23:38.820
there's the food shop and so healthy stuff too, which is pretty sick.

2648
02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:43.700
<v 5>What's going on Jamie. Yet people think that most likely was a basking shark,</v>

2649
02:23:43.730 --> 02:23:46.250
which is an average size of 11,000 pounds.

2650
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:49.970
Why do you think it's a basking shark? Because it's because of the size of it.

2651
02:23:50.290 --> 02:23:55.130
Yeah, but it didn't look a fucking shark. I was going to argue that like I know

2652
02:23:56.980 --> 02:23:59.450
they don't know shit cause I want it to be a great white,

2653
02:23:59.451 --> 02:24:00.360
but there were a bunch of things.

2654
02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:03.410
There were a lot of great white sightings in that area. Over that weekend,

2655
02:24:03.411 --> 02:24:07.640
so fuck up. Who knows? Yeah. Yeah, man. Sharks. Fuck sharks.

2656
02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:11.930
So basking sharks get that big. They get dry. They had that giant mouth.

2657
02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:14.840
They're not dangerous. They got a weird face. The sucking

2658
02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:18.390
<v 0>Krill and stuff like, Whoa, look at the inside.</v>

2659
02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:20.640
All bones. No.

2660
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:24.310
<v 5>Yeah, it looks like a tube that kind of looks like the same,</v>

2661
02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.840
but could be only that other one had that wide Alex now. No, it didn't.

2662
02:24:27.841 --> 02:24:30.570
But that might be a white ass mouth while it's open. Right?

2663
02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:34.860
Maybe if the mouth is closed. Hey Greg, do you know what the fuck you're saying?

2664
02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.720
Let me see. Oh, that looks different than me, man. Time and Gills would be on.

2665
02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:43.710
Let's take a look yet. God Damn Great. Why? Man, I don't know.

2666
02:24:44.370 --> 02:24:48.150
Let's call these apps. That's a great white shark.

2667
02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:51.630
That might really be a 25 foot shark. Dude that looked really showed that.

2668
02:24:51.631 --> 02:24:55.660
Again, that was always fucking gigantic.

2669
02:24:56.190 --> 02:25:00.720
Sorry for calling you drunk. Greg. Look at that. Whoa. Well,

2670
02:25:00.721 --> 02:25:03.840
imagine being in a Kayak and you gotta quit pot,

2671
02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:09.030
<v 0>blah, blah, blah, blah. Ah, ah, ah,</v>

2672
02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:12.810
that's so big. I'm surprised those things. They don't fuck with people man.

2673
02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:14.070
Like you see a ship,

2674
02:25:14.100 --> 02:25:17.400
you just don't just start charging into it and like I'm gonna fucking knock this

2675
02:25:17.570 --> 02:25:21.390
thing over and get a little snack. A little snacky Pooh. I don't know.

2676
02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:24.100
I saw the episode like the little snippet that Dana White

2677
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.700
<v 3>in a Matt, Sarah, Newtown has put out. I was like get the fuck outta here.</v>

2678
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.540
Go into the water with sharks. I could never,

2679
02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:35.860
why couldn't go surfing but never leave dean did it like he seems wise.

2680
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:40.990
It seems wise. It is. Plaque was supposed to be smarter than this dean.

2681
02:25:41.050 --> 02:25:44.650
It's Sarah Jones in there too. Everybody jumped in there.

2682
02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:47.500
Did you talk to Matt about it? No, I just saw the snippets.

2683
02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:49.560
I've been out here so find,

2684
02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:51.490
and it looks like there was like blood in the water too.

2685
02:25:51.491 --> 02:25:55.000
Like they threw pieces of meat in the water jumping in. She used to say like,

2686
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:58.870
look at this. Fuck it. Yeah.

2687
02:25:58.871 --> 02:26:02.290
See there's pieces of meat in the water and they were all, my God,

2688
02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.270
they were counting like one, two,

2689
02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:09.850
three fuck everything about that walk. Everything about that can never,

2690
02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:12.910
I could never do that shit just as a dumb way to dime.

2691
02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:18.290
Dana White's looking for a fight. How did Matt Serra die? Oh,

2692
02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:22.950
his fucking youtube show fucked up. Okay.

2693
02:26:22.970 --> 02:26:26.200
The whites looking for a fight. Yeah. Why would they do that?

2694
02:26:27.130 --> 02:26:31.330
They're yelling and screaming at Jane is laughing. Right? Isn't it funny?

2695
02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:34.540
Dan White's worth like a half a billion dollars and he's still gets his kicks

2696
02:26:34.541 --> 02:26:36.560
doing silly shit like this. Yeah.

2697
02:26:36.850 --> 02:26:40.660
I mean that shows a fun show because Dana's not doing that for money.

2698
02:26:40.690 --> 02:26:43.540
Not by any stretch of the imagination. He's doing that to have a good time.

2699
02:26:43.570 --> 02:26:47.260
Yeah. I mean, I love that. I love that aspect of what he does.

2700
02:26:47.261 --> 02:26:50.470
Like Dana is a fucking legitimate wild man. Yeah.

2701
02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:54.060
I really did choose to hang out with him. I love him. Maybe if I went to bed,

2702
02:26:54.190 --> 02:26:56.420
like I get hang out privileges as I'll do the same man,

2703
02:26:56.470 --> 02:27:00.040
next time I'm hanging out with y'all with him. I'll invite you if you love Dana.

2704
02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:04.290
He's crazy. He's, he mean he's the perfect dude. I always say this when I,

2705
02:27:04.291 --> 02:27:05.860
you know, I do the, um,

2706
02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:10.750
the announcing at the Wayans when Dana comes on stage. I always say without him,

2707
02:27:10.751 --> 02:27:13.460
none of this would be possible cause it wouldn't, yeah, he wouldn't,

2708
02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:18.100
he needed a wild man to take control of this fucking crazy sport.

2709
02:27:18.490 --> 02:27:22.290
Cause most people would want to tone it down or change things about it or, yeah.

2710
02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:25.720
I mean he's, and the only reason I did commentary Evers,

2711
02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:28.180
cause he asked me to do it. I never wanted to do commentary.

2712
02:27:28.181 --> 02:27:30.760
That wasn't my idea. That's Dana White's idea.

2713
02:27:30.850 --> 02:27:34.180
I'll tell you fucking what fucking killed it though. Well,

2714
02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:38.050
I got lucky that I got a chance in the early days when no one was watching to

2715
02:27:38.051 --> 02:27:41.920
learn to do it and get better at it cause I wasn't that good in the beginning.

2716
02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:44.080
It's still like, it takes a while to figure out how to do it.

2717
02:27:44.610 --> 02:27:45.970
But you are doing fear factor.

2718
02:27:45.971 --> 02:27:50.110
Before that I was doing fear factor and when I was doing fear factor, I,

2719
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:53.830
that's when [inaudible] had just purchased the UFC.

2720
02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:55.780
So I came to watch a,

2721
02:27:55.781 --> 02:28:00.730
when Tito Ortiz five Vladimir [inaudible] Shanko and a I w I went to,

2722
02:28:01.210 --> 02:28:04.720
um, some of the earlier fights, like when Matt Hughes fought soccer,

2723
02:28:04.721 --> 02:28:06.640
I was in the audience and everything like that.

2724
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:10.750
And Dana and I used to have conversations about fights and I would say, hey,

2725
02:28:10.751 --> 02:28:13.390
you know, you should check out these guys and this guy in Japan,

2726
02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:14.860
you'd check out this Russian dude. And,

2727
02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:17.290
and we were just talking about fights and I was just,

2728
02:28:17.291 --> 02:28:21.010
I would always be asking them questions and what do you guys got coming up next?

2729
02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:24.410
And I thought it was exciting because the sport was trying to take off and they

2730
02:28:24.411 --> 02:28:25.670
were risking all this money.

2731
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:29.970
Like I was there hanging out with them as a friend when the, uh,

2732
02:28:30.690 --> 02:28:34.140
pay-per-view cut short, cause they had a window of time for pay-per-view,

2733
02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:38.330
Tito Ortiz, flop Vat. Vladimir met Yushchenko right after September 11th.

2734
02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:42.350
So it was this big patriotic thing and everybody felt terrible.

2735
02:28:42.351 --> 02:28:46.640
Like this is right after nine 11 and Tito comes out with the American flag and

2736
02:28:46.641 --> 02:28:49.730
it was this big deal. And then the paper view,

2737
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:53.210
the time stopped in the middle of the fight and they just,

2738
02:28:53.211 --> 02:28:57.740
the screen went black and everybody wanted their money back so they lost a shit

2739
02:28:57.741 --> 02:29:00.470
ton of money and I was hanging out with them as you know,

2740
02:29:00.471 --> 02:29:05.280
just a friend when all this was happening. And then somewhere around a,

2741
02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:07.190
I think it was UFC 37 and a half,

2742
02:29:07.191 --> 02:29:10.380
Dana talked me into doing commentary because they were doing,

2743
02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:14.300
it was in promotion with Fox sports and the best damn sports show.

2744
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:16.880
I remember that show. Best Damn sports show period. Yep.

2745
02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:21.380
They were helping promote it and so all that stuff happened together and then

2746
02:29:21.381 --> 02:29:22.040
they talked me into,

2747
02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:25.430
Dana talked me into doing commentary and I did it ever since.

2748
02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:27.860
So w w when did you actually meet him?

2749
02:29:27.890 --> 02:29:32.540
Like met him in like 2000, right when they bought it,

2750
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:36.620
like 2001. What happened was they bought the UFC,

2751
02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:38.990
then they started putting on these events in Vegas and you know,

2752
02:29:38.991 --> 02:29:40.070
Eddie Bravo and I,

2753
02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:44.570
we had always said what this sport needs is some crazy billionaire who loves the

2754
02:29:44.571 --> 02:29:47.960
sport, who just dumps a bunch of money in it to make it, to make it big.

2755
02:29:48.170 --> 02:29:50.840
Because when I first started doing commentary was in 97.

2756
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:53.900
It was when it was presumed. It was a,

2757
02:29:53.901 --> 02:29:57.800
the old days when Bob Meyrowitz owned it and Bob hired me and Campbell McLaren

2758
02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:01.730
and I was just doing the post-fight interviews. I'd interview guys, you know,

2759
02:30:01.731 --> 02:30:04.700
after the fight was over. And then, um, I quit.

2760
02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:08.360
I did it for like maybe two years, but it was just too much work.

2761
02:30:08.361 --> 02:30:10.790
It was actually costing me money. It wasn't,

2762
02:30:10.850 --> 02:30:12.860
there's not a lot of money in interviewing fighters. You know,

2763
02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:16.550
there wasn't money in the sport back then and I just did it cause I loved it.

2764
02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:21.380
But it got to a point where like if I took a weekend off to do that versus do

2765
02:30:21.381 --> 02:30:23.970
comedy, it would cost me like a few thousand dollars.

2766
02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:27.080
And I was like I can't do this anymore. And so I quit.

2767
02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:30.730
And then when I got fear factor, I wound up uh,

2768
02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:35.210
go into one of their Vegas events cause the UFC just bought this and they were

2769
02:30:35.211 --> 02:30:39.410
giving out free tickets to celebrities. And so that's how Dana and I met. Yeah.

2770
02:30:39.411 --> 02:30:42.410
And then we just started talking about fights and he talked me into doing it.

2771
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:44.870
That's crazy. That's crazy. I never,

2772
02:30:45.170 --> 02:30:49.910
never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever be a sports commentator. No,

2773
02:30:50.330 --> 02:30:55.280
no desire to do it whatsoever. And I remember early on someone,

2774
02:30:55.281 --> 02:30:57.770
I remember who it was, was telling Dana like, hey,

2775
02:30:57.980 --> 02:31:02.240
he's got to stop talking about weed. And Dan,

2776
02:31:02.241 --> 02:31:03.140
his exact words were,

2777
02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:06.050
I don't give a fuck why he talks about as long as he talks about the fights.

2778
02:31:06.410 --> 02:31:06.740
I mean,

2779
02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:11.420
no one else would say that like as a CEO or a president of a giant billion

2780
02:31:11.421 --> 02:31:15.260
dollar organization, I would say that. Yeah, no one say that.

2781
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:20.130
It takes a wild man. He's different, man. He'd given up on the TV. Right? I

2782
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:23.620
<v 5>have it on my computer on. It's about to start here. Fucking, Hey,</v>

2783
02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:26.910
you've got it on here. That's because it's [inaudible]. There we go.

2784
02:31:27.630 --> 02:31:30.750
He beat up his cousin. Oh, Ray Cooper's about the fight. John Howard,

2785
02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:35.320
he beat his cousin up. He beat his cousin. He fought his cousin. His last one.

2786
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:40.620
Ray Cooper. Oh my God. Shields. He fucked up. Jake scheels twice in a row.

2787
02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:43.170
That's one of the weird things about that organization.

2788
02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:44.700
Are you doing this through your computer? Is that,

2789
02:31:44.730 --> 02:31:49.020
are you doing it because I have a boy. He fought. He fought his cousin.

2790
02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:52.900
Call those dudes. Oh, there it goes. Oh, there it goes. Damn. Oh No,

2791
02:31:53.020 --> 02:31:54.240
it's cause it's still going through my computer.

2792
02:31:55.410 --> 02:31:58.620
So no one really talked about that. Why is that thing in the middle of it?

2793
02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:03.360
I'm trying to switch the inputs to o box on. He's uh, you know, their,

2794
02:32:03.361 --> 02:32:07.950
their thing is weird the way they do it is weird the way the PFL does it yet.

2795
02:32:08.010 --> 02:32:09.180
Like you have to fight

2796
02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:14.910
to get into the, to get into the playoffs.

2797
02:32:14.970 --> 02:32:18.420
This should be wild as fuck. Cause John Howard can crack.

2798
02:32:18.421 --> 02:32:21.810
He hits like a fucking, he cracks, they both crack.

2799
02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:25.890
And John has fought a lot of high level dudes that they're on the bottom line.

2800
02:32:25.950 --> 02:32:28.710
That guy, he got his arm ripped off in a crash over the weekend.

2801
02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:34.150
Well it felt player. Oh, I heard about that. What happens?

2802
02:32:34.170 --> 02:32:34.681
Fucked up.

2803
02:32:34.681 --> 02:32:37.830
Just got started in the crash and said so I think it was his contract. Right.

2804
02:32:37.890 --> 02:32:38.723
What the fuck.

2805
02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:42.600
Unless they can rebuild them like Steve Austin or the billion dollar man as a

2806
02:32:42.601 --> 02:32:47.460
defensive tackle. Offensive guys. Now they can't, you can't have one arm.

2807
02:32:47.461 --> 02:32:50.650
But the one guy playing with no, like two fingers off in a,

2808
02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:54.990
a fireworks accident a couple of years ago. What you wanna hear about that?

2809
02:32:54.991 --> 02:32:59.330
He was like j p Ganache to contract. Like he's still NFL PA.

2810
02:32:59.470 --> 02:33:04.230
He's done now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's done. No. Now like as of this season,

2811
02:33:04.231 --> 02:33:09.030
I think God damn my boxing coach in Boston has finger bitten off in a street

2812
02:33:09.031 --> 02:33:11.940
fight and he replaced it with is a second toe,

2813
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:16.170
not the big toe but the second one and they had it curled permanently so he

2814
02:33:16.171 --> 02:33:19.770
could always throw right hooks that rough camp ref can look at them. I was like,

2815
02:33:19.771 --> 02:33:23.450
what the fuck is these stats? They're going to show up on the screen too,

2816
02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:26.100
like striking speed and how much they move around the ring.

2817
02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:29.280
Ray Cooper moving in quick. Boom. Big Kick taken down.

2818
02:33:29.281 --> 02:33:32.520
Ray Cooper is also state champion wrestler from Hawaii. Yeah,

2819
02:33:32.521 --> 02:33:36.810
I heard that his ass off. I was just found it weird that he fought his cousin.

2820
02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:38.250
I guess they had like a, he, they,

2821
02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:42.330
he was mad that his cousin is septic to be in the tournament knowing that he was

2822
02:33:42.331 --> 02:33:46.740
in a tournament first. Well probably not the best idea. Yeah,

2823
02:33:46.770 --> 02:33:50.730
that didn't hit so God damn hard. He hits hard. But you fucked your cousin. No,

2824
02:33:51.390 --> 02:33:53.550
well I fought my cousin when I was seven.

2825
02:33:55.170 --> 02:33:59.080
We got in a fight King Kong versus Godzilla. I was a,

2826
02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:04.110
I was a King Kong man. My cousins, my brothers used to beat my fucking ass.

2827
02:34:04.111 --> 02:34:06.540
We used to beat each other's ass as though they would jump me.

2828
02:34:06.690 --> 02:34:09.240
They would jump me. Really? Yeah. We jumped each other though.

2829
02:34:09.530 --> 02:34:13.530
