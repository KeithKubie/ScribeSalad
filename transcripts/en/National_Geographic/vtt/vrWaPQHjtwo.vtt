Shivani: I'm a fourth
generation Kenyan

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.811 line:0%
and I live in a tent

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.814 line:0%
in one of the most beautiful
landscapes in the world,

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.916 line:0%
Samburu in Northern Kenya.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:52.718
It is here that I
protect one of Kenya's

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:56.288
most iconic species; the lion.

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:58.791
In under a century we have lost

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.161
over 90% of our planet's lions.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:05.164
The situation in Kenya
is just as serious.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:09.235
We are down to less than
1,000 lions in our country.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.302
What's happening?

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:12.705
Why are we losing so many lions?

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:15.974
In Northern Kenya,
where I live and work,

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:18.211
lions are running out of space.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.978
As human numbers increase

00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:22.282
and more livestock comes along,

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.518
there's more pressure
that's being put on lions.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:29.188
Unfortunately, when this
happens, lions go out,

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:32.024
they come into close contact
with the local people

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.926
and they cause conflict.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.963
Livestock such as
camels, donkeys, cows,

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.532
they're much easier to
kill than a wild animal,

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.867
like an impala or a gazelle.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.903
This happens often in our area.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.872
Lions target livestock

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.874
but this causes a lot
of anger and resentment

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.309
amongst the local people

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:53.279
whose livelihoods depend
on this livestock.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.248
They often will go
out and retaliate

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:59.719
and they will shoot,
spear or poison lions.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.891 line:0%
Together with my team in Samburu

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.661 line:0%
an incredibly dedicated,
passionate and enthusiastic

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.563 line:0%
group of elders,
warriors and women.

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:14.700 line:0%
We run the Ewaso Lions Project.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.570
Our mission is to
promote the co-existence

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.405
between lions and people

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.707
that share this landscape.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.876
We do this through
a number of community

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:26.613
and awareness
education programs.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.281
One of our main ones

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.483
is a program called
Warrior Watch.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:34.320
Warriors are young men
aged between 15 to 30.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.189
The warrior in the
middle in this picture

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.624
his name is Jeneria.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:40.192
He's a very special young
man who's my assistant.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.528
He came to me many
years ago and he said,

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.697
"You know Shivani, my age mates,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.332
my fellow warriors,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.701
why are they not
involved in conservation?

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.169
We could do a great job,

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.338
if we just involved
all of them."

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.540
I said, "Let's
bring them on board.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.010
Let's see, if they want to
be involved in conservation."

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.812
He brought over five
warriors from his community

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.146
and he asked them.

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:02.849
He said, "Do you guys
want to be involved

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:03.916
in conservation?

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.151
Do you want to learn about

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:07.787
why it's important to
conserve these animals?"

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.488
They said, "Yes, of course.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:11.424
We are the eyes and
the ears in the bush.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.192
We see wildlife everyday.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.728
Absolutely involve us."

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.262
Thanks to the Big
Cats Initiative

00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:19.098
we started with five warriors

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.400
and now we've grown
to over 15 warriors

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.169
working in this region.

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.937
They have various roles.

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:27.306
One of them is to
patrol their areas.

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:28.774
They all live in their villages,

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.476
they go out during the day,

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.946
they see what's in the area,
they scan it.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.814
If there's predators
in the area,

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.183
they communicate that
message back to the herders

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.285
who are out there
with their livestock.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.388
We've taught them
how to use GPS's,

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.190
so as they're herding
their livestock

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.025
they can tell us
what they're seeing.

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.794
What amazing wildlife animals
they see during the day.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:52.365
Both sightings of predators
and also tracks.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.200
You can see in
this picture Precy,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.668
one of our warriors.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:59.004
He's got his finery, he's
got his knife, his bracelets

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:00.472
and right next to his knife

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:02.675
is a little GPS unit with a pen.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.110
This is all our warriors.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.612
They go out dressed
like this everyday.

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:08.981
This is their
normal way of life.

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:10.383
We asked the warriors,

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.885
"In exchange for all this
fantastic wildlife information

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.386
that you give to us,

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.622
what would you like in return?"

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:18.324
And they said education.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:20.593
"We've never had
that opportunity

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.861
to go to school.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.163
We don't know how
to read and write."

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.933
We started a Sunday
school with the warriors

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.367
five years ago.

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:30.435
Now I'm very excited to say

00:04:30.435 --> 00:04:33.673
that all of our warriors
can read and write,

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:37.576
both in English and our
national language Kiswahili.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:41.614
( applause )

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:47.853
We evaluated this program
a couple of years ago

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:50.856
to really understand how it
was working in the community

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:53.459
and we were so excited
with the results.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.860
They were very positive.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.796
They showed that the
local people's attitudes

00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:00.366
towards predators
have greatly improved

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.935
as a result of the
warriors working with them.

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:06.038
The warriors also felt much
more socially empowered

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:09.241
as a result of this project.

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:10.909
The women came to
us and they said,

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.311
"You're working with warriors,

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.080
you're working with
elders and children.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.114
Where are we?

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.249
We want to be involved
in this project as well

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.784
and where is our school?

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:21.320
We want to learn how to
read and write as well."

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.088
We started a Saturday school

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:24.790
with the women just last year

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.425
through a new program
we have launched

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:30.363
called Mama Simba, which
means "mother of lions."

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:33.132
I'm very excited to say
that just in a few months,

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.201
much shorter time than
the warriors learned,

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.803
( audience laughing )
the women...

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:41.440
( applause )

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.743
The women learned how
to read very quickly.

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:46.578
They're very excited about it.

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:47.980
They monitor all the predators

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.782
that come to their
villages at night

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:52.251
and they write down little
notes about who's come

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:54.587
and how many times
they've come in a week.

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:58.290
We did conservation
training with the women.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.094
We taught them the importance
of lions and predators

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:04.363
and why conservation is
so essential in this area.

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:06.198
We showed them
the different tracks

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:08.434
because it's all the predators
that come to visit them

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.135
at their villages
in the evenings.

00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:13.105
The women said to us
we know the tracks,

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:14.740
we know the difference
between hyena

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.174
and lion and leopard tracks

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:18.478
but we've never actually
seen these animals.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:21.313
We've never had a close-up
encounter with a lion.

00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:23.916
We hear them at night,
we see their tracks

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.684
but we've never seen them.

00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:27.520
We said we're gonna change this.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.388
We're gonna take
you all on safari

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:30.890
so you can get to see

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.026
what tourists from all
over the world get to see.

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:35.661
Here we are.

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.830
( audience laughing )
We took all the women on safari

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.099
into the beautiful
Samburu National Reserve.

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:42.902
And of course,
the number one animal

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.004
the women wanted
to see were lions.

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.038
We were a little worried

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.506
because by 11:00 that morning

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:49.241
we had seen nothing, actually,

00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:50.509
and the women kept saying to us,

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:51.543
"Where are the lions?

00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:52.545
Do they really exist?

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:53.746
We know they exist
because we hear them

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:54.847
but you keep
talking about them.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.115
Where are they?"

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.284
We worked really hard
and we were very lucky.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.686
We managed to find two of
our beautiful lionesses,

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:03.255
Nanai and Nabulu,
feeding on a baboon.

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:06.091
The women were very
excited watching this.

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:07.826
At the time,
Jeneria, my assistant,

00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:09.228
he was in another car.

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:11.830
He had a lady next to him
who had a little baby.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.466
The baby was getting
a little bit agitated

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:16.435
so he said to me
he's gonna drive off

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:17.769
and leave us with the lions,

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:19.905
and he would let us
know later where he is.

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:21.773
About 10 minutes later
he radioed me

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:23.442
and he said, "Shivani,
come quickly.

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.577
Bring the women.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.412
Something amazing
is happening."

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:27.380
I said, "What?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.447
What's more exciting

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:30.148
than watching these
lions eating a baboon."

00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:32.751
He said, "Just come, trust me."

00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:34.252
I told the women, "Hang on.

00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:36.755
We're gonna go drive
to where Jeneria is."

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.924
And off we went,
and we found him

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:40.325
and right next to him

00:07:40.325 --> 00:07:43.429
was an elephant giving birth.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:46.565
It was an absolutely
amazing experience.

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:48.567
I have lived in
Samburu for 12 years

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:50.169
and I'd never seen this.

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.171
What's even more incredible,

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:54.907
is there's a relationship
between Samburu women

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.175
and elephants.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:58.376
As we watched this birth,

00:07:58.376 --> 00:08:00.212
the Samburu women in our cars

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:01.914
were talking to the elephants.

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:03.515
They were talking
to them in Samburu.

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:05.051
They were saying<i> tomononi ai</i> ,

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.018
which means--

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:08.888
It's an endearing way
of talking to someone.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.090
They said, "We know
you're in trouble,

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.691
we know you and lions,

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:14.593
you're all facing
a lot of problems.

00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:15.828
Now we know

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.963
and we're going to work
hard to change that."

00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:21.099
It was an incredible
experience but word spread

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:22.468
that we had shown a lot of women

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:24.069
an elephant giving birth

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:26.205
and we got messages from
the community saying,

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:27.440
"Take us on Safari.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.741
( audience laughing ) We want
to see elephants give birth."

00:08:29.741 --> 00:08:31.443
Took a lot of
convincing to tell them,

00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:33.446
every time you go
on safari in Samburu,

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:36.015
you don't actually see
an elephant give birth.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:40.719
Every year we hold
Lion Kids Camps.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:44.189
Unfortunately,
children in rural Kenya

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:47.460
don't have positive
experiences with wildlife.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.928
Most of their experiences
are very negative.

00:08:49.928 --> 00:08:53.131
They get to see
a cheetah killing a goat,

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:55.100
they get to see
the remains of a camel

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.102
after a lion's preyed on it.

00:08:57.102 --> 00:08:59.271
They have never really
experienced wildlife

00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:01.474
the way I was
lucky to experience

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:02.974
when I was a child.

00:09:02.974 --> 00:09:04.743
My parents took me on safari.

00:09:04.743 --> 00:09:07.212
I will never forget my
first cheetah sighting,

00:09:07.212 --> 00:09:08.880
my first lion sighting.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.516
My first cheetah sighting
happened to be in Samburu

00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:13.452
when I was just eight years old.

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.053
That has stayed in my mind

00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:17.823
and that is why I do what I do.

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:20.693
We have really invested
in these children.

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.027
We believe they are

00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:24.697
the future conservationists
in this region.

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:28.067
They are the future wardens,
tour guides, rangers

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.402
and just wildlife leaders.

00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:32.504
Our Kids Camp changes this.

00:09:32.504 --> 00:09:35.240
We bring wildlife to
the children closeup.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.776
We give them a much more
positive experience.

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:39.277
Most of these children

00:09:39.277 --> 00:09:41.213
had actually never seen a lion

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.514
so we show them lions.

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:44.450
We bring them right
next to these lions

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.851
so they can get to see

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:48.120
what people from all over
the world get to see.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.589
These two little kids--

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.157
This picture was taken
just a couple of weeks ago

00:09:52.157 --> 00:09:54.426
at our second annual Kids Camp.

00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:56.796
These little kids,
Saiwana and Ltonos

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.364
they were sitting next to
me and they were saying,

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:00.399
"We really can't wait
to see our first lion,"

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.300
and we did.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.334
We were actually very lucky.

00:10:02.334 --> 00:10:03.702
We saw 10 lions that day.

00:10:03.702 --> 00:10:05.103
At the back in the picture

00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:06.772
you'll see a little brown blob

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:09.341
and that's actually
a big male lion.

00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:11.276
These little kids saw him

00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:13.178
and their faces say it all.

00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:15.080
This is the first
ever lion they've seen

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.516
and they kept whispering
to me, "Simba, simba,"

00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:20.553
and this is what gives us hope.

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:26.258
Loirish is a lion we
monitored in 2008.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.894
He was the father of many cubs

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:32.163
in both Samburu and
Buffalo Springs Reserves.

00:10:32.163 --> 00:10:35.300
He had control over two prides.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.771
Unfortunately, Loirish got into
a lot of trouble last year.

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:41.206
He was leaving the
safety of the parks

00:10:41.206 --> 00:10:44.009
and going out and killing
a lot of livestock.

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:47.279
He killed more than 10 camels
just in three months.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.347
We were very worried about this.

00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:51.983
We said we have to put
a collar on him now

00:10:51.983 --> 00:10:54.519
and so we can really
monitor his movements.

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:57.322
Every time he leaves
we will be able to see

00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:59.692
that he's out there
approaching livestock,

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:00.993
we could warn the herders.

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.062
This is Letoiye,
one of our warriors,

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:04.562
and Loirish was his lion.

00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:06.698
He was looking after Loirish.

00:11:06.698 --> 00:11:09.801
Unfortunately we were
not given much time.

00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:13.539
Loirish was killed
last year in September.

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:16.508
His head was cut off,
his legs were cut off

00:11:16.508 --> 00:11:18.043
and his head was burned

00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:20.578
so they would remove
the signs of the collar.

00:11:20.578 --> 00:11:23.048
Letoiye, who is in this picture,

00:11:23.048 --> 00:11:25.718
he for weeks was in camp

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.720
saying to himself and
talking to all of us saying,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.022
"My warriors killed my lion.

00:11:31.022 --> 00:11:32.725
How could that have happened?

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:35.394
I will make sure this
doesn't happen again."

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.830
This was devastating
for our project

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.965
but everyone was
even more determined

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.933
to make sure that our lions

00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:45.237
don't have the same
fate that Loirish had.

00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:48.373
On a more hopeful note,

00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:49.808
Naramat who is a female

00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:52.144
that we hadn't seen
for many years,

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:53.478
for about three years.

00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:55.814
We were driving through
Samburu last year.

00:11:55.814 --> 00:11:57.683
We heard the
guinea fowl squawking.

00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:59.251
We knew there was
a predator in the area

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.619
and we saw this female.

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.621
Jeneria and I, we know
the lions very well.

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:05.023
It takes us a couple of
seconds to identify them

00:12:05.023 --> 00:12:06.391
but in this case
we were stunned.

00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:07.960
We're like, "Who is this lion?"

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.596
We pulled out our ID books,
our iPads

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.597
which has all the sketches
of the lions,

00:12:12.597 --> 00:12:14.499
their ears, their whisker spots,

00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:16.168
and finally we identified her.

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.503
We said, "Wow this
is Naramat."

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:19.104
She left three years ago.

00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:20.839
Where has she been?

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:22.140
This is where she's been.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.709
She had been outside the parks.

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:26.077
She was surviving
with the local people

00:12:26.077 --> 00:12:27.846
and what's even more exciting,

00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:30.015
she came back with
a little male cub.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:33.285
A little one year old male cub
who we named Lentim.

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:36.355
This shows that lions
do survive outside

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:38.089
with the local people.

00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:40.359
I get asked this question a lot.

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:43.128
"Is there a future for
lions in Northern Kenya?"

00:12:43.128 --> 00:12:45.097
Absolutely there's a future.

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.832
Our work has shown that.

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:49.168
We had 11 lions a decade ago

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:52.304
and now we're monitoring
over 50 lions in our area.

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:56.008
It's because of the local
people's involvement.

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:58.711
With them invested
in conservation,

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:00.512
there's definitely a hope.

00:13:00.512 --> 00:13:02.781 line:0%
We have an event which
we have every year.

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:05.216 line:0%
It's the Running for
Lions half marathon

00:13:05.216 --> 00:13:07.352 line:0%
and now the local
people are running

00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:08.754 line:0%
in the name of lions.

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:11.356
Every year the number of
participants increase.

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:13.425
I think they hear that the
prizes are very exciting.

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:14.760
It's prizes of goats.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.896
( audience laughing ) So the
number of people keep coming

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:17.963
and women too.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.398
For the last three
years we've had

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:22.334
more than 20 women
come to run for lions.

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:25.904
This is our camp,
our field base camp

00:13:25.904 --> 00:13:28.440
in the Westgate
Conservancy in Samburu.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.643
It's an open area,
it's very remote.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.577
We have no running
water, no power,

00:13:32.577 --> 00:13:34.279
no internet, no phones.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:36.382
We have wildlife
walking through.

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:38.917
We have one little animal
that's not very wild.

00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:40.218
He's a little dog.

00:13:40.218 --> 00:13:42.321
Keeps us very
well entertained in camp.

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.290
It's in this camp
seven years ago

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.924
that we set up base.

00:13:45.924 --> 00:13:49.728
For many years we actually
never heard lions in our camp

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:52.363
but now over the past year,

00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:55.000
we can hear lions in our camp,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.201
and this is incredible.

00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:58.503
This is because they feel safer.

00:13:58.503 --> 00:14:01.373
The people are much more
willing to live with lions,

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:02.874
they're tolerant of them

00:14:02.874 --> 00:14:04.877
and now lions feel that.

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:08.413
They feel safer and we
can hear them at night.

00:14:08.413 --> 00:14:10.049
Today, I ask you.

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.551
I ask you to support
these initiatives

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.620
that are ongoing in Africa,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.323
and to spread the word
about the lion crisis.

00:14:18.323 --> 00:14:21.260
We then have hope
that we will continue

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.196
to hear lions throughout
the African wilderness

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.331
for generations to come.

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:28.567
In Samburu we say<i> ashe oleng.</i>

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:29.868
Thank you very much.

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:33.172
( audience clapping )

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:36.575
( outro music )
