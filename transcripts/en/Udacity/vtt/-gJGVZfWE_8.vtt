00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.320
You mentioned that one of the most popular hits of

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.820
things that people are interested in are the Warfarin pathways.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.330
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.840
&gt;&gt; Now why, why is that?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.690
&gt;&gt; So, Warfarin is pretty much the most advanced case of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.620
pharmocogenetics that has been studied. Why do I say that? Warfarin has more

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.810
than one drug that impacts its response. And we actually know what

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.390
a lot of those, more than one gene. I'm sorry. Warfarin has

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.020
more than one gene that's important for understanding its response. And

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.500
we actually know what a lot of those genes are, and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.060
how to combine the information from more than one gene. That's,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.050
that's a frontier. There are many genes drugs for which we know

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.620
there are several genes. But, we don't know how to combine

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.420
the information yet. We do for for Warfarin, so that's the first

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.550
thing. The second thing about Warfarin is that we also know

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.260
some of the environmental variables that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.610
effect Warfarin response. How much green

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.560
leafy vegetables you're eating? what your height and

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.550
weight is? What other drugs you're on? That all

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.910
combines to have Warfarin be the single best drug

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.650
that we have for predicting response based on the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.040
combination of genetics and environmental factors. The other thing

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.510
that I should have actually mentioned right off the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.950
bat is there are something between 30 and 50

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.680
million Americans alone on this drug. And probably obviously

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.560
twice that, or more Internationally. So we're talking

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.920
a hundred million people on this drug. There are

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.350
new drugs coming out that are hoping to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.750
knock it off as the leader. bBt today Warfarin

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.300
is still an incredibly important drug worldwide and

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.830
so accurate dosing, especially for a dangerous drug like

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.860
Warfarin. As you may know, Warfarin is anti-coagulant

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.510
and it makes it harder to clot your blood.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.050
That's good if you've had a heart attack, it's good if you've had a stroke. It's

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.950
good if you've had a clot in your lung or in your legs. But if you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.600
have too much of it, it can kill

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.510
you with internal spontaneous hemorrhage. So there's this

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.450
very narrow range, we have to get it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.750
right, and that's where the genetics can help.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.970
&gt;&gt; Right, it sounds like blood clotting

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.730
is obviously important when we cut ourselves

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.540
and we're bleeding. But you know if it's blocking our hearts that's not so good.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.340
&gt;&gt; Not so good.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.760
&gt;&gt; Well you

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.070
mentioned that there are so many people on Warfarin. the variation in

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.040
the human genome that exists on the PharmGKB side for example, does it sort

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.350
of separate? Is it able to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.359
document the pharmaco-kinetic and the pharmaco-dynamic pathways

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.080
separately? Does it combine them, how do

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.380
you how do you present that information?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah so we, those are two separate. Good for you for

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.980
knowing about this. And, and good for your class. in the case

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.000
of Warfarin, there are both pharmaco-kinetic and pharmaco

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.970
determinants to the response. And there are genetic variations

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.480
on the pharmaco-kinetic side that change the rate at

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.320
which it's metabolized. And one of the most important

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.920
genes is called CYP2C9. there's another one called

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.070
a CYP4F2, but 2C9 to take as an example.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.920
It's well known that if you're going to metabolize Warfarin

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.410
more slowly, you're going to need less of it. And,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.510
and if you take the normal dose when

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.290
you're a slow metabolizer, you're going to wind up with

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.820
effectively an overdose, and too much bleeding. There on

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.190
the pharmaco-dynamic side, there's a gene, again with a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.480
terrible name. It's called VKORC1 or Vitamin K Oxoreductase

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.390
Component one, which is actually the target. It's, it's

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.460
the, it's the protein which the drug Warfarin binds

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.330
to to inhibit clotting. And there are some variations.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.980
Both inside this gene, but also in the control

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.840
regions of the gene. That it controls it's expression, that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.526
markedly changes it's levels. And there are some variations that

00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:34.890
are very important for determining Warfarin does in that. So,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.070
it's a great story, because there's this one PD

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.120
gene that seems dominant, this one PK gene that seems

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.590
dominant. Together you can come darn close to predicting what

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.960
the right dose will be for, for an individual patient.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.521
&gt;&gt; Even without

00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:49.210
needing to see them clinically first?

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.380
&gt;&gt; That's right. You, it, it does, you do

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.210
best if you have their age, because there are

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.180
some age effects and gender. There's some sex effects

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.010
the genetics. and then, ethnicity. You would hope that

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.920
ethnicity would drop out, because you would hope that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.560
once we have the genetic measurements. Who cares what

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.350
your ancestry is? But I must say that our

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.830
ability to predict those for African-descent people is still

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.649
not as good and so in our lab, we're working very hard. The hypothesis would be

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.100
that there are additional genetic variations seen in

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.730
that population that have not been studied yet.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.010
That, with knowledge of those, we'll be able

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.250
to get our level of prediction for, African

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.980
descent people to be as good as where we are now for European and Asian descent.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for chatting with us.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.840
&gt;&gt; Alright. It's my pleasure. Thanks for doing this.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.
