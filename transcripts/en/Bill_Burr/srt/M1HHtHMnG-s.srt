1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,000
Like a boss. For some reason, I
think if I'm fluent in Spanish,

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,070
I can go down to South America
with that South America.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,260
Why did that just pop in my head?

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,740
Remember that fucking song that
David Bowie and a Mick Jagger did

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,230
dancing in the streets and
they will rubbing their ass
is together and they were

6
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:32,620
yelling all the fucking places,
different countries out.

7
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:35,890
And then Mick Jagger goes South America

8
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,343
[inaudible]

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,020
and it made me like the stones
a little bit less. Um, anyways,

10
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:54,670
I figured if I can go down there
to South America, I would fucking,

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,690
uh, if I could speak the language, I
could talk my way out of being kidnapped.

12
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,663
You know,

13
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,930
you have to watch that show
arrested abroad abroad.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,130
You ever seen that shit?
Fucking people go now I'm,

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,360
I think you don't have to take,
I'm going to do is martial artists guy.

16
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,730
I think I've been a fucking ride a
motorcycle from here to the tip of South

17
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,564
America.

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,510
I decided to ride a motorcycle to
the tip of South America and back.

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,020
You know, and guess what happens? It
gets like a third of the way there.

20
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,191
He goes,

21
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:34,191
left on fucking Venezuelans that are
right on fucking a Chalupa right?

22
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,600
It's just this premonition that
something's gonna go wrong.

23
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,500
And that's when I started going,
hmm,

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,750
do I turn it around or do I keep going?

25
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,360
Next thing you know, he's, he's
there a bunch of fucking gorillas.

26
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,480
They're just looking at like,
is this like entrapment?

27
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,880
There's no way it's this easy.

28
00:01:55,881 --> 00:02:00,881
Did a fucking white guy on a Goddamn
vesper just turned down this dirt road in

29
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,410
the middle of the fucking rainforest?
Is the,

30
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:08,150
is there a fucking death squad
behind this guy? You know,

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,130
and I just figure if you actually spoke
the language instead of these people

32
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,680
walking around, I'd get it.
Right. Cause that's what,

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,460
that's what Spanish sounds like to a white
man like me or I'm going to elaborate

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,940
that map map until you
fucking break it down.

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,560
I just think that that would be good
to be laying in the tent. Keon dog.

36
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,570
You know what? We're not going to
fucking kill this guy right now.

37
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:31,600
We're going to kill him tomorrow instead
of it sounding like I'm now all right.

38
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,610
And then maybe you could figure out how
to get out of there. So that's what I do.

39
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:38,320
So like, you know what I've always
wanted to do? I want to go out,

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,260
I want to go to the, uh,
the Galapagos Islands.

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,120
I think he would have to go through
Columbia or Venezuela, you know,

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,180
those places down there, you know,
instead of having like, they have like a

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:56,671
Pablo Francisco Boulevard,
I mean,

44
00:02:56,671 --> 00:03:01,630
I'm not going to that street as a
Goddamn redheaded white man. Hey,

45
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,410
how are ya? Who'd like to a kidnap
me first and all me for ransom,

46
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,973
you know,

47
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:08,861
you know,

48
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,710
when they say you've got to watch out
who you fucking hang out with that,

49
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,480
that's one of those times you really
have to watch out who you hang out with

50
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:17,990
because if you hang out with a bunch of
fucking losers and you get kidnapped and

51
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:20,630
they start demanding money for you,
that's going to be a rough one.

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,310
Jim
[inaudible]

53
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,180
Oh, Steve. Yeah.
