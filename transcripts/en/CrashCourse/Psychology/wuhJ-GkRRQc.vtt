00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.779
Way back in 1887, a journalist named Elizabeth
Cochran assumed the alias Nellie Bly and feigned

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.080
a mental illness to report on the truly awful
conditions inside psychiatric hospitals in

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.449
the US, which were known as asylums at the
time. She found rotten food, cold showers,

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.860
prevalent rats, abusive nurses, and patients
being tied down in her famous expose "Ten

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.000
Days in a Mad House". What she documented
had been pretty standard mental health treatment

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.420
for centuries, but her work led the charge
in mental health reform.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.379
It's been a long battle.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.360
Nearly a century later in 1975, American psychologist
David Rosenhan published a paper called "On

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.479
Being Sane in Insane Places" detailing the
experiment that he conducted on psychiatric

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.840
institutions themselves. The first part of
his experiment involved sending pseudopatients

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.680
- a group of eight totally mentally sound
associates, including David himself - to knock

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.049
on institution doors and falsely report that
they'd been hearing voices. Once admitted,

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.400
the fake patients abandoned their fake symptoms
and behaved as they normally did, waiting

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.770
for administrators to recognize them as mentally
healthy.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.070
Like Cochran, Rosenhan and his team learned
that it's easy to get into a mental institution,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.350
but it is much, much harder to get out. The
participants were kept in the institution

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.770
for an average of 19 days, one of them for
52 days. They were forced to take psychotropic

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.500
medication (which they sneakily spit out)
and were eventually discharged with a diagnosis

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.329
of paranoid schizophrenia in remission. Of
course, being dubbed in remission isn't exactly

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.469
the same thing as being labeled sane, and
that was just one of Rosenhan's criticisms

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.320
of the system. It viewed mental illness as
an irreversible condition, almost like a personality

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.990
trait, rather than a curable illness.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.899
Part two of his experiment came later when
Rosenhan shared his results with a teaching

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.259
hospital and then told the staff that he'd
be sending more pseudopatients their way in

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.979
the next few months, and challenged them to
detect the imposters. With that in mind, out

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.640
of 193 new patients, 41 were ferreted out
as likely or suspected pseudopatients. The

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.180
thing is, Rosenhan never actually sent in
any pseudopatients. In the end Rosenhan concluded

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.819
that the way people were being diagnosed with
psychiatric issues often revealed less about

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.909
the patients themselves and more about their
situation. Like, saying you've heard voices

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.650
one time might catch a doctors attention a
lot more than weeks of normal behavior.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.319
Naturally people criticized his methods and
his findings, but his experiment raised a

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.870
lot of important questions like: How do we
define, diagnose, and classify mental disorders?

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.280
At what point does sad become depressed? Or
quirky become obsessive compulsive? Or energetic

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840
become hyperactive? What are the risks and
benefits of diagnostic labeling, and how does

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.080
the field keep evolving?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.840
When people think of psychology they probably
most often think about the conditions that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.110
it's been designed to understand, diagnose,
and treat - namely psychological disorders.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.970
From common problems that most of us will
experience at some point in our lives to the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.090
more serious dysfunctions that require intensive
care. They're a big part of what psychology

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.310
is here for and over the next several lessons
we're going to be looking at mental illness,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.629
as well as wellness. How symptoms are diagnosed
and what biological and environmental causes

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.019
may be at work. But, to grasp those ideas,
we first have to find out how we came to understand

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.290
the idea of mental health itself and build
a science around studying, discussing, and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.280
caring for it.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.329
In 2010, the World Health Organization reported
that about 450 million people worldwide suffer

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.260
from some kind of mental or behavioral disorder.
No society is immune from them, but when I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.569
say psychological disorder I'm guessing some
of you will conjure up all sorts of dramatic

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.040
images like diabolical criminals from Arkham
Asylum or Hollywood stereotypes of various

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.400
eccentric, scary, or tragic figures. This
roll call of one-sided stock images is part

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.920
of the problem our culture faces - the misconceptions
and often destructive stigma associated with

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.909
psychological disorders.

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.299
So, what does that term actually mean?

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.140
Mental health clinicians think of psychological
disorders as deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.939
patterns of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.
And yeah, there are a lot of sensitive and

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.750
loaded words in there, so let's talk about
what we mean, starting with deviant.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.560
Sounds like I'm talking about doing things
that are dicey or raunchy, but in this context

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.579
it's used to describe thoughts and behavior
that are different from most of the rest of

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.490
your cultural context. Of course, being different
is usually wonderful. Geniuses and Olympians

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.870
and visionaries are all deviants from the
norm so it probably goes without saying that

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.080
the standards for so-called deviant behavior
change a lot across cultures and in different

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.800
situations. For example, in a combat situation
killing people is probably to be expected,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.610
but murder is definitely deviant criminal
behavior back home in times of peace. And

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.610
in some contexts speaking to spirits or ancestors
is A-OK, but in other settings say a bar in

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.700
Iowa City at happy hour it might not be quite
acceptable.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.940
But, to be classified as a disorder, that
deviant behavior needs to cause that person

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.740
or others around them distress, which just
means a subjective feeling that something

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.000
is really wrong. In turn, distress can lead
to truly harmful dysfunction - when a person's

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.560
ability to work and live is clearly, often
measurably, impaired.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.840
So that's today's definition but it took a
long time for the Western world to come up

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.010
with a way of thinking about psychological
disorders that was rooted in science and investigative

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.590
inquiry. It wasn't until around the 18th and
19th centuries that we really started to put

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.170
forth the notion that mental health issues
might be about a sickness in the mind. For

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.220
example, by the 1800s doctors finally caught
on to the fact that advanced syphilis could

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.020
manifest in serious neurological problems
like dementia, and irritability, and various

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.200
mental disorders. So eventually a lot of so-called
mental patients were removed from asylums

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.200
to full medical hospitals where all of their
symptoms could be treated.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.830
This "a-ha" moment is just one instance of
how perspectives on mental health began to

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.080
shift towards what is called the Medical Model
of Psychological Disorder. The Medical Model

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.870
champions the notion that psychological disorders
have physiological causes that can be diagnosed

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.050
on the basis of symptoms, and treated,
and sometimes even cured. That way of thinking

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.960
about mental health was an important step
forward, at least at first. It took us past

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.530
the old days of simply locking people up when
they didn't seem quite right to others.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.340
But even if it was an improvement, the medical
model was seen by some in the field as kind

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.220
of narrow and outdated. Most contemporary
psychologists prefer to view mental health

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.220
more comprehensively through what is called
the Biopsychological Approach. You've heard

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.190
us say over and over again that everything
psychological is simultaneously biological

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.550
and that truism is particularly useful here.
The Biopsychological view takes that holistic

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.620
perspective, accounting for a whole number
of things clearly physiological and not in

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.120
order to understand what's happening to us,
what might be going wrong, and how it can

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.630
be treated.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.610
It takes into account psychological influences
for sure like stress and trauma and memories,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.550
but also biological factors like genetics
and brain chemistry, and social-cultural influences

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.400
like all the expectations wrapped up in how
a culture defines normal behavior. So by considering

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.190
the whole host of nature and nurture influences,
we can take a broader view of mental health,

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.960
realizing that some disorders can be cured
while others can be coped with, and still

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.000
others may end up not being disorders at all
once our culture accepts them.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.250
But another important part of handling disorders
with scientific rigor is attempting to standardize

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.880
and measure them. How we talk about them,
how we diagnose them, and how we treat them.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.540
So the field has literally come up with a
manual that shows you how to do that. But

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.430
it is not without it's flaws. It's called
the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.270
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;
or, DSM-5 because it's currently in its fifth

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.370
edition. And it is used by practically everybody:
clinicians obviously, but also by insurance

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.130
and drug companies, and policy makers, and the
whole legal system.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.820
The first edition came out in 1952, and this
newest version was released in 2013. What's

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.270
particularly interesting about it is that
it's designed to be a work in progress...

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.030
forever. Each new edition incorporates changes
based on the latest research but also how

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.860
our understanding of mental health and behavior
evolves over time. For example, believe it

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.590
or not the first two editions actually classified
homosexuality as a pathology, basically a

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.730
disease. The 1973 third edition eliminated
that designation, reflecting changing attitudes

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.760
and a developing understanding of sexual orientation.
And just by looking at the changes between

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.540
the edition used today and the previous version
released in the year 2000, you can get a picture

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.220
not only of how quickly things change but
also how classification can affect diagnosis

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.200
- for better or worse - and also what the
risks are of classifying psychological disorders

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:31.860
in the first place.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.459
For instance, the new edition reflects our
growing understanding of the symptoms of Post

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:39.899
Traumatic Stress Disorder, and it changed
the name of Childhood Bipolar Disorder to

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:45.500
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder because
kids were being over-diagnosed and over-treated

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.899
for bipolar disorder when the condition that
they had didn't actually fit that description.

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:53.639
And totally new diagnoses are being explored
as well, like Gambling Addiction and what's

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:58.800
called Internet Gaming Disorder, showing that
new disorders continue to arise with changing times.

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:03.290
But the DSM is not perfect, even though we've
come a long way since the Rosenhan experiment,

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:08.430
critics still worry about how the DSM might
inadvertently promote the over- or mis-diagnosis

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.750
and treatment of certain behaviors. Others
echo Rosenhan's concerns that by slapping

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.800
patients with labels we're making them vulnerable
to judgments and preconceptions that'll affect

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.350
how others will perceive and treat them.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.310
In the end, it's just important to keep in
mind that definitions are powerful and things

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.970
can get tricky pretty fast in the world of
mental health.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:30.579
Today you learned about how we define psychological
disorders, and looked at medical and biopsychological

00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:35.120
perspectives on mental illness. We talked
about how professionals use the DSM to diagnose

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.670
disorders and how it's constantly evolving
to incorporate new thinking. Thanks for watching,
