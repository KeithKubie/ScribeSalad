00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:02.206
Voiceover:We're told given g of x

00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:06.797
is equal to ten of x minus
three pi over two plus six,

00:00:06.797 --> 00:00:09.288
find the g inverse of x.

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:10.952
They want us to type that in here

00:00:10.952 --> 00:00:12.699
and then they also want us to figure out

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.264
what is the domain of g inverse,

00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:18.143
the domain of g inverse of x.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.715
I've got my little scratch pad here

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:22.327
to try to work that through.

00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:25.387
Let's figure out what g inverse of x is.

00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:28.572
This is g of x, so g inverse of x.

00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:29.945
Essentially, let me just read

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:31.862
this is g of x right over here,

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:34.239
g of x is equal to tangent of x

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.478
minus three pi over two plus six.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:39.997
G inverse of x, I
essentially can swap the …

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:42.075
I can replace the x
with the g inverse of x

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.809
and replace to g of x with an x

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.805
and then solve for g inverse of x.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:58.908
I could write that x is equal
to tangent of g inverse of x

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:05.863
minus three pi over two plus six.

00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:08.149
Let's just solve for g inverse of x.

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.624
I actually encourage
you to pause this video

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:12.584
and try to work through this
out or work it out on your own.

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:15.015
Let's subtract six from both sides

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:17.488
to at least get rid of this six here

00:01:17.488 --> 00:01:21.151
so I'm left with x minus
six is equal to the tangent

00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:28.702
of g inverse of x minus three pi over two.

00:01:28.702 --> 00:01:31.157
Now let's take the inverse tangent

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.740
of both sides of this equation

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.872
so the inverse tangent
on the left hand side

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:40.487
is the inverse tangent of x minus six

00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:45.436
and on the right hand side the
inverse tangent of tangent.

00:01:45.436 --> 00:01:48.784
If we restrict the
domain in the proper way

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:50.106
and we'll talk about that in a little bit

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:51.943
is just going to be what the input

00:01:51.943 --> 00:01:53.771
into the tangent function is.

00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:56.319
If you restrict the
domain in the right way,

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.356
inverse tangent of the
tangent of something,

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:06.705
let's say theta is just
going to be equal to theta.

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:08.914
Once again if we restrict the domain,

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:11.262
if we restrict what the possible values

00:02:11.262 --> 00:02:13.224
of theta are in the right way.

00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:15.935
Let's just assume that we're doing that

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:19.309
and so the inverse
tangent of the tan, of this

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.694
is going to be just this
stuff right over here.

00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:23.305
It's just going to be that,

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:26.479
it's going to be g inverse of x

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.303
minus three pi over two.

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:30.889
Now we're in the [home] stretch

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.142
to solve for g inverse of x

00:02:32.142 --> 00:02:34.496
we could just add three
pi over two to both sides

00:02:34.496 --> 00:02:37.668
so we get and actually let
me just swap both sides.

00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:42.255
We get g inverse of x is equal to

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:47.386
the inverse tangent of x minus six

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:49.751
and then we're adding three
pi over two to both sides

00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:52.235
so this side is now on this side

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:58.806
so plus three pi over two.

00:02:58.806 --> 00:03:00.585
Let me actually type that

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:02.085
and I'm going to see if I can remember it

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:03.958
because I'm about to
lose this on my screen

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.117
so inverse tangent of x minus
six plus three pi over two

00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:09.493
so let me write that down.

00:03:09.493 --> 00:03:10.760
Let me type this.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.168
G inverse of x is going
to be the inverse tangent

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:17.681
so I can write it like this,

00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.237
the inverse tangent of x minus six

00:03:21.237 --> 00:03:23.169
and yes it interpreted it correctly.

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.684
Inverse tangent you can do that as

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:30.599
arctangent of x minus six
plus three pi over two

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.930
and it did interpret it correctly

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.506
but then we have to think about

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:37.106
what is the domain of g inverse?

00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:39.951
What is the domain of g inverse of x?

00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:41.696
Let's think about this a little bit more.

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:45.123
The domain of g inverse of x,

00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:48.534
so let's just think about
what tangent is doing.

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:54.269
The tangent function if
we imagine a unit circle,

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.267
so that's a unit circle right over there.

00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:58.615
Guess we can imagine to be a unit circle.

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:00.889
My pen tool is acting up a little bit

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.522
it's putting this little gaps and things

00:04:02.522 --> 00:04:04.844
but I think we can power through that.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.041
Let's just say for the sake of argument

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:08.217
that that's a unit circle,

00:04:08.217 --> 00:04:10.173
that's the x axis and that's the y axis.

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:12.359
If you form an angle theta.

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.421
If you form some angle
theta right over here,

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:19.082
the tangent of theta is
essentially the slope

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:22.538
of this terminal ray
of the angle or the ...

00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:24.628
Or I guess we can call it the
terminal ray of the angle.

00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:25.915
The angles form by that ray

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.342
and this ray along the positive x axis.

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:34.713
The tangent of theta is
the slope right over there

00:04:34.713 --> 00:04:39.214
and you can get a tangent of
any theta except for a few.

00:04:39.214 --> 00:04:41.173
You can find the tangent of that,

00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:42.335
you could find the slope there,

00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:43.403
you could find the slope there,

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:45.324
you could also find the slope there,

00:04:45.324 --> 00:04:48.408
you could find the slope there

00:04:48.408 --> 00:04:50.461
but the place where you
can't find the slope

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:55.521
is when this ray goes straight up,

00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:57.778
or this ray goes straight down.

00:04:57.778 --> 00:05:00.244
Those were the cases where
you can't find the slope.

00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:01.917
They are the slope you
could say is approaching

00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:03.968
positive or negative infinity.

00:05:03.968 --> 00:05:10.511
The domain of tangent, so tangent domain

00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:15.685
so the domain is essentially
all real numbers,

00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:26.085
all reals except multiples of pi over …

00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:29.867
I guess you can say pi over
two plus multiples of pi,

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:35.303
except pi over two plus multiples of pi

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:37.020
where k could be any integer

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.442
so you could also be subtracting pi

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:39.971
because if you have pi over two,

00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:41.517
if you add pi, you go straight down here.

00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:42.627
You add another pi you go up there,

00:05:42.627 --> 00:05:44.074
if you subtract pi you go down here,

00:05:44.074 --> 00:05:46.603
add, subtract another
pi you go over there.

00:05:46.603 --> 00:05:48.277
This is the domain

00:05:48.277 --> 00:05:52.714
but given this domain you
can get any real number.

00:05:52.714 --> 00:06:00.119
The range here is all reals

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.647
because you can get any slope here,

00:06:02.647 --> 00:06:05.572
you can increase theta if
you want a really high slope,

00:06:05.572 --> 00:06:07.721
decrease theta if you want
a really negative slope

00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:08.675
right over there.

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:11.204
You can really get to anything.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:16.866
Now when you're taking
about the inverse tangent,

00:06:17.081 --> 00:06:18.742
by convention you're going to …

00:06:18.742 --> 00:06:21.315
Well to make tangent invertible

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:23.169
so that you don't have multiple elements

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.257
of your domain all mapping
to the same element

00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:27.029
of the range because for example,

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:30.980
this angle right over here
has the exact same slope

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.489
as this angle right over here.

00:06:37.073 --> 00:06:40.785
If you have two theta's
mapping to the same tangent

00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:43.213
then that's not, if you
don't restrict your domain

00:06:43.213 --> 00:06:44.561
so that you only have one of them,

00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:46.112
it's not going to be invertible

00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:52.429
so the convention is is that
to make tangent invertible

00:06:52.429 --> 00:07:00.194
you restrict its domain

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:05.237
to the interval from negative pi over two

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:09.877
to pi over two in order to
construct the inverse tangent.

00:07:09.877 --> 00:07:12.397
The inverse tangent, you can input

00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:14.493
any real number into it

00:07:14.493 --> 00:07:16.518
so the inverse tangent's domain,

00:07:16.518 --> 00:07:19.272
this is just the convention.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.910
They could have restricted
tangents domains

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.882
as long as for any theta,
there's only one theta

00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:29.593
in that domain that maps to a
specific element of the range

00:07:29.593 --> 00:07:33.500
but the convention is,
well inverse tangent can …

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.486
The convention is to
restrict tangents domain

00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:38.782
between negative pi over
two and pi over two.

00:07:38.782 --> 00:07:44.329
Inverse tangents domain is all reals

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:46.575
but its range is restricted.

00:07:46.575 --> 00:07:49.311
Its range and this is by convention

00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:52.109
it's going to be between
negative pi over two

00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:56.536
and pi over two and not including them.

00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:59.497
Le'’s go back to our original
question right over here,

00:07:59.497 --> 00:08:02.322
what is the domain of g inverse?

00:08:02.322 --> 00:08:06.522
Let's look at our domain of g inverse,

00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:08.278
well g inverse the domain of this

00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:14.643
I could put any real number in here.

00:08:14.643 --> 00:08:16.472
Now what this is going to pop out

00:08:16.472 --> 00:08:17.849
is going to be something

00:08:17.849 --> 00:08:19.919
between negative pi
over two and pi over two

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:21.917
but they're not asking us
the range of g inverse.

00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:24.274
Actually would have been a
more interesting question.

00:08:24.274 --> 00:08:26.812
They're asking us what's
the domain of g inverse

00:08:26.812 --> 00:08:29.871
and I could put in any real
number right here for x,

00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:32.381
so let's put that in here.

00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:33.982
Domain of g inverse of x,

00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:36.629
it's negative infinity to infinity

00:08:36.629 --> 00:08:37.808
but actually just for fun

00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:39.598
and let's just verify that
we got the question right

00:08:39.598 --> 00:08:40.426
and we did

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:41.525
but just for fun.

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:42.681
Actually I am curious,

00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:45.266
let's think about what
the range of g inverse is.

00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:47.814
The range of this thing right over here

00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:51.431
is going to be between
negative pi over two

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:55.542
to pi over two, that's for
this part right over here

00:08:55.542 --> 00:08:59.105
and then we're going to add
three pi over two's to it.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:02.849
The range for the entire function,

00:09:02.849 --> 00:09:08.654
so the range for this
thing is going to be,

00:09:08.654 --> 00:09:12.218
what the low end if we add
three pi over two to this,

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.683
this is going to give us two pi over two

00:09:14.683 --> 00:09:16.005
which is just going to be,

00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:18.013
so three pi over two minus pi over two

00:09:18.013 --> 00:09:20.604
is going to be two pi
over two which is just pi,

00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:23.555
just pi all the way to three pi over two

00:09:23.555 --> 00:09:26.030
plus another pi over two is
going to be four pi’s over two

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.256
or two pi.

00:09:28.256 --> 00:09:32.306
The range of g inverse
of x is pi to two pi

00:09:32.306 --> 00:09:34.410
and it's an open interval.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.076
Doesn't include the boundaries

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:40.119
but its domain you could
put any value for x here

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:42.351
and it will be defined.
