00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.950
On a first date with someone we like, we really
want – of course – for the evening to

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.009
go well. There are many, varied bits of advice
in circulation: don’t do all the talking;

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.870
be funny and light; ask them about themselves;
don’t pry; select a small, perhaps Italian

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.590
restaurant; leave a generous tip; wear nice
shoes. We’re understandably nervous: we

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.820
are trying to do something which is very strange
and tricky: seduce another person. Not so

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.100
much in the narrow and (potentially sinister)
sense of trying to beguile them into having

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.019
sex with us – but in a larger, more fundamental
way of getting them to like us. A date is,

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.700
in essence, an audition. Much more than we
usually admit, we’re trying to imagine each

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.089
other as prospective long-term partners. Seduction,
in its larger more important sense, means

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.079
gradually persuading someone that we’re
a plausible candidate with whom to be in a

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.890
relationship. The question then is: what are
the things that might properly show us in

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.400
this light? What do we need to do to get them
on board? There are two central priorities.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.210
The first is to show that we have a good relationship
to ourselves. This doesn’t involve saying

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.530
how wonderful we are or what exciting lives
we lead. Our culture hints that it might be

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.160
seductive to say things like ‘I love Paris’s
museums’ or ‘I am excellent at swimming

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.710
in moonlit lakes’. But such statements don’t
really convey that we will be pleasant (or

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.050
even bearable) to live with day-to-day. On
the contrary, what makes us attractive as

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.810
a potential partner is the degree to which
we can recognise our own failings. It’s

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.490
not that we should exhibit our flaws: getting
furious with the waiter, starting to weep

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.850
about an old friend who let us down or going
on throughout the first course about an insult

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.010
at work that happened years ago. This is weakness
unbound, given total victory. What is really

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.690
sweet and charming – that is, powerfully
reassuring – is weakness handled strongly.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.500
For example, it can be hugely seductive to
drop in, with an air of confidence and wit:

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.940
‘You know, coming here made me a bit nervous’.
That’s a sign both of insight and strength.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.700
We’re not simply being nervous (gulping
down a cocktail or frantically insisting that

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.110
the decor is wonderful); we are vulnerable
but have an overview on our anxieties and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.480
the capacity to handle them lightly. It can
be equally seductive to mention, in passing:

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.420
‘As you can imagine, after that, I had a
little temper tantrum with myself’ but in

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.790
a profoundly calm and smiling tone that indicates
both an accurate ability to dislike oneself

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.450
at points and a mature ability to digest and
learn from one’s less impressive moments.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.710
At the heart of seductive self-revelation
is the idea: ‘I’m a touch crazy, of course,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.430
but very much sane enough to tell you about
it in a modest and un-hysterical way.’ We’re

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.651
indicating that we have the best possible
relationship with our own shadow sides. The

00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:14.900
second hugely seductive move is to signal
that we view the other person with a mixture

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.090
of tenderness and realism. It’s often imagined
that it’ll be seductive to convey an air

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.840
of adoration, to hint that the other strikes
us as exceptionally attractive or accomplished.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.690
But surprisingly, it is deeply worrying to
be obviously adored, because everyone, from

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.280
the inside, knows very well that they don’t
deserve intense acclaim, are often disappointing

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.390
and sometimes quite simply pitiful. So seduction
involves suggesting both that one likes the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.710
other person a lot – and yet can see their
frailty quite clearly, that one can cope with

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.180
them and forgive them with gentle indulgence.
One might, towards the end of the evening

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.599
drop in a small warm tease that alludes to
our understanding of some less than perfect

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.819
side of them: ‘I suppose you stayed under
the duvet feeling a bit sorry for yourself

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.270
after that?’ we might ask, with a benign
smile. Such a gesture implies that we like

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.590
another person not under a mistaken notion
that they are flawless but with a full and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.489
unfrightened appreciation of their frailties.
That ends up being powerfully seductive because

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.970
it is, first and foremost, reassuring. It
suggests the ideal way that we would like

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.380
someone to view us within the testing conditions
of a real relationship. We crave not admiration,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.520
but to be properly known and yet still liked
and forgiven. Many things are in the moment

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.160
exciting – but self-knowledge and perceptive
generosity are the most properly seductive

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.241
things in the world; because they are what
make life with another person bearable. They

00:04:53.241 --> 00:04:59.030
are what indicate that we have what it would
take to embark on a long, exciting, beautiful

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.960
and intermittently extremely painful journey
beyond the first date.
