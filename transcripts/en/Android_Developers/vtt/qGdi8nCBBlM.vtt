Hello, my name is Hoi.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.900
And welcome to This Week in
Android Development on Tuesday,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.680
December the 3rd, 2013.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.760
My American colleagues
are taking a week off,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
giving thanks, eating turkey,
and watching football.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.010
In this week's Android
Design in Action,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.120
the usual team and some
very special guests

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.430
speak about their
favorite design flourishes

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.510
in Android apps.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.100
And just in time to get you
all ready for Christmas,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.440
Stephanie Alexander's
expertise is now

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.580
available via the Cook's
Companion Android app.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.080
There has been an interesting
development with Chrome

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.730
and ADB called ChromeADB.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.280
When launched, you can
see all devices connected

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.190
to the machine, install
APK and running processes.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.290
You can easily
clear the cache data

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.300
or uninstall a specific app.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.640
You can even monitor
real-time heap status

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.810
of a specific process, and
this is an open source project.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.129
The first episode of UXD
airs Tuesday with Nazmul,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.220
and the very special
guest, Izabel.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.650
And that's it, This Week
in Android Development.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770
Be sure to check out
this week's show.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.160
I'm Hoi Lam, dashing
through the snow

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.670
in a one-horse open sleigh.
