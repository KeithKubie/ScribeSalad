00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:07.354
Walter, you're up late.

00:00:07.354 --> 00:00:10.260
&gt;&gt; I find my mind is most clear when
the moon is in the eleventh house.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.971
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:12.785
Wait, what?

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:14.400
&gt;&gt; So life update.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.910
I decided that I wanted to
upscale it my current career.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.785
So I signed up for Udacity's fortune
teller and future seer nanodegree.

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:22.026
&gt;&gt; Mm, interesting.

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:25.244
Man, I wish that there was some way
that I could see into the future of

00:00:25.244 --> 00:00:26.272
ShoppingList++.

00:00:26.272 --> 00:00:29.381
With things so up in the air
with the data structure, man,

00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:32.043
a little foresight would
be really helpful.

00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:34.398
&gt;&gt; Here,
why don't you just take this amulet?

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:37.730
It'll light up prophetic
visions of the future beyond.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.080
Just say what you want to see three
times before you go to sleep.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.550
&gt;&gt; Walter, this is amazing.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.145
Can I keep this?

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.650
I'm on to bigger and better things now.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.990
Now I'm going to go turn
Palter into a frog.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.219
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a frog.
