00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.970
PROFESSOR: All right, welcome.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.630
We have some fun origami
topics today, mostly

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.715
related to a topic
called pleat folding.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.249
General idea of pleat
folding is to fold

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.290
alternating mountains and
valleys back and forth.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.260
And you can do a lot of cool
things with pleat folding,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.220
and that's what I want
to talk about today.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.130
In particular, this
model is usually

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.160
called the hyperbolic
paraboloid.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.650
It's pretty simple.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.180
You start with a square paper.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.160
You fold this crease
pattern, which

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.360
is concentric squares
alternating mountain

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.580
and valley, and you
fold the diagonals,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.100
alternating mountain and valley.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.475
You crush it all
together, you'll

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:56.880
get this sort of x-shape.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.460
And you sort of let
go, give it a twist,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.260
and it pops into this
saddle form, which

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.745
looks a lot like a
hyperbolic paraboloid, which

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:12.900
is one of the standard
saddle surfaces.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.860
It's approximating a hyperbolic
paraboloid, we think,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.262
or we thought, and that's
why it's called that.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:21.720
So you should all
try this at home.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.511
It's a great model.

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:23.222
It's very cool.

00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:24.680
It's an example of
something I like

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.890
to call self-folding origami
because the paper basically

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.670
folds itself.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.230
You put in a very simple crease
pattern, concentric squares.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.780
What could be simpler than that?

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.130
And yet you get this really
cool 3D form automatically.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.070
Physics, in some sense, is
finding this form for us.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.480
You can take this
pleating idea and apply it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.980
to many different
crease patterns.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.800
Another fun one if you have
a compass lying around,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.000
to score circles is you just
crease concentric circles,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.627
alternating mountain and valley.

00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:59.210
In this case, you
also need to cut out

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.550
a circular hole in the center.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.170
Then you get a
different saddle form,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.090
which we don't know
exactly what it is.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.730
Let's see, I have some various
fun things to talk about here.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.790
So what's going on with paper--
if I take a piece of paper,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.260
paper is an elastic material.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.660
It remembers that
it was made flat.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.860
It likes to be flat.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.070
If I curl a paper a
little bit, for example,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.890
it flattens back out.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.960
That's elastic memory.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.540
If however, I crease
a piece of paper,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.260
then that's called a
plastic deformation

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.150
beyond the yield
point of the material.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.189
This works in sheet metal
also, lots of materials.

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.230
I've effectively changed
the memory of the paper.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.640
It now wants to stay bent.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.620
If I try to unfold it, it
goes back to some angle.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.430
Depending on how
hard I crease it,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.520
it will go to a sharper angle.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.420
So that's basically
what's going on.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.410
In these surfaces, where
we crease the paper,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.060
it wants to stay bent.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.450
Where we don't crease the
paper, it wants to stay flat.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.830
It can't do all of those
things, but physics

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.190
finds an equilibrium
among all those forces.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.300
So we simulated
that some years ago.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.850
This is with architecture
undergrad Jenna Fizel

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.200
and Professor John
Ochsendorf, architecture.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.040
So on the right of
each of these examples,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.770
we have photographs of real
models, pleated foldings,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.090
a hyperbolic paraboloid,
squares, hexagon,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.170
octagon, just not so pretty.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.120
But we re-created that physical
model with a virtual model

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.750
just using some
spring approximation

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.130
to the forces I described.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.380
And here's an approximation
to a circle, where we just

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.500
took a really big regular n-gon.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.890
This is real circles
and the simulation.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.020
So this confirms that what
I said is actually true.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.080
Those are the only
forces you need to model,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.990
and you get an
approximation of what

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.720
really happens in real life.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.740
So instead of folding
real paper in this way,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.660
you could simulate it.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.180
Cool.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.899
Here is that simulator in
action with pleated hexagons,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.470
just to show you
what it looks like.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.960
So the creases are trying
to become more bent,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.960
at this point have
reached equilibrium,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.350
and you get your 3D form.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.070
Once you have that
3D form, so you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.340
have a virtual model of a
physical piece of paper,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.890
the natural thing to do
is build a physical model

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.070
of the virtual model of the
physical piece of paper.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.290
And you've seen this
on the mailing list.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.420
This is what we're
calling origami skeletons.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.630
Here the vertices, which
you can see bigger here,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.190
are 3D printed plastic spheres,
and there's aluminum rods.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.780
The spheres have holes
at just the right angles

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.570
to make exactly the 3D form
that was made by that simulator.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.980
So this is something you
could really only build

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.410
if you had a virtual
model of that thing.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.382
So this is a fun example
of taking mathematics

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:13.340
and our sort of the
computational understanding

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.840
of how paper folds
and turning it

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.980
into sculpture that requires
that mathematical basis.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.430
On the topic of sculpture,
at the very beginning--

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.250
so this is early on in my PhD,
with my dad and my PhD advisor

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.120
Anna Lubiw, same authors as
like the folding problem,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.570
one of our early explorations on
the mathematical sculpture side

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.510
was to take
hyperbolic paraboloids

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.650
and take a lot of them
and join them together

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.870
to make polyhedral surfaces.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.520
These are what we
call hyperhedra

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.290
because hyperbolic paraboloids
are also called hypars,

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.110
I think, originally by
the architect community.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.150
So these are
algorithmically-generated

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.890
sculpture.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.760
The input to the algorithm is
a polyhedron, like the cube,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.410
and the output is a way
to join hypars together

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.050
to represent that cube.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.660
And the algorithm
is very simple.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.300
For each face of the
polyhedron-- so here it

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.220
has four sides, you take
four hyperbolic paraboloids

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.395
and join them together in a
cycle just sharing one edge.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.380
So you do that for each of
the six faces, so in all

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.840
you have 24 hyperbolic
paraboloids.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.590
Then to join two
faces together, you

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.660
join them along a pair
of edges like this.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.040
And when you do that,
you get an enclosure.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.380
It's a closed solid.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.880
And you can do that
for every-- here

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.670
we're doing it for all
the Platonic solids.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.890
You can do it with any
polyhedron in theory.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.176
So it's like an infinite
family of sculptures here,

00:06:47.176 --> 00:06:48.120
which is kind of fun.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.310
Here is a simulation of
that cube just for fun.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.370
That works, too.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.790
And back to the curve creases.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.660
These are some examples I
showed way back in lecture 1.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.380
These are sculptures in the
permanent collection at MOMA.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.510
And the idea here
is instead of taking

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.600
just one concentric circle
which goes around 360 degrees,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.500
we take a circular ramp
which goes around twice,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.500
and then join the ends.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.050
So we have 720
degrees of material

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.890
there, which you might think
of as negative curvature.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.069
But it's a little
weird because there's

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:29.360
the hole cut out in the center.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.420
So it's a little hard
to measure curvature,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.470
but you can actually define it.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.310
And these are three
different foldings

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.790
with the same idea, slightly
different parameters

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:45.070
in how big those ramps are, and
different numbers of creases.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.800
And you get very different
equilibrium forms.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.520
Again, this all sort
of self-folding paper

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.680
wants to live in these
three configurations.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.890
Here's some that you
may not have seen.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.400
They're on the web.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.720
But these are taking
regular 360-degree circles

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.100
but taking two or
three or four of them

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.680
and joining them at a
couple of key points,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.180
and the rest is self-folding.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:20.070
So the big-- I mean, the sort of
powerful scientific engineering

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.230
idea here is that you
could deploy complicated

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.060
3D structures just
by manufacturing

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.790
very simple flat
structures, maybe

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.550
joining a few points together,
and then just say go.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.500
If you can manufacture
these things

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.850
so that every crease
locally wants to bend,

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.320
then you'll get these
3D forms automatically.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.289
This is especially powerful
at the nano scale, where

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.300
you can't have your fingers
moving around and pressing

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.800
things.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.780
But you can probably
use materials

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.070
that, say, when heated
or you add some chemical,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.510
cause everything to fold.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.430
It's very easy for us from
all the chip fabrication

00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:00.460
we do to manufacture
flat crease patterns,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.250
and that will let us manufacture
3D things at the nano scale.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.110
You could also imagine it a
much larger scale like a space

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.600
station-- like a space
station that looks like that.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.060
That would be pretty
cool-- and something

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.110
where you don't want
to have to physically

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.450
fold everything by hand.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.450
But if it could be
done automatically,

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.490
life would be good.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.929
Now, we don't have
any algorithms

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:23.470
for the reverse
engineering problem--

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.760
If I give you a 3D
curved surface like this,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.460
find the crease pattern and
the joins that make it happen.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.570
But that's the goal.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.320
And towards that goal,
we make sculpture

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.251
to explore the space
of what you can make.

00:09:37.251 --> 00:09:37.750
All right.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:44.530
I think I have one more
sculptural example here,

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:50.240
which is combining these curve
creases with glassblowing.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.120
And to make glassblowing
more tactical,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.802
Marty here, our cameraman,
is blowing glass blindfold.

00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:57.760
Don't try this at home.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.180
So paper folding is a
very tactile experience.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.680
To make glassblowing more about
touching the material, which

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.150
you're not usually supposed
to do because it's over 1,000

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.760
degrees Fahrenheit-- blindfolds.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.180
AUDIENCE: 1,000
degrees Centigrade.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.010
PROFESSOR: 1,000
degrees centigrade.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.020
Wow.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.645
The temperature of
an erupting volcano.

00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:27.978
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:41.816
This is in the glassblowing
studio in 4.003 near here.

00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:43.190
He's made a whole
bunch of those.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.210
And here's what it looks like to
fold from scratch, so to speak,

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.900
a concentric circle model.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.740
Of course, it's
accelerated in movie time.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.600
It only takes 10 seconds.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:11:00.320
In reality, it takes 10 minutes
after pre-scoring, maybe more.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.420
And now we get some
ship-in-the-bottle action.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.704
And this is a lot of fun
for us because not only

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:13.370
do you have the
self-folding constraint,

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.495
but you have this
enclosure constraint.

00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:18.110
These forms would
not look as exciting

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.526
if they could
sprawl out, and they

00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:23.880
didn't have any constraints
to live inside these bubbles.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.270
So you get yet
another collection

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.460
of forms from that glass.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.134
All right.

00:11:32.134 --> 00:11:34.300
I think that's the end of
our little sculpture tour.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.866
We'll come back to sculpture
at the end of this lecture.

00:11:37.866 --> 00:11:39.740
But I want to talk more
about-- oh, question.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.781
AUDIENCE: What was the
idea behind the blindfold?

00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:44.380
PROFESSOR: What was the
idea behind the blindfold?

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.300
So paper folding is all
about touching material.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.070
Glassblowing is
usually very visual.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.400
It's about you look
at the material,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.970
and you don't usually touch it.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.080
So we wanted to unify the two
in order to put them together.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.430
Plus it was just a crazy idea.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.780
I think what happened
is I was in my office.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.620
My dad calls me up.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.411
He's blowing glass.

00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:04.890
He's like, I got
this great idea.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.260
Come over with a camera.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
So in that video, I
was the cameraman.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.904
And I was like,
all right, you want

00:12:11.904 --> 00:12:13.195
to burn yourself blowing glass.

00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:14.528
He didn't actually burn himself.

00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:15.480
Usually, he does.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.938
But blindfold, he
was more careful.

00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:22.760
Yeah, blindfold glassblowing,
it's pretty crazy.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.960
That was his first
try ever blindfold

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.300
glassblowing in that video.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:29.800
All right.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.800
So this hyperbolic
paraboloid, it's

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.982
been around for a long time.

00:12:32.982 --> 00:12:34.190
I didn't mention the history.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.850
It goes back to the
Bauhaus in the late '20s.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.110
Albers, who I'm sure
many of you know of,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.780
taught a class about design.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.630
And he liked using
paper as a material that

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.955
would force you to focus--
not worry about material

00:12:49.955 --> 00:12:53.500
in the sort of architectural
scale and what would stand up--

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.260
and just think about design.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:00.000
And paper folding was really
tactile and good for that.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.880
And I'm not sure exactly
whether it was him

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.930
or a student of his, it's
somebody in that period, 1927,

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.810
'28, came up with this
model and the circular one.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.005
And then it's been taught
many times since then.

00:13:13.005 --> 00:13:19.310
Then it really hit it big in the
origami community in the 1980s

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.760
by [INAUDIBLE], and since then
everybody's been folding it.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.330
Question?

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.654
AUDIENCE: Is it not rigid,
but paper [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:28.654 --> 00:13:29.820
PROFESSOR: Ah, you made one.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.260
Can I show it?

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.480
Thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.850
Simple little example, but
here is concentric squares,

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.490
and you crease it down.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.760
Normally you get this
kind of X. You let go,

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.360
and it pops into
a little saddle.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.300
So this is a sort of
low-resolution one.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.510
If you spend twice
as much time, you

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.190
can double the
resolution and so on.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.860
Your question, is it rigid?

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.730
Probably not rigid.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.310
There's like this
degree of freedom.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.331
AUDIENCE: Rigid in
the sense of that

00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:06.894
between creases [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:07.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.830
What's happening in
between the creases?

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.580
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.913
PROFESSOR: That is exactly
the topic of today's lecture.

00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:16.840
In fact, we have a paper called
"How Does Paper Fold Between

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.790
Creases" to address
exactly this question.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.682
I'm going to hang
onto it, if you

00:14:19.682 --> 00:14:21.910
don't mind because it'll
be useful to point at.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.110
In fact, it is
completely impossible

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.412
to fold that crease
pattern into this shape.

00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:34.540
And so your idea that there's
something weird going on

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.980
is an idea-- we've
known for a long time

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.030
that these faces
could not stay planar.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:44.170
I mean, at least visually it's
hard to see unless you stare

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.680
at it with all the right angles.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.670
But the faces look
like they twist.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.390
Now, that's OK.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.770
Paper can do all sorts of
curving stuff without creasing.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.540
I mean, this is sort of like
a twist, no creases involved.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.520
So we thought this was
possible, but in fact, it's not.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.780
So this is the big surprise.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.460
It's something we
discovered just last year,

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.620
and I'm going to prove
that to you today.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.860
So the theorem is, if I have
this concentric square crease

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.370
pattern, even ignoring
the mountains and valleys,

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.370
it is impossible to
fold that crease pattern

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.430
into anything that is not flat.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.180
So you can, of course,
not fold it at all,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.680
then none of the
creases get folded.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.890
You can collapse it
all the way down.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.610
That probably
isn't even allowed.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.030
But never mind.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.490
But what we really
want is a 3D form

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.840
where every crease is
bent by a non-zero angle

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.500
and also not by 180 degrees.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.810
So we'll call that a
proper folding, something

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.854
where every crease is
strictly between 0 and 180,

00:15:44.854 --> 00:15:46.520
which is what we want
in these 3D forms.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.620
And the theorem is,
that is impossible

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.560
for the hyperbolic paraboloid.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.422
There is none.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.060
So that's weird because
we fold them all the time.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.425
We've been folding
them for like 11 years,

00:16:02.425 --> 00:16:07.210
and other people have been
folding them for 80 years.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.940
What's happening with
the real piece of paper?

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.310
Well, one possible answer
is that there's more creases

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.330
that you don't
see in this model.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.410
And if you add
more creases, it is

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.590
possible to fold
something that looks

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.090
like a hyperbolic paraboloid.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.960
So here we have the regular
crease pattern in black,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.500
and then I've added
some purple diagonals.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.770
Wherever we had a
black trapezoid,

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.910
I've added one purple
diagonal to triangulate

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.000
the crease pattern.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.200
And here I've chosen what
seems to be an especially

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.700
good triangulation
where I zigzag

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:44.240
back and forth
within one quarter.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.600
And then also from around a
ring, I zigzag back and forth.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.370
So that triangulation
folds into this.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.030
That's another theorem.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.350
This is construction on a
computer, obviously, where

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:03.130
we have 16 rings, and
the central crease here

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.980
is folded by an
angle of 30 degrees.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.839
That's the theta.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.880
Notice I also had to
remove part of a diagonal.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.619
That's also necessary.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.170
In the center, you
can't crease both

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:22.490
of those, the folds in an
X, by a non-zero amount.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.490
Those are all things we're
going to prove today.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.871
But before we prove
the negative things,

00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:28.329
I want to prove
the positive thing,

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.920
that this thing can
actually be built.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.320
That may seem obvious
because here it is.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:33.940
I built one.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.280
But because there's all these
arguments of, well, here it

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.010
is, I built one, we've got to
be especially careful about,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.790
does this thing
really truly exist?

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.220
So let me tell you
how it's constructed

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.624
and how we can actually prove
not only can we build it

00:17:49.624 --> 00:17:52.040
approximately on a computer,
but we can prove there really

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.655
is one there even though
we don't have it exactly.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.920
So it's actually pretty
cool and pretty easy.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.355
So this is the triangulated
hyperbolic paraboloid.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.600
So the idea is to work
from the inside out.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.140
We're going to start
with this central square

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:25.810
here-- and let me draw
it over here-- fold it

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.390
by some angle theta.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.072
That, I think, we
all know how to do.

00:18:31.072 --> 00:18:35.200
It's some rotation matrix.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.840
And then I want to
work my way out.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.410
So at this point,
I know the location

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.840
of these four vertices.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.290
In general, I know some
square and everything inside.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:52.510
I want to figure out
everything in the next square.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:58.690
And the creases are going to
look like this, from my zigzag

00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:59.650
pattern.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.935
So there's stuff in
here, which is known.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.665
So I already have figured out
the location of these vertices.

00:19:07.665 --> 00:19:09.900
And I want to know,
how do I figure out

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.330
these vertices on the outside?

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.260
If I can do that, I just repeat,
and I get a bigger and bigger

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.300
hyperbolic paraboloid.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.840
So what I do is pretty easy.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.660
I'm going to look at this
vertex first and say,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.720
well, I have these
three points, and I

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.860
have known distances
between those three points.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.640
I'm going to assume here,
and we'll see why later,

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.250
that each of these
creases remains

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.990
a straight line in
three dimensions.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.700
It's not obvious, because
creases might bend around.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.840
But let's assume
that we were going

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.966
to fold it in a simple way.

00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:48.881
These triangles are going
to remain triangles.

00:19:48.881 --> 00:19:50.370
These edges will
remain straight.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.840
And they have to
remain the same length

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.006
because we're paper folding.

00:19:53.006 --> 00:19:54.480
You can't stretch.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.800
And so I know these
three points in 3D,

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.630
and I know these
three distances, just

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.120
measuring them on the crease
pattern, flat crease pattern.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.750
So this point is on the
intersection of three spheres,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.250
and the centers of the
spheres are not collinear.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.420
This is a trick we used last
class but in two dimensions.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.590
So I have three
non-collinear points.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.450
I have three spheres--
little hard to draw--

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:20.570
centered at them.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.210
The intersection of
two of the spheres

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.990
is going to be a circle,
and the intersection

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:33.040
with the third sphere is going
to be actually two points.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.950
So the intersection of
three spheres is two points.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.330
So a little bit of ambiguity.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.440
But it turns out
one of these points

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.020
will set the mountain-valley
assignment correctly,

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.770
and the other one will
set it incorrectly.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.080
Like if I want this to be
a mountain, one of them

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.260
will be inside and one
of them will be outside.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.760
One of them will
make this mountain,

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.820
one will make it valley.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.930
So it turns out if
you actually do this,

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.620
it's uniquely determined
at every step of the way.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.620
Because you know what
mountain-valley assignment

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.280
you're aiming for, you uniquely
figure out what this point is.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.010
By the same reasoning,
you can figure out

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:08.020
what this point is, intersect
these three spheres.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.710
And then once I know
those two points,

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.376
I can figure out this
point because it's

00:21:11.376 --> 00:21:14.130
the intersection of
these three spheres,

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.070
with now these points are known.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:20.365
And then I can figure out this
point in the symmetric way.

00:21:20.365 --> 00:21:21.250
OK?

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.250
That's how you do it.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.990
We repeat.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.890
And that is exactly how
this model is built.

00:21:29.096 --> 00:21:33.620
Now, this is still not a
proof that it really folds.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.052
It's a construction method.

00:21:35.052 --> 00:21:36.135
I'd say it's an algorithm.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.160
If I start out with
the inner thing here

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.640
and I give you some angle,
I can approximate where

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.030
these vertices are.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.350
And then I can keep going
and, at each step of the way,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.469
approximate where
the vertices are.

00:21:49.469 --> 00:21:52.010
The worry is the approximation
gets worse and worse because I

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.980
have this propagating
error effect.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.020
The larger n is,
the number of rings

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:01.830
in my hyperbolic paraboloid,
the lower the accuracy will be.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.490
But I get to
choose, at each step

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.140
of the way, how
much precision I use

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.790
to compute all of these numbers.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.150
Let me tell you how this
computation actually works.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:14.210
I did this in Mathematica, or
we did this in Mathematica.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.620
Here's Mathematica.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.636
And I asked
Mathematica, well, here

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:20.790
is the equations for the
intersection of three spheres.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.160
I say, well, squared Euclidean
distance between this point

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.724
and some unknown thing x, y,
z is this distance squared.

00:22:26.724 --> 00:22:28.890
And here's the second one,
and here's the third one.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.180
It's kind of tiny.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.340
And then here's the answer.

00:22:36.615 --> 00:22:38.650
It's a little messy.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.780
In fact, you can ask how
many terms are in this thing.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.750
It's 444,000 terms
in the solution.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.025
Don't try this at
home, I guess, by hand.

00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:51.900
Intersection of three
spheres is a bit messy.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.880
There's probably a cleaner way
than what Mathematica does,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.600
but this is an easy
way to get it in.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.640
Now, in theory-- so if you
look at all of this stuff,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.210
all that's happening
is you have all

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:08.920
the various inputs, x1,
y1, x2, z2, and so on.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.152
You have some numbers
like 4 and minus and 2.

00:23:13.152 --> 00:23:14.860
All you're doing is
taking these numbers,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.640
adding them, multiplying them,
dividing them, squaring them,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.210
subtracting them.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.290
And at some point,
taking square roots.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.110
I don't know if
we'll ever see that.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.735
I mean, if we search through,
there are some square roots,

00:23:26.735 --> 00:23:28.735
but they're going to be
in very specific places.

00:23:31.782 --> 00:23:35.140
Yeah, so I probably
won't find one instantly.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.990
Oh, there's one, square root.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.927
So all I'm claiming
at this point

00:23:39.927 --> 00:23:41.760
is you can compute the
intersection of three

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.570
spheres just using basic
arithmetic and square roots.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.745
This is called a
radical expression,

00:23:46.745 --> 00:23:50.670
not because it's so
amazing and controversial.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:54.790
But it's radical because that
symbol is called rad, I guess,

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.960
and radical refers
to square roots.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.160
I guess they were
crazy at the time.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.440
All right.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.160
Actually, I want to
stay with Mathematica.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.770
So that's the idea.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.040
Still not a proof, just
a construction method.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.640
But here's a trick,
which you can

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.580
use to turn a construction
into an actual proof

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.460
that this thing exists.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.240
It's called interval arithmetic,
little computer science lesson.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.640
How many people have heard
of interval arithmetic?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.720
No one-- one person, all right.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.200
Yeah, even computer scientists
probably don't necessarily

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.200
know this unless they've
seen some numerical analysis.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.590
So it's an idea that
instead of computing

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.950
an approximate location
for this point,

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.740
I want to get not only an
approximate location, but also

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.270
an error bound on how
much I don't know it.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.240
So there are three
coordinates to every point.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.240
For each coordinate, every
number I want to represent I'm

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.770
going to represent
as an interval

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.196
from some lower bound
to some upper bound.

00:25:01.196 --> 00:25:03.070
So say, well, I don't
know what the value is,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:08.710
but I know that it is somewhere
in between these two numbers.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.800
So represent every
number like this.

00:25:14.831 --> 00:25:16.580
And then you just need
to define, how do I

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.871
add numbers, subtract them,
multiply them, divide them,

00:25:18.871 --> 00:25:20.460
and take square roots?

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.910
And the answer is carefully.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.980
I'll show you one example.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.150
If I have two numbers,
L1, U1, and L2, U2,

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.450
and I want to add
them together, then I

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.200
believe it's pretty simple.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:40.060
It's just L1 plus
L2, and U1 plus U2.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.440
This is in perfect
mathematical world

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.820
where there's no round off.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.540
In reality, when
you add two numbers,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.067
you lose a bit of precision.

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:49.150
And you make sure that
when you add these numbers,

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.820
you always round down, and
when you add these numbers

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.600
you always round up.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.680
So that way, these intervals,
the accumulation error

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.750
is realized by these
intervals getting wider.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.280
You can start with
them super tiny,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.780
maybe, in fact, 0
length because you

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.430
know exactly where these points
are, so they're 0 intervals.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.150
But then, because of the
error in every operation

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:14.040
you do on the computer,
the intervals will widen.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.040
But as long as you
do this computation

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.820
with enough bits of precision,
they'll widen slowly.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.390
If you do it slowly
enough-- if you do it

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.870
with enough precision, and
the errors accumulate slowly

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:31.070
enough, you can build your
n-ring hyperbolic paraboloid

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.660
without any error, or
without too much error

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.030
to make things go wrong.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:41.840
What could go wrong is that
these three spheres might not

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.960
intersect.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.260
That's really the worry here.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.320
There are two things
that could go wrong.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.986
One is that the spheres
don't intersect.

00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:49.590
The other is that the
surface intersects itself.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.480
Both would be bad.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.270
How do you tell when the
spheres don't intersect?

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.704
Well, we have this formula,
this ginormous formula.

00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:00.120
The only thing
that could go wrong

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.056
is that you take a square
root of a negative number.

00:27:03.056 --> 00:27:04.930
Now, hopefully that
never happens in reality.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.890
But what could
happen for us is we

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:10.110
have such a poor
approximation of our numbers.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.200
And we try to take the
square root of some interval,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.440
and L is less than 0.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.310
Now, probably the actual
number is more than 0,

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.000
but we can't tell,
and we just know

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.708
the number is somewhere
in this interval.

00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:25.060
If the lower bound
is negative, then we

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.260
can't take the square root.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.750
We don't know what the
right answer would be.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.940
So Mathematica conveniently
can do all of this for you.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.360
If you just plug in
intervals instead of numbers,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.610
it will do interval
arithmetic correctly,

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.850
and you can tell it
what precision to do.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.370
And that is how we
found this example.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:51.840
In fact, I will show
you the notebook,

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.500
and there's all this
computation and stuff.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.770
This is all, I believe,
it's in our paper,

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.006
so if you want the code.

00:27:58.006 --> 00:27:59.380
So we compute the
crease patterns

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.450
so I can measure
all the distances.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.580
And there's some collision
detection and stuff

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.270
to make sure
everything's working.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.680
And it computes some rings.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.920
And then, actually, the one I
want to show you is this one.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.420
This is model we've
been looking at,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.216
and here it is in
three dimensions.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.690
The way it's being rendered is
a bit odd, but you get the idea.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.900
That is the hyperbolic
paraboloid we construct.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.120
Now, in reality,
each of these points

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.500
is actually a little interval.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.958
It's hard to draw
that because it's

00:28:26.958 --> 00:28:29.780
smaller than the
resolution of the screen.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.230
I think I compute
up here the-- this

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.670
is like how much we've
messed up the edge lengths.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.170
It's like all of
these 9's, and then

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.692
this little area at the end.

00:28:40.692 --> 00:28:42.850
OK.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:44.210
Cool.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.970
So the point is, you just do
this with enough precision.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.550
As long as you don't
end up computing

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.610
any negative square
roots, you get a surface

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.880
where every point is
actually a little box.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.470
You don't know where the
point is exactly in that box.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.366
Then you check for
collision, just knowing

00:28:57.366 --> 00:28:59.240
that the points are
somewhere in those boxes.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.460
You try to intersect
two triangles.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.300
As long as they intersect away
from the boxes, you're OK.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.350
Then you know there's
no actual intersection.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.540
And we have done that
for this triangulation up

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.540
to-- get it right--
up to n equals

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.400
100, 100 rings, and where
the theta angle here

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:27.970
is any even number between 2
and 178 degrees, so 2 degrees,

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.380
4 degrees, up to 178 degrees.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.982
We're not interested in 180
because that would be flat.

00:29:33.982 --> 00:29:34.940
That's not interesting.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.464
We're not interested in 0.

00:29:36.464 --> 00:29:38.130
Every even number of
degrees in between.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.240
Why even?

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.840
Just because of
the representation.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.090
I'm sure it works for the odd.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.530
In fact, I'm pretty
sure it should

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.790
work for any theta and any n.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.060
But this technique will
only let us to prove it

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.501
for specific theta
and specific n.

00:29:51.501 --> 00:29:53.000
Because we're just
using a computer,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.730
it's only going to
check one example.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.030
We don't have a nice way
to do them all at once.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.590
In case you're
interested-- oh, here I've

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:06.184
built it out of sheet
aluminum, I think?

00:30:06.184 --> 00:30:07.100
AUDIENCE: Galvanized--

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.480
PROFESSOR: Galvanized steel?

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.380
All right.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.780
Water jet cut along the creases.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.180
Now, steel's a little tricky
to not add extra pieces

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.300
by accident, so
there's a few defects.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:21.160
But this is also some kind of
verification that it works.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.750
In the computer here, the
number of digits of precision.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.670
So for whatever
reason, Mathematica

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:29.450
speaks base 10
instead of base 2.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:34.000
Which is weird to me, but maybe
intuitive to everyone else,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.370
non-computer scientist, I guess.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.090
So there's normal sort
of floating points

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.420
like 16 digits of
precision or so.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.380
And there you can build this
thing up to n equals 3, 3

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.680
rings.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.780
But you go up to about
1,000 digits of precision,

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.520
and then we can get beyond 100.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.610
It depends, though, on what
the angle is that you fold.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:56.160
So for angles that are
very big, close to 90,

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.220
we had to go up to 2,000
digits of precision.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.150
And I don't know how
far n can go here.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.760
I think maybe a couple 100,
but I'm not sure exactly.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.340
The larger n is, of course,
the more accumulation you have,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.960
and so you have to
do every operation

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.410
with more digits of precision.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.030
But the conjecture would be,
any specific data and n, there's

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.590
some precision for which
this approach will work,

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.790
but we don't actually
know how to prove that.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.151
All right.

00:31:24.151 --> 00:31:27.380
So that's a triangulated hypar.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.880
Here's another
triangulation, which we also

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.130
studied in this paper, where
instead of zigzagging up

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.130
one quarter of the
square, we just

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.765
do all the diagonals
in the same direction.

00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:44.520
We still zigzag around a
ring but not between rings.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.486
And this can also fold,
as the other model

00:31:47.486 --> 00:31:48.860
that was in the
Mathematica file.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.090
I won't bother going there.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:54.710
This is for a small fold angle
of just 8 degrees in here,

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:55.480
n equals 16.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.480
And there's a reason I
did it for a small angle,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.170
because it doesn't
work for large angles.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.040
So that triangulation we
started with was a good one.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.010
It's actually not the
first one we tried,

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.170
but it is sort of natural.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.210
If you fold by a
very small amount,

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.090
you can get all the
way up to 133 rings,

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:14.560
but then it fails after that.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.910
The spheres just don't
intersect anymore.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.810
Depending on how much you fold,
like if I fold by 22 degrees,

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.590
I can get up to 13 rings.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.510
But here I wanted
to get to 16 rings

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.010
so I only went up to, what was
it, 8 degrees or something.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.360
I could have gotten a
little beyond but not a lot.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.840
And up at 178, you can
still get three rings,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.350
but it doesn't fold after that.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.920
So triangulation matters,
which triangulation you do.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.280
Going back to the
one that works well,

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.910
natural question
is, is it actually

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.040
a hyperbolic paraboloid?

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.540
It's called a hyperbolic
paraboloid because--

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.850
or there is a surface called
a hyperbolic paraboloid, where

00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.280
if you take a cross-section
this way, you get a parabola.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.980
That's the paraboloid part.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.817
And if you take a cross-section
this way, you get a hyperbola.

00:33:04.817 --> 00:33:06.400
That's a little
harder to draw, but it

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.570
goes around here
and around here.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:13.330
Hyperbolas have two
connecting components.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.565
So let's look at the
parabolic part here.

00:33:16.565 --> 00:33:18.690
We're supposed to be
approximating a parabola if we

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:22.280
look at all the points on
the top here and also maybe

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.010
on the bottom.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.290
So that's what I've drawn.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.420
The green lines, which
are very light so a little

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.800
tricky to see, they
zigzag back and forth,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.520
and that is what we compute.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.970
Again, it's approximate, but
it's so close to accurate

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.520
that I just draw them
as single points.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.150
The error is much smaller than
the thickness of these lines.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.550
And then the blue
and purple lines

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.520
here are fits of
the best parabola

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.880
that matches these points.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.319
Actually, it's not
even the best parabola.

00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:53.110
It's kind of funny.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:55.930
I just take the last three
points-- three points

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.210
determine a parabola.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.410
I take the parabola that
fits through those three

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:00.700
points and bam!

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.360
It is almost a perfect fit.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.300
These are the error
charts, I guess.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.450
This is relative errors,
probably the most informative.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:14.000
Or actually, it's the ratio--
it's not really an error--

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.620
the fit value over
the actual value.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.080
So when it's 1, that
means it's perfect.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.520
And yeah, this is at the end
of the chain where I fit it,

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.710
so of course it's going
to be perfect out here.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.580
At the center, at
the very beginning--

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.630
so I'm only looking at one
quarter of this thing-- yeah,

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.210
the error is a little bit.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.989
The ratio is not 1,
but it's 0.9997 or so,

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:42.719
maybe a little bit less, so
that I had to write it down.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:49.260
It's like 0.003% error,
if I got it right,

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.726
maybe just 0.03% error.

00:34:52.726 --> 00:34:54.060
Fix the notes.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.510
Something like that.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.260
It's very small is the point.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.092
But it is non-zero.

00:35:00.092 --> 00:35:01.550
I mean, initially
we thought, well,

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.080
maybe if you increase
the resolution-- you

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.080
make a finer and finer
hyperbolic paraboloid--

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.870
it will more closely approximate
a hyperbolic paraboloid.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.800
That does not seem to
be true because, really,

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.530
making it finer is really
just like making it bigger.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.826
You never really change
the center behavior.

00:35:18.826 --> 00:35:19.700
It's always the same.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.060
And this construction proves it.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.160
We build the center, and we
can go as far out as we want.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.939
It's just changing the
scale of the thing.

00:35:25.939 --> 00:35:27.730
But the center will
always remain the same,

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.750
and it will always
remain off the parabola,

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.250
but super, super close.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.960
Really, it's all right to call
this a hyperbolic paraboloid,

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.520
but you should
triangulate, especially

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.460
if you're making something
out of more rigid material.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.510
Cool.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.630
Let's go on.

00:35:49.335 --> 00:35:50.251
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:51.451
PROFESSOR: Yeah, question.

00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:53.375
AUDIENCE: Do the creases
have to be uniform?

00:35:53.375 --> 00:35:57.230
I mean, could you
tighten up inside?

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.410
PROFESSOR: The creases do
not have to be uniform.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.400
Most of the hyperbolic
paraboloids we've made,

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.520
we do evenly space
all the squares,

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.320
but they don't have to be.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.490
I say that in that we've
made them out of paper,

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:11.160
and they fold to
something, and you

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.190
get other kinds of surfaces.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.550
Probably not going to be a
hyperbolic paraboloid anymore.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.490
I have not done it
with Mathematica

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:22.155
and checked that it really is
possible, but it should be.

00:36:22.155 --> 00:36:24.280
That would be a fun thing
to explore at some point.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.960
Other questions?

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.460
All right.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.090
So this is the end
of the positive news

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.360
for hyperbolic paraboloids.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.720
Now we're going to go
to the negative stuff,

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.300
showing that it is
impossible to fold

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.590
this with this crease pattern.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:45.540
Hyperbolic paraboloids don't
exist without triangulation.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.320
For this we need a
little bit of math tools

00:36:51.320 --> 00:37:05.020
in this paper, "How Paper
Folds Between Creases."

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.120
So in the study
that we just did,

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.000
I assumed that all of the
creases stayed straight.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.430
And therefore that all
of the faces-- therefore?

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.470
Yeah, I guess, because
triangles are rigid.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.905
If I forced the edges of the
triangle to stay straight,

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.280
then the interior
of the triangle

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.990
must stay flat just
to preserve distances.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.560
So I assumed that every face of
the piece of paper stayed flat.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.980
Why did I assume that?

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.110
Because paper, real
paper, does not

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:37.946
have to stay flat in
between the creases.

00:37:37.946 --> 00:37:40.510
This is real stuff here.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:45.730
But paper is constrained on how
it can curve without creases,

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.780
and that is the purpose of this
little mathematical endeavour.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.790
There's some technical stuff,
and I want to get to the meat

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:58.500
as quickly as possible.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.950
But I'll just mention
some assumptions.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.230
We assume that the
thing that we fold,

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.140
the folding of our piece
of paper, is piecewise C2.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.750
C2 means you can
take two derivatives,

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:13.290
and it's still good and
continuous and sort of smooth

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.790
up to the second level.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.580
Piecewise means, of
course, we have creases.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.250
Those are not C2, not even C1.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.820
So we have some crease
pattern on our piece of paper.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.120
It's whatever.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.020
And what we mean is that inside
one of these regions, it's C2.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.860
On the creases, it's nothing.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.450
It's C0.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.460
It's continuous.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:32.790
We don't rip the paper.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:35.330
But we don't necessarily
have derivatives everywhere.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:36.840
So that's the assumption.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.170
Now, one annoying
thing here is you

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:44.460
can have something called
a semi-crease, something

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.770
we call a semi-crease,
which is C1 but not C2.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:50.970
Yeah.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.730
So you have to
divide into pieces,

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.856
but it's not
technically a crease.

00:38:55.856 --> 00:38:58.230
And this is some of the worry
of what might be happening.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.970
Maybe you don't
need creases here,

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.220
you only need semi-creases.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.595
Maybe you only need to violate
the second derivative, not

00:39:03.595 --> 00:39:04.890
the first.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.940
Creases should be violation
of first derivative.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.510
Those are sharp things.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:12.690
Semi-creases are just
kind of little sharp.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:16.310
It's like-- what's a good
example of a semi-sharp thing?

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.730
I guess if I take a
parabola, and then

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:23.194
I take a more shallow
parabola, then at this point

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.610
there's no second derivative
because the first derivatives

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:26.110
don't meet.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.920
This one has a first
derivative of this.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.000
This one has a first
derivative of that.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.910
They're not the same.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.270
Is that true?

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:36.670
Parabolas maybe not.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.780
But you get the idea.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.500
This is a discontinuity
in the second derivative,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.010
not the first.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:42.510
All right.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.300
I'm going to basically
ignore semi-creases here,

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.120
though, because they're
just kind of a technicality.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.286
They don't end up mattering.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.050
So we have piecewise C2.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.820
And we assume that our
surface is intrinsically flat,

00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:02.166
meaning it came from a
piece of paper-- trinsic--

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:07.830
oh, boy, intrinsically flat.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:11.690
Now this is something we
know as curvature zero.

00:40:15.956 --> 00:40:18.330
And I want to tell you a little
bit more about curvature.

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.650
We have defined curvature
in a few different-- well,

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.680
I guess in one
particular way, which

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.030
is you add up the material,
and you take 360 minus that.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.790
So curvature zero
means you have 360

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.765
of material, which is good news.

00:40:34.067 --> 00:40:35.650
But there are other
ways to define it,

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.830
in particular, the
way Gauss defined it.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:40.365
This is usually called
Gaussian curvature

00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:41.880
because he invented it.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.270
Gauss defined curvature
of a 3D surface.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.930
You have some weird
curved 3D thing,

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.720
like this shape,
the orange part.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.580
And there's actually a lot of
natural notions of curvature

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.160
here.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.219
Gaussian curvature
is just one of them.

00:40:59.219 --> 00:41:01.010
So let me tell you a
little bit about that.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.670
We're looking at
this point, and I

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:05.880
want to compute the
curvature of this point.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.000
Well, if I look
in any direction,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.290
like say this red
direction-- so it's

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.660
like I slice this world with
a plane, this blue plane,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.730
I get a nice
one-dimensional curve.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:23.250
Then the curvature is how bent
that curve is at that point.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.820
That's like a
directional curvature.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.880
In this direction, how bent
is-- what does how bent mean?

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.530
It just means you try to
nestle a circle in there,

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.290
in that plane, and you
take 1 over the radius.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.281
That's a curvature.

00:41:35.281 --> 00:41:35.780
OK?

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.350
So if it's flat, the radius
could be infinite, and so

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:39.680
curvature zero.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.630
If it's very sharp, then
the radius is very small.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.760
And so 1 over the radius is
very large, big curvature.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.350
So it's some thing here.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.880
Let's say it's a
positive number.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.260
And then if I take, for example,
this other blue plane, so

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.490
this cross-section,
in that direction

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:57.250
the curvature is
bent the other way.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.555
So you say, well, there
the directional curvature

00:41:59.555 --> 00:42:01.195
is negative.

00:42:01.195 --> 00:42:02.320
It depends which way is up.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.720
One of them is positive,
one of them is negative.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.420
Somewhere in between
it's going to be 0.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.250
But you have all these different
directional curvatures.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.500
The Gaussian curvature,
which is the one

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.930
that we sort of know and love
and have used a lot, mostly

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:24.390
for polyhedra, is the
min directional curvature

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:28.330
times the max
directional curvature.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.110
Now, I really mean min and max.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.250
So the smallest one, in
this case, is negative.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.600
The largest one is positive.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.490
You take the product, and
that's the Gaussian curvature.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.564
It's a weird thing.

00:42:39.564 --> 00:42:40.980
But in particular,
because there's

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.605
a negative one and
a positive one here,

00:42:42.605 --> 00:42:45.200
that means the
product is negative,

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.269
and that's because
this is a saddle.

00:42:47.269 --> 00:42:49.060
Still the case, negative
Gaussian curvature

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:49.920
means saddle.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.590
Positive means a convex cone.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.880
0 means intrinsically flat.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.355
So this is still
the thing we know,

00:42:57.355 --> 00:42:59.230
but this is a weird way
of thinking about it.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.790
This is how Gauss defined it.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.240
And he proved that even
if you fold the surface,

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.160
the Gaussian curvature
never changes.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.560
That is called the
theorema egregium.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.540
Cool name.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.200
So Gaussian curvature
doesn't change under folding.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.000
We start with something
that's flat, zero curvature.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.776
Because if you
take a flat plane,

00:43:20.776 --> 00:43:22.900
you take any directional
curvature, everything's 0.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.560
So it's the product
of min and mix.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.840
They're both 0.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.970
So we start with something zero
curvature, it will remain so.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.940
Now, if I have a
product of two things,

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.260
and I know this is
equal to 0, that

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.955
means one of the two
things is 0, maybe both.

00:43:36.955 --> 00:43:40.610
If it's still a plane,
both of them will be 0.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.200
But one of them
still has to be 0.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.490
What this means is, basically,
locally at any point,

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.980
we have a cylinder, some
kind of generalized cylinder.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.189
But it really only
curves in one direction

00:43:53.189 --> 00:43:55.730
because there's some direction
where it doesn't curve at all.

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.049
Everything's straight.

00:43:58.049 --> 00:43:59.590
In all the other
directions, yeah, it

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:00.990
curves different amounts.

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:04.040
The orthogonal direction will
be where it curves the most.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:09.340
That will be the max, I
guess, and the min will be 0.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.490
So that is what a
folded sheet looks like.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.230
And it's maybe not
so obvious, but when

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.230
I did all this
contorting and what not,

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:21.115
really I was only bending in
one dimension, like a cylinder.

00:44:21.115 --> 00:44:22.740
That's not exactly
a cylinder because I

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:27.880
can change the radius of the
cylinder all over the place,

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.740
but I'm really only
bending in one direction.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:34.550
I was reading on Wikipedia,
this explains how we eat pizza.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.840
Because you take
a piece of pizza,

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.710
which is basically
like a piece of paper,

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.030
and if you bend it a little
bit, like you push in the center

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.382
and push up on the
sides, you give it

00:44:44.382 --> 00:44:45.715
some curvature in one direction.

00:44:45.715 --> 00:44:47.923
And therefore it has to
remain straight in the other,

00:44:47.923 --> 00:44:53.219
so it kind of supports
the piece of pizza.

00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:55.010
Never thought of it
that way, but there you

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.920
go, practical applications
for this stuff.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.070
All right.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:03.280
These things we
call planar points.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.440
If I have a point p and it's
locally flat like a plane,

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.840
call it planar.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.285
These things, for some crazy
reason, we call parabolic.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.100
This is to be consistent
with other notation.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.990
I know it looks-- cylindrical
would be another fine term.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.010
But there's a third
kind called a elliptic,

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.460
which would be like this stuff.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.390
That doesn't happen.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.320
So we just worry about
locally cylinder, which

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.820
we're going to call parabolic
because it's also like locally

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:35.190
a parabola, doesn't
matter, and locally planar.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.670
Those are the two kinds
of points we can have.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:44.020
Now, I'm going to give you some
accelerated facts we're just

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:49.230
going to take as given
from differential geometry.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.150
Well, really, we had
to take some facts that

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.430
were about differential
geometry and sort of port

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.600
them to our context.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.590
They didn't give us
exactly what we wanted.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:00.510
We had to generalize
them a little.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.200
Differential geometry, if you
were at Sunday's lectures,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.090
that was one of the main
tools being used there.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.150
Differential geometry is about
smooth things, like C4 usually.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:13.960
Now, sometimes about C2 things.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.270
It is almost never about
piecewise C2 things.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.334
So you got to worry
about the pieces.

00:46:19.334 --> 00:46:20.750
Now, most the time,
we're thinking

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.300
about one little region
here, and that's nice in C2.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.480
And you can check.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.940
Most of the differential
geometry still applies there.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:29.986
Blah, blah, blah.

00:46:29.986 --> 00:46:31.110
Let me tell you some facts.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:39.170
If I take a smooth point, so
that means not on a crease

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:47.110
and not a semi-crease,
then it lies on something

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:52.790
called a rule segment,
which is a line segment,

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:56.180
also called a rule line.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.740
And the endpoints
of that segment,

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:07.650
here's the interesting part,
are on creases or the boundary.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.430
So we already know
from this picture

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.470
that any point
lies on a segment,

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.440
like an actual 3D
line segment, because

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.470
of this parabolic nature.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.240
What's interesting is that
segment, it can't stop.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.010
Just keeps on going,
like the Energizer bunny,

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.370
until it hits a crease.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:34.980
At that point,
things aren't smooth.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.340
We don't know what happens.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.640
But really, these
creases go straight.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.820
Those are rule lines.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.770
And here, actually, we have
a choice, many different rule

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:44.470
lines.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:48.660
But in the parabolic case,
that rule line is unique.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:54.735
It's going to be unique
for parabolic points.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:08.980
And so we get what's called a
ruled surface, which is just

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:14.900
the union of a whole bunch
of line segments, rule lines,

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.980
around any point.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:30.590
Maybe any smooth
point, just to be safe.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.545
So you may have heard
of ruled surfaces.

00:48:32.545 --> 00:48:33.420
They're quite common.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.460
They're fun because you can
build them out of strings.

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.450
So each string, if you hold
taut, it's a line segment.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.950
Take a whole bunch of them
and just imagine the envelope

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:42.449
there.

00:48:42.449 --> 00:48:44.491
That is a 3D surface, and
that's a ruled surface.

00:48:44.491 --> 00:48:46.240
Now this one does not
have zero curvature.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.850
It has negative
curvature everywhere.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.020
So that can't happen.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.860
This actually can happen.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.240
This is like you take
a helix, and so there's

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.550
a blue curve in
3D, a space curve.

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.619
And then you imagine taking
the tangent at every point.

00:49:01.619 --> 00:49:04.160
So just like if you just went
straight at every point instead

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.050
of turning, then you
get a bunch of lines.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.430
Those are rule lines.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:10.950
And you get this cool surface.

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:13.420
Now, that is a valid
folding of a piece of paper.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.380
Doesn't look like a
cylinder, does it?

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.150
But locally, each of these
lines looks like a cylinder.

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.175
It's just the radius
of the cylinder

00:49:20.175 --> 00:49:24.188
is changing all over the place.

00:49:24.188 --> 00:49:28.070
But that's a valid folding
of a piece of paper, I think.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:31.366
Has zero curvature
everywhere, if I did it right.

00:49:31.366 --> 00:49:36.630
Or I didn't do it, but if
I imagine it correctly.

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:37.130
All right.

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.810
So it's a ruled surface, great.

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:42.680
I mean, I can really create
my whole surface locally

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.229
around a point by a whole
bunch of rule segments.

00:49:46.229 --> 00:49:48.520
They're not all going to be
parallel or anything, which

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.410
is what we imagined
from the cylinder.

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:51.940
They can turn around.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:54.790
But these segments do keep going
until they hit another crease.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.480
Maybe the blue line's a crease.

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.760
And the boundary here could
be the boundary of the paper,

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.255
could be a crease boundary.

00:50:01.255 --> 00:50:03.080
But that's what they look like.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:09.110
Now, it's also what we
call torsal, torsal ruled.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:13.190
Here we get to somewhat
more obscure terminology

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:14.570
but some useful things.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:15.495
It's quite restricted.

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:27.961
I want to have a common
tangent plane throughout a rule

00:50:27.961 --> 00:50:28.460
segment.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:36.620
So if I look at any one
of these rule segments,

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.500
there's one plane,
which is going

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.540
to be like this, that is tangent
to the surface at every point

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.629
along that segment.

00:50:44.629 --> 00:50:46.670
So in general, you might
imagine that the tangent

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.370
plane turns as we go along.

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:52.090
But these segments are kind of--
they're locally cylindrical.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:55.030
So you can really make a
tangent plane all the way along.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:59.640
Whereas here, that's
probably not true.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.219
Imagine the tangent plane
starts-- can you see my hand?

00:51:02.219 --> 00:51:03.760
It starts to bend
like this, and it's

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.880
going to bend around like that.

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.252
It twists along a single line.

00:51:08.252 --> 00:51:09.960
In our case where we
have zero curvature,

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.020
it's actually going
to be torsal ruled,

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.625
meaning the tangent plane
just goes straight along each

00:51:14.625 --> 00:51:15.250
of these lines.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.120
We're going to need this,
that's why I mention it.

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.930
Another fun fact
along the same spirit

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:28.130
is that the points
along a rule line

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.410
are all the same in
terms of whether they

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.270
are planar or parabolic.

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:36.750
So I'll call them uniformly
planar slash parabolic.

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.510
Remember, planar just
means it lies in a plane.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:44.280
Parabolic is the other case.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.356
So here everything's parabolic.

00:51:46.356 --> 00:51:48.355
But you can't like suddenly
switch in the middle

00:51:48.355 --> 00:51:49.420
and become flat.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.234
That's not allowed,
not possible.

00:51:53.234 --> 00:51:54.400
So those are some fun facts.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.650
We're not going to prove them.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.607
If you want to see the proofs,
they're a bit technical.

00:51:58.607 --> 00:52:01.190
You have to read our paper, and
then the differential geometry

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:02.500
books we cite.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.482
But a bunch of these things, you
can understand the proofs just

00:52:06.482 --> 00:52:08.440
assuming a little bit of
differential geometry,

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.270
and it's not too hard.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.394
It's in our paper, but it's
a little bit technical.

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:15.180
So I want to look at the
things that are more related

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.730
to paper folding,
how paper folds.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.480
This is obviously
related, but it's

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.630
like the foundation on which
we build what I care about.

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:27.210
What I care about
most-- all right,

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:30.580
let me tell you a fun fact,
what we're going to prove.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:35.020
We want this nice proper folding
of the hyperbolic paraboloid,

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.140
meaning every crease is bent
by a non-zero angle and not 180

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.990
degrees.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.710
In that situation,
first claim is

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:45.420
every crease remains straight.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:50.590
Second claim is every
face remains rigid,

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:55.260
can't bend anywhere--
every interior face.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.220
These guys on the boundary,
they can do crazy things.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.930
And you see that
in the model, where

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:02.460
the outside gets
kind of all wiggly.

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.867
That's allowed.

00:53:03.867 --> 00:53:05.450
The outside faces,
the ones that share

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:08.650
the boundary with the paper,
can wiggle, can curve.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.130
But everything else
has to remain flat

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:13.520
if there are no
creases in there.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.260
And that's not at all obvious.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.425
So we're going to prove it.

00:53:19.425 --> 00:53:21.389
And I need some water.

00:53:28.737 --> 00:53:29.236
All right.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:39.640
First claim, I'll call it
polygonal implies flat.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.710
So what I mean is, suppose
I have some region of paper.

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:45.660
It's in the middle somewhere.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.680
Let's say it's smooth.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.817
And I look at the
boundary of the region.

00:53:51.817 --> 00:53:53.275
Doesn't actually
have to be smooth.

00:53:53.275 --> 00:53:54.540
It could have semi-creases.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.790
But it has no creases inside.

00:53:56.790 --> 00:54:01.390
Suppose the boundary
in 3D is a polygon,

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:04.964
so it's piecewise straight.

00:54:04.964 --> 00:54:06.880
I don't know how that
corresponds to anything,

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.120
but say the boundary
is straight.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.990
Then the inside must be planar.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:17.760
So if I have a
polygonal boundary,

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.060
then I have a flat
planar inside.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.210
This is assuming no creases.

00:54:31.371 --> 00:54:31.870
OK?

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:36.100
So what that means is that
every point inside this region

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.280
must be planar, not parabolic.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.030
That's what we want to prove.

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:42.110
So let's do a proof
by contradiction,

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:44.290
and suppose that we
have a parabolic point.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:52.710
So we have some point,
and locally it is curved,

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:54.610
and we know there's a
rule line through it.

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:57.640
I know by smoothness,
by continuity,

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:05.830
that if this guy is parabolic,
it's bent, then, in fact,

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:08.650
all the points nearby
should also be bent,

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:12.942
because you can't go instantly
from bent to straight.

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.150
You've got to do that slowly.

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:15.566
So there's some
little region-- we

00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:20.190
call this a neighborhood--
around the point that

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.965
is all parabolic.

00:55:23.752 --> 00:55:25.460
So I'll call this
parabolic neighborhood.

00:55:28.661 --> 00:55:29.160
All right.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.270
All of those points
have unique rule lines.

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:34.100
That's what we've been saying.

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.430
So I take this
little neighborhood,

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.660
and each one of them
defines some rule line.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:43.110
Those rule lines
go all the way out

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:47.860
to the boundary
something like this.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:50.550
Now, this boundary
is the boundary.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.820
That means it's polygonal,
can't be curved like this.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.820
In fact, it looks
something like this.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.130
Maybe this is straight.

00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:59.470
Maybe this has two segments.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.050
We don't know how many segments.

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:03.680
I just want to look at
one of these segments here

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.650
and all the rule lines
coming out of it.

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:08.692
So what I have is I have
the boundary of the paper.

00:56:08.692 --> 00:56:11.330
That's a poor imitation
of a straight line.

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.030
Straight line.

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:14.720
I have some rule
lines coming out.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.412
Now, I don't really know
what they look like.

00:56:17.412 --> 00:56:19.120
I want to understand
what they look like.

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.480
This is in 3D.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.872
Imagine.

00:56:21.872 --> 00:56:24.900
OK, this is straight.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.940
First thing I want to look at
is the normal to the surface.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:33.690
So normal is like
perpendicular to the surface.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:36.940
It's easy to define normals in
the interior of the surface,

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:40.180
but I can actually extend
that out to the boundary.

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:41.970
So I want to look
at a normal here.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.040
Maybe let me put it here,
something like that.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.270
If I took normals really
close to the boundary,

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.150
I just took the limit
out to the boundary,

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:54.316
I'll get some normal vector.

00:56:54.316 --> 00:56:56.265
And by smoothness, that exists.

00:56:56.265 --> 00:57:00.060
Just wave my hands
there, but that's true.

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.810
OK, what's true
about this normal?

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:04.550
Well, it's perpendicular
to the surface.

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:06.310
Now locally, the
surface here, it's

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:10.920
defined by the plane of this
line segment and this line

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.110
segment.

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:15.130
So in fact, it's
perpendicular to the boundary,

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:20.720
and it's perpendicular
here to the rule line.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.470
Buy that?

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:25.565
If I take some other normal,
like this one-- sorry,

00:57:25.565 --> 00:57:29.060
like that, it's also
perpendicular to this,

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:32.060
but it's perpendicular to
some other rule line now.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:35.550
So these guys are
perpendicular to a common line,

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:39.680
but they may not be
the same direction.

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.910
What we do know, though,
is that it's torsal.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.230
There is a single
tangent plane that's

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:48.710
perpendicular to this
entire rule line, which

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:50.530
means the normal is
the thing perpendicular

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:51.700
to that tangent plane.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.840
So in fact, all of the
normals along this line

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.900
are identical, which
is kind of neat.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.880
These guys are all parallel.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.905
Same thing here.

00:58:00.905 --> 00:58:01.655
I won't draw that.

00:58:01.655 --> 00:58:03.900
It's going to get too messy.

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.141
So what?

00:58:05.141 --> 00:58:05.640
All right.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.630
Well, here's a crazy
thing to imagine.

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:12.310
I will look at the
derivative of the normal.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:14.451
So I have this point p.

00:58:14.451 --> 00:58:16.950
Imagine you have a point p, and
it's moving along this curve

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:18.210
continuously.

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:19.060
Sorry-- not curve.

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:20.350
This is a straight line.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:24.950
It's moving along this edge
of the boundary just once.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:26.810
It goes like this.

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:30.600
And I'm going to define n of
p is the normal at that point.

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:34.275
So it starts at something,
and then maybe it's changing.

00:58:34.275 --> 00:58:36.275
I get to this normal,
then I get to this normal,

00:58:36.275 --> 00:58:38.820
and then who knows
what it looks like.

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.347
I want to understand,
can it change at all?

00:58:41.347 --> 00:58:42.930
So to understand its
change, I'm going

00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:45.890
to take the derivative,
n prime of p.

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.870
So this is as p
moves along here,

00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:50.390
how does the normal change?

00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:53.500
I claim, in fact, it
can't change at all.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.780
Why?

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:59.710
Well, the derivative of
the normal, first of all,

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:03.670
must be perpendicular to-- I
haven't given anything a name

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:05.030
here.

00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:08.120
This thing is the boundary edge.

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:15.840
So here's my boundary edge.

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.700
Every single normal here--
I didn't draw the greatest

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.480
picture-- of those have to
be perpendicular to this one

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.110
common edge.

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:24.660
Here's the fact where we use
that this is a straight line.

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:27.770
If it curves, then this
is not a consistent thing.

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:31.590
But because it's straight for
a while, all of these guys

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:33.870
are perpendicular
to the same thing.

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:36.530
All of the ends are
perpendicular to the boundary

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:37.069
edge.

00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:38.860
This is just little
perpendicular notation.

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:45.610
And if all of the n's are
perpendicular to the boundary

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:47.989
edge, the change in n must
also be perpendicular.

00:59:47.989 --> 00:59:49.780
Otherwise, it would
change in such in a way

00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:51.100
it's longer perpendicular.

00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:51.600
OK?

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.675
So that's just
sort of intuitive.

00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:58.800
Great.

00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.510
What else?

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:01.790
I need it to be perpendicular
to something else.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.730
I claim that n
prime of p is also

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:13.950
perpendicular to the rule line.

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:14.780
Ah, yes.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:21.089
Because this normal-- all of
these points along a rule line

01:00:21.089 --> 01:00:22.380
have the same normal direction.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.830
These guys were all parallel.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:28.835
And so if I look
at the change in n,

01:00:28.835 --> 01:00:32.350
in order to make all
these guys be the same,

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:39.180
I also cannot change n in such a
way that it has a non-trivial--

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.942
I'm not going to
say this too well.

01:00:40.942 --> 01:00:44.620
Do you believe it, more or less?

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.800
Let me try to say it once.

01:00:49.384 --> 01:00:51.050
I'm looking at the
change in the normal.

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:53.060
I don't want the normal
to change in such a way

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.850
that it will change
along this axis.

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:58.390
So for that to be true,
the change in the normal

01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:00.155
must be perpendicular
to this direction.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.700
This is kind of weird
because the normal is also

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:08.270
perpendicular to this direction.

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:10.320
I mean, the normal
satisfies the same things.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.986
It's perpendicular
to the boundary edge.

01:01:11.986 --> 01:01:14.190
It's also perpendicular
to the rule line.

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:20.632
That means that n, the
normal, and its derivative,

01:01:20.632 --> 01:01:21.840
they have the same direction.

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.810
That's weird.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:34.460
In fact, it means that
the derivative must be 0.

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.170
Because the normal is
always unit length.

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:38.670
So this would be saying that
the normal is getting bigger

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:40.810
or shorter, but it
can't do either.

01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:43.051
So in fact, normal's
not changing at all.

01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:44.800
So in fact, all of
these guys are parallel

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.940
along the whole segment.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.490
That means this
whole region is flat,

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:53.020
and that's a contradiction.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:53.520
All right?

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.200
So I waved my hands a little
bit, especially on this step,

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.620
but believe me.

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:02.470
All right.

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:05.360
That's one fun fact,
but we want more.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.580
Because how do we know that the
boundary would be polygonal?

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:19.476
For that we need that straight
creases remain straight.

01:02:19.476 --> 01:02:22.075
And something's not true
when you have curve creases.

01:02:25.407 --> 01:02:27.240
Curve creases obviously
don't remain curved.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.031
But curve creases don't
even remain planar.

01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:31.680
I mean, they can
do crazy things.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.850
But straight creases
stay straight.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:48.350
So what I mean is, I have
my flat piece of paper.

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:51.005
I take a straight line
in the piece of paper,

01:02:51.005 --> 01:02:52.970
and I say that's
going to be a crease.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:54.975
It has no first derivative
along the crease.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:02.440
Then when I fold that,
I get a straight line

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:07.460
and some crazy stuff
on the other side,

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.890
but that crease
remains straight.

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:10.005
So I was in the
middle of the paper,

01:03:10.005 --> 01:03:11.420
so it actually looks like this.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.860
Remains a straight segment,
obviously of the same length.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:24.762
But the point is it can't
curl, and it can't even kink.

01:03:24.762 --> 01:03:28.680
Now, just any good theorem
needs a counter-example.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:34.030
So if we take a piece of paper
and we make a straight crease,

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:37.810
look, I can curl that crease.

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:40.230
So this theorem is
not true unless I

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:43.300
say that the crease is proper.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:47.050
So here I had to make the crease
all the way to 180 degrees,

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:48.050
then I can curl it.

01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:51.350
Also, if I don't fold it
at all, then I can curl it.

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:54.700
But if it's folded something
in the middle, I cannot curl.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.170
Paper will not be happy with me.

01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:59.760
I need extra creases
in order to curl.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.325
Well, yeah, it's
just not possible.

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:17.090
So proper crease, which
means the fold angle

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:25.540
is not equal to 0 or
plus or minus 180.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.720
So that's the theorem.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.480
Let's prove it.

01:04:41.049 --> 01:04:42.090
Maybe go a little faster.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.794
All right.

01:04:48.794 --> 01:04:50.710
So we have our crease,
and in three dimensions

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:52.030
it might look curved.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:55.390
We take some point.

01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:57.380
We know that the paper is flat.

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.510
So if you look at the left
side and the right side

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:05.520
of the piece of paper,
locally, at least, it's flat.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.900
And I want to think
of there being

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.470
some tangent plane
on the right side

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:13.370
and some tangent plane
on the left side.

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:14.940
Wow, that's not a good picture.

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.360
Let me draw the planes first.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.230
So here's two planes, and
then here's my point p.

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:24.790
And locally the surface actually
lies in these two planes

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.730
and kinks here.

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:28.490
The surface kinks.

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.300
We want the crease
to be straight here,

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:35.530
but maybe the crease is
bent something like that.

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:36.510
All right.

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:39.520
Here's what we do.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.180
Again, I want to think
of-- in this case,

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.410
I'm going to look at
tangents, not normals.

01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:46.910
So I'm going to say, well,
every point on the curve

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.370
here has some tangent.

01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:51.290
In fact, the tangent
at this point

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:52.837
must lie right along
the intersection

01:05:52.837 --> 01:05:53.670
of these two planes.

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:55.860
I'm going to give
these planes names.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.600
This is p.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.640
This is going to be
tangent plane Tp,

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.600
and this is going to be
other tangent plane Sp,

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.170
so on the left and
the right side.

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:07.846
So the normal at p-- sorry, not
the normal, the tangent at p--

01:06:07.846 --> 01:06:11.512
did I give it a name-- p prime.

01:06:11.512 --> 01:06:12.970
That's what you'd
normally call it.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.950
That's the derivative.

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:20.780
Tangent of p lies
along the intersection

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.680
of those two planes.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.731
We don't really need
that, but it's true.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:25.730
Give you some intuition.

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.120
Now, what I'm
really going to use

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.170
is the second derivative,
little more extreme here.

01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:33.775
Second derivative is
curvature on the curve.

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:44.180
Now, we know that in
the unfolded surface,

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.820
there's exactly 180
degrees of material here.

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.640
Here's some point p.

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.410
We know there's 180
degrees of material.

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:56.220
I mean, locally, everything's
flat in terms of the surface.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:00.530
So here's where I'm going to
wave my hands a little bit.

01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:03.820
I claim that the
curvature vector

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:11.200
must be perpendicular to
Tp and perpendicular to Sp.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.810
Because if I take this
curve, and I project it

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:19.770
into one of these
planes, say Tp,

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:26.060
it should be straight
at p in projection.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:29.511
It also must be straight
when I project into Sp.

01:07:29.511 --> 01:07:31.260
And that actually means
that it's straight

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.944
in three dimensions also.

01:07:32.944 --> 01:07:34.360
So the straightness
and projection

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.166
corresponds to straightness
when flattened basically.

01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:39.930
I'm waving my
hands a little bit.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:43.870
But if I need the
curvature vector

01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:45.480
to be perpendicular
to this plane--

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.220
so it's something like this.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.190
It's coming straight
out of this plane.

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:53.170
But that uniquely
determines its direction.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:55.500
It also needs to be
perpendicular to Sp.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.090
These two vectors can't
be the same thing,

01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:03.890
and yet they have to be, unless
these planes are the same.

01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:06.700
So it could be there's a zero
fold angle, then it's fine.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.460
Or it could be it's
180-degree fold angle,

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:11.442
then again the
planes are the same.

01:08:11.442 --> 01:08:14.180
Can go in one
direction or the other.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:20.040
But if I have a proper crease,
then there's no such vector.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.188
And so we're done.

01:08:21.188 --> 01:08:22.979
That proves straight
creases stay straight.

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:29.290
Cool.

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:33.820
Any questions about that?

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.670
So I'm trying to hit a
middle ground of not too

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:48.850
technical but also
not too shallow.

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:53.020
And so you're left in the middle
state of sort of make sense.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.166
But I did wave my hands,
and it's not super rigorous.

01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:58.040
Because to be rigorous
it would take forever,

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.330
and I need to teach you
differential geometry and so

01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:01.520
on.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.029
But now that we are
armed with these tools--

01:09:04.029 --> 01:09:07.670
straight creases stay straight
and any polygonal boundary

01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:11.120
stays flat, planar--
that tells us

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.370
that if we have
some crease pattern,

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:20.819
any crease pattern made
out of straight edges,

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:24.010
so no curve creases allowed,
if I make straight creases,

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:29.050
every single interior
face must stay rigid

01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:32.510
in any proper folding.

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:33.844
That's pretty cool.

01:09:33.844 --> 01:09:36.260
Because we've talked about
rigid origami and said not much

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:37.468
is known about rigid origami.

01:09:37.468 --> 01:09:38.547
It's tough.

01:09:38.547 --> 01:09:40.880
But in fact, you really need
to understand rigid origami

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.700
if you want to fold something
like a hyperbolic paraboloid.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.500
Now, when you do flat
folding stuff-- well,

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.960
I guess those are
kind of rigid also.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.600
But any kind of
3-dimensional folding,

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.860
where you fold every crease
somewhat but not all the way,

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.942
all the faces need to be
rigid in the final form.

01:09:59.942 --> 01:10:01.900
Now, you could get there
by all sorts of means.

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.620
But we want the
hyperbolic paraboloid

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:07.000
to exist with creases
only along these lines.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.790
And now we know each of these
trapezoids must remain planar.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:14.140
Also, each of these
triangles must remain planar.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.560
Now, now we get to
the contradictions.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.430
If you have this piece
of paper and those

01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:22.560
are your only creases,
you can fold along

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.930
one of the creases or
the other, but not both.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.600
Unless you fold one crease
all the way to 180-- here,

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.180
we can do it.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:35.940
I have one diagonal, and
I have another diagonal.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.720
So everything's
meeting at 180 degrees.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.790
I can fold one and
then the other.

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:42.180
I can fold one, or I
can fold the other.

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.932
But I cannot fold a
little bit of one,

01:10:44.932 --> 01:10:46.390
and then try to
fold the other too.

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:48.710
It's not possible.

01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:52.180
Therefore, this crease
pattern doesn't fold at all.

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:52.680
OK?

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.280
Kind of trivial.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.980
The center is messed up.

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.930
But keep in mind,
again, these faces

01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:00.620
we don't know anything about
because this edge could

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.290
do crazy things.

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:04.250
But the interior faces
of the crease pattern

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:07.240
must all stay flat
and stay exactly

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.730
as they were in the original.

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:11.440
So it's really like we
have rigid panels here

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.590
and hinges between them.

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:15.520
The outside, though, we
have no idea what happens.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.020
OK.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:17.000
So the inside sucks.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.010
So I think, at this point,
we get to this picture.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:21.670
Here's the regular
crease pattern.

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:24.220
So let's just make life
easier and say, well, we'll

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.150
cut out a hole in the center.

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:28.980
That surely-- that
must be better.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.180
But it's no better.

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.890
That thing still
can't fold because you

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:37.830
take any of the rings
that goes around,

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:42.406
like a square annulus--
here's a ring.

01:11:42.406 --> 01:11:44.960
The creases in that ring
are just those four.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.520
So I'm just looking at
these four trapezoids.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.230
Again, each one
must stay planar.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.220
And these are the
only hinges I have.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.217
It's actually really
just like this.

01:11:55.217 --> 01:11:57.300
I've cut a hole in the
center, but it won't really

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.940
matter because the extension
of these lines meet at a point.

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:04.870
So effectively, you are
folding this whole triangle.

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.892
You can fold just the trapezoid.

01:12:06.892 --> 01:12:08.350
But however you
fold the trapezoid,

01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:10.350
you could just extend it
and make the triangle,

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:12.016
and these triangles
will remain meeting.

01:12:12.016 --> 01:12:15.680
So it's actually the same
thing as the center diagram.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.150
Because this doesn't fold,
this also won't fold.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:20.140
It doesn't matter how
many layers you cut out.

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.890
As long as there's one
interior layer that

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:26.530
doesn't touch the boundary,
it's going to be screwed.

01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:28.440
OK.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.390
That is why
hyperbolic paraboloid

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:33.910
doesn't fold without diagonals.

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:37.110
Once you know the creases are
straight, it's kind of obvious.

01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:41.160
But let me give you a
more general picture.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.770
This makes things a little
more interesting and tells you,

01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:45.270
really, all those
straight crease

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:48.180
pleatings that I've shown you,
like hexagons and octagons,

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:52.560
none of them are possible,
which was a surprise.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.790
So here I'm taking concentric
shapes in such a way

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:56.950
that the diagonals
meet at a point.

01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:58.080
I still need that fact.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.581
If they don't, in fact,
it's possible to fold.

01:13:01.581 --> 01:13:03.350
And we have a little
example of that.

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:13.515
OK, now I actually
need two interior rings

01:13:13.515 --> 01:13:16.110
to get a contradiction.

01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:23.900
So I take some ring like
this, and I take another ring,

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.254
and I suppose none of
them touch the boundary.

01:13:26.254 --> 01:13:27.920
As long as I know
there's at least four,

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.325
there's going to be two
consecutive rings like this.

01:13:30.325 --> 01:13:39.480
And the hinges are the diagonals
and the inner ring boundaries.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.360
OK.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:48.460
If I just look locally at
this, I claim it must be

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:52.470
mountain-mountain-mountain-valley
 or the reverse.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:54.810
This is something we would
normally prove by saying,

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.177
OK, this is locally smallest,
therefore these guys

01:13:57.177 --> 01:13:57.760
are different.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.176
And this is also
locally smallest,

01:13:59.176 --> 01:14:01.264
therefore these guys are
different, and so on.

01:14:01.264 --> 01:14:02.930
Except that only works
for flat folding.

01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:04.780
Here I need to prove
it for 3D folding.

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.440
I'm not going to bother,
but you can do it.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.390
So in fact, let's say this is
 mountain-mountain-mountain-valley,

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:13.040
then this must be
mountain, this must,

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.510
all the way around
must be mountain.

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:16.010
OK?

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:17.350
That's not such a big deal.

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:21.090
This must all be valley,
and this must all

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:24.590
be mountain, or
the entire reverse.

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:27.665
But the point is,
all of these guys

01:14:27.665 --> 01:14:32.190
out here must be mountains.

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:34.530
So really if I extend
all of these guys

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:37.120
and they meet at a single
point, if I was lucky,

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.740
that's what I'm supposed to
assume, really what I'm doing

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:44.890
is folding a whole
bunch of triangles

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:47.810
where all of the
creases are mountains.

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:49.400
That's not possible.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.564
So if you didn't
believe this thing,

01:14:52.564 --> 01:14:53.980
it follows from
the same argument.

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:56.535
They can't all be mountains,
and therefore some crease

01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:58.530
is not getting folded.

01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:01.350
So it's the same
argument again, you just

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:03.055
have to be a little
more precise.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.870
And that is not folding
hyperbolic paraboloids

01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:11.120
and things like that.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.390
But if you had
diagonals, it all works.

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:16.240
Now, in the last few minutes, I
want to show you some more fun

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.000
things, in particular, pillows.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.610
Everybody likes pillows.

01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:23.600
But how are they made?

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.840
Well, it's like two
squares of material joined

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:29.875
along the edges, and then
you stuff stuff inside.

01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:32.000
That kind of weird, because
doubly-covered square I

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.230
think of as flat, and yet
you can put material inside.

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:39.540
What is the maximum volume
you can stuff into a pillow?

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.090
This is called the
tea bag problem

01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:44.520
because it also works
for square tea bags.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.320
Open.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:45.960
We don't know.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.890
Lots of practical
explorations, but open.

01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:51.700
Another version of
this is Mylar balloons.

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.740
Mylar balloons can't
stretch, more or less.

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:57.980
And here is two
circles glued together.

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:00.310
Again flat, but you
can pump air into them.

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:03.180
You get this weird behavior,
these ripples on the outside.

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.880
That's real stuff.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.320
But we don't know what the
maximum volume shape is,

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.970
but it should look something
like what we see in reality.

01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:13.920
Let me tell you
some fun theorems.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:20.470
If you take any convex
polyhedron, like say a cube,

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:23.610
you can inflate it and
increase its volume.

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:26.260
Also, I guess, works for
a doubly-covered square.

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.930
This is the tea
bag open problem,

01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:31.260
where these edges are joined.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:32.510
How do you do it?

01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:34.540
I'm going to quote
from the paper--

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.157
"by simultaneously
delivering karate chops

01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:38.490
to the edges of the polyhedron."

01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:39.960
That's in the abstract.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:45.380
So you take an edge like
this-- here's an edge

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:48.846
and the two incident
faces-- and I go like this.

01:16:48.846 --> 01:16:51.070
Wow, that was exciting.

01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:57.250
So what happens when you go like
this-- the whole board shakes,

01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:59.304
I'll probably break
it eventually--

01:16:59.304 --> 01:17:00.470
you get something like that.

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:03.040
So there's a valley
here, and then

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.970
mountains there to
replace this mountain.

01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:09.640
And you can prove, if you do
that with suitable parameters

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.525
here, at every edge
simultaneously you

01:17:11.525 --> 01:17:14.740
increase the volume,
which is pretty neat.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.100
Now, how far can you go?

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.230
What happens when you keep
increasing the volume?

01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:23.475
Is the limit polyhedral, or
is it smooth with ripples?

01:17:23.475 --> 01:17:25.100
Conjecture is it's
smooth with ripples.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.891
In fact, you can prove
it's not polyhedral.

01:17:26.891 --> 01:17:28.810
Because not only for
convex polyhedral,

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:33.800
you take any polyhedron, it
is possible to inflate it

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.150
by at least some volume.

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.860
So the limit has to be curvy.

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:40.714
It's not going to be polyhedral.

01:17:40.714 --> 01:17:42.130
Now, exactly what
it looks like we

01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:46.280
don't know, but lots of
experiments to that effect.

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.690
A big open question in this
field is, does this exist?

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:53.440
We think so.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.250
It seems curve creases--
none of this stuff

01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:56.780
works for curve creases.

01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:58.952
Curve creases seem
a lot more powerful.

01:17:58.952 --> 01:18:00.660
We haven't been able
to prove this exists

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.000
because it seems very flexible.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.500
There's a lot of
degrees of freedom.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.740
It's hard to figure out
where the rule lines are.

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:09.210
But we think so.

01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:10.440
So what about curved creases?

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:11.940
I haven't talked
about curve creases

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.210
really at all
until this lecture.

01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:21.090
I would say the most seminal
work in curve creases

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.160
was done by David Huffman.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.810
Huffman is super famous.

01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:30.370
He was a grad student
and a professor

01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:32.112
here at MIT for many years.

01:18:32.112 --> 01:18:33.820
In particular, when
he was a grad student

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.319
he came up with
these Huffman codes,

01:18:35.319 --> 01:18:38.160
which are used in
every MP3 player.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.460
Every device you use that
uses any kind of compression

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.665
has Huffman codes in it.

01:18:41.665 --> 01:18:43.420
Super cool from the '60s.

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:46.670
But he also did a lot
of curve crease origami,

01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:48.310
curve crease folding.

01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:51.980
And over the last
couple of years,

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:56.690
we've been working with
his family, so his wife

01:18:56.690 --> 01:19:00.160
and two daughters,
Linda and Elise.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.788
And this is me,
that's Marty, and this

01:19:02.788 --> 01:19:04.162
is Duks Koschitz,
who many of you

01:19:04.162 --> 01:19:06.650
know is a PhD student
in architecture.

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:09.660
And we were visiting there
back in May in particular.

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:12.600
And what we're doing is
taking his work, which

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.810
is all in their houses and
almost no one has seen,

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:19.412
and figuring out
how he made them.

01:19:19.412 --> 01:19:20.870
What is the underlying
mathematics?

01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:23.720
What are the crease patterns
that make it possible?

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:26.590
And then recreating them to
check that we did it right.

01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:30.380
So what I have here are just a
few examples of our recreations

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:30.880
so far.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.421
So these are not
the original models,

01:19:32.421 --> 01:19:34.310
but they look just like
the original models,

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:37.339
made out of the same material
and more or less the same way.

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:39.380
Although we do it a little
more high-tech than he

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:45.760
did because we want to draw
perfect computational diagrams

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.762
in CAD, and then
reproduce them exactly

01:19:47.762 --> 01:19:49.470
on the paper with no
reproduction errors.

01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:56.650
So we use fancy
robotically-controlled devices

01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:58.050
to do that.

01:19:58.050 --> 01:20:00.000
So there's some
fun curve creases.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.660
You get some really
nice shadow patterns.

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:07.130
All of those are circular
arcs, all the creases.

01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:08.270
Here are some more.

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:12.140
These are actually parabolic
arcs and some straight creases

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.095
in between.

01:20:13.095 --> 01:20:14.940
Get some cool 3D relief effect.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.690
These are like
tessellations like Tom Hull

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:18.398
was talking about but
with curve creases.

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:24.390
This is pretty awesome.

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:27.860
Here the creases are quite
complicated to figure out.

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:31.130
But what's happening is
you're taking a cone like this

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.930
and pleating it back and forth
but with different angles,

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:36.600
and so the whole thing twists.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.870
We have a physical one
of these in our offices.

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:41.580
But this is the 3D model
of what's going on.

01:20:44.210 --> 01:20:47.050
Here's some particularly
awesome crease patterns.

01:20:47.050 --> 01:20:50.050
David Huffman made a
whole variety of these.

01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:51.950
These are just a
couple of examples.

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.485
Got some crazy circular arcs.

01:20:53.485 --> 01:20:55.530
You've got some-- I
guess these are also

01:20:55.530 --> 01:20:58.020
circular arcs and some
straight segments.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:01.490
And then you wrap this
around to make a cylinder,

01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:04.800
and you get this.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.660
That one-- there's a bunch of
photos of the original David

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:11.750
Huffman model on the web
if you Google around.

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:16.590
Not looking exactly like that,
but there's a whole variety.

01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:18.314
Here's another one,
a bit of a maybe

01:21:18.314 --> 01:21:19.480
surprise what it looks like.

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:22.620
Most of the center just gets
eaten away from these creases.

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:25.020
Here the creases are
elliptical, and you

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.280
get something like that.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.261
So there's some hidden
structure beneath.

01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:32.100
I think just one more example.

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.640
This is probably the
most coolest puzzle.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.720
You say, well, you float along
these parabolas, just one

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.930
valley and one mountain.

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:45.140
But you fold them a
lot, you get that.

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.670
And Huffman composed
these to make

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:50.600
various kinds of tubes
and really cool things.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.826
So this is work in progress.

01:21:51.826 --> 01:21:53.200
Just wanted to
give you a sample.

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.710
There's a paper about this
which shows more examples.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:58.850
But our goal is to recreate
all or most of them

01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:03.140
and document how he
did it and figure out

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.790
how he designed these models.

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:06.789
He had mathematical
tools to do this,

01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:08.580
and we're still figuring
out what they are.

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:13.500
The hope is it will lead to
more great mathematics and art

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.280
about curve creases.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.490
And that is it.

01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:18.270
This is my last lecture.

01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:21.980
Next class we have-- or
next three classes we

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.001
have a whole bunch of
student presentations.

01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:24.500
Please come.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.320
There will be lots of
awesome things there.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.740
Send me your slides
ahead of time,

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.820
and you'll have 10 minutes
to do it, to give a talk.

01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:35.980
And then the last lecture,
Wednesday two weeks from now,

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.720
is Tomohiro Tachi.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.920
And thanks very much.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.830
It's been a lot of
fun doing this class

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:42.121
and having you all as students.

01:22:42.121 --> 01:22:44.920
[APPLAUSE]
