1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,580
The Joe Rogan experience. Do you feel like
that's a part of your motivation? Yes.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,470
It's always been that way,
but you're also,

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:09,400
your motivation is obviously excellent,

4
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:12,540
so there's no way it could just be to
prove someone wrong is hard as you work.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,020
No, but that's just, that's what,

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,280
that's how I got to the
mentality in a work ethic.

7
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,430
I got cause in high school I wasn't
like this. I sucked in high school,

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,600
I love away. I didn't win a match.
I was sophomore in high school.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,220
I'm a residence as third grade. Like I
was asked tastic and it's was horrible.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,330
Like why got be on time? And the
coach left me out. They left,

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:36,200
they load the bus and left me sitting
there because you got beat them.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,030
I beat this. He didn't want to bring
you home or when I got beat too, I got,

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,110
I'll be lost to a girl, Joe. Oh, you lost.

14
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:46,070
So girl deadass I've didn't
have the mental, I load that up.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,950
When I got out off the met team was gone.
When outside the bus was going.

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,480
Only reason I got home because the
Varsity, he came for it, do it at night,

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,560
and it goes like, why are you still
here? Wow. That's fucked up. Yeah,

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,190
that's what really ruthless coach. But
that's the thing I wasn't, I was at boy,

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,950
lady got the little boy that
cried wolf. You know, ever.

20
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:05,280
I was always trying to get
out of workouts. I was fat.
I was lazy at the time.

21
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,610
Growing up, I loved the outdoors. I
love video games and I love eating junk.

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,350
You know,
I didn't always have this mindset.

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,340
So when it came to a point when I
wanted to do good and I was trying,

24
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:14,310
I took my first injury,

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,920
my very first injury sophomore year
in high school before Congress,

26
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:21,000
I snapped my ankle cleanser and I remember
her bike when I was sitting at her

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,670
first time I was actually hurt,
but I had faced so many injuries.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,230
Even a coach came up with
like, Chuck Kip, cool.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,960
Y'All was faking everybody's run sprints.

30
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:31,530
You get up because they all thought I
was faking, but I was actually hurt.

31
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,730
And my buddy stopped by,

32
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,490
he grabbed me and chicken to the
trainer and the trainer's like,

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,000
like I was probably a spring
here, be fine. Once the dog,

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,670
my dad came and got him in winter,
he did an x ray.

35
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:41,520
I'm up there was like this much bone
holding my foot from falling off day.

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,730
Your ankle is dyke. Pretty much
shy. Why didn't nobody bring you in?

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,320
Like you're saying, there was nothing
wrong and I went back to the X. Right.

38
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,940
It was all like, oh bro, I'm so sorry.
Like you haven't been like for so long.

39
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,860
Stop and residents,
third grade,

40
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:55,620
you know I did it because my brother
did and I want to do everything he did,

41
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,290
but I didn't, I didn't have the drive
he had, but after that scene away,

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,650
everybody kind of like dog me out.

43
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,320
I remember coming back from recover from
that and the first time I ran after an

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,180
injury and even in my mind like I
can't run this, I can't you running it.

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,150
And I did and I was limping and I was
scared it was going to break again but I

46
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:14,040
made it to where I was going like rocking
duties. It's just, it's all here now.

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,040
That's my real everything cause mentality.
Like I never had any problems.

48
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,731
I was just lazy.

49
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,640
I didn't want to work because
I was finding a way out
now that the next year you

50
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,261
can ask the coaches.

51
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,640
They told my parents I got moved
up to the varsity tournament.

52
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,230
What the first or second match and I kept
took second and third and the varsity

53
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,080
term after wrestling and Jv for the
year before and I lost it had got at one

54
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,990
thing cause like different between
court now is night and day is because I

55
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,620
realized if I put my mind to it and just
work, quit wearing. My Dad said it's too,

56
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:40,230
that's the thing my dad pushed on.
So you're at such a young age.

57
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,310
My brother got it.

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,170
He was a star athlete but he didn't get
the openings in the opportunities I had,

59
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,540
you know, because he was always
working for my father and working here,

60
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,580
working there. He didn't have the
time to do camps and all that.

61
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,920
Me being the youngest,
it was a little easier for me.

62
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,500
I seen him when he did what he told me.
When my brothers,

63
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:59,440
my sisters and teammates and all the
different people around me had done under

64
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:01,360
the way I need to go to get somewhere.

65
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,410
But being a star athlete as a professional
athlete was never a goal of mine.

66
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:08,800
I wanted to be an engineer. I love
building club houses and Shit like that.

67
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,290
That was what I wanted to do.
Wow. But all that opened doors.

68
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,000
I wanted to go to school to uni.

69
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:16,420
Diversity was constant Platteville for
engineer program, but just like sports,

70
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,020
my grades his ass. I didn't
see, I didn't try on,

71
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:22,060
so I went there to hang out with my
friends and be cool. You know what I mean?

72
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:25,230
When I applied, they messaged
me back saying, your GPA
isn't good enough to rest.

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,700
My coach wanted me there because
by then I was good at wrestling.

74
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:29,830
My last few years I killed it.
I never made the state,

75
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,480
but I killed in the
regional and the sections.

76
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,700
I want all of the sections and
lost in the finals. He had to go,

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,120
you had to win that or third,
whatever. But um, and I said,

78
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:39,810
you can't get here but you got to go
to junior college. You get your GPA up,

79
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,570
we can get you in again. I went there.
I didn't plan on wrestling anymore.

80
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,950
I loved wrestling. I cry when it was
over. But then, um, I Guy Dave Clem, Matt,

81
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,620
he uses old coach. That's how I
met Matt Hughes to Lincoln College.

82
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,690
He reached out to me. I was
like, I heard about you.

83
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,510
You got the mentality of a war.
Like you work hard, your workhorse.

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,580
I need somebody like you to
come here and work for me.

85
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,470
I can't give you a scholarship
because you didn't do much.

86
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:03,160
I don't have money left. I gave
you 1800 bucks, those 27,000.

87
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,860
I thought I was in like a full ride. I'm
like, Oh Sean, get money. And I went,

88
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:08,590
they're excited, determined to get to, and
everybody's like, Oh, you're, you know,

89
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,410
we made a state, you're not going to
do good. This isn't this. So again,

90
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,400
that was motivation for right.

91
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,610
They're going to school like they
don't think I can do this date on.

92
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,720
My grades aren't good enough.
They don't think I can get education.

93
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,030
I'm not good enough for sports.
They don't think I'm all American.

94
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,210
I think I'm gonna go ahead and just be
another member of the team that went

95
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,110
there.
I cut up,

96
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:27,220
but right before the season snapped my
leg in three I thought it was over again

97
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,130
and that coach, like I saw your
fire, different logins at same,

98
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:33,550
the same leg with different injury for
like three years later you're back to the

99
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:36,700
first one. That injuries
would change you. Well,

100
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,290
I got tired of people
thinking I was faking.

101
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,420
So because you were injured for real
in people thought you were faking it,

102
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,710
you realized something was wrong.

103
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,280
I feel that I realized I have been
lazy and my father and my whole life.

104
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,100
You go to my old house right now in
the garage is still carved in there.

105
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,400
I never get, Dale was probably like
eight o'clock nine o'clock school night.

106
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,880
My Dad woke me and my brother to help
him. Do some stuff on a boat. We tired,

107
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,850
you know, we want to go to bed and we
got to complain the whole time. He says,

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,730
my dad, if you met my dad is
the most motivating person ever.

109
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,230
Don't have an education another.
But he,

110
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,470
he started his own business from the
ground up. He's living the dream,

111
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:10,140
hunting properties, whatever
you want, he can do it.

112
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,410
And that's where I got it from.

113
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,500
But it took me forever to realize this
and I'll never forget the day tis it

114
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,650
comes to me all the time.
I think about,

115
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,520
he stood up on the boat and
was up against the garage door,

116
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:21,010
brand new garage door. He just
put a, you know, one thing I hate,

117
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,750
I cannot stand is lazy.

118
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,070
And he took his drill and he cut l a z y
on the back of his brand new garage and

119
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,780
they steal there to this
day I go home and I visit,

120
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,670
I go back here and you'll see it cut in
and do it lazy and he cannot stand it.

121
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,350
And if you know him the way he works,

122
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,190
he's just turned 59 Tuesday and
I can in his voice and I said,

123
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:41,680
you had a job I don't you.
Oh He's, they are working.

124
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,460
He got a bunch of 20 year olds and
30 year he out works everybody.

125
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,990
59 years of up and down a ladder.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,940
Brian and crane driving a truck
to the shot and that's it.

127
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,370
He always said when I was a kid
saying can only last so long.

128
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,190
I never understood what he said.
He's coming to me on the football field.

129
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,110
I'd be crying and moping around. It can
only last so long. Sorry. Keep going.

130
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:00,730
I can only last so long. I said,
I'm like, what do you mean why?

131
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,890
You always say that in a later.
I want to start getting hard.

132
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,110
I started thinking like practice
going and looking at the clock.

133
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,800
It's like 45 minutes but can only
last so long and click like, oh shit.

134
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,590
That's what my dad meant all these years.
It's only the last. I'm just go, just go.

135
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,550
Just put your nose. I get to it. So
you have this injury sophomore year,

136
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,030
your ankle snaps and you realize
you've been lazy. So what,

137
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,020
what's shifted in your mind?
What did, how did you change?

138
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,730
Let me just stop worrying about the
excuses to get out of practice and forgot,

139
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,100
remediate or was it a gradual?
As I was healing, you know,

140
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,830
I was on bedrest for awhile.

141
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,460
He was so bad and people come in and out
and my brother used to come over at a

142
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,400
time he was playing football and
whatever and watching his games.

143
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,310
It's just like sitting there for so long
away from all the sports and all your

144
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:50,630
friends are just sitting
there, just yourself. And I
just realized, like I said,

145
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,780
I've been doing it since third grade.
I've seen this stuff a million times.

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,230
I know the moves, I just don't
apply. I think when I get back,

147
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:01,310
if I actually start trying and drilling
and actually practicing and getting an

148
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:06,260
extra workout in, I could
cut up. That's what happened.

149
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,730
So what was the first step? When I
came back, it was when that first run,

150
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,480
that was really,

151
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,020
my dad's shop is probably 200 yards from
my house and it was raining and that's

152
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,840
all I, that's the reason why
I ran, because I didn't want
to get where I was like,

153
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm going to run to the house.
I'm thinking like, but his leg,

154
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,050
I don't know if I can make it and then
write down that doubt in my mind. Like,

155
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,410
why are you telling yourself
you can't even make it?

156
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,570
How many months out from the differences?

157
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,950
What broke it in what January or December.

158
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,970
And this was summertime. So it was a lot
like I had the cast on for like five,

159
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:39,200
six months. So yeah, now I
went to the airport, it was
like, it was five, six months.

160
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:42,160
It was bad. And then I, right now I've
got the plate and the screws in them,

161
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,200
but I broke some of the screws because
I was like trying to move in a wrestling

162
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:49,670
stance in my boot. And I slipped
my head, um, to tile, oh to submit.

163
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:53,000
And he had a little gloss over it and I
was washing the cars one day and I was

164
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,620
like, oh just go and my
shadows to, I don't know what,
I slipped on a wet spot lit.

165
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,270
I felt it and chew,
it appears that go across,

166
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,960
my ankle has snap so I had to wait for
all that to heal again. Jesus Christ.

167
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,830
It was a whole process. So I
was late snapped ones. The two,

168
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,720
I still got the two long screw that they
take out to leave to seven and go up

169
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,260
the femur or the Tibia. But the too
long was it supposed to pull out.

170
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,620
But the middle when I slipped
they've broken half my bone.

171
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,160
So that made the bone heal slower
cause now just a little spot they drill

172
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,890
through. It opened up like
that much that much more.

173
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:24,320
So you had to wait for all that to
heal before I could actually walk to,

174
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,310
they take the screws out and
putting new ones in there.

175
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,030
So you got broken screws in your,
and if you look at like when I work I,

176
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,180
my barrio ankles fat his head.
That's because the plate,
the plate and the screws,

177
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:36,260
the screws are so long. The
ankle, the swelling, there's
different, exactly. Yeah.

178
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,610
Here's what I'm saying,
which angle?

179
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,260
That's a fat ankle
and that's the normal one.

180
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,020
Pretty fat too. Oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah.

181
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,720
Oh yeah. It does a big difference. Yeah.
So like when I get done training. Yeah.

182
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,930
This one is like this big cause all the
blood and everything swollen around this

183
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:02,490
group. Wow. So does it
fuck with you anymore?

184
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:05,520
Like when it gets cold out or anything?
I feel it like mental,

185
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,730
everything has mentioned to me
now, right. Everything in life,

186
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,580
even though she hates it because I tell
her all the time she had a negative.

187
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:14,490
It's a negative insight on stuff
like finding the positive in it.

188
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,540
Like it's all in your mind,
but you can make the best of anything.

189
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,130
And I'm just like, oh this,
this and this happened.

190
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:24,840
Like are you could be dead or are you
good or worse? Are you going to have legs?

191
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,640
Like she got her car smashed that work.

192
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:30,590
Somebody hit the side of a tour it all up
and had to go on shot. He was like, Hey,

193
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,840
the windows in break does like think
about it drives and you windows ain't Bro.

194
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,470
Like it's the middle of winter. He ain't
gotta be cold. It could attend to her.

195
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:38,920
Yeah.

196
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,380
Like cause I mean a million different
things you can find to be sad but find the

197
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:46,200
good thing is to find the positive.
It's going to get fixed eventually.

198
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,170
So this ankle fucks with you still,
but not enough to stop you.

199
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,660
I'm nothing to stop me.
And you,

200
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,470
what does it affect you at all when you
kick things? Depends. Yeah, they dig in.

201
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,600
Like if I can get,
if they go to do the elbow,

202
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,320
like I go to kick the liver and ain't
got to sit on it and like the elbow kind

203
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:04,170
of cash it, I feel it. But
again, it doesn't stop me

204
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,540
15 minutes.
That's nothing lasts only last so long.

205
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,830
I'm going to bounce this off and keep
going. Yeah. So you get out of the injury,

206
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,780
you have the cast on you
for five or six months,

207
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,500
you realize how blessed you were to be
able to move around and that feeling once

208
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:22,320
you get your, your leg back
under you and start moving again,

209
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,330
what is the changes you make?

210
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,740
How do you start to move your
life in this positive way? Well,

211
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,390
after I made that first
jog and I realize I'm,

212
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,890
I'm good like at first I doubted myself
but I made it because I told myself I

213
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,260
can do it. I made it here.
There's no injuries, I'm fine.

214
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,210
I was just slow and steady,

215
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:42,550
just start hand fighting like good the
little they got to take down dummies,

216
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,050
hang on the wall, let's go there and
move, you know, not another fascist work,

217
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:49,320
hand fighting, just kind of grabbed
her leg, work on my shots in and out,

218
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,530
in and out in the morning before practice
and I used to go watch the guys for

219
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:56,190
off season practice study and
then when I came back it was just,

220
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,040
Oh I have to heavyweight coach.
I coached him, we drove today.

221
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,150
I'm like you guys to meet
Julie. Yeah, coach could see.

222
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,890
I just wanna work with I to do a
little bit extra stuff. After practice.

223
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:05,520
He worked with me,

224
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,290
then the other coach or come work with
me and it got to the point where like in

225
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,800
the morning I was in there before
school and I was there after school for

226
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,050
practice. Now stay after her
coaching drills, different stuff.

227
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,590
They must've been so confused and they
didn't like the coach is night and day

228
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,860
like different drink. Cornell is night
and day. The husband so strange. He goes,

229
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:26,220
this lazy kid and all of a sudden
he becomes a savage. They haven't,

230
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:27,450
when I go back to the
school and I'm visit,

231
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:30,150
they always asked me to come talk to these
people. They call me a success story.

232
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,630
Not only was this, but I grew up in
area where there was no black people.

233
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,930
I was the only black family there.
So we had racism my whole life.

234
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,160
You know what I mean?
Dealing with that.

235
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,960
So that's another man that was the mental,

236
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,710
the mental of the mental fucks of it
all. Like every, no matter what I did,

237
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:44,544
you're going to be wrong.

238
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,880
Like I was another coriander's
in two that was even worse.

239
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,470
And he was actually a troublemaker.
So when he would get in trouble,

240
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,140
they would always come get me out of the
classroom like it was Cory and I will

241
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:56,020
get put on. I ain't even did, I was
a good kid. Never did nothing wrong.

242
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,150
They not an officer principal walking
in like wrong. Like of course the quiz.

243
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,630
Every time I remember Corey,
Richard Anderson, Corey see
Anderson of course. See,

244
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:08,290
see Cory Richard. But they always pulled
me in there and it was just, cause I was,

245
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,190
it was only a few of us in my high school
in the fact that w I never did drugs.

246
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,830
She was like, when we was on
the ring, I said, I don't want,

247
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,700
I want to come in and show and shoot
with you. I don't want to smoke weed.

248
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,070
I never did drugs. I don't do none
of that. I've been a good kid.

249
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,760
But to deal with that stuff,
I used to get pulled over for no reason.

250
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,970
I had a nice truck, STN drops at
ground with rams and speakers.

251
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,940
I used to get pulled over and my friends
get put in cuffs and sit on the curb.

252
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:30,700
Like I searched the car
looking for something when I
went to college is the same

253
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,640
thing. Get pulled over all the
time. And teacher would be like,

254
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,100
every time you late for class, you said
he got pulled off. Like I'll tell them,

255
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:38,930
well on the way here, like I'm serious.
I have classmates that saw them like no,

256
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,650
he's telling the truth. It starts,
we saw them on the side of the road.

257
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,250
Like he always gets pulled over cause
nice vehicle black and they always think

258
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:47,170
of something they know and
that's just where I'm from.

259
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:52,030
So dealing with that and the mentality,
I finally figured out, like I said,

260
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:55,000
that's why when people doubt me,
I think it's trying to prove wrong.

261
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,240
Because I had coaches in high school,
I won't put names on air,

262
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:01,150
but I remember even when I was doing good,

263
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,500
I knew I was doing good because I had
led a team of sex. I didn't start.

264
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,490
You know what I mean?

265
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,900
I lay the the starting lineman out or
beat this guy and this and that and this

266
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:14,260
and that and I never got the
position or something was around it.

267
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,860
And then when I came back after I made
the UFC like, oh, I remember this.

268
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,440
Like I ain't trying to hear that and
I'm only coaching at high school.

269
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:23,560
I will say that that believed in me.
It was a wrestling coach, Marty Kaiser,

270
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,150
Marty Kaiser made everything possible
to make. Let me meet Dave Clem,

271
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,130
who was my junior college
coach who led me to rush.

272
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:33,700
David Rem led me to been asked her who?
Tim fader and everything.

273
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,130
And I've been blessed with the people
in my life that bring me to Frankie and

274
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:39,970
mark and Ricardo and I got
like the ultimate people
around me. Like my mom says,

275
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:42,220
you've always been blessed to
have a good circle of people.

276
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,100
And the one year I had a bad
coach in college, I was like,

277
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,010
my mom said we didn't have so much good.
Don't let this one coach to feature.

278
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,770
Now I'll never forget him. Jason Valley.
I'll put his name on air. That guy that,

279
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,320
that made me the toughest man I
could because no matter what I did,

280
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,450
he wanted to make sure he could
break them. He had control over me.

281
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,800
I was 16 hours away from home in
South Carolina. No family, no money.

282
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,820
He had me on a full ride. He was
just used it. I got you here.

283
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,990
You here because of me. You do this or
I'm gonna cut. You cut meat in. Fuck.

284
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,190
It goes high.
You know what I'm saying?

285
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,790
I go get recruited and he put me back
on the scene. You still need Nli.

286
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,590
You can't do that.
This is necessarily kind of like,

287
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,010
I think that's where I got the mentality
where I want to prove people wrong

288
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:26,011
because I beat the starter and I beat
him bad 13 and one toilet and you're

289
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,970
talking to wrestle. I beating
them, but you still not starting.

290
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:30,730
What the fuck you make him Muslim. Awful.
Like, I didn't beat him every time.

291
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:34,630
When you lost on the first dude a match
by Ryan time, the first week of school,

292
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,240
not beat him every time, but you're
not gonna let me start. Nope.

293
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,570
Cause he pins people and you only
get points kind of like filing.

294
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:45,260
He knocks people out and you only win by
decision. That's kind of like, all right,

295
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,450
so I left, went to Whitewater where
I met Ben and everything else again.

296
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,760
Went there.
They coach knew who I was.

297
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,890
Nobody asked me my worse cause I
didn't get the rest of the year before.

298
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,760
I was a bench warmer. That kid on team
but never wrestled. That's so crazy.

299
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,511
Kill never asked.

300
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,510
My parents would drive 16 hours of watch
me duel and he'd make me sit the bench

301
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:05,270
the whole tournament. It'd be a tournament
here like you're not wrestling today.

302
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,890
My parents would be like,
you're not wrestling. They're
like, my parents drove six.

303
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:11,690
You're not wrestling. I'm like, you
got me eight hours on the school.

304
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,290
My parents drove all that. But what's
this guy's problem? We don't know.

305
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,550
I got teammates now and got us still
fighting everything and they're like, Bro,

306
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,660
you got out of there and like a lot of
guys, he had them, they're academically,

307
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,440
he like we're going to short term short
credits you business and you're going to

308
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:27,740
do half credit but you're
gonna be at a restaurant.

309
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,630
So he was just sitting at
the deck to a lot of dis.

310
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,500
He just wanted to win and that was it.
So like guys are finished,

311
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:36,230
they wrestling career, they didn't have
the credits to graduate like coach,

312
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:39,770
I need help. Like what can I do? You don't
wrestle for me no more. I was like, Bro,

313
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:43,660
I'm only here because of you. But I left.
He Lauer. He kept hitting me up like, oh,

314
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,250
you keep coming back and next year I
let you start next year if you beat him

315
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:49,850
again, fuck can. I was like, exactly.
I said, I want you to Ada office.

316
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:53,750
Told him what was going on. They gave
me my letters trans let me transfer out,

317
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,420
but I couldn't go division two like you
can leave but you can't go division two,

318
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,420
he can't hold you back anymore.
Like that's fine. I'm out.

319
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,050
I left like among the before school
and he showed up at my house one day.

320
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,780
You're like, where are you? I'm
at your house. Like I'm gone bro.

321
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,700
What do you mean I'm going like I'm
done. I'm transferring. Like you can't,

322
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,720
I show him the papers. So how did you
get that? Like I went behind your back.

323
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,830
I got it done. I'm out of there and
uh, Tim fader to coach a whitewater.

324
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,910
I remember we put up at my house.

325
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:19,220
I almost didn't go back to school
cause he kinda got in my head like,

326
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:22,070
I don't want to go nowhere else and waste
my last year of school during the same

327
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:26,630
shit. I can't trust anybody there. I
took what, six the year for an injury,

328
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,140
but I was beating everybody. You
know, I only lost a d one d two guys.

329
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,790
And so it was like,

330
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,460
I don't want to go anywhere else and
somebody's going to screw me over a full

331
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,850
ride. But in this guy pulled up in my
driveway when I was working one day,

332
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,460
he's like, I'm looking for core
Anderson. I've seen him before,

333
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,640
but I didn't really know much about him
and we went to the lunch or whatever.

334
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,290
He was like,
I know your story.

335
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,460
But the thing is I can't give you full
rock cause the d three we can't give

336
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:52,730
money but I want you to rest for me.
This isn't this. And like I said,

337
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:55,730
when I went d three nobody knew who I
was because I didn't get to wrestle,

338
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,140
but he knew like, we're not even
gonna let you wrestle for la.

339
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,620
So I thought right off the get go,
like what are you saying? Shit?

340
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,620
Like what the fuck? Like
no, I think that he said,

341
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,890
I don't want people to know what we got.

342
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,970
We're going to wait till the first home
do and I'm gonna let you loose in the

343
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:09,620
first home dropped to number three,
dude in the country.

344
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,020
And I never forget that week cause
that you really like what you mean.

345
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,670
Like it's the time you get to come out.

346
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,760
Gave him my statement like you ready to
show up? Like you know I'm ready dog,

347
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,210
the number three guy out by
like 12 points and was like,

348
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:23,750
who the fuck is this kid? He
was like, yes, I'm finally home.

349
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,580
And then shortly after I met Russ Davey,

350
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,710
the guy who came from Colorado
who coached in Wisconsin.

351
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,540
He was my heavy weight coach,
Olympic guy. And uh, he brought in,

352
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,630
been asking is how I got into a fight in
the bin. It was just like, like I said,

353
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:37,850
the people around you,
he just Emoji like I'm blessed.

354
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:40,910
I'm saying think about it and it makes
me feel good cause all the things I've

355
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:45,230
been through and everything and it all
worked out. Yeah. Dick coach probably,

356
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,350
it helped. It helped me. It wasn't about,
and my coach told me when I signed,

357
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,850
when I signed like clothes to give me a
four as the one that kept saying to give

358
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:52,830
me a full ride, he kept saying,
Corey, you know about the money.

359
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,320
I guess the most assists any
live is not about the money.

360
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,490
Coach Klimt and Steven Rally and they
both say like it's not about the Money

361
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,550
Corp remembers most decisions,
most important decision of your life.

362
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,300
Don't let the money, few e but that
was, that's what it was for me. I'm a,

363
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,420
you know I went to a school as a walk
on pretty much now I'm getting full ride

364
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,880
offs from everywhere and I'm
going to a number one school,

365
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:15,390
division two and they gave me a full ride.
Like I thought that was something,

366
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,870
when I got there I figured out what he
meant and I'll never forget calling both

367
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:22,020
coasts like you guys are right.
I'm back home now to try for your now.

368
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,990
Well you can go in Ai. I know a few
schools I want you to as good coaches,

369
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:28,860
blah blah blah. And I'm just gonna Chill
and think about it when that goes cane.

370
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,220
And the fact that he came to my house,
reached out to him, he told him,

371
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:35,370
I can't give you money but I
want you for you and as a leader.

372
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,480
And I first got there even though he told
me he wasn't gonna let me arrest him.

373
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,370
He let me run practice for like the
first month because he couldn't teach it

374
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,190
before season. Got these. I want you to
like run practice this, this and this.

375
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,740
Cause you've got that mentality.
You can help these guys show us.

376
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:49,680
You did in d two and number one school.
You can show us stuff here.

377
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,610
And I ended up being the first NCAA all
American or incidentally filings the

378
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:55,440
school had in 22 years.
You know,

379
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:58,800
I lead a team and take downs all the way
up until like the reason the tournament,

380
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,630
my roommate,
when we had a competition going,

381
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,900
I did a lot of things that most
people didn't see heavyweights do.

382
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,110
The way I shot, the way I wrestled
my mentality, I was always working.

383
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,700
I was going to do a straight
the conditioning before
practice and before did

384
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:13,620
more at like six o'clock we asked you in
the conditioner and I've got a class at

385
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:14,970
one and I'd be in the gym lifting.

386
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,660
They're doing circuit training till three
and it went from just me to me and my

387
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,920
teammate or me and my roommate to
other teammates and like you said,

388
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,510
people will see how you're doing it and
they were jumping in and before you know

389
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:29,511
it was like six or seven of us working
out 35 and we just motivating each other

390
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,550
and the bond.
We had her as a team,

391
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,850
like I remember getting
there and everybody was like,
oh what's our goal on the,

392
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,080
I thought about was nationals.
I be like,

393
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:41,100
oh we want to win nationals or win
conference look like why the Fuck Y'all

394
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:43,500
talking about conference? That's like
the first step you got conference,

395
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,970
regionals,
all is national.

396
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,730
What about the big picture like oh well
we would never one conference before.

397
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,990
Like we should still want to get
nationalists and like by Andy Year that

398
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,960
everybody was feeding off each other.
We had,

399
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,790
we had three guys from the same high
school me tonight, 789 or 87 or 84 pounds,

400
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,624
excuse me,

401
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,330
and they called us a high nigga death
row because I was school and like death

402
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:05,790
row sugar night and all that.
So one got prayed up certain,

403
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,010
it was us three and it was like,

404
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:10,890
it was so cool to have three
guys that was on the same school.

405
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,950
We grew up right down the street from
each other, but we all went separate ways.

406
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,610
One way here, one went there, we
ended up in junior college together.

407
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,460
We in the one guy at
in our very last year,

408
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:23,520
we all ended up together as a
team captains, senior years.

409
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:24,870
I last time to do it together,

410
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,640
who we brought like a whole high school
would come to all the matches and as

411
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,640
long as an hour from home. It was
just cool man. And I was, like I said,

412
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:36,660
when I met Ben there and he brought me
to this thing and I didn't want to fight

413
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,360
again. I was, I had a doubt in
my mind. I want to go to that,

414
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,730
but I want to go back to your high,
your high school days.

415
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,010
When you made that big shift,
did you slip at all? Like you,

416
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:49,150
you went from being a guy who was kind
lazy and unmotivated to a guy who is very

417
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,190
disciplined that it
was like night and day,

418
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,400
but was there ever a time where
you fell back to your old ways?

419
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,550
I mean it sounds like it took a lot of
motivation in pep talk to myself to get

420
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:03,790
out and do something every time.
Like I wanted to instead of go work out,

421
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,490
go play video.
So I was big on a dirt bike in a fall or,

422
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,280
and like when I get off the bus, you can
hear the dirt bikes come to my house.

423
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,230
I had the motocross track,
my bag up, me and a neighbor,

424
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,380
he had a freestyle track I dirt bike tray
and I get off the bus and be thinking

425
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,210
like, God, I'm about to go do
my homework. And here you go,

426
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,100
do a little workout lift or something
and you hear him come in and say, oh,

427
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,120
I want to go ride and stay.
I want to go ride.

428
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:24,510
But at the same time like you're arrested,
you're arrested,

429
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,260
forgot to which one is first.
You know,

430
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:29,740
I let the guys go ride in my track
and I do pushups or whatever and do my

431
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:31,870
homework, whatever it was. I
do just a little something.

432
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,330
Long as I get something and I did a
little bit something that's more than the

433
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:35,760
next person. Right. You know,

434
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,210
by the time my senior year came around
and it was kind of like I still wasn't

435
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,950
all in,
but I was a little more,

436
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,630
I didn't get all in until
after that second injury in
college and during college

437
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:50,890
was the same injury, same, less, same
leg, different. What'd you do this time?

438
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,950
I snapped my leg and threw out what
freak accident this til this day I,

439
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,750
I just remember hearing
the wrestling wrestling.

440
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,560
Me and my coach drilling very slow,
very slow June,

441
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:06,040
but we had brand new mats so they was
super sticky and they had brand new

442
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,750
wrestling shoes,
which were super sticky.

443
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,750
And I remember the drill
coach Morgan really high.

444
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,470
So we're going to work to the chain
wrestling. I shoot a single lea.

445
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,310
You get the single back when I shoot
a doe, but you bumped with the hips,

446
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:19,470
you snapped to your shot. He grabbed
a single day. I snapped the foot down.

447
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,330
He shot devil when I hit it with my
hips, I fell backwards in here, pop.

448
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,570
But I didn't feel it and he stood over me.

449
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:28,360
I remember him standing over feet
on both sides like, don't look down.

450
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,500
Don't look down. Now somebody tell you
don't look. You're going. Gonna look,

451
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,240
I looked. Emma was like pointed
like this and it was down. Ah,

452
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,500
I'll turn it over that.
Sorry. Armored called.

453
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:43,040
We got a pool on the other side of the
door and I'm trying to get the doors with

454
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,560
John,
myself and paint out a Pankey.

455
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:47,170
I'll try to get in the pool because
he's trying to get up and DP.

456
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:49,750
I'll try to drive it like it hurt.
Like I was like, I want to die.

457
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,450
I was just going,
I remember him putting me on the,

458
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,950
the city go through your mind when
shock. It was shock. Things that hit you.

459
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,910
You don't think that's a crazy thing. If
you don't want to go drag, it hurts you.

460
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,070
You're on snapchat make
no, no, no. It's one spot.

461
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,530
Three spots. So it's like shooting up your
whole leg to your back. It's like, oh,

462
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,520
we're doing shoulders. The point it's
like I just want just always like,

463
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:14,590
I'm just going to go jump in the water.
First thing my mind goes,

464
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,390
bear called falling water.
Crazy instinct.

465
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,150
I wasn't the most sane kid,
but that was the first thing on my mind.

466
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,150
Go find the water. Just
just ended, you know?

467
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,770
And they flipped me over and I remember
they threw up on a punching bag.

468
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,520
So it has to do with the old injury.
Nothing to do with, oh, it's completely,

469
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,720
totally different. I like four or
five inches up from no injuries.

470
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,050
He just snapped freak acts and
that's what I kept saying, hospice,

471
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:37,960
it's a freak accident.
So what did they do then?

472
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,920
Go to the hospital that day and they
snapped him to got us snatches it back,

473
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,950
pulls her and snatches and lines
all the bones up and they put it,

474
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,310
I will put it in a cast now,

475
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:50,810
but you got to get plates and pins to
set district and that when I was out for,

476
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:55,811
again I was October 27th and I came
back after a lease back January 13th and

477
00:23:58,101 --> 00:24:01,310
14th and I was like a little bit
before regional and we didn't have a

478
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,770
heavyweight all year because I got hurt
and the other guys got kicked out of

479
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:08,300
school, whatever. So three months ish?
Yeah, he'll fat. Well I wasn't back,

480
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:11,360
but I was clear to start drilling. I
remember begging the coach, like coach,

481
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:12,021
just letting me come back.

482
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,580
I can say it was six points because
every time one got on rest of,

483
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:17,390
that's automatic six.
Did they have to put plates in your Shin?

484
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,380
I'm on the side of my leg,
I'll play it.

485
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,370
You can feel it if you
ran your hand up download.

486
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,370
It's like all bent up and from now all
the wars and shit kicks and wrestling.

487
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,180
It's like all wobbly hoes,

488
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,480
all kinds of stuff from getting kicked,
getting kicked in it from wrestling.

489
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:33,530
People do foot sweeps.

490
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,110
You ever get to look at an x ray of it
to see what it looks like and I haven't

491
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:39,530
asked her in forever. I should see
what it looks pretty bad by now.

492
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,190
I remember my first tournament when
somebody flips sweat. Oh my goodness.

493
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:47,870
That feeling like God having an under
hook and he kicked that plate and I just

494
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:49,120
fell like ain't kicking my feet.

495
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,220
I just fail because it's the first
time you feel that pain shoot up.

496
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:54,530
You've never felt it right.
Your nerves run up and down there.

497
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,910
So when it hit and everything just shut
and I fell and he pinned me. I was like,

498
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,500
what's wrong? I'm like, Yo, my leg
gave, I'm still on the mat. Like,

499
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,240
I don't know what the fuck happened there.
Like your nerves and transform.

500
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,230
Like you got nerves on the side of
the leg, you're running the plate.

501
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,770
When he did probably kicked it right and
hit the plate and another thing you had

502
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,840
to get in my mindset like
this is going to happen often.

503
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,210
You just gotta be able to toughen it up
and just go through it. Yeah. You have a,

504
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:20,060
an extra vulnerable spot. Yeah. Yeah. And
have you been low leg kicked there a lot.

505
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,190
Yeah, he did it like four
times. Bought low lucky.

506
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,720
It's just like I said, I got to
the point now I just deal with it.

507
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,100
That was in 2007 this is 2019
as 12 years of dealing with it.

508
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:33,320
You get your point where it's kind of
like, it's not really a pain anymore,

509
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:36,770
it's just a, just a pesky injury. You
feel it. But some of those injuries,

510
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:39,500
they'll go in after it's healed
up and take the plate out.

511
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,750
They say they can do that.

512
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,360
But to do that because I got the broken
pins because those pins are so broke,

513
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,010
they got cut like a whole section on
my leg or hear me and I'd be out of

514
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:52,340
commission for all alone time and
I was like, I'm used to it now.

515
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,490
Is there any benefit if they do that?
I get my whole leg back.

516
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,930
I gave him my leg bag. That's the
only benefit. It's like I said,

517
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:02,510
I said I can train, right? Yeah. Like
this is going to bother. He's like,

518
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,860
I deal with it when I retired we do all
that, but right now there's no problem.

519
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,460
Wow.
So you have this shift in high school,

520
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,990
you you make it to see are and you're
a different person night and day,

521
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:18,920
but you're still not the Corey Anderson
of today. So the second injury,

522
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,820
what is the second injury do for you
when you snapped it in the second injury?

523
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:23,720
That was just,

524
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,670
I mean that just because I
didn't get to show what I can do.

525
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,690
It motivated me that much more than
when I come back, I gotta be undeniable.

526
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,381
I got to show up.

527
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:38,240
I got to do like nobody knows I can do
because I didn't make it to state my

528
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:39,080
senior year in high school.

529
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,440
But then we went to team state and I
pinned the gotta took fourth in state.

530
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,090
So I knew I could do it by
just saying make it there.

531
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,640
So when I got hurt my freshman,
freshman year, I was gone.

532
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,070
That was the year I was gonna show people,
Corey Hanson,

533
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:52,290
which I used to know what you think this,
this and this.

534
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,340
Then I got hurt and they kind of set me
back. You know, is in my mind I was very,

535
00:26:56,341 --> 00:27:00,510
I was sad. Like I remember being
at home, I was emotionally sad,

536
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:02,820
but when I went to go back and
I couldn't focus on wrestling,

537
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,970
I just put my mind on schoolwork and
that's when I figured out I can do

538
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,710
schoolwork. I finished my freshman year
with a 3.25 GPA. After missing like three,

539
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:11,221
four months,

540
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:14,070
I had to make up everything and take
tests and that's not realize like I can do

541
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:17,880
that too. So that was a more thing. I
got the thing I got out of that injury.

542
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,200
Not so much the athletic part.

543
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,540
I was more motivated to
work even harder next year,

544
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:26,010
but I found the fact that I can
do schoolwork if I want to. Again,

545
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,940
it's just a mental thing. I have to
take the time to study. I've never,

546
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,420
I had never studied before
that ever then do any homework.

547
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:36,360
It was I bought somebody his homework or
take somebody knows and try to fill in

548
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:38,670
the answers just to get someone
to say it was a completion credit,

549
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,440
but when I'd had nothing to do, I
couldn't wrestle. I couldn't, you know,

550
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:46,800
I couldn't run, I couldn't
go play basketball in the
back, but everybody else,

551
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:51,450
it was the only back and focus on
our school at the time I came back,

552
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,480
my GPA dropped like two point something
because I hadn't been in class for so

553
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:56,040
long,
so I had to get audited up,

554
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,490
fight it before the end of the year and
finished with a 3.0 at least I finished

555
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:04,470
with a 3.25 for that was my, to
make academic. All American was my,

556
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,860
that was my highlight of my freshman year.
I didn't get the rest of all American,

557
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,960
but I had the academic,
all American,

558
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,730
that's I something I can work
on because as a kid, my parents,

559
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:18,810
my mom and eighth grade bet me $100 I
wouldn't graduate my own mother and she's

560
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:22,800
my mom and my biggest motivation ever
before myself, before my son came here,

561
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,070
my mother was the hand that pushed
me over everything. She's always,

562
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,900
my dad comes with the work ethic.

563
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,590
My mom was always makes sure you do things
right, you can do this, this and this.

564
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,510
I always helped me.
I struggle with reading.

565
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,580
She's helped me learn how to read faster,

566
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,270
read better and do things to the best
of my ability in the academic world

567
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,910
because sports and hard
work is going to beat her.

568
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:46,140
But education something you can always
fall back on. So, but I was just so bad.

569
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,150
I used to and I lived next
door to the middle school.

570
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:49,680
Sounds bad to eighth grade year.

571
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:52,470
They opened a new high or middle
school up the street from my house.

572
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,230
So I would mess up from school and
don't do homework. I don't know why.

573
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,820
I think I would get away with it.
I'm getting out of class.

574
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:59,300
My mom sit in the principal's office
because I've done it for a walk for,

575
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,800
they call it according to do his
homework again cause she was on it.

576
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,230
She would call like of course
it messed up in school. Call me.

577
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,000
She had me in summer camp.

578
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,320
I had to go to summer school one year
when I pass all my classes because she

579
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:14,340
wanted me to get that fat. Like just
cause you pass, they let you pass.

580
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:17,460
I mean you did good, you passed, but you
got to learn how to work. You're going to,

581
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,110
but that was another thing.

582
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:22,050
I didn't have the mentality that my
mom wanted me to have when they come to

583
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,250
working for academics and stuff.
So what made you do that? What?

584
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:28,550
What was the shift that caused that
from the, the injury? This, like I said,

585
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,030
one sick I hadn't asked us to focus on.

586
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,180
It was either that or become a
bum at the school, cinema room,

587
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:34,440
skipping class and fell out.

588
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,050
So I had to get my grades up if I
wanted the rest of the next year.

589
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,720
So it probably been something
that was bothering you already.

590
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,980
It didn't bother me.

591
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,380
I didn't care about my grades because
I was athletic doing athletics. No Way.

592
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:49,570
Oh my. It's kind of like the movies have
you competing and they know you're good.

593
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:53,440
Your assets at team, the teachers help
you. They tried it, they don't give you,

594
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,990
but they'll help you out, take,
you got questions, ask questions.

595
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,130
They won't fail you.
Right.

596
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,680
You know if I bake and do everything
they can to make sure I learn.

597
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,880
So will you realizing because the
injury that may be your athletic career

598
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:05,440
wouldn't be there and you need,

599
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,980
do you need to get this education
because not didn't have the help I had in

600
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:12,430
class when I was athlete. They help you
a little more but not on our wrestling.

601
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,610
It's kind of like must GPA doesn't
matter for a team anymore and I have been

602
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:17,680
missing from school for so long.

603
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:20,380
When I came back it's kind of like
now I've got a lot to make up for.

604
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:22,240
I just got to do it on my own.
I was studying,

605
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,550
that's all I had class
and my dorm room class.

606
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,460
From that point on from
that injury then you,

607
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,950
you get your academic work in order and
you start being disciplined in all our

608
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,120
areas of your life and you feel like
that carried over every is world thing

609
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:41,290
works together. Everything works for
one thing that's come out of that. Okay.

610
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,880
Like first thing we learned orientation.
College coach comes with, we're going to,

611
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,330
my God, we got your athletic scholarship,
but you're here as a student athlete.

612
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,210
And I remember going back and coach at
the same college and him giving the same

613
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:55,510
speech and he write on the board. Student
athlete. We gonna make it in two parts.

614
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:59,580
First part student, second part athlete.
So we don't write it on the board.

615
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,423
What does this mean?

616
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,720
So first priority school
after that next priority,

617
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,080
athletics to me after that you got your
family then is making sure you stay out

618
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,040
of trouble and that the last thing,

619
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,950
the very most important thing and to
come to college is just social life.

620
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,113
The rest of that,

621
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,540
everything else comes first and at the
end then you worry about your friends and

622
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:23,470
trying to be cool and all the extra stuff.
I'm 17 when I went to college,

623
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,860
I graduated high school at 17 so
I'm young. I'm not even an adult,

624
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,310
but in my mind I'm on my own,
I'm doing what I want, blah,
blah, blah. I'm showing,

625
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,170
I'm being asked, you know? Right.

626
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,280
Not like getting in trouble but
not paying attention to school.

627
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:38,610
I'm not worried about Cora in part I'm
just an athlete. Um, they not going to,

628
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:41,710
I ask questions, act like I'm struggling
and they're trying to help me out,

629
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,830
you know. But I know they're not going
to give me an f because um, I'm trying.

630
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,080
I really wasn't.
I'm asking questions.

631
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:49,740
I'm sitting in front of class so you're
not going to give me an f but they going

632
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,710
to make sure I don't, I'm eligible to
wrestle, but I'm not going to fail. Right.

633
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,540
So when you get Andrea,

634
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,550
you realize that ain't there no more
because she ain't got none of the rest

635
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,900
before you all school now.
So now you got you.

636
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,550
You can't say I got practice so I can't,
I can't study.

637
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,700
Was that a big eyeopener for you when
you realized that you can do good at

638
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:10,300
school too? Yes, 100%. Because then
your whole life when you didn't try,

639
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,290
you didn't care and it had that no child
left behind pretty much before they

640
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:16,450
made it official thing.
It was always there.

641
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,720
Cause I know I didn't do enough in school,
but somehow I graduated every year.

642
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,390
Somehow I graduated cause
there's always one teacher,

643
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,250
one person I looked off on me.

644
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,680
I guess I've been blessed to
have that in middle school.

645
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:30,490
Was Ms for met to this day. We still
talk. I go home, we have lunch, breakfast,

646
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:33,970
whatever. Yes. If it wasn't
for, I probably would have
dropped out of high school.

647
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:36,540
That's cool. Yeah. That's very cool. So.
