brain network is the executive attention

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
brain network is the executive attention
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.370
brain network is the executive attention
Network executive attention Network is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
Network executive attention Network is
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.069
Network executive attention Network is
really crucial for working memory such

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
really crucial for working memory such
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.109
really crucial for working memory such
as holding information in your mind in

consciousness and and processing and
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.719
consciousness and and processing and
manipulating it as well as focusing on

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
manipulating it as well as focusing on
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.729
manipulating it as well as focusing on
the outside world it's also important by

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
the outside world it's also important by
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.199
the outside world it's also important by
the way for focusing on your inner world

so you can be am I
daydreamer and when you're a mindful

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
daydreamer and when you're a mindful
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.020
daydreamer and when you're a mindful
daydreamer both of those brain networks

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
daydreamer both of those brain networks
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.440
daydreamer both of those brain networks
actually couple together right because

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
actually couple together right because
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.000
actually couple together right because
you're focusing that limited spotlight

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
you're focusing that limited spotlight
 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.790
you're focusing that limited spotlight
of attention inward on your and so your

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800
of attention inward on your and so your
 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.980
of attention inward on your and so your
daydreams might become more focused when

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990
daydreams might become more focused when
 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.210
daydreams might become more focused when
these two brain networks are

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
these two brain networks are
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.130
these two brain networks are
collaborating with each other so these

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
collaborating with each other so these
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.540
collaborating with each other so these
brain networks are not always at odds

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550
brain networks are not always at odds
 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.310
brain networks are not always at odds
with each other there's a unique state

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320
with each other there's a unique state
 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.960
with each other there's a unique state
of consciousness when both of those

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
of consciousness when both of those
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.810
of consciousness when both of those
networks are on the same level of the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820
networks are on the same level of the
 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.060
networks are on the same level of the
seesaw right and and that seems to be

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070
seesaw right and and that seems to be
 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.540
seesaw right and and that seems to be
creativity really really expert

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550
creativity really really expert
 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.010
creativity really really expert
