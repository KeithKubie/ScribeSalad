00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.930
Here are 10 Secret Disney Origins That They
Kept From Us

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:44.200
Tangled
Disney has brought us some pretty great movies

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.400
in recent years and in 2010 we finally got
to see a good adaptation of the classic fairy

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.680
tale Rapunzel.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.940
The movie introduces some pretty great characters
(both human and not) and also leaves us singing

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.500
their very catchy tunes.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.670
It’s definitely impressive to think that
Disney was able to take such a simple story

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.759
and turn it into a massive feature length
success.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.610
One thing that really added to the movie was
the great leading male character of Flynn

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060
Rider.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.571
Flynn is Rapunzel’s love interest and he
presents a much more complex version of the

00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:19.080
prince who rescues the damsel in distress
in the original story.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.320
In the movie, Flynn looks like your classic
Disney Prince but it turns out his original

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.470
designs were very different.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.170
One early draft of Flynn Rider had him looking
short and plump like Shrek’s Lord Farquaad

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.390
and another version presented a rugged older
looking Prince whose look was actually based

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.840
on Johnny Depp.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.090
Looking back at Flynn Rider’s origins gives
us a fun glimpse into what could have been

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.299
and as it turns out Rapunzel’s original
look was far different as well.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.530
Hang around until the end of the video to
find out what the Tangled Princess almost

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.060
looked like!

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.310
The Beast
Wit the live action adaptation of Beauty and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.360
The Beast hitting theaters, the classic Disney
movie is all over the news these days.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.110
From the looks of things, the film seems to
have done a pretty great job of staying faithful

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.779
to the animated picture.

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:17.510
That being said, there has been a lot of controversy
around the appearance of The Beast as many

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.650
folks were confused about the surprisingly
large size of his horns in the new adaptation.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.349
If this small change shocked fans, we can’t
imagine what they might have thought if Disney

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.670
had decided to go back to their original designs
for the beastly leading man.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.159
By taking a look at the original concept art
for the animated movie you can clearly see

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.219
that The Beast was first designed to look
much more like a Wolf.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.819
This appearance would have definitely made
him look creepier – but it also would have

00:02:43.819 --> 00:03:05.549
taken away his horns so who knows how people
would have felt.

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.340
Genie
If there was a competition of the greatest

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.879
Disney characters of all time we have to think
that The Genie, who was famously voiced by

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:20.129
the late great Robin Williams, would finish
near the top of that list.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.860
Everything that The Genie does is amazing
and he totally steals all of the scenes he

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.860
is in.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.611
As it turns out, Robin Williams actually improvised
a great deal of The Genie’s lines so we

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:33.109
will never really know what the characters
lines were originally supposed to be.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.689
The Genie’s giant blue look is also iconic
but like the other characters on this list

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.059
– he almost looked very different.

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:45.230
Early sketches of the genie had him wearing
clothes similar to Aladdin, having giant horns

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.239
and one drawing had the genie looking absolutely
terrifying.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.700
In the end, Disney totally nailed the look
by creating a magical character that looks

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.659
like a cross between Jay Leno and a giant
blue balloon.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:01.659
&nbsp;

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.529
The Princess and The Frog
In 2009, Disney brought the world the Louisiana

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:10.569
based movie The Princess and The Frog and
also introduced their first ever African American

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.370
Disney Princess, Tiana.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.560
Although Tiana is the only Disney Princess
who actually has a job, she stills looks pretty

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560
young.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.010
That almost wasn’t the case as the originals
designs for the Princess had her look much

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.760
older and with much more sex appeal.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.540
This alternate look definitely would have
made a lot of sense if Beyonce had ended up

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.630
landing the leading role but since the singer
refused to audition for the part, Disney didn’t

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.630
cast her.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.570
In the end the younger appearance of Tiana
matches the voice and the storyline and it

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.570
may have been somewhat confusing to see a
much more sexualized version of the character

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.340
at the center of this fairytale story.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.340
&nbsp;
Pocahontas

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.311
This is one story whose origins we can actually
talk a lot about as Pocahontas is actually

00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:56.060
the only Disney Princess who was a real person.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.110
Unfortunately, her life wasn’t exactly as
the movie showed it – it was much worse.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.290
First of all, she kinda hated John Smith,
who pretty much lied about everything that

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.710
happened between them.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.410
Also, Pocahontas was also kidnapped, held
hostage for a year, renamed Rebecca, paraded

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:20.660
around as propaganda too during the colonization
of North America.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.500
On top of all that, after all of that trauma
Pocahontas actually died at the age then died

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500
at age 21.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.680
We can understand why Disney decided to alter
the story to make it more kid friendly and

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.990
we can also understand why they decided to
alter their original designs for Princess

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.110
Pocahontas.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.180
The first drawings showed Pocahontas looking
much sexier looking Princess that would have

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.390
definitely added an elements of maturity to
the kids movie but in the end Disney went

00:05:43.390 --> 00:06:04.250
with the more PC option and we have to think
it was probably the right call.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.250
&nbsp;

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.400
Aladdin
A common theme on this list is that Disney

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.530
creators seem to often have a tough time deciding
just how old their leading characters are.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.900
This seems to usually be a problem with the
female characters as the studio is likely

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.070
trying to make sure they don’t over sexualize
their Princesses.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:31.780
Interestingly, from taking a look at the original
sketches of Aladdin it seems like the character

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.920
was supposed to be much younger.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.590
This makes the story much more sad when you
realize that it would mean that a very young

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.170
boy is living alone in the streets and having
to steal all of his meals.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.140
Disney has stated that Aladdin was supposed
to be 18 in the movie and we are guessing

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.060
that making him a legal adult was a deliberate
choice to distance the movie from any controversy

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.780
that could have come up with regards to his
age.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.960
Aladdin is one of the many movies slated for
a live action adaptation and we will just

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:07.190
have to wait and see how old an actor they
get to play the lead!

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.380
The Little Mermaid
At this point we don’t know too much about

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.410
the upcoming live action adaptation of The
Little Mermaid, but one thing is for sure

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.920
– they better do a good job bringing the
iconic villain Ursula too life.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.100
The Little Mermaid is a masterpiece and we
have to think that a big reason for it’s

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.830
success is the choice that Disney made to
base the look of their big bad sea monster

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.120
on the famous drag queen Divine.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:36.110
Unfortunately, Divine passed away in the late
80s so she won’t be playing the part but

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.760
it would definitely be cool if another similar
looking Drag Queen ended up in the role.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.330
Interestingly enough, Ursula’s iconic look
from the movie wasn’t Disney’s original

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.400
plans as her original appearance had her looking
first more like a green fish and then in another

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.770
version much more like an evil queen.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.380
The choice to base the villains look on Divine
was definitely a good one as The Little Mermaid

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:05.300
is still on of the most successful animated
Disney movies of all time.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.570
The Lion King
There is no denying that The Lion King is

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.120
one of the best movies that Disney has ever
made – animated or otherwise, and we have

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.380
to hope that the upcoming live action adaption
will live up to the original.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.520
While it has been long believed that The Lion
King was based off of Shakespeare’s Hamlet,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.669
it turns out the story was actually completely
stolen from a Japanese Cartoon.

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:32.399
That’s probably actually a good thing as
Hamlet ends with – spoiler alert – everybody

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:37.029
dying some pretty gruesome deaths.

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:41.120
As it turns out, the original artwork and
designs for The Lion King were quite different

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.699
as well and the first drawings of Simba and
Mufasa presented some much more cartoonish

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:47.209
looking lions.

00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:51.490
In the end, Disney decided to stick with their
classic animation style and created some very

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.670
slick looking jungle cats for people of all
ages to fall in love with.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:03.819
Regardless of how they ended up looking, we
all still would have cried when Mufasa died!

00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:07.059
Elsa
In 2013, people all around the world fell

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:10.860
in love with Frozen and it’s leading lady
– Princess Elsa.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.360
With her power ballad “Let It Go”, Elsa
became a force of empowerment and a role model

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.850
for kids of all ages, but as it turns out
this was almost not the case.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.889
In the original script for Frozen Elsa was
actually the villain but when Disney heard

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:28.249
her iconic song they decided to switch up
the story and make her the hero.

00:09:28.249 --> 00:09:32.470
Villainous Elsa would have looked much different
as well as early drafts of the character actually

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.959
show her to have short black hair instead
of the long blonde braid she is famous for.

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:40.939
It would have been very interesting to see
Elsa on the dark side and maybe we will get

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:46.620
to see this side of her in the long awaited
Frozen sequel that will be coming out in 2018.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:10:02.569
Tangled Pt. 2
Great, you 

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:03.569
stuck around!

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:08.779
Well, now, as promised, it’s time to talk
about Rapunzel’s original appearance in

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:10.290
2010’s Tangled.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:20.329
In the movie the character is undoubtedly
pretty 

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:24.680
but as it turns out the original sketches
presented a much older and sexier version

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.339
of the blonde haired princess.

00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:31.029
Some of the sketches showed Rapunzel wearing
a more revealing dress and all of them actually

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:33.010
gave the princess some freckles.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:37.410
In the end, Disney decided to go with a younger
and more innocent looking protagonist and

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.569
we can’t argue with their decision as the
movie turned out great.

00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:45.999
No word on sequel, but who know, maybe Rapunzel
and Flynn will make a second appearance in

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:47.529
Arendelle in Frozen 2.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:48.529
&nbsp;

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:51.430
And that brings us to the end of our list.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.619
Let’s answer those Trivia questions!

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:58.869
First off Dan Stevens is playing The Beast
in the new live action movie and he looks

00:10:58.869 --> 00:10:59.869
awesome!

00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:02.350
Next, Anna (of Frozen) is the only other Disney
Princess to have multiple love interests and

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.350
they were Hans and Kristoff.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.370
And finally, the youngest Disney Princess
is also the first ever Disney Princess – Snow

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.370
White!

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.370
How old was she supposed to be?

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.370
14, which is pretty young to be out living
in the woods with 7 strange dwarves if you

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.370
ask us.
