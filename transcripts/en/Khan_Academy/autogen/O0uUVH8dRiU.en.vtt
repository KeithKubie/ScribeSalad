00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
 . 

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.300
 Let us resolve some of the issues that concern the agreements 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.990
 Fields and ranges 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.330
 As a simple review, conjugation is a factor - called us 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.860
 Say that this is the f-coupling; it is the most commonly used character 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.309
 In the bindings - Runs a specific portlet, at 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.140
 In this case, the input will be x, and its output is y 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.950
 Or you can consider it as taking the x input, and putting it in 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.740
 The pairing box f, you will manage it 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980
 Gives the output y 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.390
 The set of values ​​we use for x is called a domain 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.320
 A set of values ​​that can be f 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.390
 Called domain 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.110
 And a set of y values ​​that f 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.140
 Its production, called the range 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.080
 Now, using this information, let's find, first 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.440
 The association definitions for each of these issues are these 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.250
 Issues, and then find domains and ranges 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.140
 If we have here: Destin gets $ 10.00 per hour - if they call me 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.870
 Type this at the bottom - $ 10.00 to cut the grass in the hour 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.900
 How much is the total amount that he gets in conjunction with the hours? 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.020
 So let's say that Destin gets on, if pairing, I'll call it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.670
 D ratio to Destin 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.460
 The amount obtained by the Dosten in conjunction with the hours 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.385
 Which depends on the number of hours 

00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:20.440
 The entrance in the box will be 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.950
 Number of hours worked 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.290
 The number of hours will be x 10 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 Ie it will be 10 x - I will not put the multiplication signal here 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.640
 Maybe I can type 10h 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.490
 Of course, it can not work for a few negative hours, if we can 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.210
 Write H to be greater than or equal to 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.890
 This is the definition of pairing that we have 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.740
 If we say, how much will he get for a work interview 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.750
 Half an hour? 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.160
 You will put 1/2 here, replacing this h 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.120
 B 1/2 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.240
 It dissolves 10 x 1/2 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.970
 Let me write this down on this side 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.780
 If Dustin will receive a half hour work fee 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.470
 IE will get 10 - when you see h 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.050
 You replace it with 1/2 - x 1/2, which equals $ 5.00 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.210
 This is the definition of pairing that we have 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.660
 I'd show you an example of how to apply it 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.023
 Now let's find the domain and range 

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:17.980
 Domain and scope 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.480
 I have already said clearly, that you can not 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.500
 Work for a negative number of hours 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.900
 This number, this pairing, will be undefined if it is h 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.380
 Less than 0 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.630
 If we can say non-negative 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.790
 Not negative 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.580
 We can say real numbers, where everything can be 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.700
 It includes pi and e and all this 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.320
 But you can not pay 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.760
 For someone 10 × pi $ 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.760
 The amount is not realistic so you can pay it to someone 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.440
 Because at the end of the day, it will be you 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.050
 Bring the amount closer to the nearest penny 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.370
 So you can not pay that way 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.040
 If any number will be paid 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.010
 Relatively few 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.880
 Which can be written as broken 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.680
 Therefore we can exclude numbers such as e and pi 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440
 If we want to be precise, we can say 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.860
 Non-negative numbers 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.210
 Relative numbers 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.160
 These are the numbers that can be written 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.010
 Break, which is the majority of numbers, does not include 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.040
 The numbers that keep repeating are all this 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.700
 If relative non-negative numbers are what 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.890
 He can enter it here 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.060
 Then the range, which is - once again 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.750
 Any number we put instead of h, remember, you can just put 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.350
 Non-negative values ​​for h, relative non-negative values 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.310
 For h, if whatever number we put instead of h, you will 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.530
 We get positive values ​​that show how much you get in 10h 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.880
 For pairing values 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.090
 If again it will be non-negative, if placed 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.700
 A relative number here and written in a broken way 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.130
 I beat him by 10, he'll stay 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.380
 Relative number 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.030
 Non-negative relative number 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.840
 If you want to be accurate, you can tell any number 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.860
 Can be expressed as an amount 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.730
 But anyway, I do not want to be too precise on this issue 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.960
 I think you got the idea 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.660
 Let us solve more 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.649
 Issues. this is good 

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.100
 Here we are: Maria gives private lessons 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.410
 You get $ 25.00 per hour tutoring in mathematics so that 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.740
 The minimum amount you receive is $ 15.00 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.010
 If the amount you get Maria can be expressed in conjunction with the number of hours 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.710
 If it gets $ 15.00 if it does not get 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.650
 Hours are sufficient 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.510
 If $ 25.00 per hour, in order to get you $ 15.00, you'll 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.980
 It works by 15/25, ie 3/5 per hour 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.100
 If its total hours are less than 3/5 and more than or equal to 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.270
 0, you will get $ 15.00 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.490
 Because if you worked only 1/5 hours, the price 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.150
 It will be $ 5.00, but it says it has 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.120
 Minimum of what you earn is $ 15.00 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.390
 If you get $ 15.00 up to 3/5 per 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.110
 Hour, or 36 minutes 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.365
 And then after that, when h is larger than 3/5 

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.400
 You will receive $ 25.00 per hour 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.310
 You will get 25 × h 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.990
 If this is the definition of coupling we have 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.890
 Now, what is the domain, field 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.050
 Coupling Maria's wages? 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.940
 Well, again, this is just an ID 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.190
 For non-negative numbers 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.470
 Non-negative numbers 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.030
 In the same logic we used here, we will be accurate 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.860
 And say, oh, he can not get e of hours or pi hours 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.590
 This is not realistic to be measured 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.900
 Everything can be represented as broken 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.930
 For example, 5, if I say 5 hours 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.820
 This is expressed as a break 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.790
 Which is 5/1 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.840
 So let's say relative numbers are non-negative 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.260
 What is the scope of what you gain by breaking or 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.010
 Coupling? 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.660
 Well, it would be at least $ 15.00 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.005
 No matter what, they will earn $ 15.00, if it will 

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:15.430
 $ 15.00 or more 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.920
 Which will be in relative numbers and larger 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.420
 From or equal to $ 15.00 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.200
 There is no particular situation where you can get $ 14.00 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.230
 Nor is there a situation that enables it to 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.960
 Get - $ 1.00 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.380
 Everything that is produced will be greater than or equal to 15 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.950
 Now we have a summary of the definitions of conjugation 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.260
 Thus we can put any number out 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.930
 Well, we will not deal with 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.010
 Preparing a vehicle, ie a real setup 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.610
 But let's see if it is determined by a bit 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.453
 If we have (f (x 

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:56.400
 Let me rewrite it. f (x) = 15x - 12 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.870
 So what is the area here? 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.420
 What is the field? 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.016
 Well, I can put any real number x place here and will 

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:08.230
 Strike it with 15 and subtract from it 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.280
 Can put pi 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.780
 I can put here the 2 box 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.450
 I can put e 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.900
 I can do many things here 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.935
 So tell all the real numbers 

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:21.080
 All the real numbers 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.880
 Any number of real place I place x, I will get 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.540
 Logical output 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.705
 Now what is the range? 

00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:29.460
 . 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.730
 Well, again, I can take any value here 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.410
 I can get any negative value if 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.990
 The value of x is negative 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.970
 I will subtract it from 12, so I can get any 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.660
 Negative value 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.920
 It can get zero 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.880
 I can get a positive value 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.096
 If this also will be all real numbers 

00:07:49.096 --> 00:07:51.840
 this is good 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.900
 Now we have this pairing 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.560
 (F (x = - they have forgotten the sign of equality - 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.970
 2x ^ 2 + 5 

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.660
 What is the field? 

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.020
 What are all values ​​that are valid for x and which I can 

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.800
 Put it here? 

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.700
 Well, I can put anything here 

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.550
 I can put e 

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.030
 2e ^ 2 + 5 

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.810
 I can put square root for 2 here 

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.220
 I can put a negative number 

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.910
 If in fact I can take any real number 

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:26.260
 All real numbers, positive or negative or anything else, or even 

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.420
 Non-relative numbers 

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.590
 Then what is the scope here? 

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.260
 This is interesting 

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.520
 Because it does not matter what number we will put here, this value 

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.559
 Will be greater than zero 

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.045
 Will be, not negative 

00:08:41.045 --> 00:08:44.110
 . 

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.490
 So if you put a negative number here, you'll 

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.040
 You squirt it, and it will become 

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.640
 Positive number when squared 

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.460
 If this term is negative 

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.890
 If you take a non-negative number and add it to 5 

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.120
 You will always get a larger output from or 

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.140
 Equals 5 

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.250
 Even in the worst case, if the value is zero, we will eventually get 5 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.690
 But if it is either less than zero or slightly 

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.750
 Above zero, you will get values ​​greater than 5 

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:16.740
 If the range is all the real numbers are bigger 

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.450
 Of or equal to 5 

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.980
 (f) x that we will not take zero value 

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.080
 It is impossible to be worth zero 

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.330
 Question No. 5 

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.690
 Question No. 5 

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.900
 We have f (x) = 1 / x 

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.550
 If again, the domain 

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.550
 Well, we can put any value to x 

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.960
 Any real number will succeed here 

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.480
 We will take its upside down 

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.830
 If all the numbers are real, all the numbers will be real 

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.380
 Then what is the range? 

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.450
 It's interesting 

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.640
 Because it does not matter what I put here, I can put anything 

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.550
 Oh, actually, let me relax 

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.670
 Will be undefined when x = 0 

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.980
 All numbers are real except zero 

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.970
 If you put zero here, I'll get 1/0 

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.260
 It will be undefined 

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.020
 Let me write this down 

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.690
 I made a mistake. (f) 0 is not defined 

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.380
 That means we do not know what 

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.150
 We do zero 

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.680
 We did not know how to deal with zero 

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.400
 If f (0) is not defined 

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.020
 If the domain is all real numbers except zero 

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.120
 Now what is the range? 

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.210
 Well, again, we can take any value here except zero 

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.465
 Can approach zero 

00:10:38.465 --> 00:10:41.220
 If the value of x is not very large, very, very, very, very 

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.500
 We can get closer to zero 

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.890
 If the value of x is negative, I will approach zero 

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.130
 But in any case we will not take zero 

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:58.210
 If again, all real numbers except zero 

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.830
 All real numbers except zero 

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.370
 Okay 

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.080
 Question No. 6 

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.300
 What is the conjugation range y = x ^ 2 

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.100
 - 5 when the domain - has 

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.300
 So deal with the field 

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.110
 They identified it 

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.470
 We were told that the domain is a 2-digit 

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.410
 -1, 0, 1, and 2 

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.640
 If the definition of this pairing says that (f (x 

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:32.660
 = x ^ 2 - 5 when x = - we can write 

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:39.180
 Any value for x of this set of values ​​-2 

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.070
 -1, 0, 1, 2 

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.420
 It will not be known if the x is any other value 

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.860
 You will not know what to do with it 

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.600
 You can only apply this if x is one of them 

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.590
 So what is the range? 

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.035
 Well, the range is all combinations, all values ​​are 

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:56.200
 Can be taken to f (x 

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:03.960
 If the range will be the set of values ​​we get 

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.900
 When you put different x values 

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.280
 So let's try the first value: -2 

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.040
 2 ^ 2 - 5 

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.830
 Equal to 4-5 

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.615
 = -1 

00:12:15.615 --> 00:12:17.220
 Let's try -1 

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.910
 1 ^ 2 - 5 

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.000
 = 1 - 5 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.050
 = -4 

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.140
 We have 0 

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.450
 0 ^ 2 

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.750
 If (f) 0, we have 0 ^ 2 - 5, equals 5 

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.560
 We have 1 

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.940
 1 ^ 2 - 5, = -4, if this 

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.180
 Of course it is scale 

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.630
 Then we have 2 

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.110
 2 ^ 2 - 5, this equals -1 

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.020
 It is of course within the field 

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.190
 If these are all values ​​that can be taken for coupling 

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.670
 Where it was determined 

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.380
 To include only these values 

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.200
 .
