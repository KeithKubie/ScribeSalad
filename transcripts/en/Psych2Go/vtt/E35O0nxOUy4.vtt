00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.100
Eleven things people with Anxiety would like their family and friends to understand.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.400
Can you relate?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.840
Disclaimer

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.360
Anxiety is different for everyone

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.420
So these statements might not apply

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.200
to everyone

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.940
This does not make the experiences

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.760
mentioned

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.560
which we gathered from people

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.140
who have experienced Anxiety

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.240
any less valid

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.000
One

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.560
Please stop telling me to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.480
just NOT worry about it

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.520
That's EXACTLY my illness.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.780
I'm bad at "just not worrying about it"

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.520
If I could, I would have done that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.420
a long time ago

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.660
Two

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm trying really hard

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.260
to not dismiss my efforts

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180
It's exhausting to feel frightened,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.900
and worried,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.940
and scared most of the time.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.840
The fear is pushing out the real me at times and I really hate it

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.640
I'm trying so hard, so don't tell me I'm not

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.360
Because you probably don't fully understand what it's like

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.000
Three: Do not take it personally if I'm frightened

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.980
When you have anxiety and you're feeling particularly bad, it's often anyone's fault in particular

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.720
The same situation sometimes does trigger the anxiety, and sometimes it doesn't

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.180
You might have triggered it, but I'm not usually blaming you for it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.240
I'm sorry if I repeat myself quite often

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.780
It just means that that's the thing worrying me the most at the moment

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.940
I know I repeat myself, but it sort of helps saying these things out loud

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.920
As anxiety can lock me in my own thoughts with worry

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.120
Bringing it out bit by bit sometimes lightens the fear ever so slightly

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.840
I'm so sorry if I annoy you, but if you want to help me, I just need someone to listen at those moments

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.200
Five: my coping methods will be different in different situations

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.120
The thing that helps the first time might not do anything useful the next time

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.840
Again, we would really appreciate patience

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.560
Six: consent still matters as always

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.640
No still means no even when I'm experiencing severe panic and/or anxiety

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.520
Don't force things on me

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.940
Seven: it's more than just stressing over a test

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.100
I wish that people understood that anxiety isn't just stressing out over a test

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.240
And it isn't being nervous about giving a presentation

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.300
It's something that takes over my life

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.840
I have really bad anxiety about dying

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.940
For example, whenever I think about future plans like "On Saturday, I'm going grocery shopping"

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.800
I force myself to think, "Well, unless I die", because if I don't worry about dying, I will die

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.980
I know it's total bullshit and I sound ridiculous, but my brain tells me otherwise

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.180
Eight: people often invalidate us

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.500
I think the biggest thing for me is that whenever I vent to someone about it

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.360
They always, in attempting to help me get over it, tell me that I shouldn't be anxious

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.540
But that's what makes me feel invalidated

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.680
Nine: it can also affect other emotions than just fear

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.860
I wish people understood how every emotion is felt 10x stronger no matter how little the situation is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.560
At least for me, it is when my anxiety is peaking

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.820
Ten: I generally cannot ignore it, and if I could, I wouldn't have clinical anxiety.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.960
I wish that more people would understand that most of the time, it's not something you can just ignore or get over

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.620
It's really crippling, and it's a daily challenge

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.320
I wish people knew that I can't knock on doors or talk on the phone

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.720
Not because I'm a millenial, but because I have an actual problem

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.520
Eleven: I'm not being dramatic or doing it for attention

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.160
I'm not being overly dramatic, and sometimes normal tasks and situations can be too stressful for me

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.840
Also the phrase "everyone has some anxiety" invalidates me, and I wish people would stop using it

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.600
