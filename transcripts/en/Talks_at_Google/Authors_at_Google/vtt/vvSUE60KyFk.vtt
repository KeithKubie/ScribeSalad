00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720
&gt;&gt; 
Today, we're lucky enough to have two authors

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.580
with us. They're both reporters at the Wall
Street Journal. Roger Thurow has been with

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.090
the journal as a foreign correspondent for
20 years and has reported on more than 60

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.950
countries including two dozen in Africa. Scott
Kilman has been the journal's leading agricultural

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.710
reporter. Together, they have teamed up to
produce a stream of page one stories that

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.640
have broken new ground in our understanding
of famine and food aid. Their stories on three

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.339
2003 famines were a finalist for the 2004
Pulitzer Prize in international reporting.

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.771
So please welcome them to discuss their book:
"Enough." Thank you.

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:55.860
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Thank you and thanks for coming.
I'm Roger, this is Scott. Scott, Roger. I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.390
think our families know us as Roger, Scott,
Scott, Roger. They've become familiar with

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.780
us talking over the years. Thank you very
much for coming. This book, as Scott said,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.160
we both have been deeply involved in issues
of hunger and even culture development and,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.830
and what is known as food security for much
of the past decade in our reporting. So, this

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.250
book really encapsulates our passion about
the subjects, and figured if we didn't do

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.450
this book, our souls would never rest. And
so, I hope you, guys, all have copies and

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.410
that you enjoy it and learn something along
the way. Enough. Why enough? We have three

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.730
meanings in this one little word. One, first,
there's enough food in the world to feed everybody

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.550
which means the world is producing enough
food and has for the last number of decades,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.230
for everybody to have sufficient, nutritional
sustenance. The second, enough is enough.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.921
We brought hunger with us into the 21st century
and shame on us for doing so. The Green Revolution

00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:10.470
was one of the great technological and scientific
achievements of the 20th century, and here

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.680
we are nine years into 21st century, not only
have we brought hunger with us, but we brought

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.359
it with us in an increasing amount. This year,
the number of hungry in the world and severely

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:30.060
malnourished is already soaring past one billion.
People, that's the highest level since before

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.040
the Green Revolution began in the 1960s and
the 1970s or when the Green Revolution kicked

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.129
in. And, for the first time since then, the
prevalence of hunger in the world is growing

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.269
which means the percentage of hungry people
among the population and those are, those

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.150
are just incredibly damning statistics that
for our age, you know, as you guys are all

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.370
intimately familiar with we've done so many
wonderful things, you know, wiring the world

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.529
for the Internet, Google and the marvelous
things you do but we still can't feed our

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:11.169
fellow man and that problem is getting even
worse. Three--there's enough people. You guys

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:21.859
that are gathered here, everybody involved
in the google.org; the process and efforts

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.519
to get involved in development issues and
help the hungry and the poor of the world.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.019
And, you guys were all part of a bigger and
much larger movement, a Grassroots Movement

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.799
that is a foot particularly on the hunger
issues that comes from churches and synagogues,

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:48.150
and temples, and mosques, and university campuses,
small farms, big institutions from peasant

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.329
farmers in Africa to the leaders in Africa,
to CEOs and corporate headquarters in the

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.419
United States and then Europe. And to some
of the great philanthropists of the world:

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:03.209
Bill Gates, Warren Buffett; Howard Buffett,
Warren's son, who we'll see later, all intimately

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.629
involved in the hunger issue and really, are
really giving it a great momentum. Our mantra

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.889
in writing the book kind of constantly threw
the, I guess, it was through the report in

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.650
that, it inspired us to do this and the stories
for the Wall Street Journal. But while writing

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.080
the book, our mantra has been outrage and
inspire. We want, we want to outrage the readers

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.100
and also about that we brought hunger with
us into the 21st century, but also inspire

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.600
that we can actually do something about it,
and hunger is one of the great problems of

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.430
the world that can actually be conquered.
We have the tools, we have the intelligence,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.510
we have the science to do it and it is something
that basically everybody can get involved

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.450
with. And, our own personal outrage, I guess,
began to stir after 9/11. When we started,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.120
I was overseas; Scott was in Chicago covering
agriculture, domestically and the impact around

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.680
the world, and I was seeing things on the
ground in Africa. We started asking questions

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.390
about, well, what policies in the United States
and in Europe, government policies, the economic

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:17.730
policies really impact in the fact and particularly
negatively impact people in the developing

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.041
world, particularly the poor in the developing
world and in the most cases, they are farmers.

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:25.780
And so we started asking, one of the central
questions we were asking is why can't Africa

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.751
feed itself, and why did Africa miss out in
the Green Revolution? And in our reporting,

00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:36.560
we came across something that Norman Borlaug
who is known as the father of the Green Revolution,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:47.000
a very humble plant scientist from small town
Iowa and he won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1974,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.960
his work on the Green Revolution. And, basically,
is known as perhaps the one human being who

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.690
has saved more lives than anybody else. In
his Nobel Peace Prize speech, it was the lecture

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.650
of the day afterwards; he said something that's
very prophetic and incredibly haunting when

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.520
you think about it in the context of the 21st
century. And he's saying this in 1970: "Man

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.170
can and must prevent the tragedy of famine
in the future instead of merely trying with

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.830
pious regret to salvage the human wreckage
of the famine as he has so often done in the

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:28.540
past. We will be guilty of criminal negligence
without extenuation if we permit future famines."

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.501
Criminal negligence. The light went off with
Scott and myself, that's what we are. We're

00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:38.870
basically criminal, we're basically crime
reporters because what were we doing as we

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.770
were reporting about hunger is we were investigating
one of the great crimes of our, of our time;

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.470
that was even five or six years ago, and now
if you bring it back or advance it, here we

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.130
are even further and the hunger situation
is getting worse. The crime continues, it's

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.480
from, you know, our own neglect as Borlaug
said, "It's good intentions gone bad," and

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.520
we try to get on, into all of this in the
book. And then the Ethiopian famine of 2003

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.070
was another turning point for us and also
for the greater fight against hunger. That

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:17.350
famine in 2003 in Ethiopia was worse than
the one in 1984; I don't know how old all

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:25.840
of your guys are. The famine of 1984 was a
milestone for, say people of our generation,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.940
it was kind of one of the first global events,
the Live Aid concerts put together by Bob

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:38.130
Geldof, Bono was part of that, all sorts of
the bands in Britain, Ireland, and the United

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.210
States with a huge global concert, sang "We
Are World, Do They Know It's Christmas," raised

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:49.130
a lot of money, a lot of awareness for the
famine in Ethiopia in 1984. All sorts of pious

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.410
statements as Borlaug had referred to, never
again, it shouldn't happen again, a million

00:07:54.410 --> 00:08:01.670
people died in that famine in Ethiopia. Well,
here we were in 2003, 19 years later, famine

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.830
once again hit in Ethiopia and worse than
the one in 1984. Worse in the sense of more

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:12.580
people being on the doorstep of starvation.
In 1984, there were maybe 10 to 12 million

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.800
that were on the doorstep of starvation; more
people died, it was a communist government.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.710
There wasn't--the relief efforts were already
there in the country but, about 10 to 12 million

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.180
on the verge of starvation and needed to be
fed. In 2003, it was more than 14 million

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.979
people, so there were actually more people
in 2003 that were on the doorstep of starvation.

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:40.700
What happened? There in lies the tale of our
book. It was Borlaug's criminal neglect come

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:51.260
to life or come to death. And, we--as I said,
it becomes the core of our book and we will

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.050
now go on a brief journey back to the famine
of 2003, and again, remember the mantra outrage

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.450
and inspire. The first part of what we're
going to show you is to outrage, it's also

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.279
the first part of the book then we'll do--we'll
come to some of the inspiration that's when

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.590
Scott will take over because he's the more
inspirational of us; I'm the one harboring

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:15.810
all these outrage over the situation. If you
spend too much time with me, you'll think,

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.490
you'll obviously know the same thing. So,
the scene of the crime as Borlaug says, here

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.940
we are. These are emergency feeding tents
in Boricha, Ethiopia up on the highlands.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.950
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: You took this picture...
&gt;&gt; THUROW: I was there, I took these pictures

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:37.640
and a number of these that are coming. Interest
in explaining of what happened. Obviously,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:45.240
the kids are in horrible shape. The one on
the right, the left, in the white shirt--I'm

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:52.220
looking backwards, is--the one in the white
shirt is Hagiorso Katayma [ph]. He was five

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.770
years old at that time and was brought in
by his father who's sitting behind him, he

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:02.180
weighed only 27 pounds at five years old,
showing all the signs of, of horrible severe

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:08.920
malnutrition, the swollen stomach, the swollen
limbs and the swollen head from the various

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.710
manifestations of malnutrition from lack of
protein. And as you can see, he and the boy

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.920
next to him or the child next to him, that's
a boy or girl are being held up by their fathers,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.060
they're propped between the legs, their fathers
have their hands on them because they're so

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:28.400
weak, they can't even, they can't even sit
up. The interesting thing is that their parents,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.530
the men behind them are peasant farmers in
Ethiopia. They each have maybe, you know,

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:42.029
one or two acres of land. The year before,
they were carrying to the same market village

00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:48.450
in Ethiopia, bags of their surplus grain.
They had had their best harvest ever in the,

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:56.630
the 2001 harvest season and 2002, and at that
stage--and it was all across the country,

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:05.370
it wasn't only these guys, but it was Ethiopia
had had its biggest harvest in history because

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.130
since 1984 famine, the push had been on in
Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa to produce,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:17.839
produce, produce, to ramp up and increase
the production of grains as quickly and as

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:24.540
mightily as possible. That they did and they
had great success. So these guys in 2001-2002

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.740
are carrying this huge hundred, hundred pound
bags of surplus grain to the market, they're

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.250
overjoyed. They finally have surplus crops,
a great income for the family. Well, what

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:40.180
happened? They came to the market and because
of the surplus that the whole country had,

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:48.320
the prices collapsed by 80% across Ethiopia.
These guys ended up losing--the price that

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.940
they got was less than their cost of production,
less than the cost of the fertilizer, less

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:58.630
than the cost of the calculated cost of their
labor of the wagon that they had to use and

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:04.811
things and so, these guys lost money; they
reacted like farmers anywhere else. In the

00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:09.100
United States, we're from Illinois. We went
to the University of Iowa. We grew up surrounded

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.970
in the cornfields and the wheat fields in
the Midwest. The farmers lose money, they

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:20.021
changed their tactics. They'll plant different
crops, they'll use cheaper inputs. These guys,

00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:24.510
the next year, what do they do? They cut back
on their use of fertilizer. Fertilizer use

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:33.279
in Ethiopia fell 27% the next year; this is
planting season for 2002-2003. They stopped

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:38.980
using the better hybrid seeds; they took whatever
seeds they had in the back of their huts.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.861
They knew they were going to get, they weren't
as good as seeds. The use of hybrid seeds

00:12:43.861 --> 00:12:48.300
in Ethiopia fell 70%. That year as farmers
tried to cut production, some of the bigger

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:55.230
farmers took thousands of acres out of production.
They shut off their irrigation systems because

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:00.610
they were too expensive that they couldn't
afford. And, they all knew they were going

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:06.630
to get less production because they were using
less fertilizer, not as good as seeds, but

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.540
the calculation that these gentlemen made
was, that's okay, because we had a surplus

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.640
production. What did it do? We actually lost
money on it. We'll cut back our expenses.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.339
Okay, we'll grow less food but as long as
we have enough food to feed our families,

00:13:19.339 --> 00:13:27.180
that's great. That's our goal as peasant farmers,
that'll be great. What happened? Drought hit

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.490
the country which it does on a regular basis.
Everybody looked to the heavens for rain,

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:39.350
rain wasn't coming; it was very sporadic.
That impacted their crops, the production

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:44.790
which they thought would be lower, fell even
more. Hunger spread across the country, tips

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:50.920
in the famine across the country. These two
gentlemen, Tasfia [ph], the man in the brown

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:57.750
shirt behind his son Hagiorso [ph], they are
carrying their children to the market where

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:03.890
the year before they had carried their huge
surplus grains of wheat. In their success

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:10.560
came their failure, from feast came famine.
The whole of economics of farming for these

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:19.160
guys stood on their heads. It's a horrible
and cruel paradox that during the boost to

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.810
push production in Ethiopia and elsewhere
in Africa but, particularly, in Ethiopia,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:30.330
the markets were ignored. The markets failed
before the weather did. And so the lesson

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:36.029
of all this is markets matter. Here are some
other people in that same, that same feeding

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:41.459
tent, and again, out of their success came
failure, feast led the famine; one of the

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:49.810
cruelest ironies that one can see in Africa.
Wow. What's this? Also in Ethiopia, not far

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.231
from the emergency feeding tents maybe a couple
of hours drive. This is an Ethiopian farmer

00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:58.580
and grain trader. He's standing in the warehouse
and this is, this is what is stacked up in

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:07.110
front of him are stacks of corn, wheat, beans,
peas, lentils that had come from the surplus

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:13.800
of the two previous harvest. Why is this here?
Because these guys had some warehouse facilities,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.050
they figured if they store it, it'll help
support prices a little bit. If all of this

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.410
grain that they had stored in these warehouses
went on the market, the prices instead of

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:27.430
collapsing 80%, you know, would've gone down
even further or would have taken such a long

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:36.589
time to recover, so these guys held it in
the warehouses. There's another picture. Where

00:15:36.589 --> 00:15:43.021
these guys are is in the town of Nazareth,
in a little bit east of the capital of Addis

00:15:43.021 --> 00:15:52.279
Ababa. Two blocks away is where the road from
Djibouti where is the nearest port runs to

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:56.870
the capital of Addis, that's the same road
where all the Food Aid that comes, that were

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.760
streaming in the country to feed this 14 million
people that were hungry. The bulk of the Food

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:07.420
Aid or at least over 50% of the Food Aid that
year was coming from the United States. So

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.930
here comes all these grain and corn and wheat
and soybeans and all of this Food Aid from

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:17.480
the United States running pass these warehouses
in Ethiopia, they're full of grain. Again,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.760
all the way up to the ceiling, a staggering
sight in a country that is experiencing famine.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.860
Why was this happening? Because of the US
Food Aid policy. It's mandated in the US that

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:34.560
we have to ship American grown food for Food
Aid around the world. We can't use cash from

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.110
the federal government budget to buy this
food that's already sitting there and would

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.700
be a huge incentive and a huge market for
the farmers of Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.830
if somebody would come in, particularly, the
United States and buy their grain in a time

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:54.200
of, in a time of famine. So if you stood outside
the warehouses and stood inside in their parking

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.760
lots, you could literally feel the rumble
of the trucks laden with the big, huge double

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.100
wide trucks laden with Food Aid from the United
States rumbling pass their warehouses full

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.150
of Ethiopian food to basically feed the starving
Ethiopians and these guys are wondering, well,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:13.760
how come, they're not sending our food or
using our food? This guy, German Mamente [ph]

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.549
he climbed to the--climbed to the top of his,
one of stack, he said, "Roger, take my picture

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:22.230
and put this picture on the Wall Street Journal
with the caption, 'Please send food, Ethiopians

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:28.520
are starving, we have no food in Ethiopia.'"
It's terribly ironic. He laughed hilariously

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:38.770
at that in a fit of gallous humor; that basically
encapsulates one of the, another of the horrible

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:44.929
ironies. These guys then got together, a number
of the commercial farmers and traders and

00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:49.710
they wrote a letter to their government. The
Food Aid coming to the country is great, saving

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:55.350
a lot of people, our fellow Ethiopians, but
first can you tell the donors and the government

00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:00.809
in sending the Food Aid, "Please buy our grain
first because if we don't sell our grain;

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:04.230
one, we're not going to have room to store
it next year and two, we're not going to have

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.650
any money to buy the, the crops to the farmers
in this planting season, in this, in the following

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.090
places." We're going to end up in the same
situation. There is going to be another, there

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.960
is going to be another lack of food, prices
are going to collapse, the farmers are going

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:21.170
to lose all incentive again to grow. At the
same time, in the United States, so I'm in

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.460
Ethiopia talking with these guys about this,
Scott's talking to farmers in the United States

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.890
and, and the folks in the White House. A group
of American farmers at the same time, led

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.871
by the Wheat Association was writing a letter
to the White House--it's Clinton White House

00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:36.550
right, on 2003, no?
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Bush.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:45.490
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Bush. Bush's White House, saying
please include more American food and particularly

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.170
American--in American Food Aid shipments because
we've had a surplus and a great harvest in

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.020
the United States and there's pressure on
our wheat prices in the United States. "Please

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:59.840
send the food overseas in Food Aid." The conclusion
on the Ethiopians and it's hard to dispute

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:07.520
with them is American farmers need starving
Ethiopians; two letters, two sets of farmers,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:16.770
exact opposite purposes at the same time in
the midst of a famine. These two guys, lentil

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:25.980
farmers in Ethiopia, they are standing--they're
in all their sartorial splendor, and typical

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.950
dress, they're wearing rags--this stuff is
all kind of put together. Scott will talk

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.050
about this later, most of the farmers in Africa
and, and in the developing world and particularly

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:42.020
in Africa, are women. It's just coincidental
that some of these photos are men. These guys

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.299
were on the road, the same Djibouti to Addis
road where the Food Aid trucks are running

00:19:46.299 --> 00:19:51.760
pass. I'm talking to them, a huge convoy of
Food Aid trucks go by and there's a little

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.551
bit of cargo that basically drips out of the
trucks and kind of scatters along the road.

00:19:56.551 --> 00:20:00.361
The trucks go pass; we all run into the road,
these guys are particularly curious "What

00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:04.700
is this, what feel out?" Again, I said these
guys are lentil farmers, they bend over and

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.660
they picked it up and it's lentils and they
said "Where is this coming from?" and I said

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.750
"Well, based on the markings of the trucks,
on the bags, on the trucks, I think it's coming

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:18.570
from the United States" and they said "Well,
why are they sending lentils to America, or

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.740
why are they sending lentils to Ethiopia?
Don't they know in America that we grow lentils

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:26.051
in Ethiopia?" I said "No, I don't think they
know in America that you grow lentils in Ethiopia

00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:31.460
and that you should grow a surplus of lentils
that they can export some." And so, again

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:37.570
setting up the huge irony and contradiction
that it's almost, you know coals to New Castle

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:42.790
in the midst of a famine and Ethiopia had
food from its previous shares of surplus production

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:50.120
we're sending in that. What this also represents
is the neglect that Borlaug talked about,

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.960
a huge part of that was the huge fall off
in development aid for agriculture and agriculture

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:02.980
development, and particularly in Africa. And
in Ethiopia, and it was not only by the United

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:09.510
States but by all the western countries and
the rich governments of the world. In Ethiopia

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:17.929
in 2003 and it's a stunning set of numbers.
There was $500 million in this American Food

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:22.650
Aid that was coming to Ethiopia that year,
$500 million in food from America that was

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:28.780
coming to Ethiopia. That same year in 2003,
U.S. agriculture development aid to Ethiopia

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:34.970
was less than $5 million. Less than $5 million
to help them grow food so that they wouldn't

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:42.500
be hungry to begin with; $500 million in food
to say "That's okay, we'll feed you." Again,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.220
a damning statistics, why are we doing that?
What's wrong with our policies? Why aren't

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.970
we helping the Ethiopians to grow as much
food as possible and to feed themselves as

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:57.919
opposed to us sending our food to feed them
when they do become hungry? This man with

00:21:57.919 --> 00:22:04.040
the scarf in his head, on a turban, it was
a very hot day, it was cooling him off is

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.990
Tasfahum Valijud [ph], Tasfahum [ph] means
"be hope" in the Amharic language. When I

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:18.090
saw him in the midst of--this is in 2003 again.
Mr. "Be Hope" had basically lost all hope.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.160
He's standing beside the Red River which is
one of the tributaries of the Blue Nile. The

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:31.620
Blue Nile is one of the great waterways of
Africa. It gathers steam and a tremendous

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:37.260
power runs over gorges and cascades and basically
500 miles that it runs through Ethiopia and

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.730
the Sudan, Sudan connects the White Nile which
is coming up from the great lakes region of

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.929
Central Africa and together they form in Sudan--in
Khartoum in Sudan and then they form the great

00:22:46.929 --> 00:22:52.700
Nile which runs through, up through Egypt.
Tasfahum at this stage, he's got the water

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.040
running right pass him. His farm, his little
plot of an acre or two which is right to the

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.260
side of the picture, is bone dry. There's
nothing growing because of the drought, whatever

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:06.230
he had planted has died. He's been on Food
Aid for nine months at this time. Well, the

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:11.940
Food Aid from America is streaming into the
country, and I asked him "Well, why aren't

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.429
you taking the water from the Red River running
in front of you right by your feet and irrigating

00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:20.100
your land?" and he said "You know, well, we
thought about that." You know, he kind of

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.760
fixes me with a gaze, you know, we're not
dumb, we thought about that. We have tried

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.510
to do that; the government basically comes
by and says "You can't do that." Why? The

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:35.440
water belongs in Egypt. What happened was,
is that Ethiopia had the great fortune of

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.500
never being colonized by a European power--one
of the rare African countries for that to

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:46.150
happen. Ethiopia also had the great misfortune
of not being colonized by a great European

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.280
power because when the European powers came
together and the councils of Europe and said

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.440
"Well, what should we do about Africa?" They
then divvied up water rights and the Brits

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.910
were in charge of--were the colonial powers
in Egypt and Sudan at that time and they said,

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:06.059
"Water of Egypt or the water of the Nile must
be for our cotton plantations and the granaries

00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:12.690
in Sudan and the granaries in Egypt. The downstream
users, we should have the right of the Nile

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:18.030
water usage." There's nobody in Ethiopia to
stand up and say "Well, what about us?" Eighty-five

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:22.900
percent of the water that runs through Egypt
and basically brings 8 million acres of land

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:29.470
in Egypt and of the Sahara Desert to bloom
and to produce a whole cornucopia of food,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:34.610
eighty-five percent of the water in Egypt,
in the Nile and in the canals comes from Ethiopia

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:41.000
and from the highlands of Ethiopia where they
usually get pretty good rain. It runs to the

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.370
Blue Nile or through some of the tributaries
that run into Sudan or in the canyon connect

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:55.110
with the White Nile or the great Nile and
itself. And, so 85% of the water of the Nile

00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:02.120
which is irrigating 8 million acres back in
2003, in Ethiopia, less than 500,000 acres

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:08.290
are irrigated. So all the Ethiopian water
is being taken, is being irrigated and irrigating

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:14.200
crops somewhere else and producing food elsewhere
and not here. And one of the great cruel ironies

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:22.230
is, is that the land that feeds the Nile can't
feed itself, and it was a screwed up system

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:30.360
of geopolitics that allowed that to happen.
Now, this is an Egyptian farmer. He's 100

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:36.679
miles from the Nile. He's way out in the desert.
He's at the last stop in the desert that still

00:25:36.679 --> 00:25:41.799
gets Nile water. If he wants to expand his
farm, he's got to expand the canal system.

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:49.200
This guy, I think he had 60 acres of a whole
array of peppers and lettuce and cucumbers

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:56.080
and tomatoes that were grown in hothouses.
Some grow corn, and wheat grown in his fields

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.930
and he had a lot of cattle, these are water
buffalo calves, they're being showered. He

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:07.230
says "Well, happy cattle are fatter cattle."
He sells them for a higher price. The water

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:15.940
that is showering them is Ethiopian water.
This guy is Food Aid. They can't grow, that's

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:24.730
their water, runs into Nile. This man using
the water that perhaps is running by this

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:36.750
guy's feet, Tasfahum [ph] feet water his cattle.
Again, outrage. This is 2002, now we're in

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:45.180
Mali in West Africa, subsidies issue of the
American farm subsidies. These guys are West

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:50.260
African cotton farmers. They are, you know,
dressed in rags. They do all their planting

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:58.429
by hand. They are walking behind their two
draft oxen; they're not mechanized, whatsoever.

00:26:58.429 --> 00:27:05.910
I got to remember, this is an American cotton
farm in Mississippi. Now these two pictures

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:12.250
were taken on the same day. I was in Mali,
Scott was in the Mississippi Delta and it's

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:17.710
the same day. These guys, the water, the rain
just started to fall, they figuring, "Well,

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:22.940
the rain is coming, time to go prepare for
the planting season." I think they were doing

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:28.960
the same in Mississippi on that day. This
is Ken Hood. He was the head of the American

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:35.990
Cotton Counsel and Cotton Association, whatever
it's called. In 2002, was the Farm Bill that

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:41.900
President Bush signed, and again, he signed
it five, six, seven months after 9/11 where

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.330
President Bush was asking the question that
he said was on the minds of a whole bunch

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.970
of Americans at the time, and rightfully so,
why do they hate us so much? So they started

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.881
the whole round of World Trade talks called
the Development Round. How do we make the

00:27:55.881 --> 00:28:02.460
World Trade benefit people in the developing
world? They have the Monterey Conference in

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.260
Monterey, Mexico where everybody pledged,
we're going to increase our development aid

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:13.179
to the developing world. That, I think, was
in Doha, it was in November of 2001, Monterey

00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:21.330
in March or April of 2002. In May of 2002
comes U.S. Farm Bill which Bush signs, raising

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.190
subsidies for American farmers and particularly
for American cotton farmers. The first person,

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:30.480
President Bush turns around to shakes hands
with after signing the bill is Mr. Ken Hood

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:37.270
because and he has a big smile on his face
because his subsidies were greatly increased

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:45.300
and the farmers are the potential subsidies
that they could get. No subsidies for these

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:52.950
farmers in Mali and the government at the
same time was telling them that their price

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:58.850
for their cotton is going to be cut by 5,
10, 15% that year because there was a glut

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:05.510
of cotton in the world market. The world market,
the, all the cotton that basically is grown

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:09.080
in the United States, we don't have a cotton
industry anymore, we don't make t-shirts or

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:16.470
underwear, and it drives down the prices.
The Mali government was able to pay less to

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.190
its own cotton farmers. So, if you look at
these two people and you'd wonder, "Wow, who

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.799
should get the--who should get the aid from
the government, who should get the subsidies?"

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:32.049
This guy should--does he need subsidies? That's
the question that we address in the book;

00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:35.180
that's the outrage section--inspiration Dr.
Borlaug?

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.330
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Well, now they're all bummed out.
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Now they're all bummed out. You're

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:43.560
thinking, what's going on? So, people should
be simply outraged as it is promises the world,

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.990
that's driving the hunger problem.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Roger has talked about the Green

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:53.830
Revolution and this is all before your time.
Most of, most, everybody's in the wrong time.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:30:00.910
But, with the Green Revolution was in the
1960s and 1970s, hunger and famine was a problem

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:10.809
mostly of Asia, that's where the epicenter
was India and Pakistan. And this man had been--lucky

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:17.340
coincidence, had been working in Mexico trying
to develop better types of wheat for the poor

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:22.420
farmers of Mexico. And, what was happening
was that the farmers of Mexico would grow

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:29.530
their crop and would be wiped out by diseases.
So, he was given the job of trying to find

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:37.030
wheat plants that could resist this disease
and he was successful. He was just a--I won't

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:44.860
call him a simple scientist but he was--he
didn't start of thinking of himself as a humanitarian.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:52.539
He was given a scientific problem and he pursued
it, try to figure out how to solve it and

00:30:52.539 --> 00:30:57.870
he did. As it happened the way that he solved
it was he came up with a new way of breeding

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:04.370
wheat plants. Mexico is unique because there's
actually two places in Mexico where you can

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:08.710
go grow wheat at different times of the year.
You can grow wheat continuously in Mexico

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.980
just but in different parts. So he had to
figure out, you know, how do I, how do I stay

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.929
ahead over this disease that keeps evolving
and keeps changing. Every time I come up with

00:31:17.929 --> 00:31:23.720
a new wheat plant, you know, this fungus evolves
quickly and it will destroy the wheat plant,

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.010
so he had to speed up planting, he has to
speed up breeding and he did by breeding,

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:32.890
by figuring out that he could breed two cycles.
In Mexico, you could actually two wheat crops

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.211
in Mexico in a year but that meant traveling
more than a thousand miles back and forth

00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:42.340
on trucks. You need to harvest at one place,
take the seed, travel up to Northwest Mexico,

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.350
plant it there, see how well it did, pick
the best ones, bring it down to around Mexico

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:52.850
cities, so he speed up the breeding process.
In the process of doing that, he came up with

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:56.570
a type of wheat plant nobody expected. It
was a type of wheat plant that could grow

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:03.120
anywhere in the world. Most plants are very
sensitive to their environment, only grow

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.790
in a very unique place because the length
of daylight, the climate and the soil. But,

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.940
unintentionally, he came up with a super right--a
super wheat plant that would grow anywhere.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:20.520
So, when the India and Pakistan were having
their famines, he was the guy who had the

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:26.730
seeds to plant a crop that could grow in India
and Pakistan and it worked, and the wheat

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:33.150
production soared in India and Pakistan so
that by, you know, the 1960s--I have to look

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:38.370
at the book but I think, in the late 1960s,
20% of all the wheat that was grown in the

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:45.679
United States was being shipped to India for
Food Aid, 20%, one in five bushels. By the

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:52.900
mid 1970s, India could feed itself. And, by
the late 1970s, India actually had excess

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:59.400
stock piles and in the '80s or '90s or some
years where India was actually exporting wheat.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.940
People still think of India, and there's still
a lot of poverty, still a lot of hunger in

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.409
India but there weren't famines anymore. And
it was, it happened just because he was a

00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:15.961
stubborn guy, and he was given a very specific,
scientific problem and he solved it and a

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:21.390
coincidence, he had the tool that could help
India and Pakistan; on a footnote, this is

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.650
Norman Borlaug. He won the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1970 because of this, he was coined the

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:33.080
Green Revolution. What happened, what he was
able to do to stop the famines in India and

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.970
Pakistan in the 1960s or 1970s, the seeds
spread throughout Asia, throughout Latin America

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:49.159
and it was an amazing time in the '70s and
the '80s--something very unusual happened.

00:33:49.159 --> 00:33:55.429
If you put it in an economic function--what
happens is that the per capital availability

00:33:55.429 --> 00:34:01.539
of grain around the world actually grew which
nobody expected. Everybody thought that population,

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:06.950
as Malthis said population grows faster than
food production, and he had more to do with

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:11.569
anybody else to shovel that. We don't have
to be doomed to buy that idea. You can actually

00:34:11.569 --> 00:34:19.090
make more food available to everybody even
as the population is growing. But, it's interesting

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:23.300
because he's probably the most obscure Nobel
Peace Prize winner you'll never hear about.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:34.790
He never made a lot of money, never patented
any of his inventions,

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:39.500
and if he had, his techniques are not used
by a lot of SIG companies, biotechnology companies,

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:48.389
he'd be a very wealthy man but he lives in
a two-bedroom house in Dallas and lives very

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:54.169
humbly. He's now 95 years old. I was just
with him a couple of weeks ago doing a video

00:34:54.169 --> 00:35:01.820
for the wsj.com, that will hopefully run this
weekend. And, here's this guy--what fascinated

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:07.720
me about him was that, when you write a book
about hunger, it's a pretty daunting task

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.530
because you start off and you think, well,
there are a million problems, it's an unsolvable

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:16.600
problem, there are a million problems. How
can--you know, how could you find any kind

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:22.210
of hope in this problem? And you look at Norman
Borlaug and you realize well, one person can

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:27.230
make a difference. He didn't intend to make
a difference but just doing his job and doing

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:33.349
his work, he came across something was pretty
miraculous and he made a difference, what's

00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:36.460
the next [INDISTINCT]. Some of my notes in
the--so I'm to supposedly be the inspirational

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.260
one, a part of what we're talking. So, the
first half of the book basically lays out

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.230
the problem. It makes the argument that hunger
is a solvable problem and the second part

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:50.360
of the book focuses on people who are actually
doing something about it. So, Norman Borlaug

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.500
is sort of the grand example of somebody who
can make a difference; who can still inspire

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:04.010
people. One of the people who's doing, working
now in Africa is Howard Buffett. His last

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:09.060
name is a lot better known. He's the son of
Warren Buffet, the eldest son of Warren Buffet.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:18.770
He's one of the wealthiest men in the world.
You know, while Warren is an expert stack

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:23.750
picker and loves to sit in an office, he sits
in an office and goes through the financial

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:29.750
data. Howard didn't want that kind of life;
he wanted to be a farmer, he like grew up

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:37.180
in Omaha. He--as it turned out, you know,
in his farming life, he got more involved

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:44.030
in political issues and agricultural issues,
and ended up working for some corporations.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:50.480
Archer Daniels Midland, he was on the board
of Kanegra, and the Coca-cola Enterprises,

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:59.770
other companies like this. On one of his business
trips to Africa--go backward--no, no. On one

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:04.420
of his business trips to Africa, he took a
camera with him, and he is sort of conservationist.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.210
He was very interested in the environment.
So, when he went Africa on a business trip,

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:12.000
he was interested in cheetahs, and you know,
gorillas, and saving the gorilla which is

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:20.640
all good stuff, and he had somebody supporting
that kind of thing. But it was in 2000, he

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:28.240
went to Northern Ghana to a town called Tamale,
you've been there, right? I've been there.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.450
In Northern Ghana, and he was being--I think
he was accompanied by World Vision, one of

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:38.500
the NGOs there, just trying to show him, you
know, different issues he should get involved

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:45.460
with. He's walking through a hospital and
he sees this girl laying in a bed. And he--she's,

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:52.099
basically, she's starving to death. She has
meningitis and she had something, she's malnourished

00:37:52.099 --> 00:37:53.530
but...
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Malaria.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:38:00.180
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Meningitis and malaria. Her body
couldn't fight off diseases, and she dies

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:06.790
a few days after this picture was taken. And
this picture changed his life. He took this

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:11.040
picture, it's really--it's in our book, it's
interesting to me because she's looking right

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:16.760
at him through the viewfinder. And he's a
father of five, and he sees this, and he told

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:21.560
me--one of the first times I had to set down
my camera, I couldn't take any more pictures.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.830
And he ended up talking to the mother through
a translator, and something happened, he sort

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:32.190
of having--he started an epiphany that he
realized that the issue that he'd been concerned

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:37.650
about in Africa, conservation and the environment,
protecting endangered animals and hunger were

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:42.260
linked. But one of the reasons that the animals
were endangered in Africa and the environment

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:48.470
was endangered in Africa, it was because of
the way that poor people were having to scrounge

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:53.050
for food. That they were cutting down the
forest to find any kind of acre land that

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:57.220
they could plant; that they didn't have the
means to grow enough food on their own land.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:01.720
That they had to keep moving after they grow
out in some land and do a bad job of it, exhaust

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:07.500
the soil, they have to move on to somewhere
else, it's called slash and burn farming.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.600
A little while after he took this picture,
he was flying in a plane over the, near the

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:20.200
Serengeti and he was taking pictures of the
thundering herds of the wildebeest and zebra.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.070
But, on the flight, he noticed the fires in
the distance and they flew over, and they

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.740
realized that the farmers are burning down
the forest to try to make room to grow, and

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:33.230
the light went off in his head, and he realized
that we can't, you really can't handle the

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:37.690
conservation issue, you can't make your progress
in conservation unless you help people feed

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:45.760
themselves. And so, his focus changed from
being primarily, conservationist to being

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.320
someone who wants to help people in Africa
farm better. Now, he's an unusual man because

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:57.849
he's a farmer, but he also has access to enormous
wealth. His--you've all heard, you probably

00:39:57.849 --> 00:40:04.210
have all heard the story when Warren Buffet
gave about $40 billion dollars of his money

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:09.940
to the Gates Foundation. He also carved out
a fraction of that and it was 1.5 billion

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.610
over 20 years, it was carved out for his three
children, and Howard is one of his three children.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:19.040
So, now he has about--depending on the stock
price is, he has, you know, between $38 and

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:26.351
$50 million dollars to spend a year on his
hunger fighting projects in Africa. And he's

00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:30.700
interesting because he really does it on his
own, he doesn't have a big staff. You see

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.210
the gouge on his shoulder, the big scar, that's
the way, he's always like that. I mean, this

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:39.720
guy is actually on the dirt scrounging around,
falls off stuff just like me all the time.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:46.030
You can't see it but there's a cheetah scar,
there's a cheetah bite scar on his right hand;

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.730
he almost got eaten by a polar bear once too.
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Not in Africa?

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:55.440
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Not in Africa. No. Yeah, he hasn't
been that successful. But the point of him

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:01.820
is, you know, here's this guy who could have
a very easy life. I mean, he has access to

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:07.710
enough money to make any of us happy, and
he's made the decision that what he wants

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:14.890
to do with his expertise which is farming,
and with his unusual family situation is spend

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:19.070
it in Africa on the poorest people. So, what
the--I don't know, if you all see any people

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:27.690
in that, he's actually on a cornfield in Burundi,
right? Back in the, earlier this year and

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:32.060
he's actually talking with women in this village
about very, very simple things which is "Why

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:37.180
it's a good thing to plant your rows, why
plant your corn on a straight line?" I mean,

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:42.290
he isn't introducing hi-tech farming here.
It's very, very simple things like, you know,

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.450
things that we knew 150 years ago, or 100
years in the United States, it just the very

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:52.220
fundamentals of farming to make your farming
operation more efficient. And again he--so,

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.570
he's an example of--you know, just one person
who's trying to make a difference in Africa,

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.832
and then, this next?
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Another one person, one of the

00:41:59.832 --> 00:42:04.910
extraordinary women of Africa, Elayne Gabramado
[ph]. She is an Ethiopian--throughout the

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:11.290
famine in two decades before, in 1984, she
was a student at Cornell University, it was

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:17.109
in the lunch room, ate for lunch or dinner,
and a food fight broke out, and she stood

00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:23.290
on the table in the middle of the famine in
1984, stood up on a table and said, stop wasting

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:27.380
food, people in my country are starving. She
thought about that, it was kind of a watershed

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.200
moment for her that she basically then dedicated
her life and her studies and her career as

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.690
an agricultural economist or market economist,
to basically straighten out the markets in

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:40.790
African agriculture. As we pointed out in
the other pictures, the markets failed before

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:48.470
the weather did in the 2003 famine. That became
the catalyst for her to start the Ethiopian

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:53.490
commodity exchange; there she is ringing the
bell. The little thing is--the monitors are

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.359
behind her. It's one of the first days of
trading of it, has a great accomplishment

00:42:57.359 --> 00:43:02.741
in Africa that actually have a commodity exchange
is one of the few in Africa, north of the

00:43:02.741 --> 00:43:09.310
Limpopo in South Africa. And, again, one person
really determined crying in the wilderness

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:15.009
for all those years. Finally, you know--gets
her chance and then sets this up.

00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:18.770
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: One thing I'm going to explain
about--don't go back. One thing I'll explain

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:23.089
about commodity exchange why it's important,
we're based in Chicago so, you know we buy

00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:30.430
the commodity exchanges. The commodity exchanges
started in the United States back in 1860s

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:35.250
and it was a great benefit to American farmers
because they had the problem then the Ethiopian

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:39.410
farmers have now, they have a good crop, everybody
brings it at the same markets, at the same

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:44.790
time, prices collapsed. When a commodity is
exchanged, particularly, the future is exchanged,

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:50.079
it's a way for farmer to lock in a price into
the future, so that they don't have to take

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:55.810
the price that they're getting that day. It's
a market where everybody's competing for what

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.410
price they want to pay in the future. They
want to know who's going to deliver a crop

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:04.960
to them, so an exchange sounds really mundane,
it's immensely important to the farmers. This

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.040
is a picture that I took in Northern Ghana,
and the reason we included this one is an

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:17.670
example of where--there's a group of women,
he was in Bulgo [ph] Katanga where they--I

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:25.400
love that name--they're a group of women who
lived in this town and they were all mothers,

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:31.100
middle aged women, and some Christian NGO
came in and started a literacy program for

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:35.030
them and they all learned how to read. Well,
in the process of learning how to read, they

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:38.160
sort of bonded together and they realized,
now we know how to read what are we going

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.270
to do with that? How would it make our lives
better? And they were smart enough to realize

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:47.560
that what they had growing around them that
was, you know, basically, like wild food were

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:54.839
shea nuts, shea nut trees. And in ladies'
cosmetics--are there men's cosmetics? Ladies'

00:44:54.839 --> 00:44:59.330
cosmetics, shea nut is, you know, used in,
you know, in skin care or skin cream. So,

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:03.380
they realized, well, gee, we have something
valuable, why don't we make shea nut butter,

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.980
and someday will buy our shea nut butter.
So, actually, they got a little money, a little

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:12.090
bit of money from an NGO and they built this,
this little cement block house, and that's--this

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:17.660
is basically shea nut butter processing facility.
And they collected these nuts, they cracked

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.430
them, they take the meat out, they heat them
up, they blend them together and they end

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:25.050
up being in these, I think once these are
filled in, the other ones end up having the

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:30.520
shea in it, great idea. The problem is the
world's worse business plan. I listened to

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.910
their story and I thought, you know, it be
a good example for the book about people trying

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:38.160
to better themselves, but they did everything
backwards. They realized this, this, well,

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.280
we have something that's viable, let's sell
it. They never figured--they never asked themselves

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.140
who's going to but it? You know, in the United
States they would say "Gee, will somebody

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.550
buy something that I have?" You know, I want
to make money from this, is anyone going to

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:54.730
buy it? You ask that first. So, I show up
and they're asking me, "Chief, do you know

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:59.609
anybody who buys this stuff?" They have buckets,
and what sort of--the parallel to me, what

00:45:59.609 --> 00:46:03.221
sort of struck me is that, you know, in the
United states, maybe in United States but

00:46:03.221 --> 00:46:08.670
in other places, if they don't have an access
to the Internet, you now, in the United States,

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:12.200
you're an apple farmer or carrot farmer or
somebody would say, "Gee, I got something

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.030
that, you know, organic. I'm going to sell
it over the Internet, at least there's a way

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:20.490
for me to find and do some research and find
out who wants Shea nut butter? Who'll buy

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:25.140
it from me, who can send an email to this
and say, "Gee, we have it." And as--I actually

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.190
think to myself, you know, gosh, if I had--if
I wasn't doing what I was doing I'd go in

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:35.380
the Internet and start pitching and say, "You
know, I know these farmers in Ghana who sell

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:42.190
fare trade and organic Shea nut butter." That
would be great, and you could put it, you

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:49.550
know, from Ghana, you know, help these people.
But, they didn't have that tool to reach the

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.961
rest of the world. So, one of the reasons
I include in these pictures, you know, it

00:46:52.961 --> 00:46:57.020
strikes me that, you know, what you guys do,
you know, the Internet allows people to, if

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.579
they only had access to it, is to reach the
world in a way that they couldn't have reached

00:47:00.579 --> 00:47:05.810
it to five years ago or 10 years ago.
&gt;&gt; THUROW: They could have Googled Shea nut

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:08.010
butter.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Yeah. As I did when I got back,

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.890
I find out, you know, Japanese companies want
Shea nut butter.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.930
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Yeah, so, I mean, they're genius
enough to develop this Rube Goldberg type

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:19.840
of contraption, and some of their inventions
are quite, are quite remarkable.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:28.381
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: So, this--we include this picture
because, what we're really writing about this

00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:36.600
is how generations of people are damned just
because of where they grow up. The fact that--if

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:43.450
you believe that all life--anybody's life
is valuable, and equally valuable, she doesn't

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:47.480
have a chance. The reasons she doesn't have
a chance it's because, I think I was in Togo

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:52.520
and Benin now, I think she's probably seven
years old, so hard to tell how old the kids

00:47:52.520 --> 00:48:00.540
are because they're so tiny. They don't get
a chance to grow to their full potential but

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.850
her life is going to be hauling water. That
stone on her head, her job and her family

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:09.960
is to haul water. Flip to the next picture--oh,
go back, I'm sorry, I thought I had another

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.960
picture there.
&gt;&gt; THUROW: No.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.880
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: But she's got the stone that she
bounces on her head and her job is to go on

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:18.701
in the morning, walk in to this village and
collect water. Walk along the road and bring

00:48:18.701 --> 00:48:26.609
it back to her family which could be kilometers.
One day the SUV I was traveling in broke down

00:48:26.609 --> 00:48:34.380
and there's a hill and it was like a 135 degrees,
and I thought we were completely isolated

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.310
and deserted and nobody was going to find
us, and I kept seeing shimmers out in the

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:42.770
distance, and I realized that they were like
little girls. They don't--they saw strangers

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.622
on the road so they're weren't going to walk
by us. So, they were walking about a half

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:50.550
of kilometer, a quarter of kilometer away
just carrying water back and forth, just like

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:58.450
that. The difference that her family, and
she's from a farming family, they barely make

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:03.190
enough to survive through they year. If they
were able to grow enough on their land not

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:07.370
just to feed themselves, but to have something
more to grow, they could have afford to pay

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:10.410
the fees where she could go to school, and
she wouldn't be hauling water.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:13.750
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Which is this, this is a school
in Mali, and this is where she should be.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:20.240
These are, majority are girls, and this is
a school feeding program and one of the great

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.290
things that's also great for the, it's a great
incentive for African farmers, for somebody

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:28.860
to buy, the World Food Program, Howard Buffet,
others involved, the Gates Foundation, to

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:33.740
buy the crops that the African farmers themselves
grow, give them a market, can keep the price

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:38.599
up, gives them incentive to grow as much as
they can, and it feeds the school children

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:45.609
of Africa. If the parents of this girl, if
she could go to school and bring--and be fed

00:49:45.609 --> 00:49:50.040
in school, and then for a lot of the girls
they give them a monthly ration to take home

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.700
of both food and cooking oil. If her parents,
if she could do that and bring that home,

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:59.000
her parents would say, "Your time is more
valuable to us as an economic commodity, you

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.600
go to school. You'll get fed in school that's
one less mouth for us to feed and you will

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:08.130
bring food home for the family." So school
feeding is one of the great things of African,

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:15.400
and also a lot of people can make a difference.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: We'll just move the slides if you

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.359
have any questions. We've been prattling on,
you may have any questions?

00:50:20.359 --> 00:50:30.800
&gt;&gt; First of all, thanks a lot for coming;
I really enjoyed your talk. So, you set up

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.050
this talk basically saying that the Green
Revolution is this great thing and if only,

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:38.050
you know, the rest of the world had access
to it. But, there's been a lot of discourse

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:41.990
lately that [INDISTINCT] Green Revolution
is a lot of, cause of a lot of ecological

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.490
problems that we have and it's not clear to
me at least that the Green Revolution everywhere

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:50.471
is necessarily a good thing. So, somebody
who cares about both the issues of starvation

00:50:50.471 --> 00:50:54.450
and also the issue of the environment which
seems also ultimately relatively troubling.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:58.140
Do I have to choose between these two things
right, like, do I have to say, "All right,

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:03.819
put off the environment and say green evolution
for everybody and then every one eats or can

00:51:03.819 --> 00:51:08.030
I have them both?"
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Okay. So that's a great question.

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:15.880
The Green Revolution of Asia in 1960s and
1970s isn't what we want and isn't the Green

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:20.380
Revolution that would work in Africa today
and it's a different Green Revo--different

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:24.970
Green Revolution. Green Revolution is actually
a very loaded term because it gets associated

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:29.339
with the heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers.
There was a lot of--when they started it in

00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:35.550
the 1960s and '70s, they didn't know enough--they
didn't as much as they know now. So, what

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:39.010
had had happened there, you know, farmers
who have been starving one year, they have

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:44.030
a big crop because they start putting fertilizer
on it. And so, they said, "Gee, that was great,

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:50.260
more would be better." And they put too much
on, and they got into the water ways. Since

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:55.339
that time, we've learned a lot more about
how not to waste fertilizer. I mean, the farmers

00:51:55.339 --> 00:51:59.100
quickly realized that, you know, if you put
on too much, you're wasting it, why spend

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:04.540
that money on it? So, in Africa, we've gotten
to the point now where you--I think you could

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:08.980
much more micro-manage the amount of fertilizer
and the insecticides that you use, that you

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:16.550
can avoid those problems or a lot of those
problems. But I also say this that what happened,

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:23.069
you know, in the 1960s and 1970s, the famine
stopped other than North Korea. You know,

00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:27.650
famine stopped in Asia. If you--if we were
talking about this in 1960s and 1970s, you

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:31.060
would think that were be the best thing that
could possibly happen. Well, now, in hindsight,

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:35.000
we can look back and we're not worried about
famine in Asia anymore. So, we can worry about

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:44.089
things like, "Gee, they were excesses that
occurred. It's--what you're arguing about

00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:51.930
is which is worse, problems of scarcity or
problems of abundance? You know, problems

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:57.570
of scarcity are a lot harder to fix than problems
of abundance. So now, we have more food in

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:03.240
Asia. Now we can be better growing it. We
don't have to worry about producing such massive

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:09.680
amount so quickly. We can be more scientific,
more surgical about how we do it. In Africa,

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.630
I wouldn't want, I wouldn't want this--you
would want to do the same type of agricultural

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:23.020
development that you did in Asia; it's a different,
much more complicated. Asia has a lot of lands,

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:28.160
you could grow two crops in Asia and have
a huge effect. You grow a lot more rice and

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.099
wheat in Asia and have a huge effect on hunger.
In Africa, there are many more crops that

00:53:33.099 --> 00:53:39.740
are grown. I mean, there's sorghum and [INDISTINCT]
some people depend on cassava and some people

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:47.510
depend on bananas. So, you have to have, basically,
like it's the phrase has been filled as a

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:57.180
mosaic. Revolutions. There has to be different
revolution or different parts of the continent.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:04.131
And I think in Africa, you can have a much
bigger impact than you—initially, if we

00:54:04.131 --> 00:54:11.660
just focus on trying to get--teach farmers
how to be good farmers just, you know--I would

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:17.000
say this too that, now we have technology
we didn't have in the '60s, we have biotechnology.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.599
And there are ways to get seeds to the farmers
that are drought--or soon that will be a drought

00:54:20.599 --> 00:54:24.980
resistant that will help them in ways they
never had in Asia. So, I don't think you have

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:30.261
to pick or choose. It's just fighting the
right--the modern science to use in Africa.

00:54:30.261 --> 00:54:35.290
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Please.
&gt;&gt; So, I have one comment and a question.

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:38.950
The comment was there's also a guy called
Henry Beachell, have you ever heard of him?

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:44.390
He is similar to your guy about the wheat.
He developed a strain of rice, that was very

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:49.359
efficient and saved a billion lives and then
lived to be a hundred years old and died last

00:54:49.359 --> 00:54:51.470
year, I read this in his obituary last year
but--so...

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:54.010
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: He was at the Rice Institute in
the Philippines, right?

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:58.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, I think so. I mean, that's
all I know about him. But, yeah, they call

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:06.950
him; you talked about the Doha Ran and just
trade in general. Would you agree that farm

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:11.109
subsidies, agricultural subsidies in Europe
and America are probably the single biggest

00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:20.891
factor in terms of sort of fixing the economics
of food in the world? And, if so, what do

00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:27.730
you think is the sort of that level of awareness
politically because their farm subsidies are

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:34.030
also not benefiting the general consumer,
the general population in North America and

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.420
Western Europe as well?
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Yes.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:41.500
&gt;&gt; So, it's really benefiting 1% of western
population at the expense the whole, the rest

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:46.720
of the world. So, how do you see the political
dynamics? Do you think Doha Ran will be successful?

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:51.240
Do you think farm subsidies will go away in
the west and fix the economics?

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:57.329
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Yeah. I mean, in terms of awareness,
I mean, the politicians are all certainly

00:55:57.329 --> 00:56:05.000
and definitely aware of this. It is--the counter
balance to that is the very powerful farm

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:14.950
organizations and farm lobbies in the United
States and in Europe. You know, and that basically

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:20.280
blocks in the way, and we go into this in
quite detail in the book, and kind of a way

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:28.200
the Farmville is almost rigged that it's going
to have the results that it does instead of

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:33.010
dismantling or bringing down the farm subsidies,
you know, to some extent but, you know.

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:40.700
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: But here's to, this is to complicate
though. I'll make it--I never make it easy,

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:45.160
I'm complicated but, we started subsidizing
American farmers in 1930s during the Great

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:49.109
Depression because it's a very efficient way
to fight poverty. Most farms in the United

00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:54.160
States in 1930 were poor. That's where the--that
was the epicenter of poverty even during the

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.079
Great Depression. And so, we were trying to
figure out, the Roosevelt administration was

00:56:59.079 --> 00:57:04.790
trying to get money into the pockets of these
people. And they did it by subsidizing their

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:12.630
crop production. And it was very effective.
It worked. What's--the issue now is that in

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:16.310
this last decade and then this decade, the
average farm family in the United States is

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:21.240
now wealthier than the average U.S. family.
So, does it make it, you know, subsidies are

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:30.730
no longer needed as a--can no longer be justified
as a poverty fighting mechanism. So, one of

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:33.910
the things you have to think about it, you
know, we don't have an issue with, you know,

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:40.480
the $20 or $25 billion--it depends on the
U.S. government spends on subsidizing farmers,

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.980
it's--the issue is how do you subsidize it?
If you subsidize per bushel crop production,

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:49.180
if you give them money for every bushel of
crop they produce it, it encourages them to

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:54.690
over produce. And that causes prices to fall
on the international markets and--which means

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:59.210
that farmers that aren't subsidized aren't
protected when prices fall, they really--they

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:04.180
get hurt. So, what's interesting about subsidies
is that overseas and in Africa, it's a huge

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:08.710
issue. I mean, everybody will talk to you
about it; in United States, not so much. We

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:14.130
have plenty of food and not that much of an
issue and we all like farmers. So, you know,

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:19.359
we--do we really want to take money away from
them, why? You know. They don't see it in

00:58:19.359 --> 00:58:24.560
that kind of perspective. Our argument is
that, your subsidies are effective way to

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:29.470
fight poverty, if they could justify the 1930s
in the United States, why don't they justify

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:38.200
it in Africa now? What happens is that you
have donors and governments didn't want subsidies

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:42.160
used in Africa. And we think that's--didn't
want farmers to be subsidized there. They

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.980
thought it was an inefficient economic policy.
Not good for them, okay for us, not good for

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:54.190
them. We don't think that's right anyway.
&gt;&gt; So, we, a few years ago, we had Jeffrey

00:58:54.190 --> 00:59:00.650
Sachs come and speak to us and sort of the
Jeffrey Sachs in the Bono Camp, any other

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:07.369
development economist, I've certain to has,
you know, a lot of concerns about the million

00:59:07.369 --> 00:59:12.160
goals and the UNDP and so on. I'm interested
in your thoughts about the UNDP and a million

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.921
of the goals and where they factor in to all
of this?

00:59:14.921 --> 00:59:17.820
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Concern meaning whether there'll
be met or are they the right goals?

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:24.460
&gt;&gt; Whether their aims that, you know, are
going to solve some of the problems that you're

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.000
talking about.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Well, I mean, we know that the

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.470
millennium--to us, the most important millennium
development goal was to reduce the prevalence

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:37.599
of hunger by half by 2015. So, in the year
2000, when the development goals formed, you

00:59:37.599 --> 00:59:43.320
know, the goal was the World Powers wanted
to see the prevalence of hunger, the percent

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:49.270
of the world that's hungry fall by half by
2015. You know, last year and this year, the

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:54.359
prevalence of hunger actually rose. So, in
the 1970s or early 1970s, nobody has really

00:59:54.359 --> 00:59:57.420
good numbers because we didn't really do a
good job counting hungry people back then

00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:02.770
but, it's a good guess that 25% of the world
population was chronically malnourished. They

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:06.950
went to bed hungry every night. That's 25%
of the world population. If you want to talk

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:11.750
about the poor nations where you expect to
find hunger, one in three went hungry to bed

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:19.540
every night. By the--a few years ago, you
know, they trended lower, lower, lower, mostly

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:24.470
because the population continued to grow as
the number of hungry stayed the same around

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:26.109
850.
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Million.

01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:31.440
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: But now, the numbers of hungry
are growing again; faster than population.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:37.240
So, for the first time since 1970, the prevalence
of hunger started to grow again. It tried

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:43.900
to pop up. It's impossible that the world
will meet--the World Powers will satisfy their

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:50.110
promise of cutting hunger in half. But as
the World Powers ever had, ever lived up to

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.650
their promise to cut to…
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Yeah, I mean, even Kofi Annan,

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:58.119
he was the Secretary General at that time,
like he's kind of admitted, they're throwing

01:00:58.119 --> 01:01:02.690
in the towel, in not in his efforts because
he's very involved in it, but that's one of

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:08.089
the goals, it is the first goal and that will
be met. I think the beneficial thing of what

01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:14.660
the UNDP does and somebody like Bono, is they
at least bring attention to these issues and

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:20.320
say "People, pay attention." One can argue
about you know, the way he used to do what

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:27.150
Jeffrey Sachs, very big on development aid;
the counter argument by William Easterly and

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:33.670
now by Dambisa Moyo, who's kind of repeating
for taking up Easterly's argument, is that,

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:37.839
you know, aid is not the right way to do it.
There's a better financing mechanisms and

01:01:37.839 --> 01:01:43.490
things. But the UN, by their efforts and Bono,
it's, at least, this is a problem, people

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:47.900
think about it, let's do something about it
and we can have these arguments which are

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:53.109
very beneficial about how's the best way to
do it. But we've got to think about the--think

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:58.130
about these girls, think about everybody we've
seen in this fight and farmers. And, it's

01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:05.069
Norman Borlaug's criminal neglect. And that's
the big movement and cry of them, and particularly,

01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:12.280
Bono, that stop neglect. Stop the stupid poverty.
And it's something that we can do--we can

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.970
do something about.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: We're giving long answers.

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:21.450
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Right.
&gt;&gt; So, this is on the topic of outrage and

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:26.440
inspiration and what, you know, the average
American can do. So, do you think--what do

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:31.520
you think is the outrage level of the average
American and how can people who are outraged

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.950
get everybody else outraged? And what do you
think is the ability for people to actually

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:40.970
do something that inspires them to say, "I
have made a difference," and do you think

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:47.150
there's--what steps can be taken to make it
because I actually, you know, I'm troubled

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:51.839
by these issues and I don't really know what
do about it. And, you know, how do we get

01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:54.171
more people knowing what they can about it?
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Right.

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:57.650
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: I think, I was--do you think I'll
give the, you get the long answer; I'll get

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:02.680
the short one. I think what's what really
intrigues me is that, you know, I believe

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.830
there are people out there that have solutions
now and probably your age, they don't know

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:09.390
they have it and I don't know they have it
because they haven't been over there to see

01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:13.140
what they know. For example, like one of the
things that are intriguing when I was in Africa

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:17.150
is the difference the cell phones make. That
if you have a cell phone in a village, now

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:21.990
they're connected to the world, and you can
send them prices, and they could start finding

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:27.070
out if they're getting a fair deal from their
local merchant or not. I think another way

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.450
that people can make difference is just a
little thing is if you go to Africa and you

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:34.589
know about, and you try to teach people how
democracy works. I mean, one of the things

01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:38.680
that intrigues me in Africa is that United
States farmers are very powerful, they're

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:43.049
very powerful lobby. They're 2% of population
but they're certainly can, God bless them.

01:03:43.049 --> 01:03:48.349
But, in Africa, farmers are very, very--they
don't have any power but their democracy is

01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:53.260
spreading though Africa now. They all have
one vote. They're just what the [INDISTINCT]

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:57.569
realize and "Geez, we could use our votes
to actually elect people who are going to

01:03:57.569 --> 01:04:01.550
care about us." But people have, you know,
they don't have that kind of culture, they

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.290
don't have that experience. So, now, people
can make a difference through--go ahead, you

01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:07.420
can do that sort of thing.
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Yeah. I mean, there's also, also

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:14.281
to marvelous organizations that are very committed
and passionate and involved in this and we

01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:20.000
write about a number of them in the book.
I mean, there's all sorts of faith based organizations

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.849
across the entire religious phase spectrum.
You know, there's bread for the world. There's

01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:33.410
an organization called Food is a Resource,
a bank that's doing very innovative things

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:39.340
in farming communities and it connects people
in American communities, individuals farmers

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.799
here and what they can do…
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: CARE, World Vision.

01:04:41.799 --> 01:04:49.000
&gt;&gt; THUROW: There's CARE, World Vision, the
ONE campaign, you know, they're, at least,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.270
give structure to you and to any others who--and
all the others who are in to this. And I think,

01:04:56.270 --> 01:05:00.569
I mean, in terms of your question of the outrage,
I think the outrage is building and we kind

01:05:00.569 --> 01:05:08.210
of plot it in the book that, you know, who
basically in the 1990s was interested in the

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:14.280
debt relief issue. That became huge and it
moved, it moved Congress. You know, Jessie

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:19.119
Helms also, to people in Congress, had kind
of, you know, great conversions and they said

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:24.400
they were wrong on foreign aid and things
and so, AIDS. The outcry that was, that was

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.080
over the AIDS issue, that all kind of has
come from boil up, boil it up from the grass

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:34.200
roots and what you can see in these organizations,
we kind of implant this history in the book

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.790
that it moves kind of from engaging in the
issues. So, the debt relief issue. Well, that

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:44.420
has tremendous impact on the farmers too.
The AIDS issue, a tremendous impact on the

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:49.799
farmers because in 2003, it was the only famine
in Ethiopia; there was huge hunger problems

01:05:49.799 --> 01:05:55.530
elsewhere in Africa all the way down to east
coast and in Southern Africa. By 2003, seven

01:05:55.530 --> 01:06:00.020
million farmers in Africa died of AIDS; seven
million people not planting crops anymore.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:06.819
They're are kids, the orphan headed households,
they had no idea how to plant, how to do anything,

01:06:06.819 --> 01:06:13.250
how to tend their crops, that spread hunger.
So it became kind of an AIDS-induced famine.

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:19.010
And so, by engagement and these other issues,
it should all eventually come to the hunger

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:21.040
issue.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: You know, I try to make to the

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.510
book is that there really hasn't been [INDISTINCT]
constituency to fight hunger for hunger's

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:29.510
sake, you know. And we try to talk in the
book about why that's necessarily and how

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:33.730
to do that. I know we're running out of time,
but if you--on your other question like the

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:38.190
specific things you can do, you can always
email us, we can up with ideas. I could share,

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:41.299
contact with our people. We have a website,
what's the—enough, Enough, the book.

01:06:41.299 --> 01:06:44.640
&gt;&gt; THUROW: enoughthebook.com.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: .com and our email addresses are

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.589
on it.
&gt;&gt; THUROW: I also wanted to say that the advocacy

01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:53.260
is a great thing, I mean, it's just, you know,
the advocacy with your congress people, with

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:59.119
the senators, even people, you know, the state,
in the state legislatures, you know, to pay

01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:04.390
attention to this issue. On the Food Aid,
the Food Aid situation comes up every year

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:08.730
in congress, and that the more that they're
made aware of this, stop, you know, sending

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:15.339
all American food, make it 50%, 50% food of
the Food Aid budget, 50%, 50% cash. They use

01:07:15.339 --> 01:07:19.859
all the cash and send more food or something,
but at least have the flexibility to subsidies,

01:07:19.859 --> 01:07:24.609
pound home the subsidies issues with your,
you know, with your representatives. The Blue

01:07:24.609 --> 01:07:28.319
Nile issue; all these things that we talked
about, I mean, straighten out those things.

01:07:28.319 --> 01:07:33.180
The Doha, you know, get on top of the--make
it sure a development round and, you know,

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:37.460
pin down the representatives. You know, we
just had the presidential campaign but it

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:42.339
all stops, you know, few of the questions
even from the moderators on the debates, you

01:07:42.339 --> 01:07:45.420
know, what are you going to do about the hunger
situation in the world? You know, it's getting

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.450
worse.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Looks like you need to wrap up.

01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:47.450
So…
&gt;&gt; THUMROW: Yup.

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:50.050
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: I'll wrap it, so you have one more--did
you have a question again?

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:59.440
&gt;&gt; Well, let me just cover those, I was going
say the subsidies and sourcing aid locally.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.720
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Right.
&gt;&gt; I would think those are the two biggest

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.720
things and those are political things there.
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Right.

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.720
&gt;&gt; The Congress, I think, that's the biggest…
&gt;&gt; THUROW: Yup. And they're dealing with them

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.839
every year. And so, it's when you get a critical
mass and this constituency builds that basically

01:08:07.839 --> 01:08:12.270
says for heaven's sakes, let's deal with this
issue. It's an outrage, you know, we should

01:08:12.270 --> 01:08:16.460
be all ashamed of ourselves. So, it's the
right thing to do. That's our final pitch

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:23.230
all, I have things to do. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; KILMAN: Thank you.
