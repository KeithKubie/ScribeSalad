00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.770
Born in Sydney Australia in 1905, Henry Robert
Pearce, better known as Bobby Pearce, dominated

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.650
the world of competitive rowing throughout
the 1920s and 1930s and was extremely popular

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.720
with fans of the sport due to a combination
of the ease with which he seemed to best opponents

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.570
and his affable personality.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.670
Perhaps the greatest example of both of these
things in action was the time Pearce stopped

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.620
mid-race to allow a duck and her ducklings
to pass in front of him and still won.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.340
This particular anecdote from Pearce’s life
occurred at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
during the quarter final of the single sculls
event in the Sloten canal.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.330
For anyone unfamiliar, the single sculls is
essentially a race between individual opponents

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.890
along a body of water and it has been a staple
of the Olympic program since 1896.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.269
Prior to taking part in the quarter final
event at the 1928 Olympics, Pearce had already

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.549
made quite a splash with locals by beating
his previous two opponents by nearly 30 seconds

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.950
each, winning his first event with such a
comfortable lead that, according to a contemporary

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.710
report from the Sydney Morning Herald, he
pulled up before the finish line to wait for

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.380
his opponent to catch up a little.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.409
Pearce’s opponent on the fateful duck match
quarter final was a Frenchman called Vincent

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.609
Saurin, a powerful rower who during his career
would win nine national titles and medal at

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.579
three European championships.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.109
Despite his opponent’s pedigree, Pearce
was able to effortlessly pull away and secure

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:33.200
himself a near half-minute lead before the
half way mark of the 2000 metre race.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.310
In an interview with historian Henry Roxborough
in 1976, Pearce recounted what happened next.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090
I heard wild roars from the crowd along the
bank of the canal.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.140
I could see some spectators vigorously pointing
to something behind me, in my path.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.969
I peeked over one shoulder and saw something
I didn’t like, for a family of ducks in

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.549
single file was swimming slowly from shore
to shore.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.409
It’s funny now, but it wasn’t at the time
for I had to lean on my oars and wait for

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.409
a clear course…

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.659
“Had to lean on my oars…” isn’t quite
accurate.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.049
He could have simply plowed through them,
but chose to pull up.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.549
While all this was happening, Saurin made
up the lead Pearce had secured and, showing

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.819
far less concern for the welfare of the ducks
than Pearce had, capitalised on his opponents’

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.610
unlikely stint as a duck crossing guard and
blew past him, stealing himself a five length

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.060
lead before Pearce started rowing again.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.640
Remarkably, in the final 1,000 metres of the
race, not only did Pearce catch up to the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.641
Frenchman, but he was able to once again get
far enough ahead to secure an almost 30 second

00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.090
lead by the finish line.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.220
In the end, Pearce finished the race with
a time of 7:42.8 vs. Saurin’s 8:11.8.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.519
This, in of itself would be impressive, but
it should also be noted that not only was

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.800
Pearce able to beat Saurin by nearly half
a minute after coming to a complete stop in

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.300
the middle of the race, but in that race he
also finished with the fastest time of any

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.420
of the eight competitors that round.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.750
We should also probably mention that this
was during the elimination portion of the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.620
competition meaning Pearce had risked his
chance of winning an Olympic medal for his

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.090
country in his first Olympics to let the ducks
pass.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.490
Unsurprisingly, Pearce ultimately won the
gold medal for that event, beating out the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.450
previously undefeated American Kenneth Myers
with a new world record for the 2,000 metre

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.810
event with a time of 7:11.0.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.500
This record stood for an astounding 44 years,
finally beaten in 1972 by Yuri Malishev of

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.780
the Soviet Union.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.890
As for the formerly undefeated Myers, his
time in that face-off was a nearly equally

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.970
remarkable 7:20.8, which would have been a
new world record, beating the old by almost

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.970
15 seconds, if not for Pearce’s time.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.970
(For reference, today the world record is
currently held by Mahé Drysdale of New Zealand

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.970
with a time of 6:33.35, which he set in Poland
in 2009.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.970
As for the Olympic record, it was recently
set in 2012 in London by Tim Maeyens of Belgium

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.970
with a time of 6:42.52 in the first heat.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.970
However, the gold medal in that Olympics went
to Drysdale with a time of 6:57.82 seconds

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.970
in the final.)

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.970
Despite his incredible talent, as Pearce was
barred from competing for money if he wished

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.202
to continue competing in the Olympics, he
struggled to make ends meet for much of his

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:44.190
early life, even being unemployed during the
early 1930s, scraping a living by collecting

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.379
scrap paper at the Sydney Showgrounds.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.370
His fortunes turned around, however, when
he met Scottish whisky magnate Lord Dewar,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.019
who happily offered Pearce a job selling his
whisky as his official Canadian representative,

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.690
prompting Pearce to move to Canada, where
he lived the rest of his life.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.870
Despite the move, Pearce continued to compete
for Australia in the 1932 Olympics, in which

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.209
he defended his title, winning the gold by
narrowly beating out American William Miller

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.079
by a mere 1.1 seconds in the final.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.150
While that was a close finish, it should be
noted that the nearest competitors behind

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.489
those two finished a whopping 30 seconds back.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.150
Shortly after the 1932 Olympics concluded,
Pearce decided to turn pro, barring him from

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.400
future Olympics, but at least allowing him
to earn some money at his greatest skill while

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.740
his body was still up to it.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.000
Pearce’s professional career was decidedly
uneventful… by which we mean he won every

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.180
event he took part in and none of his races
involved ducks.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.900
He eventually retired undefeated as an adult
in 1938.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.190
That same year, he even managed to win a title
defense race in Toronto just a few days after

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.070
his wife unexpectedly died.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.250
In fact, while we know he must have lost several
matches before his first competitive victory

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.740
at 14 years old, the only definitive record
we could find of Pearce ever losing a sculling

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.960
match was his first one when he was six years
old, which was a 16 year old and under youth

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960
competition.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.380
He finished second in that race.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.340
After retiring from the sport, Pearce tried
his hand at being a professional wrestler

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.000
before joining the Canadian war effort during
WW2 as part of the Naval reserves.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.820
He served in the navy until 1956, retiring
as a lieutenant commander.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.520
He subsequently spent the rest of his life
selling whisky on behalf of Lord Dewar in

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.330
Canada, later dying of a heart attack at the
age of 70 in 1976.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.800
Before his sculling career, Pearce served
in the Australian army where he was the Army

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.850
heavyweight boxing champion.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.800
Australians have historically always done
well at rowing events and rowers, such as

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.690
Pearce, had long attributed this to the fact
Australians train in the seas rather than

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.950
rivers and lakes, which are rougher and harder
to control oneself in.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.040
For Pearce, he was also aided by the fact
that he had a rather unique training regime

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.040
(for the time, though very common today for
virtually anyone wanting to get in great shape,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040
let alone pro-athletes), using interval training.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.200
In his case, he would sprint for a quarter
mile in his craft, then rest for a time, then

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.120
sprint again, etc. Pearce would alternate
this with long distance rowing as his primary

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:06.600
methods of training.
