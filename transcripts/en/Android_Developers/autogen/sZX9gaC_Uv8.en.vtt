jelly bean those icons seem to disappear
I was just wondering if that's

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030
I was just wondering if that's
 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.690
I was just wondering if that's
intentional or a bug in my code no

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700
intentional or a bug in my code no
 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.499
intentional or a bug in my code no
that's what he is intended okay cool you

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509
that's what he is intended okay cool you
 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:07.969
that's what he is intended okay cool you
know any reason why they decided to get

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
know any reason why they decided to get
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.910
know any reason why they decided to get
rid of those I mean I I don't know you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
rid of those I mean I I don't know you
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770
rid of those I mean I I don't know you
put it's probably question for the UX

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
put it's probably question for the UX
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020
put it's probably question for the UX
team but they decided that if their menu

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
team but they decided that if their menu
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.370
team but they decided that if their menu
would just be textual okay I was a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
would just be textual okay I was a
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.660
would just be textual okay I was a
simple answer yeah look at the moderator

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
simple answer yeah look at the moderator
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240
simple answer yeah look at the moderator
I believe that I I hit upon the correct

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
I believe that I I hit upon the correct
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070
I believe that I I hit upon the correct
answer right away which was to say I'll

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
answer right away which was to say I'll
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.370
answer right away which was to say I'll
let Nick answer this and there it was

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380
let Nick answer this and there it was
 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.660
let Nick answer this and there it was
yeah you can I've seen other

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
yeah you can I've seen other
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.090
yeah you can I've seen other
applications override it and do more

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
applications override it and do more
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.500
applications override it and do more
interesting menus I think chrome for

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510
interesting menus I think chrome for
 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.910
interesting menus I think chrome for
example there's some stuff where it puts

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
example there's some stuff where it puts
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.090
example there's some stuff where it puts
the first overflow item is actually you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
the first overflow item is actually you
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.500
the first overflow item is actually you
know three it's the forward and back and

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510
know three it's the forward and back and
 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.969
know three it's the forward and back and
start buttons I think so they've done

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
start buttons I think so they've done
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.840
start buttons I think so they've done
something a little bit more creative

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
something a little bit more creative
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.060
something a little bit more creative
with iconography so it's possible to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
with iconography so it's possible to
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.620
with iconography so it's possible to
kind of override the implementation and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
kind of override the implementation and
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.940
kind of override the implementation and
do something with I clocked with us

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
do something with I clocked with us
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.499
do something with I clocked with us
super important to you but I'd probably

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
super important to you but I'd probably
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.870
super important to you but I'd probably
stick to the 2,000 default unless you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
stick to the 2,000 default unless you
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.539
stick to the 2,000 default unless you
have good reasons to deviate nice way to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
have good reasons to deviate nice way to
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.160
have good reasons to deviate nice way to
make sure it wasn't a bug that's all I

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170
make sure it wasn't a bug that's all I
 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.679
make sure it wasn't a bug that's all I
have to say that putting reserving the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
have to say that putting reserving the
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.509
have to say that putting reserving the
icons for the action bar gives you I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519
icons for the action bar gives you I
 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.979
icons for the action bar gives you I
think maybe a little more incentive to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
think maybe a little more incentive to
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.140
think maybe a little more incentive to
put your your your colorful and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
put your your your colorful and
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.910
put your your your colorful and
interesting actions out there and not

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
interesting actions out there and not
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.920
interesting actions out there and not
hide them in the overflow well

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
hide them in the overflow well
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.449
hide them in the overflow well
I don't know yeah it's also quite

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459
I don't know yeah it's also quite
 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.550
I don't know yeah it's also quite
important to provide text and icons for

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
important to provide text and icons for
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.110
important to provide text and icons for
everything because the way the action

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120
everything because the way the action
 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.539
everything because the way the action
bar works with the if room and so on you

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549
bar works with the if room and so on you
 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.949
bar works with the if room and so on you
just don't you can't guarantee

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959
just don't you can't guarantee
 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.630
just don't you can't guarantee
deterministically how many icons are

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
deterministically how many icons are
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.860
deterministically how many icons are
going to be shown depending on the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
going to be shown depending on the
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.259
going to be shown depending on the
device and platform changes and all this

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269
device and platform changes and all this
 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.780
device and platform changes and all this
good stuff so yes is super important to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
good stuff so yes is super important to
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.899
good stuff so yes is super important to
provide a title even if you only even if

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909
provide a title even if you only even if
 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.179
provide a title even if you only even if
you just have an icon and you say always

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189
you just have an icon and you say always
 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.309
you just have an icon and you say always
show this because you know that that

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
show this because you know that that
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.809
show this because you know that that
same title text will be used for the

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819
same title text will be used for the
 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.910
same title text will be used for the
long press tooltip so it's just really

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920
long press tooltip so it's just really
 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.530
long press tooltip so it's just really
important to provide provide both really

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540
 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.449

I'll just try to work out if there's a

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909
I'll just try to work out if there's a
 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.500
I'll just try to work out if there's a
way of doing animated Launcher icons or

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
way of doing animated Launcher icons or
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.490
way of doing animated Launcher icons or

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379
of the the launcher icon
 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.420
of the the launcher icon
I just don't work out if there was a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430
I just don't work out if there was a
 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.610
I just don't work out if there was a
clever way of other animating Launcher

read because I mean I do a lot of

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.640
read because I mean I do a lot of
 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.490

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500
research and I can see this is a
 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.170

important area they're still different

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180
important area they're still different
 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.280
important area they're still different
looks like they're still defining the

looks like they're still defining the
 

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.810
looks like they're still defining the
actual specs at the moment but I'll

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:56.820
actual specs at the moment but I'll
 

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.400

so at the moment my take on it it's not

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:30.630

a subject I know a ton about but I

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:32.400
a subject I know a ton about but I

believe there are some devices already

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:34.349
believe there are some devices already
 

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:35.930
believe there are some devices already
supported like in the silicone already

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940
supported like in the silicone already
 

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.150
supported like in the silicone already
and in the market like the Galaxy s3 and

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.160
and in the market like the Galaxy s3 and
 

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.579
and in the market like the Galaxy s3 and
so forth and I think in some cases we

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:40.589
so forth and I think in some cases we
 

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:42.680
so forth and I think in some cases we
even take advantage of it I think maybe

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:42.690
even take advantage of it I think maybe
 

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.060
even take advantage of it I think maybe
in some of our DRM stuff I'm not

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.070

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.820
in some of our DRM stuff I'm not
entirely sure but I don't think there's

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:46.830
entirely sure but I don't think there's
 

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.370
entirely sure but I don't think there's
any platform api's yet I think it's all

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380
any platform api's yet I think it's all
 

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.740
any platform api's yet I think it's all
quite device specific at the moment okay

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:51.750
quite device specific at the moment okay
 

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.150

that bad boy go out really I think yeah
if you need assets yeah I think if you

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.110
if you need assets yeah I think if you
 

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.390
if you need assets yeah I think if you
pink hair you'll probably get response

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:53.400
pink hair you'll probably get response
 

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:00.230
pink hair you'll probably get response

okay so first unanswered question on the

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:18.570
okay so first unanswered question on the
 

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.440
okay so first unanswered question on the
moderator activity hosting multiple

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:21.450
moderator activity hosting multiple
 

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.440
moderator activity hosting multiple
fragments each fragment uses data from

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:24.450
fragments each fragment uses data from
 

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.600
fragments each fragment uses data from
the same table of a local database would

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:26.610
the same table of a local database would
 

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.490
the same table of a local database would
it be better to load table data into a

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500
it be better to load table data into a
 

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.280
it be better to load table data into a
singleton pojo in activity rather than

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.290
singleton pojo in activity rather than
 

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.510
singleton pojo in activity rather than
loaders in each fragment

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:32.520
loaders in each fragment
 

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.580
loaders in each fragment
how can activity broadcast fragments

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:34.590
how can activity broadcast fragments
 

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.060
how can activity broadcast fragments
unload complete he this is Martin as he

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.070
unload complete he this is Martin as he
 

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.640
unload complete he this is Martin as he
goes on to say I know how to use

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:40.650
goes on to say I know how to use
 

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.440
goes on to say I know how to use
interface methods to access data in

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.450
interface methods to access data in
 

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.000
interface methods to access data in
activity from the fragment I just don't

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.010
activity from the fragment I just don't
 

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.710
activity from the fragment I just don't
know how the activity can tell the

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720
know how the activity can tell the
 

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.570
know how the activity can tell the
fragment it's loaded the data so the

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:47.580
fragment it's loaded the data so the
 

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.040
fragment it's loaded the data so the
fragment can hide the indeterminate

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.050
fragment can hide the indeterminate
 

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.890
fragment can hide the indeterminate
progress and paint the data maybe loader

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:51.900
progress and paint the data maybe loader
 

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.110
progress and paint the data maybe loader
is not that much of a problem when each

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120
is not that much of a problem when each
 

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.790
is not that much of a problem when each
fragment needs the data from web service

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800
fragment needs the data from web service
 

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.140
fragment needs the data from web service
then it makes sense for the activity to

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.150
then it makes sense for the activity to
 

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.410
then it makes sense for the activity to
do a single web service call so this

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420
do a single web service call so this
 

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.940
do a single web service call so this
sounds like kind of a familiar design

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:01.950
sounds like kind of a familiar design
 

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.280
sounds like kind of a familiar design
pattern to me you've got you've got a

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.290
pattern to me you've got you've got a
 

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.750
pattern to me you've got you've got a
data store you want to show it in

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760
data store you want to show it in
 

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.240
data store you want to show it in
possibly multiple places each and a

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.250
possibly multiple places each and a
 

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.880
possibly multiple places each and a
fragment and you've got this very long

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:10.890
fragment and you've got this very long
 

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.450
fragment and you've got this very long
slow method of getting the data from the

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:14.460
slow method of getting the data from the
 

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.460
slow method of getting the data from the
web which could take an indeterminate

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:16.470
web which could take an indeterminate
 

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.020
web which could take an indeterminate
long time it could take seconds or even

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:18.030
long time it could take seconds or even
 

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.070
long time it could take seconds or even
minutes to fetch the data this is this

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:22.080
minutes to fetch the data this is this
 

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.720
minutes to fetch the data this is this
kind of follows I think in the pattern

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:23.730
kind of follows I think in the pattern
 

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.400
kind of follows I think in the pattern
of like the RSS reader

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:26.410
of like the RSS reader
 

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.710
of like the RSS reader
that I wrote earlier this year and what

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720
that I wrote earlier this year and what
 

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.300
that I wrote earlier this year and what
I did to solve the problem in that case

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:30.310
I did to solve the problem in that case
 

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.840
I did to solve the problem in that case
was I use a sequel database to host the

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:33.850
was I use a sequel database to host the
 

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.939
was I use a sequel database to host the
data locally I used a content provider

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:35.949
data locally I used a content provider
 

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.369
data locally I used a content provider
to publish it and then loaders wait so

00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:38.379
to publish it and then loaders wait so
 

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:40.650
to publish it and then loaders wait so
that the the loaders and the content

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:40.660
that the the loaders and the content
 

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.790
that the the loaders and the content
provider worked out between themselves

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800
provider worked out between themselves
 

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.519
provider worked out between themselves
when the data needed to be refreshed in

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:44.529
when the data needed to be refreshed in
 

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:47.040
when the data needed to be refreshed in
that case my my fragments really didn't

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.050
that case my my fragments really didn't
 

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.960
that case my my fragments really didn't
have to do a whole lot now it is true

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:48.970
have to do a whole lot now it is true
 

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.889
have to do a whole lot now it is true
that I did not I did not put any code

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:52.899
that I did not I did not put any code
 

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:56.429
that I did not I did not put any code
into my detail fragment to look for a

00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:56.439
into my detail fragment to look for a
 

00:13:56.439 --> 00:13:57.749
into my detail fragment to look for a
change in the data because I was

00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759
change in the data because I was
 

00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.220
change in the data because I was
expecting the data to be quite static

00:13:59.220 --> 00:13:59.230
expecting the data to be quite static
 

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.170
expecting the data to be quite static
but the ListView definitely updated

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:01.180
but the ListView definitely updated
 

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.699
but the ListView definitely updated
dynamically as as the database changed I

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:04.709
dynamically as as the database changed I
 

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:07.019
dynamically as as the database changed I
did not do an indeterminate progress

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:07.029
did not do an indeterminate progress
 

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:08.939
did not do an indeterminate progress
instead basically I just fetched

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:08.949
instead basically I just fetched
 

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.920
instead basically I just fetched
everything more or less invisibly and

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:10.930
everything more or less invisibly and
 

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.050
everything more or less invisibly and
just let the new data magically appear

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.060
just let the new data magically appear
 

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.990
just let the new data magically appear
in the ListView what I did for fetching

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000
in the ListView what I did for fetching
 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.220
in the ListView what I did for fetching
the data was not to put it in the

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.230
the data was not to put it in the
 

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.650
the data was not to put it in the
activity but I put it in an intent to

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:19.660
activity but I put it in an intent to
 

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.980
activity but I put it in an intent to
service and then either a timer kicked

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:22.990
service and then either a timer kicked
 

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.809
service and then either a timer kicked
off by alarm manager or a user interface

00:14:27.809 --> 00:14:27.819
off by alarm manager or a user interface
 

00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:30.300
off by alarm manager or a user interface
button on the action bar would cause an

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:30.310
button on the action bar would cause an
 

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.650
button on the action bar would cause an
intent to be sent to the intent service

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:31.660
intent to be sent to the intent service
 

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.439
intent to be sent to the intent service
to go out to the web data store and and

00:14:34.439 --> 00:14:34.449
to go out to the web data store and and
 

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:37.350
to go out to the web data store and and
fetch new data for me so my answer then

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360
fetch new data for me so my answer then
 

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.400
fetch new data for me so my answer then
was intent service for the web kicked

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:41.410
was intent service for the web kicked
 

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.379
was intent service for the web kicked
off by intents from the activity or from

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:43.389
off by intents from the activity or from
 

00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:48.509
off by intents from the activity or from
alarmmanager sequel database to hold the

00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519
alarmmanager sequel database to hold the
 

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:51.660
alarmmanager sequel database to hold the
data content provider to front loader to

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:51.670
data content provider to front loader to
 

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.210
data content provider to front loader to
keep it fresh and then one fragment per

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:54.220
keep it fresh and then one fragment per
 

00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:02.879
keep it fresh and then one fragment per
to to actually show the data rather

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:02.889
to to actually show the data rather
 

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:04.829
to to actually show the data rather
long-winded explanation but I don't see

00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:04.839
long-winded explanation but I don't see
 

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:05.999
long-winded explanation but I don't see
a lot of other people vying for our

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:06.009
a lot of other people vying for our
 

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:09.210
a lot of other people vying for our
attention here and yeah just speaking

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:09.220
attention here and yeah just speaking
 

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.319
attention here and yeah just speaking
about the general question you said

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:10.329
about the general question you said
 

00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:12.269
about the general question you said
about how would you have the activity

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279
about how would you have the activity
 

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:14.819
about how would you have the activity
talk to a fragment so yeah he says he

00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:14.829
talk to a fragment so yeah he says he
 

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:16.170
talk to a fragment so yeah he says he
understands that you can use an

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:16.180
understands that you can use an
 

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.049
understands that you can use an
interface method that the activity

00:15:19.049 --> 00:15:19.059
interface method that the activity
 

00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:20.429
interface method that the activity
implements so that when the fragment

00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:20.439
implements so that when the fragment
 

00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:22.590
implements so that when the fragment
gets the unattached message it holds a

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600
gets the unattached message it holds a
 

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.660
gets the unattached message it holds a
reference and costs the activity to that

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:24.670
reference and costs the activity to that
 

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.639
reference and costs the activity to that
interface so understands talking from

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:26.649
interface so understands talking from
 

00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:28.460
interface so understands talking from
the fragment up to the activity but

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:28.470
the fragment up to the activity but
 

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.629
the fragment up to the activity but
quite simply the answer is really simple

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639
quite simply the answer is really simple
 

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:32.939
quite simply the answer is really simple
really like a I think it's fine for the

00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:32.949
really like a I think it's fine for the
 

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:35.639
really like a I think it's fine for the
activity to know concrete details about

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:35.649
activity to know concrete details about
 

00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:37.769
activity to know concrete details about
the fragment it's just not okay for the

had to lay out the fragments differently

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:43.290
had to lay out the fragments differently
 

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.820
had to lay out the fragments differently
but because because activities own the

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:46.830

you know when you create that fragment

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:52.950
you know when you create that fragment
 

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.560
you know when you create that fragment
and add it to the page and a transaction

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:54.570
and add it to the page and a transaction
 

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.330
and add it to the page and a transaction
you just hold it a reference set

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:56.340
you just hold it a reference set
 

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.920

into the normal size bucket
 

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.400
into the normal size bucket
there it there is a bit of overlap in

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:54.410
there it there is a bit of overlap in
 

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.620
there it there is a bit of overlap in
our bucket sizes so that a large phone

be in the large size bucket and you want
 

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.690
be in the large size bucket and you want

your big phones to still be in the
normal size bucket I think so I don't

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.210

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.320

I think that you know 480 is a lot

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:12.980
I think that you know 480 is a lot
 

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.060
I think that you know 480 is a lot
closer to 440 than is 320 which is the

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.720
closer to 440 than is 320 which is the
next available size huh that's what it

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:19.730

was so it's kind of my that's kind of my

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.570

take on it is that I thought he would

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:26.300
take on it is that I thought he would

never round up I thought he would only

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:28.070
never round up I thought he would only
 

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.970
never round up I thought he would only
other round down I'm with spiking this

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:30.980
other round down I'm with spiking this
 

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.440
other round down I'm with spiking this
one I think the documentation always

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.450
one I think the documentation always
 

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.630
one I think the documentation always
suggests is roughly I'll go around that

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640
suggests is roughly I'll go around that
 

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.760
suggests is roughly I'll go around that
but I'm gonna have to go and look at

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:36.770
but I'm gonna have to go and look at
 

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.550
but I'm gonna have to go and look at
this source code to display manager

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:41.560
 

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.260
another thing that I noted is that it's

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:44.270
another thing that I noted is that it's
 

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.920
another thing that I noted is that it's
approximately it's approximately twice

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:47.930
approximately it's approximately twice
 

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.860
approximately it's approximately twice
I'm sorry 440 dpi it's approximately

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:50.870
I'm sorry 440 dpi it's approximately
 

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.370
I'm sorry 440 dpi it's approximately
twice the density of TB dpi so if you

I would rather double it then multiply
 

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.720
I would rather double it then multiply
it by one point five because I think

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:43.610
into Android I like the way it's so
 

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.760
into Android I like the way it's so
structured because these days we have

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:45.770
structured because these days we have
 

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.830
structured because these days we have
software which is not really structured

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840
software which is not really structured
 

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.260

structure that's there and I like the
 

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.800
structure that's there and I like the
way Android does it cause when

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:56.810
way Android does it cause when
 

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.140

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:12.850
your project with the NFC have you
 

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.530
your project with the NFC have you
actually implement too much NFC before

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:16.540
actually implement too much NFC before

actually implement too much NFC before
no actually my first experience it would

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.150
no actually my first experience it would
 

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.970
no actually my first experience it would
be also like a learning experience or

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:23.980
be also like a learning experience or
 

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.380
be also like a learning experience or
did you hear me okay for that sorry oh

did you hear me okay for that sorry oh
 

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:28.980
did you hear me okay for that sorry oh
yes I did

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:28.990
yes I did
 

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.810
yes I did
yes I'm still learning it the

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:31.820
yes I'm still learning it the
 

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.420
yes I'm still learning it the
limitations of restrictions or were far

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:34.430
limitations of restrictions or were far
 

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.180
limitations of restrictions or were far
we can go with it for future projects so

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:37.190
we can go with it for future projects so
 

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:39.550
we can go with it for future projects so
it it's interesting your angle on it as

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:39.560
it it's interesting your angle on it as
 

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.400
it it's interesting your angle on it as
well oh yes I was listening in before

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:42.410
well oh yes I was listening in before
 

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:47.800
well oh yes I was listening in before
sorry yeah yeah I feel like it's uh it's

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:47.810
sorry yeah yeah I feel like it's uh it's
 

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.420
sorry yeah yeah I feel like it's uh it's
a growing technology because I think

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:49.430
a growing technology because I think
 

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.110
a growing technology because I think
it's going to be used in so many places

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.120
it's going to be used in so many places
 

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:57.280
it's going to be used in so many places
and the ideas you can come up with are

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:57.290
and the ideas you can come up with are
 

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.550
and the ideas you can come up with are
just phenomenal

00:30:59.550 --> 00:30:59.560
just phenomenal
 

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.430
just phenomenal
yeah from a UX point of view like I

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440
yeah from a UX point of view like I
 

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.270
yeah from a UX point of view like I
think

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:04.280
think
 

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.070
think
you can really I really love the way

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080
you can really I really love the way
 

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.840
you can really I really love the way
that Android Beam is implemented and

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:07.850
that Android Beam is implemented and
 

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.190
that Android Beam is implemented and
that there's you know no on-screen

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200
that there's you know no on-screen
 

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.590
that there's you know no on-screen
affordance you literally just touch and

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600
affordance you literally just touch and
 

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.850
affordance you literally just touch and
then it'll send whatever is in the

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:12.860
then it'll send whatever is in the
 

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.700
then it'll send whatever is in the
foreground I love that simplicity that

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:15.710
foreground I love that simplicity that
 

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.010
foreground I love that simplicity that
you know basically you're using such a

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.020
you know basically you're using such a
 

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.870
you know basically you're using such a
close location as a really strong signal

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880
close location as a really strong signal
 

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.090
close location as a really strong signal
that you don't have to kind of like you

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.100
that you don't have to kind of like you
 

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.860
that you don't have to kind of like you
know have lots of guides and buttons and

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:23.870
know have lots of guides and buttons and
 

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:30.400
know have lots of guides and buttons and
things the hint of it actually been

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:30.410
things the hint of it actually been
 

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.070
things the hint of it actually been
asked about that element of the being we

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080
asked about that element of the being we
 

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.260
asked about that element of the being we
have to touch on the interface and one

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:35.270
have to touch on the interface and one
 

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.330
have to touch on the interface and one
of the I've been asked say is a way of

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:37.340
of the I've been asked say is a way of
 

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.940
of the I've been asked say is a way of
transferring via NFC without the touch

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:39.950
transferring via NFC without the touch
 

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.570
transferring via NFC without the touch
obviously the beam will force you to

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:42.580
obviously the beam will force you to
 

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.110
obviously the beam will force you to
make the person touch but there are some

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120
make the person touch but there are some
 

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.920
make the person touch but there are some
circumstances where you might want to do

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:47.930
circumstances where you might want to do
 

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.140
circumstances where you might want to do
a back and forth conversation and you

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:50.150
a back and forth conversation and you
 

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.820
a back and forth conversation and you
may want to may not want to touch each

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:51.830
may want to may not want to touch each
 

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.730
may want to may not want to touch each
time but I think it being forces each

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:54.740
time but I think it being forces each
 

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.430
time but I think it being forces each
time yes if you're using beam like beam

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440
time yes if you're using beam like beam
 

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.920
time yes if you're using beam like beam
is like a convenience API on top of NFC

00:31:59.920 --> 00:31:59.930
is like a convenience API on top of NFC
 

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.170
is like a convenience API on top of NFC
so yeah if you want to use beam then

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:02.180
so yeah if you want to use beam then
 

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.930
so yeah if you want to use beam then
yeah the touch is part of that but you

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:04.940
yeah the touch is part of that but you
 

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.010
yeah the touch is part of that but you
can obviously build that kind of pain

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.020
can obviously build that kind of pain
 

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.900
can obviously build that kind of pain
from that kind of translating behavior

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:07.910
from that kind of translating behavior
 

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.000
from that kind of translating behavior
using a lower level and a seat at

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.010
using a lower level and a seat at
 

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:13.330
using a lower level and a seat at
yourself yes that's why I was looking at

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:13.340
yourself yes that's why I was looking at
 

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.190
yourself yes that's why I was looking at
because that was the only way to do that

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200

the moment or do you know how how about

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:31.490
the moment or do you know how how about
 

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:35.140
the moment or do you know how how about
the take-up is I am actually doing

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.150
the take-up is I am actually doing
 

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.410
the take-up is I am actually doing
school in Canada at the moment okay so I

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:38.420
school in Canada at the moment okay so I
 

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.870
school in Canada at the moment okay so I
wouldn't be too sure about it but I

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880
wouldn't be too sure about it but I
 

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.440

put buttons into their list views so

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:27.990
put buttons into their list views so
 

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.640
put buttons into their list views so
it's a pretty popular pattern I don't

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:31.650
it's a pretty popular pattern I don't
 

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.200
it's a pretty popular pattern I don't
know my first response is why would you

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:33.210
know my first response is why would you
 

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:33.740
know my first response is why would you
do that

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:33.750
do that
 

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.380
do that
I mean every you know why would you

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:36.390
I mean every you know why would you
 

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.710
I mean every you know why would you
replicate a control over and over and

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720
replicate a control over and over and
 

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.910
replicate a control over and over and
over again like that when you could just

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920
over again like that when you could just
 

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.000
over again like that when you could just
make the list the list view clickable

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.010
make the list the list view clickable
 

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:47.120
make the list the list view clickable
but I think it's a I guess the answer is

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.130
but I think it's a I guess the answer is
 

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:51.680
but I think it's a I guess the answer is
just a custom layout right he's already

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:51.690
just a custom layout right he's already
 

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.630
just a custom layout right he's already
doing that I think my son's it I think

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640
doing that I think my son's it I think
 

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.400
doing that I think my son's it I think
he wants to know how he knows what the

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:55.410
he wants to know how he knows what the
 

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.650
he wants to know how he knows what the
index is once the buttons been clicked

00:36:59.650 --> 00:36:59.660
index is once the buttons been clicked
 

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:05.030
index is once the buttons been clicked
so I think my default behavior to self

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040
so I think my default behavior to self
 

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.410
so I think my default behavior to self
this is if you're using the view holder

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420
this is if you're using the view holder
 

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.550
this is if you're using the view holder
pan stash the index in the view holder

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560
pan stash the index in the view holder
 

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.220
pan stash the index in the view holder
and then when the button is clicked

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:12.230
and then when the button is clicked
 

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.620
and then when the button is clicked
catch the click in the view holder and

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:15.630
catch the click in the view holder and
 

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.330
catch the click in the view holder and
then have a separate listener which

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:17.340
then have a separate listener which
 

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.130
then have a separate listener which
passes out saying this is the index of

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140
passes out saying this is the index of
 

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.520
passes out saying this is the index of

yeah I'm kind of with you Sparky it's

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:23.930
yeah I'm kind of with you Sparky it's
 

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:27.740
yeah I'm kind of with you Sparky it's
not a good thing to do no I don't know

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:27.750
not a good thing to do no I don't know
 

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.120
not a good thing to do no I don't know
about that I think there's definite ways

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:29.130
about that I think there's definite ways
 

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.800
about that I think there's definite ways
you would want a button in their

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:30.810
you would want a button in their
 

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.230
you would want a button in their
different clickable regions think about

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240
different clickable regions think about
 

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.030
different clickable regions think about
in the people up for example you have a

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040
in the people up for example you have a
 

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.980
in the people up for example you have a
list item which is partly your phone

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:36.990
list item which is partly your phone
 

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.900
list item which is partly your phone
number so tapping you know some type of

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:38.910
number so tapping you know some type of
 

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.460
number so tapping you know some type of
it will call them and there's

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:40.470
it will call them and there's
 

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.620
it will call them and there's
a little divider and then like the SMS

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:42.630
a little divider and then like the SMS
 

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.820
a little divider and then like the SMS
button I think this is a common pattern

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:43.830
button I think this is a common pattern
 

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.260
button I think this is a common pattern
where you have multiple actions per row

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:45.270
where you have multiple actions per row
 

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:48.349
where you have multiple actions per row
I think it's perfectly valid so yeah

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359
I think it's perfectly valid so yeah
 

00:37:48.359 --> 00:37:50.150
I think it's perfectly valid so yeah
you're basically wanted response to the

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160
you're basically wanted response to the
 

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.490
you're basically wanted response to the
click but if you isn't there I think if

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500
click but if you isn't there I think if
 

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.500
click but if you isn't there I think if
you using a list activity for example

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:54.510
you using a list activity for example
 

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.930
you using a list activity for example
then you get the on item selectors

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940
then you get the on item selectors
 

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.550
then you get the on item selectors
callback which will actually give you

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560
callback which will actually give you
 

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.800
callback which will actually give you
the position as well so that's the

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:00.810
the position as well so that's the
 

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:05.150
the position as well so that's the
that's the index into your attacker but

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160
that's the index into your attacker but
 

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.099
that's the index into your attacker but
I guess that applies to the whole row

00:38:07.099 --> 00:38:07.109
I guess that applies to the whole row
 

00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:10.010
I guess that applies to the whole row
doesn't it or mine yeah but you also get

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020
doesn't it or mine yeah but you also get
 

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:16.520
doesn't it or mine yeah but you also get
