&gt;&gt;Julie: Greetings, everybody. I'm Julie Wiskirchen
at the Authors@Google team in Santa Monica

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.600
and we're extremely excited today to welcome
Molly Ringwald.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:17.810
[applause and cheering]

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.260
Molly began her film career at the age of
13 with a Golden Globe nominated performance

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.890
in Paul Mazursky's, Tempest. In the 80s, she
starred in such beloved coming-of-age movies

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.750
as Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and
Pretty in Pink, then moved to Paris in '92

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.010
and acted in such films as Seven Sundays and
King Lear, a screen adaptation directed by

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.079
French film legend, Jean-Luc Godard.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.260
On TV you can currently see her starring in
ABC Family's, "The Secret Life of the American

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.699
Teenager." She also appeared in the series,
"Townies" and Steven King's, "The Stand."

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.539
Her theatre credits include playing Sally
Bowles in Cabaret on Broadway, a London Stage

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.899
Production of When Harry Met Sally, and the
Tony nominated Enchanted April.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.890
Off Broadway, she was in Tick, Tickâ€¦Boom,
and in a national tour of Sweet Charity. And

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.190
today she's here to talk to us about her brand
new book, which is entitled, "Getting the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.050
Pretty Back: Friendship, Family and Finding
the Perfect Lipstick." So please join me in

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.080
welcoming Molly Ringwald.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.970
[applause and cheering]

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.830
&gt;&gt;Molly: Thank you. Hi.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.760
&gt;&gt;audience: Hi.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.400
&gt;&gt;Molly: It's so great to be here. I feel
like I really fit the whole color scheme.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.030
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Molly: I'm very Google. All right. I think

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.540
I'd like to start out with, usually when I
read from my book, I like to start out with

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.530
the first chapter because I-, I like people
to understand that when I'm talking about

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.240
"pretty," it's not so much of a physical thing
as it is an attitude and a state of mind.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.420
So, the, the first chapter is called, "Isn't
It Pretty to Think So?"

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.410
[reads from book]

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.180
"Early on during my first pregnancy, a female
acquaintance off mine told me, 'You better

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.609
hope she isn't a girl 'cause she'll suck the
pretty out of you.' I sort of laughed. Sort

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:14.629
of. In a few short weeks, I found out that
the baby was a girl. A few weeks after that,

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.519
I was absolutely sure that the woman was right.
I was not a particularly attractive pregnant

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.519
person.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.659
"Every woman I know has wanted to be beautifully
pregnant; the type of Cover Girl pregnant

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.939
where you can't tell from behind. It's only
until you turn and reveal the perfect bump

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:36.409
hovering over your Manolos that you are with
child. Me? I blew up like a water balloon,

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.739
thanks to a semi-common ailment, preeclampsia,
and a troubling, powerful fondness for Macho

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.170
Nachos. The freckles on my face decided to
band together and form a pigment block party

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.030
and my ankles swelled as if I'd been stung
by a hive of particularly vindictive bees.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.209
"On the day my daughter, Matilda, was born,
as I tried to tie up loose ends before heading

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.139
into the labor room, I was asked to participate
in a Maternity Gap ad, which I was obviously

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.450
unable to do. When I hung up the phone and
told my husband and friend, Victoria, the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.181
nurse on-call chimed in, 'That's funny. A
Gap ad? You look like the Michelin Man!'

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:12.819
[laughter]

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.969
"My husband, friend and I were shocked into
silence. The nurse took this to mean that

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.079
we hadn't heard her and felt compelled to
repeat her insight.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.209
[laughter]

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.359
'You look like the Michelin Man,' she snorted.
It wasn't until she went in for the third

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.909
time that Victoria snapped, 'Yeah, we got
it.'

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.249
[laughter]

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:33.489
"In the months after I delivered Matilda,
I would catch glimpses of myself in the mirror

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.180
each time thinking the same thing, 'Is that
me?' I couldn't get over the heft of my body.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.340
I would breastfeed my daughter and look down
in horror to find that my breasts were larger

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.340
than her head.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.810
[laughter]

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.549
"My husband came home from work one day to
discover me in the bedroom dissolved in tears.'It's

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.230
true, it's true.' 'What's true?' he asked,
alarmed. 'She got it all. She sucked the pretty

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.230
out of me.'

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.230
[laughter]

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.900
"I'm sure I'm not the only woman who has felt
this way and obviously it isn't only motherhood

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.370
that can give you this feeling; it can be
a relationship gone south, a stressful job,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.900
weight gain. What makes it so disturbing when
it is motherhood, however, is the completely

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.799
irrational feeling that your loss is someone
else's gain; something that is so associated

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.849
with something so wonderful: the giving of
life. It's the ultimate bittersweet sensation.

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.940
"It seems to me that there is a moment when
women are no longer defined as pretty. It's

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.840
hard to know when exactly it happens, but
suddenly you notice it. You are beautiful,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.860
unique, handsome (if you're unlucky), or interesting;
pretty is a word that is reserved for the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.500
young. At some point you are expected to relinquish
the word like an Olympic torch. If you were

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.379
ever called pretty to begin with, you know
that there's a definite time limit imposed

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:49.460
upon the word.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.910
"You could say that it has the longevity of
the career of an ice skater or ballerina.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.680
You get to dance, swan-like, a few times,
then you're expected to teach it. What is

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.199
pretty anyway? Not just beauty. It's an attitude
toward life, a frame of mind, a lightness,

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.199
even a frivolousness; it's attractive and
charming, yet also naive. It's endearing particularly

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.639
because it's so innocent, because it seems
to disregard, or simply be unaware of, all

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.949
the things in the world; the experiences,
the people, the accidents that increasingly

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.919
defy and deny the sense of giddy hopefulness.
When I told a friend I was writing a book

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.120
called 'Getting the Pretty Back,' she asked,
'Why don't you call it Getting the Beauty

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.870
Back? That's a better title.'
'But beauty isn't what I'm talking about.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.770
Prettiness is inside every woman. It's a feeling,
a sense of self that never entirely leaves,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.660
it's always there.'
"I remember at my daughter's baptism, which

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.670
we had in Greece where my husband's parents
live, watching my mother-in-law dancing at

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.220
the after party at four in the morning, as
she spun I could see the village girl she

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.340
had been 50 years earlier in every light,
joyful step. It was moving and it was inspiring

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.979
and it was also, the best part, completely,
carelessly normal. She wasn't thinking about

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.729
it. She wasn't pretending. She was just doing
what felt right. I watched her turning her

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.069
wrists and hands in time with the music with
such confidence and grace thinking to myself,'

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.349
She's so pretty.'
"Getting the pretty back is about getting

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:18.979
in touch with your essential self; the part
of you that knows what you really want, that

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.259
takes risks, that isn't scared away by all
the things that can and have gone wrong. It's

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.629
the part of you that runs around in summer,
holding your sandals in your hand. It's remembering

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.030
the girl you were at 15 who did double flips
off the high-dive, the girl who laughed and

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.979
squealed with your best friend while you huddled
together in the bathroom double-piercing your

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.460
ear with a needle and a potato.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.460
[laughter]

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.509
"Being pretty can be about style or outer
beauty, true. But on a deeper, more fundamental

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.819
level, it's about learning to take care of
yourself again. Style is the first and easiest

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.919
step to reminding yourself, and the world,
that you matter. Too often, after kids, after

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:59.009
years in and out of relationships, we settle.
We stop paying attention to ourselves. Everyone

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.770
else's needs come first. We'd love to try
a yoga class or see a movie with a friend,

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.389
or visit a country that we've never been to,
but before that can happen we have all these

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.560
other responsibilities: the car payments,
the mortgage, the dental appointments, the

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.770
carpools, the birthday parties, the work functions.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.950
"At times they can make you feel as if adulthood
is nothing more than a series of tasks to

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:24.009
be completed. And I'm not advocating trying
to recapture your youth, mostly because it

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:29.870
isn't possible, but secondly because you shouldn't
want to. Our life experience, after all, is

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.789
what makes us interesting, smarter, more confident
and formidable. But being all those things

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:39.710
shouldn't preclude being whimsical, light,
flirty and fun. At heart, prettiness is a

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.720
state of mind; it's a way of looking at things.
A way of looking at ourselves. It's just one

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.409
thread of the tapestry that makes us up, but
it's an all too often neglected thread. Luckily,

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:52.890
it isn't so hard to get the pretty back as
I rediscovered again while writing this book.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:57.280
I spent a lot of time searching through my
past, remembering the good and bad, and finding

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.849
out what got me to where I am now and I invite
you to do the same. Whether it's reconnecting

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:06.069
with friends that you miss or remembering
how much you used to love to dance to Bananarama

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.531
in the living room by yourself--

00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:08.700
[laughter]

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.219
getting back in touch with the pretty girl
that you once were, just might make you realize

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:14.419
that she isn't so far from the woman that
you are today."

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:17.400
[applause]

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.370
Thank you.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.310
I wanted to read you one other part and, and
I've been talking with my husband back there,

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:33.740
who just graduated from Stanford on Saturday,
just got his MBA.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.510
[applause, clapping, cheering]

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:43.409
Go Panio! So we were talking in the car about
what to read and I didn't, honestly, I didn't

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:48.510
expect so many men to be here. And I'm really
thrilled, so I'm trying to think of, you know,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.730
the book is obviously written more for women,
but not to say that men can't get something

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:59.990
out of it, too. So, I don't, I don't know.
There's, there's nine chapters to, to the

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:05.840
book and they're all sort of about what it
means, to me, to be a woman. So I just try

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.130
to think about, you know, wh-, what's important
to me, and so there's a style chapter, there's

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.800
a food chapter, there's a fitness chapter,
there's even a hair chapter.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800
[laughter]

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.850
So, I decided to read something I, I haven't
actually read at other book readings and it's

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:27.170
part of the style chapter, which is called,
"It Woman," which is kind of the genesis of

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:33.450
the book. I decided, when I was turning 40
years old, that every stylish book seemed

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:38.300
to be about "It" girls rather than "It" women.
So, I wanted to write a book about being an

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.260
"It" woman. And so, so here's the, the beginning
of Chapter Two, "It Woman."

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.760
[reads from book]

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.550
"When I was seven years old, I was a tall,
leggy kid with short, shaggy hair and permanently

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:55.820
stubbed toes and for a good deal of time,
I sported a woman's stocking, my mothers,

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.980
attached to the top of my head with two precisely
criss-crossed bobby pins. This seemed to be--"

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.980
[noise interference]

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.980
What's that?

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.980
&gt;&gt;team member: ok

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.250
&gt;&gt;Molly: Oh.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.440
[continues to read]

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.150
"This seemed to be, in my seven year old brain,
the best solution as to how to exist in California

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:18.160
in the 70s with a gorgeous, blue-eyed older
sister with long, blonde hair. I was sure

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.400
that she knew how it tortured me as I lay
on the bed and watched her brush her long,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.150
straight trusses and then flip it back over
to have it land on her back as if in slow

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:32.690
motion. I was memorized by the perfection
of it. It was the perfect color, the perfect

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.639
weight; it even smelled nice.

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:38.100
"Farah Fawcett shampoo. Which I'm pretty sure
it was just Herbal Essence with a picture

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.769
of Farah stuck on the bottle. I asked my mother
if I could grow my hair out like my sisters.

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:47.279
'Maybe later,' she'd tell me. 'This time we'll
cut it short and you'll see, it'll grow in

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:52.620
thicker.' This lie, handed down from the ages,
clearly senseless, and yet somehow at that

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.610
age, irrefutable, and anyway, who doesn't
want thicker hair? So, off to the barber I'd

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.350
go where they'd chop off my honey colored
wisps and fashion my hair into a boys cut.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.851
'A pixie,' my mom would say. 'What's his name?'
everyone else would say.

00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:06.990
[laughter]

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.100
"In our neighborhood, in every direction out
of our cul-de-sac, there was a home that housed

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.220
a set of siblings. Joanie and Jennifer to
the left of us, Laurie and Lisa to the right,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.660
and Karen and Krista in the middle, across
the street. Not one of which, incidentally,

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.630
had anything short of shoulder length hair.
Our games mostly consisted of freeze tag and

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.760
cartoon tag and I could occasionally corral
them into taking part in a backyard vaudeville

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.620
show. I'd copied out scenes from classic Abbot
and Costello sketches from a local show that

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.640
my brother and sister and I performed in on
the weekends. I would direct them to the proper

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.930
timing and sometimes have to explain the joke.
'Yeah, you see, his name is Who and see the

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.910
other guy doesn't get it.'

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.180
"This would keep us occupied until the ice
cream truck or some other distraction came

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.490
along and then home for dinner. Then, one
day, while playing inside the house, rummaging

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.620
through my mother's things, I came across
a long ponytail curled up in a hat box that

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.170
I was pretty sure wasn't real, but nevertheless
intrigued me almost as though it were a living,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.640
breathing thing. Treating it with reverence,
I carefully presented it to my mother for

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.480
explanation. I don't even think that it matched
my mother's hair color. 'Oh, it's a fall,'

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.410
she said. 'We used to wear those all the time
a few years ago. Nobody wears them anymore.'

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.200
This information I accepted gladly since it
basically gave me free reign to claim the

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.550
thing as my own. I would attach it to my head
and no one would be able to pry it loose.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.740
Unfortunately, there was precious little to
attach it to.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.459
"Every time I thought I had it fixed, the
second I attempted to copy my sister's hair

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:36.700
swing, that I'm sure she copied from Susan
Day, the flick from one shoulder to the other,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.540
the hairpiece would fly across the room and
sail onto the floor. Apparently, this unhappy

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.790
event actually happened to a famous singer,
dancer, on Johnny Carson's, The Tonight Show,

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.250
which my mother remembers helped deter her
from wearing the elaborate up do and they

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.560
were really going out of style anyway.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.690
"This did little to deter me until I had to
face the fact that as much as I loved this

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:01.079
piece of hair and wanted it attached to me,
the thing had no interest in me, preferring

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:06.250
to hibernate indefinitely in the hatbox. I
reasoned that the real problem was the weight

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.860
of the hairpiece and if I could just find
a less weighty version, unfortunately, my

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.990
mother had not invested much in her hair accoutrement.
There were only two that I could find and

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.510
one of them I figured was a Halloween wig
and of little interest, since it was a short,

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:24.759
curly do that looked like it belonged to Bewitched's
Samantha's frisky cousin, Serena. But I did

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:30.680
happen upon a pair of stockings, one for each
leg. While pantyhose were becoming more commonplace,

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.060
my mother still owned the old-fashioned, singular
nylons, which along with the fall, I never

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.390
saw her wear. The thought occurred to me that
it was about the same length as the fall and

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.910
a much better color match. Two bobbies later,
I was in business.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.910
[laughter]

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.050
"I flicked my head around and admired my handiwork.
Then I ventured out into the neighborhood.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.360
[laughter]

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.350
"My friends make no mention of my new hairdo,
if they even noticed they didn't' let on.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.720
I was filled with a combination of relief
and disappointment. Relief that I wasn't about

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.660
to be made fun of mercilessly, I still can't
quite believe it. I don't know if it was the

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:07.069
age or the place, the fact that I had exceptionally
kind friends, and disappointment because couldn't

00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:12.399
they see I had long hair? Then a couple of
days later, I noticed Jennifer sporting a

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.501
black stocking on her head.

00:14:13.501 --> 00:14:14.501
[laughter]

00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:19.250
"Soon, all the girls tried it out, even pinning
their own hair up in order to show the stocking

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.790
hanging down. Joanie went so far as to put
pantyhose on her head, but we all agreed that

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.790
was ridiculous.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.790
[laughter]

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.960
"It was at that time when I realized that
I had set a trend. I had an idea that was

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.579
different. I executed it and I watched it
catch on. It was magical the way we all entered

00:14:35.579 --> 00:14:40.440
into a tacit understanding that stockings
on our head was cool, even when the evidence

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.870
should have clearly showed us otherwise. I
think I discovered at that moment that fashion

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.200
was fun and ridiculous, but most important
that as long as I set the trend instead of

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.019
following it, I would be ok."

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:52.051
Thank you.

00:14:52.051 --> 00:14:59.620
[applause]

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:05.730
So, I guess now is the Q&amp;A part? If you have
any questions, if anybody has any questions,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.639
I would be happy to answer them. Yes.

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:13.350
&gt;&gt;memberfemale1: Where did you get these shoes?

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:22.029
&gt;&gt;Molly: [laughs] Great question. I, I actually,
I flew to London to have the cover photo taken

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:27.660
by a friend of mine named Fergus Greer, and
it was styled by a wonderful stylist and they

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:34.600
are Manolo Blahnik. And, I actually, it has
taken me months to actually have those shoes

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.100
in my possession now. I have them.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.100
[laughter]

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.829
That was way back in December and I desperately
wanted them. I thought, "I have to have these,

00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:46.629
these shoes." They're like the modern day,
like Dorothy, from Wizard of Oz or something.

00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:53.870
So, they made me a special pair because apparently
they were all gone. So, yeah, sorry.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.870
[laughter]

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.790
&gt;&gt;member female: [inaudible]

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.630
&gt;&gt;Molly: Any other questions?

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:05.000
&gt;&gt;memberfemale2: I have one. I actually saw
you when I was living in New York, in Tick,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.899
Tickâ€¦Boom and which I thought was great
and it was all about kind of the turning 30

00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:14.459
and, and how to deal with that milestone and
now your books about turning 40, so I was

00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:18.649
wondering if you thought back to that musical
or if you saw any parallels between those

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:19.649
two.

00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:26.839
&gt;&gt;Molly: I actually, I haven't made the connection,
but it, it's, it is, I think, a similar feeling.

00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:33.879
I think for women, 40 is even more. I mean,
40 is really the moment when you can no longer

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:39.460
call yourself an ingÃ©nue in, in any realm
at all, you know? And, and you know, most

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.870
people, by the time they're 40, ha-, you know,
have kids and you know, or, you know. I mean,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:50.589
I had my kids later than, than most people
do. I have a six year old daughter and eleven

00:16:50.589 --> 00:16:54.459
month old twins. Yeah, they're so cute.

00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:55.459
[laughter]

00:16:55.459 --> 00:17:00.459
But, you know, 40 is really that age that
I think it's not so much that you feel different,

00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:07.770
it's that, that you feel that everyone sees
you differently. I was doing, when I was on

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:13.199
my book tour, I was doing "Regis and Kelly"
and she, she actually had a really great comment

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:18.439
that I think she heard from someone else,
but it seems that at 39, everyone says to

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:22.839
you, "Are you ok? You look so tired." And
then you turn 40 and they go, "Wow, you look

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:23.880
great for 40." You know?

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.880
[laughter]

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.440
It's like, suddenly the perception completely
changes. But yeah, I mean, Tick, Tickâ€¦Boom

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.730
was very similar. I think, I think Jonathan
Larson really felt that way because his, his

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:42.440
career really hadn't taken off yet. He was
still the "starving artist" and I think, for

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.809
him, he felt that that's acceptable. You know,
we all put these numbers and, you know, they,

00:17:47.809 --> 00:17:49.340
they don't really mean anything.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.260
It's just what we put on ourselves, you know?
When you're, when you're creating, when you,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.330
when you're, when you're an artist, it's like
you, you should have arrived already by the

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:03.590
time you're 30 and I think that was the pressure
he felt is that, that after 30 it was like,

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:08.919
ok now he's gonna have to get a real job,
you know? And I think that, that this happens

00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:13.461
all the time. I think, you know, I'm, I remember
turning 25 and feeling that, you know, oh

00:18:13.461 --> 00:18:14.770
my God, I was so old, you know?

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.490
[laughter]

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.980
You know, it's just, i-, i-, it happens all
the time, you know? You're a teenager and

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.870
all you can think about is, is being 21 and
then after 21 its like, "Oh my God, I'm so

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.541
old!" You know? It's gonna happen. I think,
I think I'm gonna look back on turning 40

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:38.320
and feel like I was a baby, you know? So,
any other questions? Yes.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.820
&gt;&gt;membermale3: Steven King's, The Stand, is
a marathon of a book by any means, so when

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.400
you're preparing or any time since, have you
read the book?

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:53.250
&gt;&gt;Molly: I read the book while I was making
the movie, actually. I hadn't read it prior

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:59.760
to, to doing, I read the script. And the,
the script, the, or I should say the teleplay,

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.120
because it was, it was a television movie;
I think was a pretty faithful adaptation.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.679
Because I remember as I was reading the book,
I felt like I had just read it, you know?

00:19:08.679 --> 00:19:17.429
Because I just read this incredibly long teleplay.
But, you know, usually, I mean I think, I,

00:19:17.429 --> 00:19:23.460
I prepare differently for each project. Sometimes
I feel like I, I understand the character

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.250
completely. I mean, like for instance, all
the John Hughes movies I did, there was not

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.039
a lot of research that went into those parts,
you know? They were very similar to, to me,

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:37.010
or to somebody that I knew, but then other
parts, obviously require more research.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:43.830
&gt;&gt;membermale3: So, I love the movie adaptation
and watching it is an effort in itself, so

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.850
how was filming it? I mean, it, it's so long.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:53.380
&gt;Molly: It was really long. I had just moved
to France, actually and that was the first

00:19:53.380 --> 00:20:00.640
time I'd been back in America since I had
chosen to move to another country and I, I

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.179
remember having a lot of, of down time and,
and constantly trying to, to get back to France,

00:20:06.179 --> 00:20:14.440
you know? So, it was, it was, it was such
a big, huge cast and, you know, I just, I

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.960
mean I had most of my scenes with Gary Sinise
and he's, he's an amazing actor and, and a

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.350
great guy to work with so, so I had fun making
it.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.350
&gt;&gt;membermale3: Thanks.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.350
&gt;&gt;Molly: Sure. Yes.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.350
&gt;&gt;memberfemale4: You're one of these rare,
amazing performers whose career has spanned,

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.350
you know, the stage, screen and television.
And I'd like you to talk a little bit about

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:45.150
your approach to the different media. If there
is one you prefer, and if it sort of on a

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.150
project to project basis.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:52.400
&gt;&gt;Molly: That's a great question, thanks.
I don't prefer any, any of them, I think.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.490
I, I mean, I started out doing theatre so
I think theatre, so I think theater is a little

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:03.780
bit like my first love and I've always felt
really comfortable on stage. And then I moved

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.830
to film and I think I'm more known as a film
actress. I love the immediacy of television

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.460
and I, and I love how many people you can
reach on television, you know?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:19.020
I, after I, I lived in France for all those
years, I came back to New York and I did almost

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.930
exclusively theatre for about ten years and
I feel like, except for the people that happen

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.320
to be there at the time, nobody knows. It
was like I wasn't doing anything for, for

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.270
ten years, you know? But, I mean, people that
were there, you know, they say me in all these

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.402
plays and they thought, "Oh, I didn't know
you could sing, I didn't know you could dance,"

00:21:37.402 --> 00:21:41.520
you know? But then, it just, there's all these
people that it doesn't reach, you know?

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.140
So, that doesn't mean that I don't love doing
it, but I, obviously when you work you love

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:52.179
to, to be able to, to connect with people
and to reach people. So, I did all of that

00:21:52.179 --> 00:21:55.660
theatre and then I moved here and now I'm
on a television show and it, it always seems

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.909
like I love to go back and forth. I mean,
I would love to go back to New York and do,

00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:04.320
it's been, it's been a couple years now since
I've done a play. I would love to do it, you

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.669
know, especially with the Tony's last night,
I think, "Oh, my God, I love, I love doing

00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:11.740
theatre." You know, and I'd love to do more
films. I think it really just depends on the

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:16.740
project and I think that there's certain projects
that, that sort of lend themselves to a certain

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.920
medium. So, depends on the story. Yes?

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:29.040
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Did living around Parisian
women affect your sense of pretty? [inaudible]

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:36.540
&gt;&gt;Molly: I feel like French women are, I mean,
they're, they're incredibly stylish. They

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.299
seem to come out of the womb--

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:39.299
[laughter]

00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:46.260
with an Hermes scarf sort of wrapped perfectly
around their neck. They just seem to have

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:52.730
an innate sense of style that I really think
comes from a sense of confidence, you know?

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:58.910
When I was writing this book and going through
the editorial process, I did a word search

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.720
one day on the word "confidence" cause I wanted,
or "confident." I wanted to know how many

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.180
times I used that word and it was ridiculous.
I used that word like, 25 times, I used the

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.480
word confident. But I think it really said
something about one of the themes of my book,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:17.230
which is how confidence, confidence in yourself,
is one of the most important things because

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.730
if you don't have confidence in yourself,
no one is gonna have confidence in you. And

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:26.220
it affects everything. It affects your style,
it affects the way that people listen to you,

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.799
you know, it affects everything.

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:33.271
So, I think that that's something and I don't
know exactly, i-, it's something that was

00:23:33.271 --> 00:23:37.990
very interesting to me figuring out where,
where French women come up with this sense

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:43.169
of confidence and I, I really do think it
has something to do with their culture. And

00:23:43.169 --> 00:23:48.240
it's something I hope to impart on, on, on
my children, my girls especially. You know,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.409
the feeling that they can do anything that
a man can do and in heels, backwards.

00:23:53.409 --> 00:23:56.130
[laughter]

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.160
Great question, though. Thank you.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.721
&gt;&gt;Julie: Does anyone on the video conference
have questions?

00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:03.721
&gt;&gt;Molly: Oh, I think this gentleman has a
question.

00:24:03.721 --> 00:24:04.721
&gt;&gt;membermale6: So, you played a teenage mother
and so I'm wondering when you were pregnant

00:24:04.721 --> 00:24:05.721
with your first child, did you ever think
back on that movie and did anything seem to

00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:06.721
be particularly realistic? Did some things
make sense or some unrealistic? Do you have

00:24:06.721 --> 00:24:20.680
any thoughts about that?

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:31.710
&gt;&gt;Molly: Well, I think everyone is different
in how they deliver their children. As I remember,

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.010
I haven't seen that movie in a long time,
but I remember I did a lot of yelling and

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.010
screaming.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.370
[laughter]

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.750
As most people do when they, when they have
that, that scene when they're delivering children,

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.350
you know, there's like [heavy panting], you
know all of that--

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.350
[laughter]

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:51.700
and I, and I did that and it seemed very realistic
at the time, but, but having had three children

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:56.370
now I, I didn't deliver at all that way. Not
to say that it didn't hurt, because it did

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:02.480
a lot, but all of my energy was very internal
and very, y-, you know, I felt like I couldn't

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.370
make that much noise because I, I would lose
my concentration and all I was focused on

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:12.470
was getting this baby out. So, you know, if
I had to do it over again I might have played

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.970
that scene a little differently, so yes, to
answer your question, I would, I would've

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:17.970
done it differently.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.320
[laughter]

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.039
Yes.

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:26.800
&gt;&gt;memberfemale8: So, when, oh thanks. So,
when writing this book was there any one particular

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.690
chapter that was your favorite writing, or,
I guess I'm just reading through it and I'm

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:37.740
like, "She gives good email." That's an interesting
one, but I, I, my question is like, which

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.799
one was your favorite in writing, if you had
one or if there's one that, like, sticks out

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:40.799
the most?

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:43.909
&gt;&gt;Molly: Well, when I had the, the concept
for the book, like I said I wanted to write

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:49.760
this sort of girlfriends guide to being a
stylish woman and I, I feel like, so many

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.600
people feel like they grew up with me because
they kinda did, you know? My movies are sort

00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:01.130
of a rite of passage, you know, for, for so
many people. So, I, I had the idea. I knew

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:06.440
I wanted it to be illustrated and I was really
fortunate enough to get my dream illustrator,

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.450
Ruben Toledo, to, to illustrate the book.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:15.740
But I, I always knew that I wanted it to be
part narrative about my life, about my friends

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:21.149
lives and then I also wanted it to have sort
of an advice aspect to it because I've always

00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:26.799
been sort of like the go-to girl for all of
my, my girlfriends. But I found that all of

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:32.809
the narrative was so much easier to write.
You know, all the story telling, the, you

00:26:32.809 --> 00:26:37.531
know, and I think that has to do with my background
as an actor and getting into characters and

00:26:37.531 --> 00:26:43.130
telling stories. When it, when it actually
got to the advice part, even though I have

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.279
been that advice kind of girl, it, it is sort
of hard.

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:52.059
Once you put things down on, on paper, I didn't
want anyone to feel like I was a big old know-it-all,

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:57.750
you know? And all of these, all of, all of
the advice that I write is really just, you

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.590
know, I'm not an expert in any of the, this
is just strictly my opinion, you know? I have

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.220
a whole chapter we were just talking about
that on, on t-shirts.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.140
[Molly laughs]

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:12.179
I have a whole sort of manifesto on "You're
not a billboard." And that, and that, you

00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:16.919
know, we, we shouldn't be advertising other
people's, you know, mostly it's those horrible

00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:22.029
slogans or those, you know, those t-shirts
that you pick up on vacation that say, "Barbados,"

00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:23.029
you know?

00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:24.029
[laughter]

00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:28.330
And it's like, what is this really telling
the world, you know? But anyway, to answer

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:34.700
your question, I think, I think all of the
parts, the, the stories about, about my friends

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.110
or, you know, about my life, I think those
were the definitely, or, or the one that I

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.080
read to you about being a little girl and,
and sticking a stocking on my head, I think

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.299
those were the most fun to write.

00:27:44.299 --> 00:27:45.299
Yes.

00:27:45.299 --> 00:27:56.020
&gt;&gt;memberfemale9: So, I have a email question.
So, like for me, being almost 40, the most

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.320
disturbing thing is now I see teenagers, like,
dressing like the 80s and now I'm like that

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.490
old person, you know, who their era has come
back, right?

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:04.490
[laughter]

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.200
It's really weird because I feel like some
of the kids; they just could've gone to my

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.070
high school. Like, it looks--

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.490
&gt;&gt;Molly: Yeah.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.111
&gt;&gt;memberfemale9: exactly the same. So, they
say that if you are old enough to wear the

00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:18.490
fashion the first time around, you shouldn't
wear it the second time around.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.490
[laughter]

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:20.490
&gt;&gt;Molly: I disagree.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.779
&gt;&gt;memberfemale9: Ok.

00:28:21.779 --> 00:28:26.700
&gt;&gt;Molly: I respectfully disagree with that.
I, you know, I, I think that you shouldn't

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:32.340
dress head to toe in, in anything that you
wore. I mean, mostly because it probably doesn't

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:37.880
fit, you know? I mean, I still have clothes
that I wore in the 80s, but, you know, most

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.350
of them don't, don't fit the same. I mean,
I'm hanging onto them, you know, for, for

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:47.270
my kids and, you know, but, but I think, I
think the 80s now that, that people, I think

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:53.340
there's kind of like, cherry picking the best
parts of, of a particular era, you know? There's

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.830
certain 80s-esque things that I wear now,
you know, sort of color choices. I mean, Google,

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.220
very 80s, you know? All of the, you know,
all of the primary color, the yellow and the,

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.350
you know. Like, I find myself doing that now.
I have a cu-, a pair of, you know, yellow

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.350
Ray bans, you know? Different, you know, hats
or, you know, there's certain things that

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.630
I, that I associate with the 80s that I still
wear, but I try to make it modern, it's not

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.649
just head to toe.

00:29:17.649 --> 00:29:21.980
And, you know, to be perfectly honest, in
the 80s, I was doing other eras, you know?

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.890
I, I was doing, that was my version of the
20s, you know? Or, you could say that the

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:31.510
shoulder pads from the 80s was, was inspired
by the 40s. I remember in the 70s being obsessed

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:35.580
with the 50s, you know? With Grease and everything
and, and thinking that the 50s were just the

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.230
coolest thing ever. So, I think all those
fashion, it just, it's constantly re-, recirculating.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.840
There's nothing really original except for
the way that you interpret it.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.740
&gt;&gt;memberfemale9: Wow, I, great answer.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.899
[Molly laughs]

00:29:48.899 --> 00:29:51.220
I'm impressed, thank you.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.960
&gt;&gt;Molly: Sure. Yes.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.120
&gt;&gt;memberfemale10: Hi.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.289
&gt;&gt;Molly: Hi.

00:29:55.289 --> 00:30:00.799
&gt;&gt;memberfemale10: I'm, I'm so excited to read
this book, I've been flipping through. I just,

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:06.159
since you've, you know, covered all the other
media, movies and theatre and whatnot, I just

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.720
wondered, do you have another book in you?

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720
[Molly laughs]

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.270
&gt;&gt;Molly: I should hope so because I signed
a two book deal.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.270
[laughter]

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:18.679
So, I'm really hopin' that there is a book
in there somewhere. I was just actually talking

00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:26.330
to my husband about that in the, in the cafe.
I, I really after writing an entire book about

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:31.929
myself, I really want to write about something
else. So, I think, I think probably my next

00:30:31.929 --> 00:30:39.350
book will be fiction just so I can kind of
get into those characters and, you know, I,

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:43.570
I, I think that's sort of what I'm leaning
towards and then, if I ever write about myself

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.580
again, it'll be a long time. It'll be like
the official autobiography years and years

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.580
from now.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:58.440
&gt;&gt;memberfemale11: So, I read a little of your
book at the airport a week ago, and you have

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.990
a chapter on, well not, you have a small part
about dating a younger guy. What happened

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.100
to him and how did it work out?

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.230
&gt;&gt;Molly: He's sitting right back there.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.230
[laughter]

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:15.500
&gt;&gt;memberfemale11: It's hard, right? Like,
women are supposed to date, usually date,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.950
we're trained to date yo-, older men. Older
men for younger women, yeah? What are your

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:24.610
thoughts and how did it all work out for you?

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.610
&gt;&gt;Molly: I--

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.659
[laughter]

00:31:27.659 --> 00:31:37.039
He actually was the, the first and last ol-,
younger guy that I dated. It, it was hard,

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:43.610
it's true, women are, sort of, I don't know
why exactly, why we are taught to date older

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.850
men, I mean considering that women are supposed
to live longer it makes more sense to date

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:48.850
younger men.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.559
[laughter]

00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:56.380
But I, I like all, many other women, I, I'd
always dated guys that were older and it was

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.450
sort of by accident that, as, as I write about
in my book, that, that we even ended up dating

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:07.799
at all. We, we met through a mutual friend
on email, actually, and I, we didn't even

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:13.409
actually meet in person for about six months
and I actually thought that he was an older

00:32:13.409 --> 00:32:17.980
man because in the way, in the way that he
writes, I had this sort of vision of this,

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:23.159
you know, old swarthy intellectual and, and
he was this 25 year old cutie-pie.

00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:24.230
[laughter]

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:31.290
So, so it was, it was a little bit of an adjustment
in, in my head because he, he wasn't exactly

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.409
what I envisioned and also I had that hang
up, like, "How could I date somebody young,

00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:38.711
this, who am I? Is he a boy toy? What's the
deal?" You know?

00:32:38.711 --> 00:32:39.711
[laughter]

00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:45.220
But then I, I got over it, you know? And now,
I, I don't even think that, we don't even

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:50.460
notice the age difference. Its seven years,
which, you know, is, is a significant amount

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:56.039
of time. I do believe that our lives are sort
of lived in seven year cycles, so occasionally

00:32:56.039 --> 00:33:02.149
I'll notice that I'm in one stage of my life
and he's in another stage of his life, but,

00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:08.649
but it's ok. I think it's, three kids later,
almost ten years later; I think it's worked

00:33:08.649 --> 00:33:10.929
out ok.

00:33:10.929 --> 00:33:12.070
[applause]

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:18.450
&gt;&gt;Julie: Does anybody on video conference
have a question?

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.450
[laughter]

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:30.150
&gt;&gt;Molly: Hi, people. They're thinking about
it. The guy in the blue shirt. I can tell.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:31.150
[laughter]

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.169
Oh, no he's just, he's just chatting with
someone.

00:33:34.169 --> 00:33:35.519
[laughter]

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:39.649
&gt;&gt;member12: They're all on mute.

00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:40.799
&gt;&gt;Julie: Oh. Ok. I think we'll take one more
from Agraria.

00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:46.350
&gt;&gt;memberfemale13: Thanks so much for coming
and I think it's great, the transition you're

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:51.330
able to make or just like, looking over the
past, I don't know, it's probably embarrassing,

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:53.960
but those terrible countdowns of child actresses
and where they are and you're always a success

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960
story, and so--

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960
&gt;&gt;Molly: That's nice, thank you.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:02.190
&gt;&gt;memberfemale13: I think it's very admirable.
And I was wondering, I mean, I've heard that

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:06.530
you probably credit to your time in France,
just being away and that kind of thing and

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.330
we already kinda touched upon like, women
and friends being beautiful and the confidence

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.200
and stuff, but how did that impact your life
and your career and do you recommend, what

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:19.770
do you recommend to other people, maybe if
we can't go to France for that kind of defining

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:25.310
moment that, you know, helps you transition
from where you were before to, you know, where

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.420
you are now?

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.130
&gt;&gt;Molly: Which part of that question should
I address?

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.130
[laughter]

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:38.501
That was very long, interesting, complex question.
I, I think, you know, France was sort of my

00:34:38.501 --> 00:34:43.421
version of going to college. In fact, I had
applied to USC and gotten accepted and was

00:34:43.421 --> 00:34:48.510
supposed to go into the fall to, to start
getting my college education and then went

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:53.440
to France to do a movie over the summer and
just stayed. So, that, it, you know, that

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.340
was sort of my version of, of the college
years and I, I had been working for so long

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.680
that I'd never really been, I felt like I'd
never really been out of the public eye and

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:08.430
I felt like, for me, I needed to go somewhere
where I wasn't recognized.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:13.080
That I, I could sort of make mistakes and
be silly and just do all that stuff, you know,

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:18.040
that, that, that everyone basically does in
college, you know? And that's, that's what

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:22.680
I did and I'd, and that, that's what worked
for me, but I think, you know, everyone's

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:29.650
different. I think it also had a lot to do
with sort of following my bliss and feeling

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:34.190
like if I didn't do it at that time in my
life, that I would never do it. And I, and

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:38.910
I always wanted to live in a foreign country
and I've always had a thing about France.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.060
I don't know why, it might have been a past
life thing or something, but in my house,

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.870
my mom was a chef and she really idolized
Julia Child and Julia Child was always saying,

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:54.000
"bon appÃ©tit," and so, to me, that was just,
you know, it represented something so beautiful

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.900
and so cultural and I just, it just really
spoke to me.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:03.170
But I think it's different for everyone, but
I, I really, I do recommend that somebody

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:09.600
lives outside of their own country for a period
of time just because it, it just completely

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.560
changes your perception, you know? You live
in this country and you're taught things in

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:19.400
your history books and it never occurred to
me that people have completely different points

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.050
of view, you know? We think we're sort of
the center of the universe here and guess

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.050
what?

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:27.000
In France, they think that they're the center
of the universe and I think every country

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.520
is different, but I, it just, it just completely
opens up your, you know, the world just becomes

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:37.760
a much bigger place. And, and that's really
what it did for me. Thank you so much for

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.320
having me here. This has really been fun.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.090
[applause]

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:51.400
And I have to say, I have to say I'm a very
big Google fan and, and also my mother, who

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:57.070
is not the most computer savvy person in the
entire world, just called me up, I would say

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:01.370
about a year ago and said, "Molly, there's
this incredible thing called Google. Have

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:08.990
you heard about it? You can, you can ask it
any question and it'll answer you!" Great,

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:14.690
mom. Anyway, so, many, many Google fans in
the Ringwald household. And thank you, thank

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:15.690
you again.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:15.691
