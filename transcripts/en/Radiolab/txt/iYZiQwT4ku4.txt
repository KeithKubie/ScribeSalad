Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y. S. C. E.

Speaker 2:          00:11          All right, so tell us who you are.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16          and I'm Andrea Navy's mom. We are in Hopkinsville, Kentucky for the great American eclipse. We are about a minute to totality. I can see it easily, easily sat on. We can hear the CICADAS

Speaker 3:          00:31          and glasses on. I can. I can.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Yeah, I can't look at him. You're just holding them up. What do you see your this way? Is it looking dark?

Speaker 3:          00:45          Like a storm coming in?

Speaker 2:          00:47          It does look like a storm coming in. Yoga. Wow. Oh my God. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:14          What do you see?

Speaker 1:          01:25          Oh,

Speaker 4:          01:41          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:41          Oh my God. Still a look. Look up there. Hey, I'm, I'm, I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. All right, so these last few weeks on planet earth in this corner of planet earth had been a little confusing. Little crazy, but then there was yesterday we all got to reprieve from, just got a chance to look up. Look at that. Look, look up at the sun. Couple hundred people sent us recordings from all over the place. [inaudible], Colorado, Helen, Georgia, Nashville, Tennessee. Kenmore, Washington sent us recordings of themselves watching the moon pass right in front of the sun.

Speaker 4:          02:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:20          the moon in front of the sun. The moon is blocking the sun.

Speaker 3:          02:26          I think.

Speaker 4:          02:31          Oh my God, that is,

Speaker 1:          02:34          they got to see you hear these recordings and you can help with think. I think we're gonna be all right.

Speaker 4:          02:46          You're saying that [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:55          in honor of this list, your miracle today we're going to keep up,

Speaker 5:          03:00          but not in the direction of the sun.

Speaker 6:          03:02          Well, you know, when you look up at the sun, you have to put on these glasses too, to protect yourself from the sunshine. The sunshine is very powerful and it stretches across vast, vast, vast, vast distances in space. But what we're going to do at the end is how is we're going to leave the sunshine behind. We're actually going to escape the sunshine where humans have never been before. Right?

Speaker 1:          03:24          And we're going to start with a story that I've been following pretty much my entire career at radio lab. You kind of have to rewind back to 1977. I mean that's not when I started following the story. That's when the story itself started. In August of 1977, NASA launched a spacecraft and on the Kraft was a gold record and the record carried a message. This was a message from us to them out there. Our story now, it was Carl Sagan.

Speaker 7:          03:52          The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be

Speaker 1:          03:58          led. The team that made that record and that team included actually it was headed by a woman named Andrew Willian. And about 10 years ago I spoke with Annie and uh, we made this story that you're about to hear.

Speaker 5:          04:12          I visited Annie at her home in Ithaca, New York and we sat in the backyard and your waterfall in the same spot. She says where Carl himself would sit and become so absorbed in what he was reading that he would not notice a deer standing right next to him. Sure. My name is Annie Adrianne. And, um, it was honored to be the creative director of the voyager interstellar message project, which began in early 1977. But now, how does this come about? I think about the project now and it's so exciting to think about, I mean, it's such a romantic idea. Did you know that at the time? Absolutely. We felt, first of all that this was a kind of sacred trust that here we were half a dozen and very flawed human beings with a huge, a huge holes in our knowledge of all of these subjects. Building a cultural Noah's Ark. It was a chance to tell something of what life on earth was like to beings of perhaps a thousand million years from now because the, the voyager engineers were saying, this record will have a shelf life of a billion years. That didn't race goosebumps then you'd have to be made of wood. Uh, it was also the, the, the, the season that Carl Sagan and I fell so madly in love with each other. And here we were taking on this mythic challenge and knowing that before it was done, two spacecraft would lift off from the planet earth moving at an average speed of 35,000 miles an hour for the next million years. And on it we'd be a kiss, a mother's first words to her newborn baby. Come on now. Mosa

Speaker 4:          06:15          [inaudible] [inaudible] greetings in the 59 most populous human languages. Hello for children or planet earth

Speaker 5:          06:28          as well as one non human language, the readings of the humpback whales. And it was a sacred undertaking because it was saying we want to be citizens of the cosmos. They want you to know about that.

Speaker 5:          06:53          Tell me about the moment you fell in love with Carl Sagan. You said it was during the voyager compilation. Yes, it was. It was on June 1st, 1977 I had been looking for some time for that piece of Chinese music that we could put on the voyager record and not feel like idiots for having done so. And I was very excited because I'd finally found a ethnomusicologist composer at Columbia University who told me without a moment's hesitation that this peace flowing streams, which was represented to me as one of the oldest pieces of Chinese music, 2,500 years old was the piece we should put on the record. So I called Carl, who was traveling. He was in Tucson, Arizona giving a talk. And um, we had been alone many times during the making of the record and as friends for three years. And neither of us had ever said anything to the other.

Speaker 5:          07:55          We were both in Baba people. We'd had these wonderful storing conversations, but we had both been completely just professional about everything and his friends. And, uh, he wasn't there. I left a message, our later phone rings pick up the phone and I hear this wonderful voice. Then he said, I get back to my hotel room and I find this message and it says any card. And I say to myself, why didn't you leave me this message 10 years ago? And my heart completely skipped a beat. I can still remember it so perfectly. And I said for keeps, and he said, you mean get married? And I said yes. And we had never kissed. We had never, you know, even had any other kind of personal discussion before we both hung up the phone and I just screamed out loud. I it so well because it was this great Eureka moment.

Speaker 5:          08:58          It was just like a scientific discovery. And then the phone rang and I was thinking, Oh, you know, and a phone rang and it was Carl and he said, I just want to make sure that really happened. We're getting married, right? And I said, yeah, we're getting married. He said, okay, just wanted to make sure. And I'm spacecraft lifted off on August 20th and August 22nd we told everyone involved. And we were together from that moment until his death in 1996 in December. Wow. Talk about Romantic Michael Magic. And part of my feeling about voyager obviously, and part of what I was feeling in the recording of my brainwaves, my heart, my eyes, everything in that meditation on the record, I had asked Caro whether or not would be possible to compress the impulses in one's brain and nervous system into sound, and then put that sound on the record and then think that perhaps the extraterrestrials of the future would be able to reconstitute that data into thought. And he looked at me and beautiful May Day in New York City and said, well, you know, that was a million years is a long time. You know, why don't you go do it? Because who knows? You know, who knows what's possible in a thousand million years. And so, um, my brain waves and rem, every little sound that my body was making was recorded at Bellevue Hospital in New York.

Speaker 5:          10:41          This was two days after Carl and I declared our love for each other. And so what I often think is that maybe a hundred million years from now, who knows somebody flies that record down. And I always wonder, because part of what I was thinking in this meditation was about the wonder of love and of being in love and to know it's on those two spacecraft. Even now in my, whenever I'm down, you know, I'm thinking it's still, they moved 35,000 miles an hour, leaving our solar system for the Great Wide Open Sea of interstellar space.

Speaker 3:          11:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:30          billions of years from now, the Sun will have reduced this planet to a charred ashy ball at that record with Andrew Ian's waves and heartbeat on and will still be out there somewhere intact in some remote region of the milkyway preserving a murmur of an ancient civilization. That one's flourished on a distant planet.

Speaker 3:          11:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          11:57          so that's how we ended the original story with that quote from Carl Sagan. Uh, and um, it happens to be actually the 40th anniversary of the voyager probes launch. I mean, we're sort of in between. The two dates were probe, one probe two were launched. And so we were thinking about the anniversary and uh, our producer Matt Aronchick called up android and again, and they got to talking about the fact that we still, scientists are still talking to those probes. That's the thing that gets me here we are 40 years later and for your tier one, we're still in contact with voyager one, we still know we're four to one and two are we were able to build something so well that with the energy, which is essentially more people than the energy in a toaster, we can communicate with voyager as she leaves to wander the Milky Way galaxy intact with the message intact. Well those same engineers said it would work for a dozen years. It's 40 years and it's still working. So coming up we're going to ask where are they actually, where specifically are those two probes now?

Speaker 5:          13:09          And the answer is they're in a very, very, very undiscovered place. I mean they are learning things and we have never known

Speaker 9:          13:30          scally's radical. You got Negro, the sun turns red. Elena [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         13:43          hey this is Becca. I'm calling from Dallas, Texas to let you know that Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 5:          14:01          I'm Tobin Lowe and I'm Kathy too and we're the hosts of Nancy, a podcast from w mic studios about all things LGBTQ and we apologize in advance for making you cry. Don't you want to tell people about our stories exploring the queer experience today? Sure, but I think we have to warn them about all the tears they're going to have. Think hydration, think tissues. Figuring yourself out is complicated work and that's what Nancy is. The story is about how we define ourselves and the journey it takes to get there described. Did Nancy, wherever you get your podcasts and maybe grab a handkerchief or something. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and now we're going to ask where are those voyager popes like right now? I

Speaker 8:          14:40          mean, again, this is a story we've been following forever, and about five years ago, producer Lynn Levy began to ask yourself that question, where are they? Because at that point, news was starting to bubble up that the, the divorce or probes were about to tip toe their way across a truly amazing threshold. And at that moment it wasn't completely clear what was happening. So, so here's what we reported. Then we're going to break in at a certain point and update things even further. But Lynn began this story. We're the last one. Liftoff. Okay. So like in the point of the mission wasn't really to deliver this record, it was to go out and look at all the planets in the outer solar system. So starting in 1977 these two little spaceships, two spacecraft, voyager one and two went racing away from Earth snapping pictures. And so every time before your trip reach another planet, you know, all of the voyager people would get together, go into the imaging room and see the pictures come from the outer solar system. Do you remember seeing them? I remember as a child saying life magazine, you know, I was seven when La Jolla was launched. So this is [inaudible] professor at Boston University. As I grown up, she became part of the voyager team. All the pictures that you know, as a kid you look at the books and just say what, how Knapton look out Jupiter logo.

Speaker 1:          16:05          You know, just to complete revelations Saturn, the image of Saturn technique color like pink and look, reddish, turquoise, color yellow. And those rings just spectacular. They could see active volcanoes on one of the moons of Jupiter. Finally, that vision of Neptune, this like blue jewel,

Speaker 8:          16:27          really blue, it's all came from voyager. We had no idea how they look like before voyager. Neptune was the last big cool planet and it was the last thing they were supposed to photograph. After that the cameras were going to be shut off to save energy, but Kelsey Sagan convinced them to turn voyager back to earth and take a final picture. So on Valentine's Day, 1990, uh, one of the ships slowly rotated so it was facing back to earth

Speaker 11:         16:58          and

Speaker 8:          17:02          it snapped a picture. One last picture. Describe it so it's mostly empty. Um, it's, it's pretty dark. You can see sort of streaks of light coming from the sun

Speaker 1:          17:18          and then you honestly wouldn't notice it if it wasn't pointed out to you. But down in one corner, kind of a suspended in a Sunbeam, there is a very small dot. Blue, a pale blue dot. That was us in Carl sagans words. Everyone you ever knew, everyone you ever loved, every superstar. If we corrupt politician, just everyone in all of history, everything is some total think of the rivers that blind they have run. So that one indistinguishable group could have momentary domination over a fraction of that pixel. It was one of those really rare images every single day. I hear from people who take that Pale blue.so deeply to heart and was, it was a complete reframing after that that come out of a ton off.

Speaker 1:          18:17          But here's the thing, the ships kept going, going, going, going, drifting through the darkness, going, going, going. Even though they weren't taking pictures anymore, they were using like their other senses, little instruments that detect like how many particles are around, what the temperature is. So they were hurdling through this empty space really fast measuring, sending that data back and scientists like that off where they're listening and waiting for what was not clear, but they knew at some point these capsules would get to the edge, the edge of what the solar system, the solar system has an edge. I thought it was just a big spiral. Has an edge. It's a, it's like a bubble. See The sun has a wind

Speaker 8:          19:05          if we start as a wing, but the sun has its own wind that blows out through the solar system. It's very fast. It can be between 400 to 800 kilometers per second anyway, blows out

Speaker 1:          19:18          from the sun past all the planets and uh, it keeps everything else. Ouch. Oh, so it's like blowing up a balloon. Yeah, exactly. The wind gives it a shape, right? So these little things are cruising out towards this edge, wherever it is. Scientists don't quite know where it is or what it is. The guys in the control room are like pegging the ships like, Hey, what's, what's up? What do you see in the ships? They're like, nothing. Well, how about now? Not much. No nothing. And how long before they actually see something? 14

Speaker 8:          19:46          oh man, that's like driving through Kansas but like a million times worse. But

Speaker 1:          19:51          there comes a day I end of 2004 where

Speaker 8:          19:55          they stopped listening for a little while because the antenna, NASA only has so many antennas and they have to use them to listen to everything. So for a little while the voyager teams like, okay, you guys over there can use the antennas. We're going to lunch. Yeah, I mean it's not like anything's happened. Nothing's happening anyway. It's been 14 goddamn years. Ask yourself out guys. It's cool. And they come back a few hours later, start listening again and it's happened very southern. Everything is totally changed. All of a sudden, boom. The speed of the wind drop from around three 80 kilometers per second

Speaker 12:         20:29          to a hundred

Speaker 8:          20:31          instantly, like just all in one sentence. And then everything out there started to get

Speaker 1:          20:36          messy, very [inaudible],

Speaker 8:          20:39          much more turbulent. And before particles are also, um, behaving a very different way.

Speaker 3:          20:51          The fields are very, um, we are

Speaker 1:          20:57          the fields, the magnetic field. So just like the sun has a wind, the sun has a magnetic field as well. The field starts at the sun and then curves out in this kind of graceful arc through the solar system in the how the sun rotates, it's create what people call [inaudible] cart. You know how like a skirt will flair if you spin around real fast. [inaudible] that's apparently kind of what this field looks like. But way out there, it seemed like the skirt started to fray, maybe tear a little threads had broken off and it seemed to be floating around on their own. Not connected to anything. So what does this all mean? I mean, if the fields are breaking down and the wind is dying down and you said the wind is what actually creates the space of the solar system, does this mean we're out to know?

Speaker 8:          21:44          I kind of thought that was what was happening. But no, it's not out. And it's not quite in, it's in the edge of the bubble. It's in the air. Yeah. But it's not like, I'm not like a little thin edge. It's a, it's a thick, thick edge. So the edge is and just a little line that you cross. It's the place.

Speaker 1:          22:03          Yeah. And while we listened the two voyager ships moved through this edge for several years.

Speaker 8:          22:13          Then something very interesting happen is that the wind on [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          22:21          stopped

Speaker 8:          22:22          like completely stopped. Yeah. So now we're out. No, no. I mean this is what people thought. But the other measurements like temperature and number of particles, the magnetic field doesn't tell us that we are out of the bubble. Nature surprised us again. So now we think there's a place at the edge of our solar system [inaudible] the edge of the edge. That's utterly still no wind at all. A pause. People are Connie stagnation layer. And there is a big discussion why this layer exist and how thick it is and by how thick it is, she means when will it end? Because once we get past this. So has anything ever crossed this, the boundary before? No. This will be the first manmade object to live any star and a voyager was like right there smelling, touching that boundary. You know, you only do those things

Speaker 1:          23:20          first once like your first kiss, your first taste of alcohol, your first time driving a car. The first time you see the ocean, these things open up a whole new world. First time out of the solar system. So when is it going to freaking happen? It might've happened while we were talking.

Speaker 8:          23:41          Yeah. We're thinking from now. Any moment now. Next couple months or three years from now, four years from now. It's close.

Speaker 1:          23:51          Every day I opened my Google alert for voyager and I look and see did it happen today? Because if it happens before the show goes out, I'm really pissed. Yeah. Every day it's the first thing you do in the morning. Oh, alright, good. Like the third thing

Speaker 12:         24:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          24:11          okay. So when a pedestrian levy left that story at that 0.5 years ago, that seemed like the voyager probes, we're in this weird liminal space kind of stuck somewhere in the edge of the edge of our planetary neighborhood and that the out moment, that transition moment could happen at any time. That's where we left it, which seemed honestly kind of frustrating. Like we did the story too soon, you know, like that happens every so often. So we decided to call Marav Ofer back. She's the scientist, you are in the story who is part of the voyage or team. And we asked her to pick up the story, like what happened.

Speaker 8:          24:47          Okay. So since then we will waiting. Right, right. And the stories is fascinating and a little complicated too because this was back in 2012 right. She says shortly after our story was released, a couple of months later, so was in August, around August, 2012 but six months after our story particles. This was fascinating. The energetic particles if I'm the sun, um, dropped to some people thought, oh no sun particles, that must mean we're out. But couple of days later they came back, Huh. And then there was the same intensity as before and then they dropped again. It's almost failed that somebody had open a window and they closed the window and then open the window and close the window. Oh Wow. So it's kind of weird errors where you expect the classic crossing, it should be sudden, it should be, oh, you're in or you're out. Yeah. You don't have this intermediate, I'm in, I'm out. I mean, I'm out. I know. So, so this was not the classic textbook and was very like, what's going on? And there was very heated discussions because, you know, you're waiting to say to the public and we really crossed the solid system for the first time or not. And we cannot say that must've been frustrating. Super Frustrating.

Speaker 1:          26:05          And she says, scientists started arguing, right? I mean there was a bunch of, uh, conferences and meetings where they got together and the scientist essentially broke into factions. Like you have one faction. There was like we are out. Another faction was like no, no, we're in,

Speaker 8:          26:19          and she says at one of those meetings there was a vote. Are we in or are we out? And I and I just felt this is crazy. This is such a major, my stone. It's like, you know, vote on it. It has nothing to do with exactly. It was almost like Christopher Columbus, right? Did we really arrived. America's evolved and it was just crazy. But she says they did vote and the vote was still well inside. So towards the end of 2012 that's what they thought. We're still in. But something changed and and the something is a sound we were hearing

Speaker 9:          26:55          or more

Speaker 1:          26:57          around the time of these arguments. The voyager was sending back sound. The voyager doesn't have a lot of energy on board, right? So they have a tape recorder. So there's a tape recorder. Really? Yes. I think it's an eight track. What? Like an eight track eight track. Jan, I think it turns out it's true

Speaker 8:          27:15          there. There are eight tracks on both of the probes that are capturing ultra low frequency plasma waves, two to three Kilo Hertz, which you can actually hear.

Speaker 1:          27:25          No, that whoosh, that is just a background of the power supply. That's just the sound of the voyager itself idling basically cruising through empty space,

Speaker 8:          27:35          but she says, when you listen to the following recording this what you're about to hear is eight months of time from late 2012 into 2013 eight months collapse into a tiny clip. What you hear are these little swells

Speaker 13:         27:51          [inaudible]. Here's one.

Speaker 8:          28:00          There's another. You'll have those ramps. Now the spare, it gets kind of confusing. The essentially Murav says those swells.

Speaker 13:         28:08          That's the voyager space craft colliding with some new galactic stuff, so you're hearing, okay, there is a ramp of density as you go into the interstellar space. I had thought that those sounds, one of those two sounds is the voyager bursting out of our solar system, but she told me no,

Speaker 8:          28:29          no. What it is is the sound of the voyager already on the other side. It's the voids. You're basically saying, I'm in a new space now and after some analysis in this part, I cannot explain a NASA pinpointed the ejection moment, the crossover moment to just be for the first of those two swells. So if this is the first swell

Speaker 13:         28:54          [inaudible] just before that, maybe right there like right. Yeah. That's when we left. It's so
