00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.953
KORY JEFFREY: Welcome everybody.

00:00:01.953 --> 00:00:04.630
We are live at location at
Founder World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.150
Joining me in the
studio is Sanjit Dang,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.534
Investment Director
at Intel Capital.

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:10.909
Thank you for
joining me, Sanjit.

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:12.240
SANJIT DANG: Thank you very
much for having me here.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.390
KORY JEFFREY: So let's talk a
little bit about Intel Capital.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.650
What is, I believe,
your consumer?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.200
SANJIT DANG: Well,
let me step back.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.140
We are the venture arm
of Intel, the company.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.480
And our goal is to
create new markets

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.170
and expand existing
markets for Intel.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.500
We have been investing
for 25 years.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.160
And we are one of the most
active investors, not just

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.130
most active corporate
investors, but

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.520
actually, one of the
most active investors.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.160
We invest around $400
million every year.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.470
So that's not a fund size.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.705
That's actually every year.

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:48.580
And we have been doing
it for a lot of years.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.780
So it's not just talk.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.490
In fact, this year, we are
on track to do $600 million

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.860
in startups.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.300
So very active investors.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.850
Very global as well.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.465
We have a strong presence
in Asia, Europe, everywhere.

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:06.150
So mirroring Intel as a company.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.345
KORY JEFFREY: Does that spread
across different stages?

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:11.540
SANJIT DANG: It goes across
consumer, enterprise.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.670
We invest in data center space,
big data, cloud computing,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.840
dev ops.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.150
We invest on consumer
side, e-commerce, media,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.240
drones, you name it, wearables.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.870
So we are actually quite
agnostic because Intel

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.520
as a company is a
horizontal company.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.310
We want to be the underlying
layer of computing everywhere.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.620
So mirroring that is
the investment thesis

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.627
of Intel Capital.

00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:39.210
KORY JEFFREY: So would you say
the investment thesis is, then,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.850
investing in markets where
you guys can be the underlying

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.680
computing engine?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.430
SANJIT DANG: Yeah.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.380
And we don't need to have
a hardware partnership

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.890
with the startup when we invest.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.590
But if we can see
a vision how this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.900
can be beneficial
to Intel long-term,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.710
that is what we are looking for.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.550
And there is actually
a second play

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.500
that has come up within Intel
in the last three, four years,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.880
a 3D camera called RealSense.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.710
The goal of that camera is to
provide vision to all devices.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.090
So today, it is already selling
into the laptops and tablets.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.360
Next, we actually have a
partnership with Google

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.840
that we announced where we
are putting the RealSense

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.540
camera behind the phones.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.320
So if you Google search for
"Intel RealSense Google,"

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.640
you will see prototypes
of the phones.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.670
So our vision is that
phones will have 3D cameras.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.455
So next, I should be able
to just move the phone,

00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:35.520
tell what's the dimensions
of that wall, how

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.550
the furniture will look
like in virtual world

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.930
before doing any
shopping or calling

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.390
any contractor to my home.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.300
So in addition to
the compute layer,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.750
we are also looking for
investment opportunities

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.680
where we can bring new
applications and usages

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.087
to the RealSense camera.

00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:55.170
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.961
So walk me through.

00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:58.480
If I'm an entrepreneur, how do
you get involved with Intel?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.880
How do you get discovered?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.921
How do you like to interact
with the entrepreneur

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:04.300
to move towards an investment?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.840
SANJIT DANG: For
me, I really have

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.780
to build some trust
and credibility

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.510
with the entrepreneur.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.430
That's supreme.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.940
And I have to be able to have
a dialogue with him or her.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.390
It's not just about
the presentation.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.120
In some pitches, I just say,
OK, the presentation is great.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.930
Let's do a whiteboard session.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.680
I want to get into the mind
of the entrepreneur, how

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.010
sharp the person is, what
he or she is thinking.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.570
What's the vision of
this entrepreneur?

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.140
Especially when we are investing
at seed and Series A level,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.740
there's not enough market
proof for these startups.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.560
So it's very important
to understand

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.910
what the team is thinking.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.760
And it's also important to get
comfortable about their ability

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.400
to attract more talent.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.420
Because typically,
we come across a team

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.220
of 5 or 10 people.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.200
But once we invest,
let's say, $10 million,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.040
the next stage is
going to be hiring.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.769
How do you get to
20 people, 30, 40?

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.810
They have to be able to
attract the right talent.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.790
And if they can't articulate
the vision of the company

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.970
to me as an investor, how will
they convince future talent?

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.309
How will they convince future
employees or their customers?

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:10.600
So that's what I'm looking for.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.683
KORY JEFFREY: Makes sense.

00:04:11.683 --> 00:04:13.890
So if vision is a
big, critical aspect

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.390
for you guys in
investing, would you

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.717
say that you invest in ideas
that go far into the future?

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:19.550
SANJIT DANG: We are.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.680
We already are.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.850
3D cameras, that's
a great example.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.260
Very few devices today
actually have 3D cameras.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.530
But we believe in that vision.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.390
We believe that all
devices over time

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.920
will have a 3D camera just
like a 2D camera today.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.510
So we're already
investing in startups that

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.050
are driving along that vision.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.330
We already made
investments here.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.390
KORY JEFFREY: So we've
talked a lot about Intel

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.746
being a very horizontal company.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.830
And so you're a little
bit technology agnostic

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.250
in terms of where you invest.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.820
You're not verticalized.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.890
But what is a technology
or a recent investment

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.045
that you've done that's
really got you excited?

00:04:57.045 --> 00:04:58.420
SANJIT DANG: That
got me excited?

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.510
I invested in DocuSign.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.350
DocuSign is an
e-signatures company.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.730
We did the investment
earlier this year.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.044
And we really like how they
have been able to execute.

00:05:13.044 --> 00:05:14.460
This is not just
about the vision,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.520
but how they have
been able to execute

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.540
in that space, digital
management space,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.770
and be able to pretty
much command the market,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.680
not just in the US, but
even outside the US.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.200
And we really liked the product
at a fundamental level-- very

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.090
sticky, nice user interface,
very convenient for the user,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.310
and it gets the job done on
a mobile phone very quickly.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.310
KORY JEFFREY: So we're
at Founder World.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.490
There's thousands
of people here.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.050
What is it that you look for?

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.160
What brings you to
an event like this?

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.110
SANJIT DANG: I always
crave for some new ideas

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.330
that challenge me, that
when I hear, I go, wow.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.490
I would have never been
able to think about it.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.460
This would have never
crossed my mind.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.030
I actually learn
from entrepreneurs.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.900
And I enjoy being in the company
of entrepreneurs, to be honest.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.920
They come up with
such creative ideas,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.940
and they're very dogmatic
about their vision.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.790
That's what I like
about entrepreneurs.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.840
So I talk to, whether
it's a one-person

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.690
shop or a three-people
shop or a 50-people shop,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.560
they're all equal in my mind.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.600
The question comes down
to is how serious you are,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.070
how committed you are to us.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.820
And I want to see failure
is not an option for them.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.890
They may end up failing,
but they are like,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.940
I want to drive this to success.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.050
So that's what brings me to
events like the Founders World.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.300
KORY JEFFREY: So if you had
to give any sort of advice

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.050
to aspiring founders, many
of which are here today,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.750
what is it that
you'd want to impart?

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.750
SANJIT DANG: I would tell
them believe in yourself.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.630
Don't go by the experts,
the so-called "experts."

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.770
You are the expert.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.660
The things that
we're looking at,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.240
the technologies that we
use today, a lot of them

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.990
were rejected by "the
experts" in their time.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.870
PC, when it came
out, somebody said,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.500
why would somebody buy this?

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.350
I don't see this selling
beyond 100 units.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.440
Things like that.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.840
iPhone came out.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.420
A big company,
competitor to Google

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.465
said, hey, who's going
to buy a $500 phone

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:22.340
to put in his pocket?

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.950
No way.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.560
Don't go by the experts.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.570
Experts don't know
what you're doing.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.909
Believe in yourself.

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:29.950
Just keep marching along.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.250
And there will be dark days.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.920
But that's where your vision
and your faith in the vision

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.365
comes to save you.

00:07:36.365 --> 00:07:37.990
KORY JEFFREY: So we
talked a little bit

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.940
about the partnership
between Intel and Google

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.646
with the new 3D cameras.

00:07:41.646 --> 00:07:44.020
Other than that, what is your
favorite Google technology?

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.400
SANJIT DANG: I really
like the Chrome browser.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.380
Search is obviously great.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.320
I use it every day.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.430
But talking beyond search, I
really like the Chrome browser.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.290
And I moved to the browser
probably three plus years ago.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.310
Ever since then, I
have not had any reason

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.920
to go back to Mozilla
or Internet Explorer.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.540
If I'm forced to use
Internet Explorer or Mozilla,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.900
for some reason, I
feel like, oh, come on.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.597
Don't send me back.

00:08:13.597 --> 00:08:14.680
KORY JEFFREY: That's good.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.140
That's good stickiness there.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.150
SANJIT DANG: And it's the basic,
fundamental strategy of Google

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.300
to merge search
bar and the URL bar

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.814
into one simple thing
I think was phenomenal.

00:08:26.814 --> 00:08:27.730
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.240
Well, thank you very much
for joining me today.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.820
And thank you for
joining me, Kory.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.030
I am on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.780
