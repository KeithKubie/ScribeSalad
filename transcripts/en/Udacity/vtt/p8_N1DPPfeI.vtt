00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.200
So up to now,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.900
we have built a univariate kernel density estimator, which gives us our model.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.700
Now we ask the question, is the model optimal?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.180
We discussed the bandwidth and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.540
how that plays a role in determining the quality of our model.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.580
To validate our model, we will need some validation techniques for

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.430
estimating probability density.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.402
One way to do this is to minimize the MISE, or the AMISE.

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:38.680
The MISE stands for the mean integrated standard error.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.139
And the AMISE stands for asymptotic limit of the mean integrated standard error.

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.492
We can also minimise the KL Divergence,

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:52.841
which is called the Kulberk-Liebler divergence.

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:58.270
We're, we're going to look into some of these validation techniques and

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.760
derive some rules of thumb of how to get an optimal bandwidth.
