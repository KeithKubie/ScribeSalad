00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.530
But here we go. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio,

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.910
the podcast. And today

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.440
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.090
<v 2>what's so interesting about the Cicada sounds is when you just hear it for the</v>

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.180
first time, you just hear white noise just here,

6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.540
just noise. But when you, um, learn what's going on,

7
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:27.490
you can hear the different parts of the orchestra.

8
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.320
<v 0>That's David Rothenberg, composer and professor and writer.</v>

9
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:40.890
And what he's going to do is he's going to take that huge wall of insect sounds

10
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.200
[inaudible] soon to be upon us, soon to be upon us and, and get really into it,

11
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:46.610
really start to dissect it.

12
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.110
But what he really loves to do really is he likes to play music with animals.

13
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.550
He goes around and finds individual animals or groups of animals to duet with.

14
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.110
And uh, if you don't mind you, I like to just go, just,

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.930
just introduce you to a few of his strange escapades or one of the first times

16
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:09.140
he tried this was with a, well that was a white crested, laughing thrush.

17
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.920
Oh right. Question. Laughing through.

18
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.200
Cause you know before I met the white crested, laughing thrush in Halo,

19
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.420
the way you're able to bring them up.

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.210
Cause if you ask an ordinary person like myself to say white crested,

21
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.830
laughing thrush, it's hard.

22
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.040
It should be much more well known because the white crested laughing.

23
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:29.330
Thrush is one of the best in the white crested laughing thrush shit thread.

24
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.590
Washington has them, Bronx through has them. They thrive very well in zoos.

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.100
But what they do is they sing duets, the males and females together.

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.830
So that's animals singing with animals. But here's what he did.

27
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.640
He went to the national aviary, which is in Pittsburgh.

28
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.790
First I stepped into the big tropical aviary where you wander and the birds run

29
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.100
or flying freely to big, warm kind of moist space.

30
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.300
He got there before the aviary opened, like 6:00 AM and they were,

31
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.400
when he walked into the case,

32
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.490
there were dozens of different kinds of birds flying around. And uh,

33
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.000
I was walking with my clarinet

34
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.360
playing up to the trees. Why is he doing this? Well he just wanted to see,

35
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.220
well that's him by the way. And he wanted to see what would happen.

36
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.790
And uh, as it turns out, nothing happened.

37
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.720
The bridge more or less ignored him. By then,

38
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:27.880
I was kind of kind of lost interests. Like nobody's paying attention to this.

39
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.260
It's a bad idea. And then all of a sudden

40
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.533
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

41
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.710
<v 0>hello the laughing thrush was interested.</v>

42
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.633
That's the thrush

43
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.300
one little guy, brown feathers, dark beat.

44
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.240
<v 3>At that moment,</v>

45
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.790
<v 0>anyone would say, hmm, I don't know, like doing and response. Yeah.</v>

46
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.560
This is interesting. Something's happening here.

47
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.320
This bird and this clarinet is doing something together.

48
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.050
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible] woo.</v>

49
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.460
<v 0>So as you're, as you're playing well,</v>

50
00:03:25.461 --> 00:03:28.160
what's going on in your mind at this point? I was just imagining,

51
00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:31.580
I was sitting down with a musician who maybe couldn't talk to,

52
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.980
spoke another language besides English.

53
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.080
I couldn't talk to this musician, but I can make music together with them.

54
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.900
Okay. So that was his encounter with a thrush.

55
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.500
Let me take you on another little adventure just before we get to our big thing.

56
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.870
Uh, this is a diff, can I do this?

57
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.740
You have your attention for permission [inaudible] no, no, no. You can't. Oh,

58
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.570
all right. Well, I'm not going to ask you that. I'm just doing it good.

59
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.380
After a variety of bird duets in which I'm sure he frustrated many a thrush.

60
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.530
He then did a duet with an entirely different animal.

61
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.080
What the humpback whales,

62
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.450
the best thing about that story is nobody knew they sang until the 1960s so you

63
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:19.590
can try them but don't.

64
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:22.260
We'll spend most of their time except for the tops of them.

65
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.540
Underwaters the way we do be. Good point.

66
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:27.510
I was broadcasting my clarinet through an underwater speaker

67
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.820
listening with headphones to to what's coming out of an underwater microphone

68
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.860
and you here?

69
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.410
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

70
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.580
<v 0>we just do from down there live clarinet and whale [inaudible]</v>

71
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.790
this is so bizarre. What is the whale make of this?

72
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.070
I [inaudible] I don't speak whale.

73
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.910
Thinking about humpback whales is unlike most animals,

74
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:06.300
they change their songs from year to year. They're interested in new sounds,

75
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:11.280
so all the humpback whales in any one ocean are singing one song and then they

76
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:13.710
change it all together. No one knows why.

77
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.730
Why do they want to change their song if they all want to sound the same?

78
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.120
Well when you sound your song with the whale,

79
00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:27.630
did the whale react like the thrush? I think it's different,

80
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:31.980
but I would say the whale seem to change what he was doing.

81
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.610
Now it can be a little hard to hear exactly what David's talking about.

82
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:39.910
It took me a few listens to pick out the distinguishing moment,

83
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:42.730
but here's what the whale was doing. When David showed up

84
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.933
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

85
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.450
<v 0>it was doing this thing. We would go, Whoa, and then down and woo and then down</v>

86
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.480
over and over. And here's what it started doing.

87
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.940
A few minutes after he'd been playing the clarinet.

88
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.483
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

89
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.150
<v 4>the whale kind of extends the note. Whales tend to go</v>

90
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.290
[inaudible] and clarinets tend to go, Ooh, they play a steady tone.

91
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.390
And so the way I was trying to play a more steady note

92
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.183
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

93
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.340
<v 4>maybe,</v>

94
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.020
<v 6>no, I, I don't know that you just a little bit of an extended line. It's</v>

95
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.500
[inaudible]. I mean, it's awesome. No, I don't get, I love listening to this,

96
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:46.630
but I don't, I mean, I don't, it just sounds like

97
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.320
<v 0>the whales still doing well. Well,</v>

98
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:51.650
David says that when he played the recording to some of the two whale scientists

99
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.630
and they all are shocked, all, uh, every,

100
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.990
every scientist I played that to was,

101
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.110
did not believe that what I played them was actually alive recording.

102
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:02.630
They thought I'd done something to it, which I didn't. I mean, they,

103
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.320
they never heard a whale make a sound like that. I'm assuming,

104
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.410
which implies that the whale was reacting to his clarinet. Well,

105
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.730
because maybe the way I was just saying,

106
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.890
<v 6>shut up. Shut up up there.</v>

107
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.330
<v 0>Well, however you want to resolve it. Like we, we, we, uh,</v>

108
00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:20.340
we should move on to the real purpose of our,

109
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.220
of our gathering here this afternoon or, okay, whatever.

110
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.640
Every time you're listening to this 2:00 AM,

111
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.380
which is that he then turned to this sound right here.

112
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:35.390
<v 2>Yep. Play. This is the sound of lots of Cicadas.</v>

113
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:37.340
And, and when you, and I hear it, I mean,

114
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:41.870
it just sounds like an enormous block of monotone. No noise.

115
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.880
Yes sir. Just screech, you know, elaborate screech I knowing. But David says,

116
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:51.610
actually, if you know what's going on in here, if you learn to dissect it, wow.

117
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.500
<v 0>Pretty soon you can pick out up to nine separate sounds made by the three</v>

118
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.390
unrelated species Cicada that are there at the same time. Can you,

119
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.420
can you walk us through the nine different sounds? At least some of them.

120
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.940
By the way, that was our producer Lynn Levy. Okay.

121
00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:09.570
We have three basic species that come out whenever there's an emergence,

122
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:12.460
they're all there. So now I didn't, you know, realize that this we're doing,

123
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.260
you're walking through the woods and you hear this enormous white noise,

124
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.490
which you're actually hearing are three different kinds of Cicada,

125
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:21.900
three different species singing,

126
00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.970
three very different songs that are all mixed together.

127
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:27.060
So you can't tell them apart. And then each one of those songs,

128
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.440
each of those three has three parts, which is how you get to the number nine.

129
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.820
Any case here are the three species. This is number one. Magid,

130
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.990
CICADA Kassin I makes the white noise sound

131
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.550
<v 7>sure. Sure.</v>

132
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.140
<v 0>And they, they, they, they swell together. They synchronize. So they'll all go</v>

133
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.690
<v 8>and then they fly around a bit. Do that now. Jump up up. Yup.</v>

134
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.510
Go up your feet and you get back into to do it again.

135
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.710
<v 0>There you go. Okay, so that species number one,</v>

136
00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:13.130
how here is species number two magister Qaeda stepped in.

137
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.423
[inaudible] is making like

138
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.733
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

139
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.890
<v 0>It's kind of irregular.</v>

140
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.363
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

141
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.740
<v 0>so that's the bebop style kind of. Yeah. And there's fewer of those than there.</v>

142
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:28.710
Quieter. So less is known about them. Can I hear that one again?

143
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.140
Shall we got the white noise one? The bebop one. Now here's number three.

144
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.700
Magic CICADA Sept and [inaudible] the most popular and known sound.

145
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.870
And that's going fear. The Pharaoh sound fear rope.

146
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.510
Wow. The [inaudible].

147
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.990
And the thing is, when you actually hear millions of them,

148
00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:59.730
all you hear is [inaudible].

149
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.433
<v 9>[inaudible].</v>

150
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.790
<v 10>If you take one and multiply hundreds and thousands of time, tail disappears.</v>

151
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.230
You just hear this tone. I mean, this is what we hear,

152
00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:19.340
but what would the a Cicada hear in all this? Oh, well this is the whole story.

153
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:23.121
<v 0>Well, see,</v>

154
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:26.810
the thing about Cicadas is that this Acadias who sing here are the males,

155
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.760
just the guys, and they sing a four. It's the amazing song really. You know,

156
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:35.000
there are lots of songs you saying this is a, it's one of those kinds.

157
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.430
And the idea being the females here, all this sound. Yeah.

158
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.480
<v 10>They find the males</v>

159
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.130
like the grand mess of music,

160
00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:45.740
like a disco or it's called the Lek by biologists,

161
00:10:45.741 --> 00:10:47.610
which pretty much means disco anyway. Yeah.

162
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.640
<v 0>And then you were a guy looking for a date.</v>

163
00:10:49.641 --> 00:10:51.680
You might not join with lots of other guys,

164
00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:56.420
but these animals join together for what purpose? So the females can find them.

165
00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.260
But if you've got like a, a billion cicadas crowded into a disco,

166
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:00.800
then how do you,

167
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.800
how does a single male and a single female a notice each other?

168
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.160
They don't have to, they just bumping into each other and then it's on,

169
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.970
you know, 17 years ago,

170
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.780
John Cooley and David Marshall discovered things were more complicated than

171
00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:14.290
that.

172
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:18.040
They discovered the females make a sound after the male finishes his sound.

173
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.410
So say you're one of these males, go ahead.

174
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.300
<v 11>Uh hmm.</v>

175
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.020
<v 0>And the female has to make a wing flick. This tiny little flick.</v>

176
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.371
Exactly.

177
00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:35.900
One third of a second after the male stops or do so it's like

178
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.223
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

179
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.800
<v 0>nobody imagined such a thing was going on and they didn't imagine insects or</v>

180
00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:42.650
doing anything that's called [inaudible].

181
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:47.730
Well for one thing it sounds like that would be a male to female bit of business

182
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:51.280
one to one. When you listened to all these animals,

183
00:11:51.281 --> 00:11:54.880
you don't think they ever have a one them. They are like so many of them,

184
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.110
millions of a males are making the pharaoh sound. But when you're close to one,

185
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.010
you know the female, here's fear. Oh, if there's one close enough,

186
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:06.280
she makes the wing flick and the male knows to approach her a little bit and he

187
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.930
stopped and he goes on with a second sound.

188
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.500
It's called by John Cooley court to court to his like,

189
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.580
<v 11>oh, uh, no pharaoh, Pharaoh.</v>

190
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.590
<v 0>And then she makes the wings like again, same one as far as we know. Okay.</v>

191
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.860
Where does that tell Mr Mr, I love you guys.

192
00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:31.230
Time to start meeting and make the third sound.

193
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.230
<v 12>Just more like that, that, that, that, that, that,</v>

194
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.120
<v 0>let's do that again. So you use your hello is [inaudible]. Yeah,</v>

195
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.520
I'm getting closer is

196
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.170
<v 11>what's her offer</v>

197
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.760
<v 0>now we're kissing and et Cetera, et cetera. Is</v>

198
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.000
<v 12>that, that's what's up that, that, that, that, that,</v>

199
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.950
<v 0>so now you know when the cicadas coming,</v>

200
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.100
you hear this massive war.

201
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.850
What you're really hearing is an orchestra of sex. This,

202
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.170
just think of all these little animals getting ready to do what they were born

203
00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:07.441
to do,

204
00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:12.441
what they've been waiting 17 long years in the ground to do and all the while

205
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.350
it's the songs that matter. They're like following these little rules,

206
00:13:16.351 --> 00:13:21.351
simple rules that together it shows how very simple organisms can create things

207
00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:22.890
of great complexity and beauty.

208
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.410
Each individual doesn't have to know that much about the whole and still

209
00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:29.670
interesting things happen, which,

210
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.530
which gives you a different view of human life.

211
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.340
Your one little part in this giant thing. You,

212
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.850
you don't have to really know what's happening,

213
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.880
but you're doing your little bit for it for the whole of creation or evolution

214
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:43.290
or life for music.

215
00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:46.420
Can you do your own little thing and you're [inaudible] sure where it leads,

216
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.790
but for the individual Cicada for Tommy Cicada or Betty Cicada,

217
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:55.870
it's all pretty simple. They have their sex, they lay eggs on twigs of trees,

218
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:58.570
the eggs hatch, and then tiny little larvae,

219
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:03.400
cicadas will fall to the ground and the Milton burrow into the warm earth and

220
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.840
attach themselves to the roots of trees and then start sucking the fluid from

221
00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:11.500
tree roots. And they will do this for years and years and years.

222
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:16.090
It's a slowly growing and then for some reason that nobody can quite fathom at

223
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:20.080
the exact same moment. It's body time.

224
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.430
There are different broods of them.

225
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:24.970
So different years you can go somewhere in the country and maybe there's some

226
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:25.804
coming out.

227
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.540
And why is it that the one that's about to come out here in the northeast,

228
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:31.960
why does that happen? Only every 17 years.

229
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:35.110
Why 17 the honest answer is we really don't know.

230
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.590
We do have some evidence of how they keep track of the years,

231
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.520
which is at the CICADA monitors the temperature. We don't know how,

232
00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:44.950
but that's what they pay attention to. So in the ground,

233
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:47.290
they're not just eating tree juice.

234
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.870
They're also going to have a little thermometer somehow they're paying it.

235
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:52.310
They have a little counting thermometer. They count the number of years.

236
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:55.130
Then they know when to come out. A few years ago in my parents' house,

237
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:58.040
I did see one in the wrong year and every year a few of them wake up.

238
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.700
Where's the party? Oh really? You Have Rip Van Winkle One? Yeah.

239
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.290
They don't always count correctly. You know who's really bad?

240
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.670
Must be a lonely experience. Yeah.

241
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:12.500
The lonely Cicada looking for its kind the wrong year. The wrong place.

242
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.620
Can they go back down and go back to that? It? I don't think up.

243
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.700
They've changed. They come from their larval stage and the wings have come out.

244
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:24.260
They can't crawl back and lose the wings. Oh, did it sing?

245
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.170
That loan's a Canaan. Ah, yeah. Hey was thinking

246
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.770
<v 7>to no one to no one. To me.</v>

247
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.430
You can kind of

248
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.280
<v 0>imagine David picking up his clarinet.</v>

249
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.863
<v 13>Um,</v>

250
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.623
<v 0>and joining in</v>

251
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.103
<v 13>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

252
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.363
[inaudible] [inaudible]

253
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.630
<v 14>thanks to John Cooley and to David Marshall.</v>

254
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.660
And now Jed wants to say something.

255
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.790
What do I want to say about Glen Levy's favorite song?

256
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.800
<v 0>If you go to yes, and if you go to radio lab.org,</v>

257
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.440
you can download a, uh, a song from David Rothenberg's, uh,

258
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.570
album chosen by our producer, Lynn alleviate is her favorite song.

259
00:16:30.571 --> 00:16:32.070
You can download it for free. Also,

260
00:16:32.071 --> 00:16:34.530
David Rothenberg has a new book out called Bug Music.

261
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.640
And if you happen to be on the east coast, we have,

262
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.580
well you can do this from any coast you like,

263
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:42.090
but we have a map where you can track where these little critters are popping

264
00:16:42.091 --> 00:16:45.050
up, which there I'm doing right now. Yeah, just,

265
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:50.070
just barely in Georgia and the Carolinas and not in Brooklyn yet, but soon

266
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:51.830
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

267
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:52.581
<v 0>that'd be frying them up,</v>

268
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:56.810
making some Tim knower out making cause Rocco's cause the little guy will come

269
00:16:56.811 --> 00:17:00.770
up to you and go, I could get to cut that bit. Got to cut the cut on your leg.

270
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.490
He'll show up to the ground and burrow into the earth, and we won't see you for,

271
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.630
I don't know. It'll be like either 13 or 17 years. Thanks for listening.

272
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:13.840
I'm Jack. I boom. Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich. See you.
