â™ª Four and three and two and one

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:09.776 size:84% position:42%
  - What's up guys?

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.644 align:start position:0%
  I'm Matt FX and this is
  the Broad City music recap

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:14.080
 for episode six, Stolen Phone.

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.616
Stolen Phone starts with
a cold open by Obeycity,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.818
 A kingpin of the local
 Brooklyn music scene.

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:19.986
 Obeycity is Sam Obey,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.556
 founder of the adventurously
 cosmic label Astro Nautico.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:24.690 align:start size:88% position:13%
  He's personally
  signed to LuckyMe,

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.493 align:start position:0%
 the label started by Scottish
 producer Hudson Mohawke,

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:29.062 align:start size:88% position:13%
 who you'll know as
 one of the main sounds

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.497
 of Kanye West's most
 recent record, Yeezus.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.698 size:84% position:42%
  Obeycity's track Intrique

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:36.135 align:start position:0%
runs under Abby and Ilana's
late night Facebook booty hunt.

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:37.570
 It picks up kinda half
 way through the track,

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:39.639
 which is really good
 as the cut starts

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.707 size:84% position:42%
  speeding up while they're
  going through guys names.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.809 size:88% position:44%
  - I feel like I'm
  on coke right now!

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:43.643 size:84% position:42%
  (yelling)

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:44.544 size:88% position:44%

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.315
 - Rod White.

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:51.784 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - We are like feminist
 heroes right now!

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:52.618
(notifications blinging)

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.787 size:84% position:42%
  (yelling)

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.556 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Next up we have
 Philly act, Damn Right

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.825 align:start size:88% position:13%
setting the scene at
the bar in Stolen Phone.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.327
Damn Right features producer
and vocalist Johnny Fiessinger,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.796 size:88% position:44%
 a personal friend of Abby's
 from way back in the day,

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.164 size:88% position:44%
  so we were really
  excited to be able

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:07.133
to include Halo in the episode.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.536
 (Techno music)

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:15.808 size:88% position:44%
  - I'm from Philly.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.110
 Philadelphia.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.311
 When I was five I was actually

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.147 align:start size:88% position:13%
 an extra in the
 movie Philadelphia.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.749 align:start size:88% position:13%
 It filmed right near
 my dad's office,

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:27.787 align:start position:0%
 so, I learned about AIDS
 before a lot of my friends.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.222
- It's a really wonderful track

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.523 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it's got the perfect
tone to set the scene

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:32.758
 for a night of hitting
 on guys at the bar.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.127 size:88% position:44%
 Shout out to Swine
 in the West Village

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.195
 for being the bar we
 filmed at by the way,

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:37.730 size:88% position:44%
  you guys are dope.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.832 align:start size:88% position:13%
Lastly, I wanna
highlight another track
from the bar scene,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.467 size:88% position:44%
 Annika Zee's Make it Right.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.169 size:88% position:44%
 Make it Right plays
 underneath Abby's

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.838 align:start position:0%
 honest and cute flirtation
 scene with the guy at the bar,

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.574
 and again, sets the perfect
 tone for the emotion at hand.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:51.077
 - Cell phones are so
 close to being perfect

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.279 align:start size:88% position:13%
except that I just miss,
like, there's like a

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.081
 dial tone.
 - Dial tone!

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.549 size:88% position:44%
  - Yes! Are you kidding me?

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:58.084 size:88% position:44%
 - No. Yeah.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:01:59.318 size:84% position:42%
  - You're trying to make
  a connection with someone

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:00.686 align:start size:88% position:13%
and there's no sound
anymore, it's just like,

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.054 align:start size:88% position:13%
  hi, you're there.
  - Yeah, yeah.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:03.489
 - It's needed.

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:04.590 size:88% position:44%
 - Annika's a student at the

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:05.691 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Clive Davis
 Institute in New York

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:08.194 align:start position:0%
 and I met her a couple
 years back at a house party.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.062 size:88% position:44%
  It's been really, really
  cool watching her progress

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.131 align:start size:88% position:13%
  as both a producer
  and a vocalist.

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:13.766 align:start position:0%
  She's got a full EP coming
  out later this year,

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.468
 so keep an eye out for that.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.037
 And that was the music recap
 for Broad City's episode six,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.372
 entitled Stolen Phone.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.573

 there isn't gonna be
 a recap for next week

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.619 align:start size:88% position:13%
 as our girls get
 trapped in a hurricane

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.421
 with no electricity or music,

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.357 align:start size:88% position:13%
