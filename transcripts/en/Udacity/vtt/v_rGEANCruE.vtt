00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.260
So we've covered all different
types of monetization models

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.040
from freemium to premium.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.500
Which do you think is the best?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.950
&gt;&gt; Well, premium was the easiest to do,
but most games have a free

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.940
option because it encourages more people
to try out the game in the first place.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.560
We also learned about how
freemium games make money.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like learning about
the different types of ads.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.360
And also learning how to code them into
a game using the Amazon mobile apps API.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.570
What did you think was
the most interesting?

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.640
&gt;&gt; I thought learning about in app
purchases was great, because it went

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.410
into the details, like the importance
of being clear about value.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.040
&gt;&gt; And we also mentioned
alternate ways to monetize.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.520
Like through Amazon Underground and
outside your game by making and

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.160
selling merchandise.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.300
&gt;&gt; Now that we've learned
about all these strategies,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.261
what are our next steps?

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:48.340
I'd say,
we're almost ready to publish your game.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.880
&gt;&gt; In our next lesson,
will show you the best practices for

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.760
testing out your game and publishing it.
