00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.010
Say I live in a country of a 100
million people and there's

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.500
a presidential election
coming up.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.570
And in that presidential
election there are two

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.109
candidates.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:16.250
There's candidate A,
and candidate B.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.800
And there's some reality-- let's
say I live in a very

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.060
decisive country and everyone is
going to vote for either--

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.300
and everyone participates in
election and everyone is going

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.530
to vote for either candidate
A or candidate B.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.410
And so there's some percentage,
there's some

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.170
reality there, that p-- let me
write it over here-- maybe 1

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.460
minus p percent-- let me do
the p first. There's some

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.600
reality that maybe p percent
will vote for B, and I could

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.820
switch them around
if I wanted.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.060
So p percent are going to vote
for B, and the rest of the

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.960
people are going to vote for A,
so maybe 1 minus p percent

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.690
are going to vote for A.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.400
And you might already recognize
that this is a

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.890
Bernoulli Distribution.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.070
There's one of two values
for a sample I can get.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.660
And right here, the values I
said you're either voting for

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.750
candidate A or you're voting
for candidate B.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.220
It's very hard to deal
with those values.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.790
You can't calculate a mean
between A and B and all of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700
that-- those are letters,
they're not numbers.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.620
So to make it manipulatable
mathematically we're going to

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.380
say sampling someone who's
going to vote for A is

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.070
equivalent to sampling a 0,
and sampling someone who's

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.900
going to vote for B is
equivalent to sampling a 1.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.420
And if you do that with a
Bernoulli Distribution, we

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.220
learned in the video on
Bernoulli Distributions, that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.690
the mean of this distribution
right here is going to be

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.750
equal to p.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.090
And it's a pretty
straightforward proof for how

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.690
we got that.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.230
So the mean of this
distribution, which will

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.260
actually be not a value that
this distribution can take on,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.850
is going to be some place over
here and it is going to be

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.260
equal to p.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.830
Now my country has a
100 million people.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.470
It is practically, or is
definitely impossible for me

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.840
to be able to go and ask all
100 million people who are

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.100
they going to vote for.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.420
So I won't be able to exactly
figure out what these

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.630
parameters are going to be.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.570
What my mean is, what
p is going to be.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.910
But instead of doing that, what
I'm going to do is do a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.140
random survey.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.450
I'm going to sample this
population, look at that data,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.990
and then get an estimate
of what p really is.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.430
Because this is what I
really care about.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.740
I really care about p.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.240
So I'm going to try to estimate
p with a sample, and

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.690
then we're also going to think
about how good of an

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.670
estimate that is.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:46.360
So I am going to randomly
survey, or sample, 100 people.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.300
And let's say I got the
following results.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.710
Let's say that 57 people say
that they were going to vote

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.875
for person A.

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.020
Let me write it this way.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.350
So 57 people say they're going
to vote for A, or that's

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.260
equivalent to getting
57 samples of 0.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.650
And then the rest of the people,
once again, very

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.000
decisive population, no one is
undecided, the rest of the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.960
people, so 43 people say they're
going to vote for B.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.540
Or that's the equivalent
of sampling 43 1's.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.430
Now given this sample here, what
is my sample mean and my

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.400
sample variance?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.180
My sample mean right here, well
that's just going to be

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.150
the average of these 0's and
1's So I've got 57 0's, so

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.630
it's going to be 57 times
0 plus my 43 1's.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.700
So the sum of all of my samples,
so it's 43 1's, plus

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.890
43 times 1, over the total
number of samples

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.940
I took, over 100.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.900
So what does this get me?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.040
So 57 times 0 is 0.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.690
43 times 1 divided
by 100 is 0.43.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.920
That is my sample mean, the
mean of just the 100 data

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.520
points that I actually got.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.070
Now what is my sample
variance?

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:25.450
Sample variance is going to be
equal to the sum of my squared

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.070
distances to the mean divided
by my samples minus 1.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.770
Remember, this is a sample
variance, and we want to get

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.270
the best estimator of the real
variance of this distribution.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.220
And to do that you don't divide
by 100, you're going to

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.710
divide by 100 minus 1.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.610
We learned that many,
many videos ago.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.710
So I have 57.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.530
So I had 57 samples of 0.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.510
We'll do it in that same
yellow color--

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.400
57 samples of 0.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.230
And so each of those samples
are 0 minus 0.43

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.090
away from the mean.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.740
Each of those samples are 0.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.650
You subtract 0.43-- this
is the difference

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.380
between 0 and 0.43.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.140
And if I want the squared
distance, I square it-- that's

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.220
how we calculate variance.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.950
There's 57 of those.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.780
And then there's 43 times that
I sampled a 1 in my sample

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.540
population-- 43 times I sampled
a 1, and the 1 is 1

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.300
minus 0.43 away from the mean
because that is the mean, and

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.430
I want to square
that distance.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.860
And then I don't want to
just divide it by n.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.860
I don't want to just divided by
100-- remember, I'm trying

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.730
to estimate the true
population mean.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.160
In order for this to be the best
estimator of that, and I

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.720
gave you the intuition of why
many, many videos ago, we

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.190
divide by 100 minus 1 or 99.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.830
Let's get the calculator out
to actually figure out our

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.270
sample variance.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.160
So let me get the calculator
out, and we have-- I'll do the

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:12.880
numerator first. I have 57 times
0 minus 0.43 squared,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:27.430
plus 43 times 1 minus
0.43 squared.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:33.050
And then all of that divided
by 100 minus 1, or 99--

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.210
divided by 99 is equal
to 0.2475.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:46.380
So my variance, my sample
variance, is equal to 0.2475.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.120
And if I want to figure out my
sample standard deviation I

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.760
just take the square
root of that.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.420
My sample standard deviation is
just going to be the square

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.710
root of my sample variance.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.650
So I take the square root of
that value that I just had,

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.730
which is 0.497.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.900
So actually let me just
round that up as 0.50.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:15.270
So my sample standard
deviation is 0.50.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.590
Now if you just look at this,
you say OK, well your best

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.470
estimate of the percentage of
people voting for A or B is

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.630
really what you just saw here.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.180
Your best estimate or your best
estimate of the mean is

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.420
that 43% of people are going
to vote for B and everyone

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.190
else is going to vote for A.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.740
But an interesting question
is how good a

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.120
of a sample is that?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.230
Let's take it to
the next level.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.820
Let's try to think of an
interval around 43% for which

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.860
we are 95%, that we're
reasonably confident, roughly

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.480
95% sure that the real mean
is in that interval.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.960
Let me make it very clear.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.790
Let me draw.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.810
So when we get our sample mean
we are sampling from the

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.930
sampling distribution of
the sampling mean.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.800
Let me draw that.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.890
The sampling distribution
of the sample mean.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.210
So since we're sampling from a
discrete distribution it's

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.460
actually going to be a discrete
distribution, but

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.540
it's going to have 100
possible values.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.270
This can take on 100 different
values here.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.180
Really anything between
0 and 1.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.780
But I'll draw it kind of
continuous because it would be

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.260
hard for me to draw 100
different bars.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
If I did, you'd have a bar
there, you'd have a bar there.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.440
The odds that your sample mean
would be 1, it would be a very

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.940
low probability, and then you
would have one more bar, a bar

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.280
like that, a bar like
that, but that

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.090
takes forever to draw.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.390
So I'm just going to approximate
it with this

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.210
normal curve right over there.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.330
So the sampling distribution
of the sample mean-- let me

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.600
write it over here.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.870
So this is the sampling
distribution

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.600
of the sample mean.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.940
It has some mean here.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.230
It has a mean, and I can denote
it with the mu sub x

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.080
bar-- this tells us this is
the mean of the sample

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.970
distribution.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.680
But we know from many, many
videos that this is going to

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.540
be the same thing as the mean of
the population mean that we

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.030
are sampling from, that each
sample comes from, each of

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.820
these 100 samples come from.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.370
So this is going to be equal
to mu, which is going to be

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.620
equal to p.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.760
Now this variance over here,
the variance of this

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.470
distribution-- let me draw it
like this, or even better

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.880
let's do the standard
deviation of this

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.270
distribution.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.150
The standard deviation of this
distribution, that distance

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.470
right over here, the standard
deviation of the sampling

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.110
distribution of the sample
mean-- we've seen it multiple

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.370
times already-- it's going to
be this standard deviation--

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.690
it's going to be the standard
deviation of our population

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.690
distribution.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.040
So that standard deviation
is going to be that

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.370
distance over there.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.790
So there's some standard
deviation associated with this

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.730
distribution.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.690
It's going to be that standard
deviation divided by the

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.140
square root of our
sample size.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.680
And we saw many videos ago why
that, at least experimentally

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.430
makes sense, or why it
intuitively makes sense.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.850
So it's going to be the
square root of 100.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.740
So it's going to be this
guy divided by 10.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.130
Now we do not know
what this guy is.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.190
The only way to figure out
what that guy is is to

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.060
actually survey 100 million
people, which would have been

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.010
impossible.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:53.010
So to estimate the standard
deviation of this, we will use

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:59.490
our sampling standard deviation
as our best estimate

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.190
for the population standard
deviation.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.820
So we could say-- and remember,
this is an estimate.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.020
We cannot come up with the exact
number for this just

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.710
from a sample.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.020
But we can estimate it.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.400
Because this is our best
estimator for this standard

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.040
deviation, and if we divide it
by 10, we will have our best

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.100
estimator for the standard
deviation of the sampling

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.500
distribution of the
sampling mean.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.040
So remember, this is
just an estimate.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.870
It is just an estimate.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.780
So you kind of have to take
everything after this point

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.980
with a little bit of
a grain of salt.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.300
So it's going to be roughly
equal to or an estimate of it

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.550
is going to be 0.5.

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:42.040
And remember, every time we take
a different sample from

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.550
here this number is
going to change.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.630
So this isn't like something
in stone.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.710
This is dependent
on our sample.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.720
So it's going to wiggle around a
little bit depending on what

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.980
numbers we actually
get in our sample.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.220
But it's going to be 0.50.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:59.840
This is the s right here, this
0.50 divided by 10, which is

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.300
equal to 0.05.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:08.320
So our best estimate of this
standard deviation is 0.05, or

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.380
you could even view it as 5%.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.670
Now what I want to do is come up
with an interval around the

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:20.220
sample mean where I'm reasonably
confident using all

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.910
my estimates and all that that
there's a-- let me say I'm

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:31.820
really confident that there's
a 95% chance that the true

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:38.100
mean is within two standard
deviations-- or let me put it

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.260
this way, there's a 95%
chance that the true

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.460
mean is in that interval.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.920
So let me write this down.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:58.790
I want to find an interval
such that I am reasonably

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:06.550
confident-- and I'm putting
this kind of touchy-feely

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.140
language over here because it's
all around the fact that

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.650
I don't know for a fact that
the standard deviation is

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.540
0.05, I'm just estimating.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:28.810
But I'm reasonably confident
that there is a 95% chance

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:35.300
that the true mean of the
population, which is the same

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.830
thing as the proportion of the
population who are going to

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.270
vote for person B, or the
proportion of the population

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.170
that are going to be a 1.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.070
So this is also, we just
have to remember that

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.940
mu is equal to p.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:57.770
That there's a 95% chance
that the true

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.762
p is in that interval.

00:14:01.762 --> 00:14:04.200
And actually, since I've already
gone 14 minutes into

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.630
this video, I'm going to pause
this video, I'm going to stop

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.110
this video here, and maybe I'll
even let you think about

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.770
it just based on everything
we've done so far.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.470
We figured out the sample mean--
sorry, we figured out

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.420
the sample mean right
over here.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.035
We've figured out an estimate
for the-- and remember, this

00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:22.860
is just a sampling mean.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.850
We don't know the true-- this
is the mean of our sample.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:30.740
We don't know the true mean of
the sampling distribution, and

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.500
we also don't know the true
standard deviation of the

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.420
sampling distribution.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.490
But we were able to estimate
it with the

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.660
sample standard deviation.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.170
Now everything that we have so
far, and based on what we've

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.990
seen before on confidence
intervals and all that, how

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.820
can we find an interval such
that roughly-- and I'm saying

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.340
roughly because we had to
estimate the standard

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.070
deviation-- that there's a 95%
chance that the true mean of

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.750
our population, or the p, the
proportion of the population

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.790
saying 1, is in that interval?

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.980
And we're going to do that
in the next video.
