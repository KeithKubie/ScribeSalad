Hello Internet,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.909
Enjoying your Internetting session?

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.500
Perhaps watching this video with lots of tabs
open and full of interesting things to check

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.500
out.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.059
The Internet is amazing and that's because
of the rules which govern how it works, an

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.030
important one of which is Net Neutrality:
treating all data equally.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.020
But some Internet Providers want to ditch
this rule to insert themselves betwixt you

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.160
and your data as the most meddlesome middlemen
in human history -- to their benefit and our

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160
detriment.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160
How?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.050
Well think of the Internet as a series of
pipes.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.760
Some are ocean-and-continent spanning pipes
through which vast rivers of data flow.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.210
You don't get access to those -- they're very
expensive, and you couldn't handle it anyway.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.500
But you do have a little pipe that connects
to the big pipes, through which you can pull

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.980
down and send out data.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.999
Your pay your Internet provider to maintain
this pipe.

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.140
This rule means that your little pipe, cares
not what flows through it: cat videos, discussion

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.589
forums, calls or games.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.589
Whatever you're doing, you're using the whole
pipe to do and no website gets preference

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:56.629
over another.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.629
Everyone wants faster Internet, but that requires
more metaphorical pipe in the ground, the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.969
building of which is slow and expensive.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.640
Now you may have heard your Internet provider
on the news talking about how this rule prevents

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.420
them from building 'fast lanes' for special
kinds of data -- they want you to think they're

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.440
expanding your access to the information superhighway.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.530
But removing this rule also gives them the
power to speedbump the existing roads and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.670
charge more to use the 'fast' lane that was
just what you had before.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.490
The power to preference some data over others
is the power to favor one video site over

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.340
another and to limit a tiny part of the pipe
for the video you're watching right now or

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.760
trying to anyway.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.300
We've been through this before: and constrain
other companies in similar ways.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.300
Take the electricity.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.960
You pay for a certain amount and when it arrives
in your house you can do with it what you

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960
wish.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.640
The electricity company doesn't get to decide
that rather than build more power plants it's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.990
going to dim your bulbs and then offer a 'brighter
bulbs' monthly subscription.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.750
And so it should go with the Internet.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.150
Watts are watts and bits are bits and we'll
always need more and more.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.880
And preserving this rule for the Internet
has much wider impact than just if some company

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.540
takes more of your coins.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.570
Not to be overly dramatic here, but preserving
data equality may be one of the most important

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.240
issues in a generation.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.080
Because without this rule Internet providers
could cripple competitors they don't like.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.090
Ever notice the same company that sells you
internet also sells Cable TV and Landlines

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.379
-- stuff The Internet totally replaces?

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.060
Without data equality your Internet Provider
could narrow the pipe for competitors until

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.719
they either go out of business, pay the meddlesome
middleman, or both.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.849
It's like if one store in town super-promised
to pay for fast roads everywhere as long as

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.110
the town gave them absolute power over all
the roads no backsies.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.200
If you agree to that deal don't be surprised
when years later all traffic to them is fast

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.889
and free while the roads elsewhere are slow
and neglected.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.760
This town is basically the Internet without
net neutrality which some Internet Providers

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.170
would love, but actual Internet citizens,
not so much.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.079
Having the pipes treat all data the same lets
one guy with a good idea and a bit of programming

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.730
knowledge make something today that's seen
by millions tomorrow.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.409
But only because his data is treated equally
with everything else in the pipes.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.060
An Internet that treats data equally is an
internet that continues to shower us with

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.060
wonder.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.980
But an Internet where middlemen pick and choose
what comes through the pipe is an Internet

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.829
of stagnation for all and profit for few.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.219
Which is why some Internet providers will
always want that control, so the cost of preserving

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.379
our awesome Internet is eternal vigilance
on the part of good citizens to defend Net

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.249
Neutrality.
