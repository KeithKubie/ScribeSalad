Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience is, is the end. The way things operate is not something that's far from optimal. It's something, it's not something that sucks but it is very, is very good, very optimal heart to beat in the sense that the like for example, mortality, right eye is death important for creation, for, for his death. Important for us. Human beings for life, for us as a society is important for us to die. Like if you could live forever, would you live forever? I think miss out on the possibility that there is something, well I had this conversation with CT Fletcher yesterday cause you know he survived the heart transplant a year ago. You're in two days ago. I think it's, what do you think? I think I think mortality is essential for everything. So I think the end, we need the end to be there. Right. But do you think that we need the end to be there for the overall health of the human race or the or the all the organisms on earth or do you think we needed to be there because there's something else?

Speaker 1:          01:17          Do you think there's something else that happens to you when your body stops existing? Do you think your consciousness transcends this, this dimension? I think, uh, I think I'm not smart enough to even think about that. That's a great answer. So I think everybody on earth has that exact same answer if they're being honest. So you're talking about atheism and so on. I used to think atheism means what I just said. So, but it's more we know so little. Uh, so the, the only thing I know is that the finiteness of life is, uh, the Broadway, just a school that train, that has this poster at the, at the, at the opening, which is a hunter s Thompson quote, which is, um, uh, for about skidding into death sideways. No one's a good one. Uh, no for all moments of beauty. Many souls must be trampled, something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:16          That's a fucking great quote. God, I love that guy. Yeah. So basically for beauty, you have to have suffering. I do not disagree with you. I do not disagree with any of the things you said. And I think there's always a possibility that human beings are the most advanced life form that's ever existed in the cosmos. There's always that. That has to be an option if we are here, right? If we can't see any others out there, and even though you know there's the Fermi paradox and there's all this contemplation that if they do exist, like maybe they can't physically get to us or maybe they're on a similar timeline to us and they're also, it's also possible as as it might sound, that this is as good as it's ever gotten anywhere in the world or anywhere in the universe, rather that human beings right now in 2019 or as good as the whole universe has ever produced, we're just some freak luck accident and everybody else is throwing shit at each other, right?

Speaker 1:          03:14          There's 15 arm caterpillar people that live on some other fucking planet. They just tossed her own shit at each other and they never get any, they never get any work done. But we might be that. But even if that's true, even if this beauty that we perceive, even if that, that this beauty requires evil to battle and requires, are seemingly insurmountable obstacles you have to overcome. And that through this you see, achieve great beauty. That beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For sure. Objectively, the universe doesn't give a fuck if rocky pizza, Apollo creed in the second movie, it doesn't give a fuck. It's nonsense to everything's nonsense too. And when you look at the giant ass picture of what beauty is, if the sun's going to burn out in 5 billion years, what beauty is that? If there could be a hyper Nova next door that just cooks us.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Ugh. So that's like the book sapiens. Uh, yeah. That basically, we've all, one of the things we've created here is we've imagined ideas that we all share ideas of beauty, ideas of truth, ideas of fairness. We've all created together. And it doesn't exist outside of us as a society. And no, it only exists to us. Yeah. To us it does exist. And this is where I think the beauty of being a person truly lies. It lies in us, our appreciation of us. We appreciate people in a profound way. Like we were talking about Hendrix, I probably, I don't know how many hours of Hendricks I've ever listened to or Richard Pryor, how many hours of Richard Pryor I watched and how much that affected me as a kid watching live in the sunset strip. That's what got me to do in stand up comedy. We affect each other. A Ct Fletcher who was on the podcast yesterday who's just incredibly inspirational guy, you watch his videos, you want to lift the fucking world and throw it into space, you know?

Speaker 1:          05:16          I mean he's, he's so powerful. We appreciate each other. We appreciate people. So all those things you're saying are real. Like for us, they're real. For us, my concern is not that my concern is that we are outdated. My concern is not that there's not beauty in what we are. I'm a, I'm a, I am big appreciator of this life. I appreciate human beings in this life and human beings. Their contributions as, as a and as I get older, like particularly like over the last few years. I just started doing a lot of international travel. I fucking appreciate the shit of all these people that are living in this different way with weird and shit and weird smell and foods and I like to think like what would it be like if I grew up here? Like these are just people but they're in this weird sort of mode.

Speaker 1:          06:07          You know? I think we're insanely lucky that we have this enthusiasm for each other that we have this into like for your work man, I have this deep enthusiasm for what you do. I'm fascinated by it. I love being able to talk to you and pick your mind about like you're out there coding these fucking vehicles that are driving themselves, artificial life on wheels. I don't think any other animal appreciates each other the way people do. I mean I might be wrong. People do, right? Yeah. I might be wrong about dolphins and whales mean maybe they love each other just as much as we do just in a different way. But what, where does AI fit into that? So your worry, I'm worried that we are Australia peer thickest and AI is going to come along and make us look stupid. The only reason why I was trying to pick Australia pithy would be cool. Today's we found a gang of, I'm on an island somewhere. We were like, Holy Shit. They survived. They never evolved. They're on this island just cracking coconuts and just eating fish, whatever they can catch, that would be amazing. But everyone documented or undisclosed discovered uncontacted tribe, they're all homo sapiens, all of them. So it's like, you know.
