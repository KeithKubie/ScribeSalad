00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.220
- [Narrator] Presidents
of the United States have

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.710
many powers, but perhaps
one of the most influential

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.040
of these powers is the
power of appointment.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.870
They can, of course, appoint
members of their cabinet.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.453
They can appoint ambassadors,

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:21.453
ambassadors, and they can appoint judges.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.900
We could talk about
federal judges generally,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.580
but perhaps most importantly,
they can appoint members

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.420
of the Supreme Court, the
United States Supreme Court,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.700
and that is a very influential appointment

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.170
because these are positions
that will last for a lifetime,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.490
but this power is not unchecked.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.930
These appointments need to be confirmed

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.410
by the United States
Senate, and many times,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.400
the confirmation process
goes relatively smoothly,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.881
but sometimes, especially
when we're talking

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:58.470
about lifetime judicial appointments,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.400
especially to the United
States Supreme Court,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.290
things can get quite heated,
and perhaps the best example

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.123
of that is something

00:01:06.123 --> 00:01:07.940
that has happened quite
recently relatively

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.270
to the making of this video.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.760
2016 was an election year.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.950
In February of 2016,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.420
you have associate Justice
Scalia passes away.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.850
Now this is a really,
really big deal because,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.520
as we talked about, Supreme
Court appointments are for life,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.210
and so in theory this is now a time

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.270
where the president
would make a nomination.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.830
Now the president does make a nomination.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.970
President Barack Obama in March

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.030
of 2016 nominates Merrick Garland.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.910
Now the Republicans are not happy,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.320
and Republicans control
both houses of Congress,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.130
but most important for this
video, they control the Senate,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.550
and the reason why they are not happy is

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.770
Justice Scalia was considered to be

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.480
the conservative backbone

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.740
of the United States Supreme Court,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.990
and if all of a sudden he
is replaced with someone

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.860
who leans to the left, who leans liberal,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.590
that could change the tone.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.360
That could change the sentiment

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.080
of the United States Supreme Court

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.450
for a generation or maybe
even generations to come.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.330
So they invoke their power in the Senate,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.110
which is controlled by Mitch McConnell,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.850
who is the Senate majority leader.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.960
He decides to take a hard stance,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.710
and even though President
Obama had nominated

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.480
Merrick Garland, the Republicans
make the argument that,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.840
"Hey, this is a
presidential election year.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.580
"We're just gonna wait things out,"

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.850
so they refused to have
hearings on Merrick Garland,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.120
much less vote on his nomination,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.600
and so they essentially
just wait out the clock

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.660
through the presidential election,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.930
and then at the presidential election,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.480
you have a Republican who
gets elected, Donald Trump,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.370
and so then they are able to help get

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.950
Donald Trump's appointment
for that seat approved,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.130
and even that is a little bit

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.560
of an interesting political story.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.430
So this is a classic example
of a congressional check

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.520
on a presidential power,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.590
and this one in particular
gets people on both sides

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.580
of the aisle a little bit worked up.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.080
Democrats would say,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.600
"Wow, you did not consider an
appointment by a president,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.420
"and you waited out
many, many, many months

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.090
"just to get an outcome you wanted?"

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.460
While Republicans might say,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.020
"Wow, Mitch McConnell was
really principled here,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.450
"and he really used the
Senate's constitutional power

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.000
"to place an appropriate
check on the president."

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.880
I will let you decide.
