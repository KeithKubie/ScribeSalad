00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.666
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now at last, I'd like you to write this initial expression in its fully

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.619
factored form. To do this, look at the two terms that we have, in the step right

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:11.636
above this one, and see if they have a common factor. Then that will be a factor

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:15.356
that you can pull out and put in one set of parentheses and then figure out

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:16.314
what's left over.
