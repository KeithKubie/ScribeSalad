00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:09.591
Energy is all around us,

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:14.009
a physical quantity that follows
precise natural laws.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.479
Our universe has a finite amount of it;

00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:18.675
it's neither created nor destroyed

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.175
but can take different forms,

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.527
such as kinetic or potential energy,

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.698
with different properties
and formulas to remember.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.091
For instance,

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:29.601
an LED desk lamp's 6 Watt bulb

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.686
transfers 6 Joules
of light energy per second.

00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:35.540
But let's jump back up into space

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:39.130
to look at our planet,
its systems, and their energy flow.

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:41.714
Earth's physical systems include

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:44.216
the atmosphere, hydrosphere,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.759
lithosphere, and biosphere.

00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:49.554
Energy moves in and out of these systems,

00:00:49.578 --> 00:00:52.342
and during any energy
transfer between them,

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.759
some is lost to the surroundings,

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.208
as heat, light, sound,

00:00:57.232 --> 00:00:59.185
vibration, or movement.

00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:03.402
Our planet's energy comes from
internal and external sources.

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:06.654
Geothermal energy
from radioactive isotopes

00:01:06.678 --> 00:01:09.759
and rotational energy
from the spinning of the Earth

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:11.826
are internal sources of energy,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.872
while the Sun
is the major external source,

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:18.208
driving certain systems,
like our weather and climate.

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:21.963
Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere
in varying amounts,

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:23.675
and this causes convection,

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:26.370
producing winds
and influencing ocean currents.

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:31.842
Infrared radiation, radiating out
from the warmed surface of the Earth,

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:36.012
gets trapped by greenhouse gases
and further affects the energy flow.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.481
The Sun is also the major source
of energy for organisms.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:42.899
Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria

00:01:42.923 --> 00:01:45.510
use sunlight to produce organic matter

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:48.112
from carbon dioxide and water,

00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:50.738
powering the biosphere's food chains.

00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:54.451
We release this food energy
using chemical reactions,

00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:56.926
like combustion and respiration.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.342
At each level in a food chain,
some energy is stored

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.424
in newly made chemical structures,

00:02:02.448 --> 00:02:04.797
but most is lost to the surroundings,

00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:06.840
as heat, like your body heat,

00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:09.175
released by your digestion of food.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.424
Now, as plants are eaten
by primary consumers,

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:16.791
only about 10% of their total energy
is passed on to the next level.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.342
Since energy can only flow
in one direction in a food chain,

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:24.341
from producers on to consumers
and decomposers,

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:26.651
an organism that eats lower
on the food chain,

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:29.014
is more efficient than one higher up.

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:32.281
So eating producers
is the most efficient level

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.759
at which an animal can get its energy,

00:02:34.783 --> 00:02:38.677
but without continual input of energy
to those producers,

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:40.112
mostly from sunlight,

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:43.424
life on Earth as we know it
would cease to exist.

00:02:43.448 --> 00:02:47.424
We humans, of course, spend our energy
doing a lot of things besides eating.

00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:51.858
We travel, we build, we power
all sorts of technology.

00:02:51.882 --> 00:02:53.106
To do all this,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.933
we use sources like fossil fuels:

00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:57.808
coal, oil, and natural gas,

00:02:57.832 --> 00:02:59.560
which contain energy

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:02.466
that plants captured
from sunlight long ago

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.849
and stored in the form of carbon.

00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:07.400
When we burn fossil fuels in power plants,

00:03:07.424 --> 00:03:09.267
we release this stored energy

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:10.986
to generate electricity.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:13.267
To generate electricity,

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:16.933
heat from burning fossil fuels
is used to power turbines

00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:18.786
that rotate magnets,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.417
which, in turn, create
magnetic field changes

00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:23.666
relative to a coil of wire,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.934
causing electrons to be
induced to flow in the wire.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.674
Modern civilization depends on our ability

00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:33.886
to keep powering that flow of electrons.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.516
Fortunately, we aren't limited
to burning non-renewable fossil fuels

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.515
to generate electricity.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.644
Electrons can also be induced to flow

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:44.850
by direct interaction
with light particles,

00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:46.849
which is how a solar cell operates.

00:03:47.642 --> 00:03:49.372
Other renewable energy sources,

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.437
such as wind, water,

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.906
geothermal, and biofuels

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.388
can also be used to generate electricity.

00:03:57.332 --> 00:03:59.870
Global demand for energy is increasing,

00:03:59.894 --> 00:04:02.039
but the planet
has limited energy resources

00:04:02.063 --> 00:04:05.375
to access through a complex
energy infrastructure.

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.126
As populations rise,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.047
alongside rates of industrialization
and development,

00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:13.363
our energy decisions grow
more and more important.

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:16.559
Access to energy
impacts health, education,

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:19.942
political power, and socioeconomic status.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.348
If we improve our energy efficiency,

00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:25.393
we can use our natural resources
more responsibly

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:27.778
and improve quality of life for everyone.
