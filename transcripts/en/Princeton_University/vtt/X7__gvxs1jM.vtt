The We Speak Survey is a survey of the
Princeton student population,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
both undergraduate and
graduate students,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.700
that asks about
students' experiences

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:09.450
with nonconsensual sexual contact

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.680
on campus, and the 
administration's responses

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.910
to these issues, 
and also the general culture

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.820
on campus surrounding this issue.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.927
To someone who has not 
taken the survey yet,

00:00:18.927 --> 00:00:20.890
I urge you to take just 
15 minutes out of your

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.681
day to take the survey, 
because in order to

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:28.000
address this issue on campus, 
we need to understand it first.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.570
That's it.
