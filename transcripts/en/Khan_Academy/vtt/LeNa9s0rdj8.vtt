00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.890
We are on problem 15.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.795
A store charges $28 for
a type of sweater.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.800
This price is 40% more than it
costs the store to buy one of

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.980
these sweaters.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.370
So $28 is 40% more than
what it costs.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.750
So that equals the cost plus
40% of the cost. Right?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.090
0.4 is the same thing
as 40%, right?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.390
It's the cost plus 40%
of cost. That's

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.890
what 40% more means.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.300
Another way, you could kind of
immediately say, well, that's

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.840
just the same thing as 1.4 times
the cost. And that's

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.560
kind of shorthand.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.410
You might immediately go to the
step, 1.4 times the cost

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.800
OK, let's see what it says.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.110
At the end-of-season sale, store
employees can purchase

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.900
any remaining sweaters at 30%
off the store's cost. So the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.600
sale price-- let me call that
s-- is equal to the cost minus

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.910
0.3 times the cost. Right?

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.820
30% off of the cost. This is 30%
of the cost. You take that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.390
off of the original cost. And
that is equal to, of course,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.885
0.7 times the cost. This
is the sale price.

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:18.210
It's 0.7 times the cost. How
much would it cost an employee

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.680
to purchase a sweater of
this type at this sale?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.720
So let's see.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.020
So how much would it cost?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.490
So we could figure
out what the cost

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.070
is from this equation.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.900
We have 28 is equal to 1.4 times
the cost. Cost is equal

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.670
to 28 divided by 1.4.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.280
I just divide both
sides by 1.4.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.240
I switched them around.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.190
Let's see, 28 divided by
14 would be 2, right?

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.000
28 divided by 1.4 is 20.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.900
So that makes sense.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.170
And you could go
the other way.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.520
40% more than 20.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.110
40% of 20 is 8.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.540
You add 8 to 20, you get 28.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.160
So that's right.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.930
The cost is $20.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.000
And now the sale is 0.7 times
the cost. So sale is equal to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.450
0.7 times the cost. And
that equals what?

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.060
20 times 0.7 is $14.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.690
Because 20 times 7 is 140.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.710
You have one decimal
place, $14.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.430
So that is choice B.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.220
Next problem.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.246
Problem 16.

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:23.780
And then we're done
with this section.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.810
In rectangle ABCD-- let me
draw rectangle ABCD, even

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.110
though they haven't.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:41.350
OK, rectangle-- whoops--
A, B, C, D.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.640
In rectangle ABCD, E is
the midpoint of BC.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.960
So let me draw E.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.930
So this distance is equal
to that distance.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:04.725
If the area of quadrilateral
ABED is 2/3, what is the area

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:06.060
of the entire rectangle?

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.620
Fascinating.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.505
So they're making another
quadrilateral within this.

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:12.260
And I'll just draw it.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.880
Let me do it in another color.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.520
So they're saying the area
of this thing, ABED.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.470
Area of that thing is 2/3.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.790
And so they want you to
figure out the area

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.540
of the whole thing.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.750
And so this is just a pure
visualization problem.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.410
Because what I can do is I can
break up this rectangle in a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.710
interesting way.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.480
Let me do it with this
brown color.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.920
If I wanted to break up this
rectangle, I could break it up

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.780
into four equal triangles,
right?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.810
You see here, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.020
And how do I know
they're equal?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.570
Because E is the midpoint.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.730
We know that this side is equal
to this side, because E

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.210
is the midpoint.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.680
We know that this is equal to
this, which is equal to this.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.339
So we know that all four of
these rectangles are going to

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.450
be the same.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.120
Now, they tell us that the
area of three-- of this

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.060
rectangle, this rectangle, and
this rectangle-- right?

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.680
That's ABED.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.920
They tell us three of the
rectangles-- sorry, three of

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.250
the triangles.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.550
Have I been saying rectangles
the whole time?

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.350
These are triangles.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.550
ABEA, these are triangles.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.180
So this rectangle is made up
of four equal triangles.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.910
We know that three of the
triangles-- this quadrilateral

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.290
here-- three of the
triangles, so I'll

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.490
call them three triangles.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.590
So I'll call it 3 times
the area of each

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.402
triangle is equal to what?

00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:56.290
It is equal to 2/3.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.640
And we know that because they
told us that the area of this

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.040
plus this, plus this is 2/3.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.970
This quadrilateral is 2/3.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.810
So what's the area
of each triangle?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.160
The area of each triangle is
going to be 2/3 divided by 3,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.840
which is 2/9, right?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.900
2/3 times 1/3.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.430
Area of each triangle is 2/9.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.230
So what's going to be the area
of this entire rectangle?

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.080
Well, it's going to be this
area-- that we just know is

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.980
2/3-- plus the area of one
more triangle right here.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.240
Plus the area of
this triangle.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.170
And then we get the
whole rectangle.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.230
So plus 2/9.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.280
And this equals-- let's see,
common denominator is 9.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.290
2/3 becomes 6/9.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.720
And then you have that plus the
2/9, and this becomes 8/9.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.290
And that is choice C.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.100
And we are done.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.220
So this was a pure visualization
problem.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.930
You just had to see that the
area they gave you was three

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.270
equal triangles, and they
essentially just want you to

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.750
add the fourth onto it
and figure out what

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.160
the total area is.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.110
I'll see you in the
next section.
