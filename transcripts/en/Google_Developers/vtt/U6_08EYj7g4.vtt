The cloud Firebased
hosting integration

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.390
allows you to use
this architecture

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.300
as a back end for a web app or
microservice in your Firebase

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:01.650
If you have an existing instant
app built with a feature

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.110
plug-in, migrate to
an instant enabled app

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.670
