00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.350
Let's consider now the real world,
and in particular hedge funds.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.210
So let's consider two real world funds.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.180
One is RenTec or
Renaissance Technologies,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.930
it was founded by Jim Simons, a math and
computer since professor, and

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.489
he's had tremendous performance
over the last several decades,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.040
and Warren Buffet,
who runs Berkshire Hathaway.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.720
Both of these funds over the years
have produced similar returns.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.560
But on the one hand,
Warren Buffet holds maybe 120 stocks,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.030
and he doesn't trade much,
he just holds them.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.540
Renaissance technology trades
may be 100,000 times per day.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.920
Can a single theory relate these two?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.620
Can it account vastly widely
differing numbers of trades per year,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.840
and can it relate the fact that
they have similar performance and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.750
maybe different levels of skill?

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.500
How does that all work together?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.540
Well, yes,
there is a theory that can relate them,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.402
it's the fundamental law of
active portfolio management, and

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:09.970
I'm going to show it to
you in just a moment.
