00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.490
We'll discuss each of this in some
detail beginning with public and

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.688
private keys.

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:11.290
They're used together to facilitate
the secure transfer of information and

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.140
for other purposes.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.329
You can think of them simply as two
numbers that are mathematically related

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:18.800
but in a very complex way.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.280
One of them is public and
is freely available.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.850
The other is private and must be
secured, accessible only to its owner.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.600
Given the freely available public key,
it is prohibitively expensive and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.245
time consuming to calculate
the matching private key.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.695
PKI rests on that core assumption.

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:42.455
If you've ever done banking,
paid bills or

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:46.315
purchased anything on the Internet,
you've used these keys.
