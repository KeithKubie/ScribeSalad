1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,530
Two one.
Yeah.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,710
And we're live. All right.
So to set this up, um,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,750
when Gary was on last,
Gary Tobbs Still Stefan,

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,410
how do I say your last name? Stephanie.
DNA. DNA. DNA. It's like DNA,

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,790
like DNA with a g.
Right. Got It. Okay. Um,

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,390
when you were on last, Stephan had, uh,

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,940
some opposition to some of the
things that you were saying.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,590
We talked about getting
him on and you on together.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,850
We finally pulled it off.

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,870
Took there was a lot of wrangling was a
lot of back and forth and cat wrangling,

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,030
but we got it. We're here. Um,

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,130
give me your position on this
is all for folks listening,

13
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:50,810
this is all about obesity and the,
the mechanism for obesity,

14
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:51,710
is that fair to say?

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,640
Yeah. Yeah. So essentially, uh,

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,210
the main points that we
want to talk about today,

17
00:00:57,211 --> 00:01:01,440
I'll try to keep this a fist from your
face just so you can move it around. Um,

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,950
what causes obesity and what
causes insulin resistance,

19
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:09,480
which is behind a lot of our, um, chronic
diseases that are common in society.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,020
And please, uh, give us
your background. Yeah.

21
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:14,840
So I have a,

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,620
a BS in biochemistry,
Phd in neuroscience.

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,140
After getting my phd in neuroscience,

24
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,590
I went on to study the neuroscience of
obesity at the University of Washington

25
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:29,280
and particularly the brain circuits
that regulate body fatness.

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,290
Hopefully we'll get a chance
to talk about those today.

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,440
And then I went on to
become a science consultant,

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,250
science communicator and write a book
called the hungry brain. That is,

29
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:45,900
um, my attempt to explain for a
non specialist audience what, uh,

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,970
what causes obesity and uh,
yeah, so that's my background.

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,680
Now, what is your disagreement
with Gary's position? Everything.

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,560
Everything. Yeah. So, uh, how about,

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,380
how about I just can I start by explaining
please do what I believe caused the

34
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,400
obesity. I'm going to be long winded here.
Is that okay? Go right ahead. All right.

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,920
We have ours. Okay, cool. So first,
uh, a little bit of housekeeping,

36
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,860
I'm going to be citing a lot of
evidence today and so I was wanting,

37
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,530
he's bringing this up to you. Okay,
sure. Just moving around. Sure, sure.

38
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:19,880
You want to sit back? How's that?
Perfect. Okay. I'm going to be exciting.

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,210
A lot of evidence today and I want people
to be able to follow along at home and

40
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:29,010
so I've put many of the references that
I'm going to be siting on doesn't cover

41
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:31,350
your face. Okay, there we go. All right.

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,340
I've put a lot of the references that
I'm going to be siting on my website,

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,830
Stephan bna.com or if you don't
feel like spelling my name,

44
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:42,831
you can go to whole health source.org and
I have a numbered list of topics there

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,980
and I'm going to be calling out numbers.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,300
Just scroll down to the number that I
referred to and the references are all

47
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,850
there. The second thing I want to say, uh,

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,630
that I would want to be really clear
about today is that I'm not here to be the

49
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:00,310
anti low carb guy. Okay. Um,

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,990
I think low carb diets are valid
tool for a controlling body,

51
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,700
fatness and controlling blood sugar.

52
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,720
I'm not here to talk anybody out
of being on a low carb diet. Um,

53
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,860
what I am here to try to talk people
out of is some of the mythology that has

54
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,310
accumulated around the low carb diet.
Okay?

55
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:22,800
So I want to get started with an
analogy to help people understand, um,

56
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,840
why the brain is important and obesity.

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,400
So imagine you're an alien coming
down from outer space and you want to

58
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,110
understand what's going on on earth.

59
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,740
And you notice that on the highway some
cars are traveling faster than others.

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,850
Some cars go faster, some cars go
slower and you want to figure out why.

61
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:44,851
And so you go and you start studying the
tires of the cars because obviously the

62
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:50,650
amount of force that is exerted by the
tire onto the asphalt is the thing that

63
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,950
determines the speed of the car.
We know this, this is just physics.

64
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,660
And so you study the tires and you study
the tires and you study them and you

65
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:03,610
never figure out why some cars go
faster than others. Now, why is that?

66
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,400
The reason is that you're studying
the wrong part of the system.

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,900
If you want to understand the,
uh,

68
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,310
why some cars go faster than others,

69
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,330
you have to understand the part of
the system that regulates speed.

70
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,920
And that is the person behind the wheel.
And so in this analogy,

71
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,610
the tires are fat cells and the
person behind the wheel is the brain.

72
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,170
There has been tons of
research on fat cell biology,

73
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,920
on what factors put fat in fat cells,
what take it out.

74
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,930
It's been tons and tons
of research on that.

75
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:38,710
And it's intuitively obvious that we
should be studying that to understand

76
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,780
obesity, right? But in fact,

77
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,710
all of that research has yielded very
little insight into why some people are

78
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:49,180
fatter than, than others. That's because
it's the wrong part of the system.

79
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,190
Study fat cells do not regulate the size
of fat cells anymore than the tires on

80
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:57,790
a car regulate the,
the speed of the car.

81
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,920
The thing that regulates the size of fat
cells is the brain. So let's talk about,

82
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,100
um, first of all, give you a little
framework for thinking about this.

83
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,840
The brain evolved over about 600 million
years to promote the survival and

84
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,410
reproduction of our ancestors.
And over the course of that time,

85
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:18,100
we evolved all of these different brain
circuits that have specialized functions.

86
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,260
They generate our hunger and our
cravings and our fullness feelings.

87
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,320
They generate our eating behavior,
what and how much we eat.

88
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,830
And they actively regulate the
amount of fat on our bodies.

89
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,420
And that's one of the
things I want to talk about.

90
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,130
And all of these circuits evolved.
And these are nonconscious by the way.

91
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:38,020
So you don't decide.
You want to be hungry,

92
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,210
you don't decide that you
want to have a craving.

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,840
These are things that bubble up from
nonconscious parts of your brain that you

94
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,780
don't control. So, um,

95
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,770
these circuits are calibrated to
an environment of our ancestors,

96
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,750
not the environment that
we're living in right now.

97
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,480
So these circuits all evolved to function
optimally in the environment of our

98
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,680
ancestors. Pr Promote the survival
and reproduction of our ancestors.

99
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,640
So what happens when you put these
brain circuits in the modern environment

100
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:13,490
where you have abundant
calorie, dense, tasty foods,

101
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:17,810
rich in carbohydrate and fat is these
same brain circuits push us to over

102
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,560
consume and they push our bodies
to accumulate and hold on to fat.

103
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,000
And then what you see as a result
is the three hallmarks of obesity.

104
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,370
First of all, the obvious, you see
elevated body fat mass. Second of all,

105
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,440
you see elevated calorie intake.

106
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,030
People with obesity consume more calories
than people who do not have obesity

107
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:42,590
after correcting for height and
sex and physical activity level.

108
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,761
And third,

109
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:48,440
you see that people with obesity defend
their higher level of body fatness

110
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,360
against changes. And so there's actually
a regulatory change that happens.

111
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,520
It's not conscious defense,
you know,

112
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,970
they're not trying to remain obese.

113
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,740
It's these body fat regulatory circuits.
And this is where Gary gets it right,

114
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,840
is that people with obesity are not
just lean. People who eat more calories.

115
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,550
There's actually a change
in the regulatory activity
that regulates body fat in

116
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:15,890
the body.
And we can get back to how that happens,

117
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:20,150
but I'll just leave it there for now.
So up until this point,

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,990
I've basically just been telling
a plausible story, right? I mean,

119
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:27,440
I haven't actually cited any
evidence yet to support that.

120
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,950
My story is correct. Um,
and so let's get into that.

121
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,100
Let's talk about what some of the evidence
is that supports this idea that I've

122
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:37,850
just laid out. So I
want to start with, um,

123
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,920
the genetics of obesity.
I think this offers some wit.

124
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,410
[inaudible] uh, as long as it's
very brief. The question I don't,

125
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,470
I still don't quite understand
what the model is. Okay.

126
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:51,540
Now I have to say about this.
How about environment?

127
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,260
If you don't understand the model,
how about I lay out,

128
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,040
how about I finish laying it out and
then you can ask a question because I may

129
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,220
answer your question over the
course of a continuing. So let me,

130
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,380
let me just finish. Um, okay.

131
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:08,381
So now the genetics of obesity offers
us a lot of insight into the biological

132
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:14,900
mechanisms that drive differences in
body fatness in the general population.

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,930
So you get these studies,
like the,

134
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,720
the most interesting studies or the
Genome Wide Association studies.

135
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,250
They get hundreds of thousands
of people together and they, um,

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,530
sequence or they measure all these markers
in their genomes and they figure out

137
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,770
what parts of the genome makes
some people fatter than another.

138
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:37,190
So if you have version a in
this particular location,

139
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,680
you end up a little fatter
than if you have version B.

140
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,470
And when you look at all the
places where this is happening,

141
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,920
you can see the genes where it's
happening in. And that tells you,

142
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,750
if you look at what those genes are doing,

143
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,670
that tells you what the mechanisms are
that underlie everyday differences in

144
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,940
body fatness, in the general population.
And so to kind of warm ourselves up,

145
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,640
let's start by talking about height genes.

146
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:03,630
So height has a strong genetic component.
So does body fatness,

147
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,830
um,

148
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,670
and researchers as figured out a lot of
the genes that underlie differences in

149
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:12,420
height between people.
And when you look at what those genes do,

150
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,620
they tend to be involved in the growth
and development of the skeleton and the

151
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:19,080
connective tissue, which is
what you would expect, right?

152
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:21,030
Cause growth of the skeleton
determines your height.

153
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,840
So genes that determine diabetes risk
type two diabetes are all about insulin

154
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,380
sensitivity,

155
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:33,381
all about insulin secretion
and the function of the
insulin secreting pancreas,

156
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,660
which is what you expect because
diabetes is a disease that is all about

157
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:44,130
insulin. So these studies are really good
at getting at the underlying biological

158
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:46,890
mechanisms that are
driving these phenomena.

159
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,890
So what do these studies
had to say about obesity?

160
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,290
If Gary's model is correct,

161
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,850
we should see a bunch of genes popping
up related to fat cells and insulin.

162
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,130
If my model is correct,

163
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,300
we should see a bunch of genes popping
up related to the brain. And in fact,

164
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,650
that's exactly what we see.

165
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,450
The genetics of obesity are overwhelmingly
related to differences in brain

166
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:13,070
activity between individuals.
And um,

167
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,220
okay so that's one piece of evidence.
Another piece of evidence.

168
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,060
There are five FDA
approved weight loss drugs.

169
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,670
Four of those act in the brain.

170
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,200
One of them reduces dietary fat
absorption in the digestive tract.

171
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,070
There are no effective fat
loss drugs that I'm aware of.

172
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:36,810
The target insulin or fat cells.
Third piece of evidence. Um,

173
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:37,620
if you look at,

174
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,160
some people get really unlucky in life
and they end up with these horrible

175
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:45,000
genetic mutations that, you know,
knock out some biological pathways.

176
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,030
Some of these people end up with
extreme obesity people and also animals.

177
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,680
We see this in mice and rats.

178
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:55,590
Just occasionally you get unlucky
and you get really, really fat.

179
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,280
And researchers have been
cataloging what are these mutations?

180
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:01,770
When we find people who are
genetically really obese,

181
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,560
what are these mutations
that are making them fat?

182
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,700
What is the biological mechanism that's
getting screwed up that's making them

183
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,420
fat?

184
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,290
And what they've found is that all of
these mutations that they've identified to

185
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:13,680
date,

186
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,680
a number of them are occurring
in the Leptin signaling pathway.

187
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,430
And this is the Leptin,
um,

188
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,180
is the primary fat regulating
hormone in the body.

189
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,150
Gary avoids this,
never talks about this in his writing,

190
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:34,170
but Leptin as the primary fat
regulating hormone in the body.

191
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,050
And these mutations
either knock out Leptin,

192
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,250
they knock out leptin receptors or they
knock out the left and response pathway

193
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:45,870
in the brain. And um, so that's
the third piece of evidence.

194
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,763
Okay.

195
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,520
So now we haven't really gotten around
to talking about what it is exactly about

196
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,880
the bad interaction that happens between
our ancient brains in the modern food

197
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,240
environment that causes us to become fat.
Um,

198
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,640
we've established that the
brain is central to obesity,

199
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:07,030
but we haven't really established what
it is exactly about that interaction.

200
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,920
Why does our modern food, why does our
modern environment promote obesity?

201
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:16,210
Right.
So I'm basically,

202
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,360
there are three different ways that
I'm going to look at this from,

203
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,480
um,
but first I want to say that the,

204
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,650
probably the best way to answer this
question is to start with the question,

205
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,810
what is the most fattening
diet in the world?

206
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,190
What is the Diet that is more fattening
than any others in the answer to that is

207
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,590
it's human junk food in a variety
of nonhuman species and humans.

208
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,950
It's human junk food that is
more fattening than any others.

209
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:48,910
And I'm going to skip over some of the
research here that demonstrates this.

210
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,600
By the way, I haven't been
calling out numbers here. Okay,

211
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,240
let me call out some numbers.
Um,

212
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,520
reference number two on my website is,
um,

213
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,320
those genetic studies.

214
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,400
Reference number one is the obesity drugs.

215
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,290
Reference number six, is those
spontaneously occurring genetic mutations?

216
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,770
And now I'm talking about reference
number 52. So I'm, I'm gonna,

217
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,700
I'm going to gloss over some of the
individual research cause I'm being long

218
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,240
winded here.
But um,

219
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,180
essentially what you find is that this
stuff is really fattening and animals,

220
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,320
many different species. It's super
fattening and humans calorie dense.

221
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,330
When you put create an environment
with abundant easy calorie, dense,

222
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,720
tasty foods,
rich carbs and fat,

223
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,140
you see this dramatic overconsumption in
fact game across many species including

224
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:43,960
humans.

225
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,960
And what you find in the research is that
the sugar and the carbohydrate cannot

226
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,880
explain that they're part of the
effect. Yes, they explained part of it.

227
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,920
But you cannot replicate that effect
by only feeding sugar and carbohydrate.

228
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:03,460
You can't replicate it in animals.
You can't replicate it in humans.

229
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,400
When you say you can't replicate it,
you mean you can't replicate obesity?

230
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,950
What do you mean? Yeah. Um,
that's right. You cannot,

231
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,780
you cannot cause the
same degree of fat gain.

232
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,670
The same extent of fat gain,

233
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,380
the same extent of overconsumption using
only sugar and carbohydrate that you

234
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:23,860
can cause with a variety of calorie dense,

235
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,810
palatable human foods. You can't fully
replicate it with sugar and carbs.

236
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,960
You cannot fully replicate
it with fat alone either.

237
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,100
If you put those when we can, we can get
deeper in this if you want. I'm confused.

238
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,320
So you're,
you're saying that the,

239
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:42,460
the Diet that causes the most
obesity is what we think, right?

240
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:47,020
This a human junk food diversion,
sugar, simple carbs, bullshit,

241
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,960
bullshit type right.
What do you,

242
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,270
you're saying that you can't
replicate that with just,

243
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,010
you cannot fully replicated in some,

244
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,760
what I mean is that if you just feed,

245
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,040
if you just increase sugar
intake in animals or in humans,

246
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,900
you do get weight gain.

247
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,320
But it is modest compared to what you
get when you put people around a variety

248
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:15,170
of calorie dense, palatable foods,
rich in carbohydrates and fat.

249
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,090
Similarly, if that's very
confusing. How's that?

250
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,960
Because I'm not sure exactly what
you're saying. You're saying you,

251
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,020
if you give people this calorie
rich sugar diet of junk food,

252
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,720
you will make them gain weight
but not as much weight as what?

253
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,160
Um,
so what I'm saying is that if you,

254
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,700
if you give people or animals the,

255
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,290
the actual human junk food with all
the carbs and fat and everything,

256
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,800
they gain a lot more weight and a lot
faster than if you just give them a diet

257
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:56,540
that's high in sugar and
high in refined carbohydrate.

258
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,130
And what that shows is that the sugar and
they're fine carbohydrate cannot fully

259
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:05,180
explain the effect. Can't fully
explain why those foods are fattening.

260
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,850
See this is where I'm confused. No, I
don't see what you're saying cause you're,

261
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:11,960
you're saying if you give people
the Diet of American junk food,

262
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,860
you,

263
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,860
you get not as much of an effect if
you give them just the sugar and the

264
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,370
carbohydrates. So you're saying, Yep. So,

265
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,500
but what are you giving them when you're
giving them the g the Diet of junk food.

266
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,300
You give them.
For example,

267
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,200
in animals now it's different because
if you think about human junk foods,

268
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,850
generally those foods contain fat and
carbohydrate and salt and all kinds of

269
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:39,690
other things, so it's more, it's more
than just let's a lot of soda, no

270
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,170
sugar, so I'll get in more detail.
So the ways that you can do this,

271
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,000
you can add sugar,

272
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,530
just sugar table sugar to the feet
of animals. That's one way to do it.

273
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:55,160
Or you can add it to their drinking water.
Sometimes it's a little bit fattening,

274
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:59,930
sometimes it's not. It's not that
fattening and animals and humans,

275
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,460
you can ask them to drink sugar sweetened
beverages that are just sugar and you

276
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:08,090
can see what happens and people will
gain weight or you can tell them to stop

277
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:10,490
drinking sugar sweetened beverages
and you could see what happens.

278
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,520
People will gain weight,
they will lose weight.

279
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,370
Suggesting that that is
part of the explanation,

280
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,730
but it's a much smaller effect than you
see with this full pallet of these foods

281
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:26,810
that contain carbs and fat and all of
this other stuff. Desire saying car.

282
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,670
Well obviously there's
more calories right?

283
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:31,400
If there's carbs and fat and
all these other, correct.

284
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,050
If you think that calories matter, then we
agree. Oh, hold for short matters. Right?

285
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,100
Gary doesn't think it matters.
You don't think it matters. Well,

286
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,880
we think it's the wrong
way to think about it.
