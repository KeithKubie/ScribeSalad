00:00:00.657 --> 00:00:03.707
- [Voiceover] We're now entering into 1944

00:00:03.707 --> 00:00:06.466
where the Americans and
the Allies are able to go

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:10.004
even more on the offensive
versus the Japanese

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.802
and get closer and closer to Japan,

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:14.571
get in bombing range of Japan

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:17.199
and deprive the Japanese of,

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.705
I guess you could say,
their forward bases.

00:00:19.705 --> 00:00:21.866
And so right as we enter into 1944,

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.019
and once again I'm giving you an overview

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.559
I'm not giving every
single battle that occurs,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.967
the Unites States is
able to take Kwajalein.

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:32.510
Which, once again, the strategic
value of a lot of these,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.750
these islands are tiny

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.298
they're barely large enough
to have primitive bases

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:39.801
plus, kind of an air field,

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:41.882
but they're incredibly valuable because

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:45.667
the bombers can land,
refuel, get resupplied

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:47.046
and then take off from there

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:51.214
and then be on the
offensive even further in.

00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:53.450
I guess you could say
in Japanese territory.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.797
And with the taking on Kwajalein,

00:00:54.797 --> 00:00:56.999
just as a bit of a reminder,

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.980
the Americans, amongst other things,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.122
now had control of the Soloman Islands.

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:06.445
They now have control of the
Marshall and Gilbert Islands.

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:10.146
They now have control of the
Marshall and Gilbert Islands.

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:13.315
And as we'll see, the real theme of 1944

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:15.695
as we get into the middle
of and the end of the year

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:19.482
is to get as close as possible
to the Japanese mainland.

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:23.772
Because the Americans now had a B-29,

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:28.492
or they had the B-29 bomber
that had a 1500 mile radius.

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:32.981
1500 mile, I guess I
could say 1500 mile range.

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:36.421
Which means if they're
able to get points of

00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:38.598
where their bombers
could land and take off,

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.327
and once again these bombsers
are way too large and heavy

00:01:41.327 --> 00:01:42.536
to land on a carrier,

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.698
but if they can find islands
where they can do that from

00:01:44.698 --> 00:01:47.414
within a 1500 mile range of Japan

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:49.514
then the United States
could have bombing attacks

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:53.868
directly on Japan and
hopefully get closer to

00:01:53.868 --> 00:01:55.581
an end to the war.

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:56.611
So that was really the theme,

00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.439
get as close as possible to Japan

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.067
and then there was a secondary theme

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:01.980
of take back The Philippines.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.968
One, it was a matter of pride,
it was a former US possession

00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:08.099
ever since the Spanish-American War.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.211
But then on top of that,

00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.210
The Philippines are incredibly
strategic for shipping lanes

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.697
from Indonesia, remember
those raw materials,

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:17.174
those resources, that
oil that Japan wanted

00:02:17.174 --> 00:02:19.143
from Indonesia.

00:02:19.143 --> 00:02:21.764
If you control The Philippines

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:23.444
you're gonna control the
shipping lanes between

00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:26.074
Indonesia and Japan.

00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:28.675
So you could deprive Japan
of those natural resources.

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:30.875
So The United States' kind of

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.780
main focal areas in 1944,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.888
get as close as possible to
Japan, get within bombing range,

00:02:36.888 --> 00:02:38.956
and take The Philippines.

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:41.628
And this is exactly what they did.

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:45.133
As we go into the summer of 1944,

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:48.917
and one, there were some, as
early as the summer of 1944,

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:53.643
some bombing raids that
took off in China to Japan

00:02:53.643 --> 00:02:56.495
with the new B-29s.

00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:59.518
So you do have some of these
that happened as early,

00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:02.124
some of these bombing
raids happened as early

00:03:02.124 --> 00:03:05.382
as summer of 1944.

00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:09.008
But in terms of actual
islands, or territory

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:11.225
The United States takes or takes back

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:14.327
in the summer, in June of 1944,

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:17.345
you have The Battle of the Philippine Sea.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:21.097
So Battle of Philippine
Sea occurs right around,

00:03:21.097 --> 00:03:23.078
right around here.

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:27.840
It's a victory for The US.
It's a victory for The US.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.998
And it ends up really, really

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:35.106
hurting Japanese ability

00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:36.914
to field carriers,

00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:40.146
have air warfare from carriers

00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:42.287
because so much of their

00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:44.369
carrier capability

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.567
was damaged in The
Battle of Philippine Sea.

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:51.734
So, The Battle of

00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:56.992
Philippine

00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:00.491
Battle of the Philippine Sea

00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:04.008
this occurs in June

00:04:04.008 --> 00:04:05.778
1944.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:08.601
And along with that, in the summer,

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:12.483
the Allies are able to
take several islands

00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:14.360
in The Mariana Islands.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.049
Once again, this is
gonna be super important

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.277
because from The Marianas,
they're able to launch

00:04:18.277 --> 00:04:22.149
B-29 bombing attacks on
the mainland in Japan.

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:24.642
And so over that summer the Allies,

00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:28.536
the Americans in particular,
are able to take Saipan,

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:32.703
they are able to take Guam,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.322
they are able to take Tinian,

00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:37.271
which is this little
island right over here.

00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:39.147
Some of these islands
are quite hard to find.

00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:40.645
They're super small, in fact,

00:04:40.645 --> 00:04:43.016
even these little dots
exaggerate their size,

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.530
if you were to actually go onto
Google Maps or Google Earth

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.840
you'll see how small these are.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.699
And I encourage you to look at them

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.553
it's really fascinating to see how small

00:04:49.553 --> 00:04:50.677
some of these islands are.

00:04:50.677 --> 00:04:52.339
They're really atolls, a lot of these are

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:53.991
more atolls then islands.

00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:55.247
Not all of them are atolls.

00:04:55.247 --> 00:04:57.659
But you see, they barely have enough space

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.826
for a landing strip for
planes, especially the B-29s.

00:05:02.714 --> 00:05:04.698
And then as we go further into the summer

00:05:04.698 --> 00:05:08.351
and we start entering
kind of later in the year,

00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.392
the Americans are able to take,

00:05:10.392 --> 00:05:14.199
at the time what was called
Peleliu, now it's Palu.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.366
So Peleliu, they're able to take Morotai,

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:23.515
and then perhaps most importantly in 1944,

00:05:23.515 --> 00:05:27.141
this might be the biggest
deal out of all of these

00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:28.986
pacific battles that
occur and all of these

00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:30.439
naval battles that occur,

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:34.606
is The Battle of Leyte an
The Battle of Leyte Gulf.

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.994
Because The Battle of Leyte was important

00:05:37.994 --> 00:05:41.744
because in the process of taking Leyte

00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:44.640
The United States essentially
is able to knock out

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.198
the Japanese's ability to further defend,

00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:49.484
I mean they will continue,

00:05:49.484 --> 00:05:52.250
but realistically defend
the rest of The Philippines.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.750
So once Leyte is taken by the Allies

00:05:57.532 --> 00:06:00.370
the odds of the Japanese
being able to hold

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.237
the rest of The Philippines
becomes very low.

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:04.867
And maybe even more important,

00:06:04.867 --> 00:06:08.802
The Battle of Leyte Gulf, which
occurs right around there,

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:12.308
it's an incredibly decisive
battle for the American Navy.

00:06:12.308 --> 00:06:16.334
The Japanese go all in, and
that bet is not a good one.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:19.908
The Japanese Navy is pretty much destroyed

00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:22.959
in The Battle of Leyte Gulf.

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:25.842
And so 1944, once again,

00:06:25.842 --> 00:06:27.414
very good year for the Allies.

00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:30.535
Very bad year for the Japanese.

00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:34.368
Now the Allies are in control of

00:06:34.368 --> 00:06:36.803
they're in control of air strips,

00:06:36.803 --> 00:06:39.284
from which they can take B-29 raids

00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:41.367
to the mainland of Japan.

00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:43.487
So air strips,

00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:45.685
they can now, they're now within range

00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:48.362
to do bombing attacks on
the mainland of Japan,

00:06:48.362 --> 00:06:53.350
and they now are very likely
to control The Philippines

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.094
and control the shipping
lanes from Indonesia to Japan

00:06:57.094 --> 00:07:01.204
and they've all but
destroyed the Japanese Navy.

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:05.538
So, once again, things are not
looking very good for Japan.

00:07:05.538 --> 00:07:09.741
And as we go into 1945,
we'll see the Allies

00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:13.160
get closer and closer and get more intense

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.358
bombing raids on Japan.

00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:16.821
And every time they get closer,

00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:18.476
the battles to take these islands,

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:20.003
Iwo Jima, Okinawa,

00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:22.975
incredibly incredibly bloody

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.322
and The United States says,

00:07:24.322 --> 00:07:25.961
'Well what do we have to do to get

00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:27.641
the Japanese to surrender?'

00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:31.239
And we'll see what, at
least in the mind of Truman,

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:32.572
needs to happen.
