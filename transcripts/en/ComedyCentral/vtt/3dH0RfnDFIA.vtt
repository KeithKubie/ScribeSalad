00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.637
The Internet lost its (bleep)
last night

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.440
over some salacious new gossip
generated by BuzzFeed

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.609
about President-Elect
Donald Trump.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.377
The explosive leak
is unverified.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.679
-(laughter)
-Uh, we don't know if it's true.

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:14.615
Now I have to say,
we were working

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.416
last night when this broke.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.318
I didn't really get all
the details-- I'm really busy--

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.020
but I honestly
don't see what the big deal is.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.955
Everybody loves
<i>The Golden Girls.</i>

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.557
-What is the problem?
-(laughter)

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.259
It's especially...

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.895
What's the big deal?

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:30.931
-(cheers and applause)
-Yeah. Right?

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.633
Oh.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.601
And if they're peeing on you,
even better.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.870
(laughter and groaning)

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.605
At a press conference
this morning, Trump confirmed

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.575
via catchphrase that his sons
will be running his companies.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.777
I hope at the end of eight
years, I'll come back,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.913
and I'll say,
"Oh, you did a good job."

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:50.184
Otherwise, if they do a bad job,
I'll say, "You're fired."

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.554
-(laughter)
-I see he did the, uh...

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:55.556
It's the thing he said
on the thing.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.691
-(laughter)
-He also...

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.026
He also promised reporters

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.995
his inauguration would be
"very, very elegant."

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:03.397
Instead of popular A-listers

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.831
and artists
that millions of people

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.700
would be interested in seeing,
his planner said

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.969
he'll be surrounded
with "soft sensuality."

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.971
A "soft sensuality."

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.473
I don't know. Maybe like
a nice, romantic dinner at home

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.409
with Mike Huckabee
in a velvet robe.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.644
-(laughter)
-That's very soft.

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:19.546
And sensual.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.981
Don't neglect the Huckabees.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.617
Uh, comedians, with all
this craziness surrounding

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.019
our golden leader, how exactly
is Trump's inauguration

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:28.789
going to be elegant?
Emily?

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.024
He's gonna swear
on a solid gold bible

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:32.526
that encrusted
in Swarovski crystals,

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.628
but it'll be the size of,
you know, like,

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:38.131
-a cereal box you get at a diner
so that, uh... -(laughter)

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.268
...you know, so that
his little hand looks real big.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.703
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yeah. Okay, points.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:43.904
-(applause)
-Points. Matt Kirshen.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.207
Uh, it'll smell
like the finest asparagus.

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:49.276
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yes. Points.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.911
Points. Rhys.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.579
Thanks, everybody.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.748
(laughter)

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.083
-Ah. -Very good.
HARDWICK: Yes. I'm so sorry.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.784
It must of been hard
for you to start talking

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.720
from that thunderous round
of applause.

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.355
(laughter)

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:03.624
What's...?

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:05.092
(laughter)

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.060
We've got a good four years
ahead of us.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.863
I think
this large red button will

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.266
launch my fireworks display.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.001
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Okay.

00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:15.335
Oh.

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.703
(imitates explosion)

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:16.803
(laughter)
