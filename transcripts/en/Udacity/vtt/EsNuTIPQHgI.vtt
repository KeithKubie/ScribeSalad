00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.210
Here's an example of a web form.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.900
A user enters his name and password.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.790
The password is sent in encrypted
hash form to the web server, and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.690
the web server needs to retrieve the
user's password hash from the database

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.219
and compare and authenticate the user.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.590
The web server issues a SQL
query to the database, so

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.510
this is the example of normal usage.
