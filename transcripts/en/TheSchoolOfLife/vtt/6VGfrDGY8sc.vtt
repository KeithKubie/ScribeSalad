00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.119
Animals don’t set out to teach us anything
at all – but we all have a lot to learn

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:12.009
from our interactions with them nevertheless.
Imagine that we come back from work unusually

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.160
late. It’s been a tricky day: a threatened
resignation, an enraged supplier, a lost document,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.800
two delayed trains… But none of the mayhem
is of any concern to one friend waiting by

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.720
the door uncomplicatedly pleased to see us:
Pippi, a two-year-old Border Terrier with

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.360
a continuous appetite for catching a deflated
football in her jaws. She wants to play in

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.310
the usual way, even if it’s past nine o’clock
now, with us in the chair and her sliding

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.900
around the kitchen, and, unexpectedly, so
do we. We’re not offended by her lack of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.290
overall interest in us. It’s at the root
of our delight. Here, at last, is someone

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.150
wholly indifferent to almost everything about
us except for our dexterity at ball-throwing,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.770
someone who doesn’t care about the Brussels
meeting, who will forgive us for not warning

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.519
the finance department in time about the tax
rebates and for whom the Lisbon conference

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.170
is beyond imagining. One of the most consoling
aspects of animals – it might be a dog,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.990
a sheep, a lizard or a beetle – is that
their priorities have nothing whatsoever to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.590
do with our own perilous and tortured agendas.
They are redemptively unconcerned with everything

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.460
we are and want. They implicitly mock our
self-importance and absorption and so return

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.530
us to a fairer, more modest sense of our role
on the planet. A sheep doesn’t know about

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.999
our feelings of jealousy, it has no interest
in our humiliation and bitterness around a

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.960
colleague; it has never emailed. On a walk
in the hills, it simply ambles towards the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.320
path we’re on and looks curiously at us,
then takes a lazy mouthful of grass, chewing

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.820
from the side of his mouth as though it were
gum.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.100
Ducks nibble
at the weeds, waddle down to the water and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.229
paddle about in circles without any interest
in which century it happens to be from a human

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.240
point of view; they’ve never heard of the
economy; they don’t know what country they

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.010
live in; they don’t have new ideas or regret
what happened yesterday. They don’t care

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.760
about the career hurdles or relationship status
of the person who sprinkles a few bread crumbs

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.450
near them. Time around animals invites us
into a world in which most of the things that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.740
obsess us have no significance – which corrects
our characteristic over-investment in matters

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.100
which make only a limited contribution to
the essential task of existence: to be kind,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.560
to make the most of our talents, to love and
to appreciate.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:47.120
we believe in making the world a more emotinally intelligent place.  To that end we have also produced some extra ordinary books.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.200
As well as other merchandise that re-enforces some of the themes illustraited in our videos.
