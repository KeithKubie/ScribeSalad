[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.910
- It has been one of the most
successful shows on Broadway.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.120
- It's the hottest ticket.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.720
- One of my favorite
Broadway shows.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.800
- 19 different productions
around the world

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.019
in seven languages.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.810
- Simply the most
astounding and phenomenal

you will ever have.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.630
- One of the great
hit shows of all time.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.380
- The most unique
show ever performed.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.550
- Remarkable experience.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.290
Most fantastic show.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.580
- 63 million people.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.055

become a phenomenon.

[MUSIC - "THE CIRCLE OF LIFE"]

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.050
- By the summer of 1994,
"Lion King" is a giant hit.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.580
And because it's existed as
a film, as books, as music,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.882
it ends up in people's homes
and then touches them so much

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:15.423
because of its
theatrical experience.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.430
- The question was, how does the
audience know where to focus?

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.590
The dimensionality of
theater allows the audience

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.990
to focus on the puppet and
forget about the puppeteer.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.840
I believed in that.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.070
As a director, you're always
looking for the abstraction

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.000
of what the whole is.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.960
It's the circle.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.339
It's the circle of life, it's
the sun, it's Mufasa's head.

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:41.630
- If you look in Julie's
original designs for the mask,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.930
you'll see a series of circles.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.930
And then this is how she
interpreted that design

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.236
into a physical mask
when she sculpted it.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.770
- One of the reasons why
the "Lion King" worked

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.080
was that it was a
good collaboration.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.975
- Lebo M's influence on this
project was so enormous.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.230
- Everybody has that deep
emotional reaction to it.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.470
I mean, people start crying
at the opening of the play.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.510
I have never seen
anything like it.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.150
- The idea of having to
put a wildebeest stampede

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.710
on the stage, yes,
I'd love to try that.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.970
- People who have touched the
"Lion King" and its texture,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.660
this tapestry of the Lion
King, are deeply moving to me.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.980
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.980
- I would love to come back and
see it again like five times

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.980
over.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.480
- Wow.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.060
That's all I can say is wow.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.980
- I loved it.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.940
All the songs, the
music, it was great.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.900
- Every time you see it,
you see something new.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.450
- We're going to pick one of
you to be in "The Lion King"

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.950

And now, a special performance
from "The Lion King."

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:07.950
- You know, I can't hear
the beginning of that song

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.810
without crying.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.750

One of the performers
up here today

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.880
opened "The Lion King" with me
at the New Amsterdam theater

in 1997.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.300
She performed in

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.660
Now, it says here on this cue
card that I can tell a personal

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.440
opening anecdote here about
his-- my experience-- his,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.010
mine--

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.810
experience with the show.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.900
I was 21 when I was hired
for "The Lion King,"

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.170
and I think rehearsals had
been going on for about, what,

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.370
three days?

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.760
Three days before I,
on the fourth day,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.060
was hired an hour before
the first rehearsal.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.060
And that was how my
Broadway career started.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.480
Tom Schumacher walked up
to me after my callback,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.320
and then the room
says, congratulations,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.970
you just booked your first show.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.920
You have an hour before
you have to report

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.665
to rehearsal upstairs.

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:28.074
[SCREAMS]

00:11:28.074 --> 00:11:30.490
So I called my mother who was
teaching school at the time,

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:35.380
and I made the secretary patch
my call into her classroom.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.900
And I said, mom,
I'm on Broadway.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.200
I don't know what that means.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.991
I don't know what "The
Lion King" is really

00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:42.429
going to-- what
to expect, but I'm

00:11:42.429 --> 00:11:43.720
going to be in a Broadway show.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.750
And she said,
[SCREAMS],, and her class

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.480
probably got out of a
lot of homework that day.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.480
Tom Schumacher, the
producer of "The Lion King,"

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.480
says that it's a show that
speaks to everyone because it's

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.690
about what happens on
Earth after we leave it.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.850
The song that
performed just now,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.460
"He Lives in You," and the
reprise, "They Live in You,"

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.240
is a perfect example
of this sentiment.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.210
Why is it that you think
that this show resonates

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.724
with so many people?

00:12:11.724 --> 00:12:13.390
ADRIENNE WALKER: Well,
I'm going to have

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.280
to borrow something that Julie
Taymor said earlier this week.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.720
CHRIS JACKSON:
Always a good thing.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.678
ADRIENNE WALKER: She came
by to visit the cast,

00:12:18.678 --> 00:12:20.890
and she kind of gave us
some motivational words,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.740
and talked about the
process when it first began.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.870
And she said something
that stayed with me,

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.560
and that's that the show--

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.719
the story is something that
everyone can relate to.

00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:32.260
No matter their
background, no matter

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.130
where they're from,
no matter their age,

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.340
they can relate to some
part of that story.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.467
And I think that's why
it's had such longevity.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:40.300
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.758
TSHIDI MANYE: And
I guess to add on

00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:44.590
that is, you know, "Lion King"
is not one of your stories,

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:50.200
like you know, "Cinderella"
and all of that.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.930
This is a story about the life
that you live in, the sadness.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.350
We've all gone through sadness,
we've all gone through--

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.800
at times we've gone through
betrayal in our lives.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.810
And there's love
into the story, too.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:07.450
So it's the life that we all
are living in everyday life.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.040
CHRIS JACKSON: Are
there any examples

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.220
of the sadness, or the
joy in which the show now

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.060
speaks to you?

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.601
Have you guys
experienced that either

00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:20.020
in performing the show,
or just the parallels

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.790
that you found in life?

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.580
MICHAEL HENRY: I lost my sister
to a bone cancer last year.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.330
And the first
performance back going

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:33.040
into the show, when
Mufasa's singing to his son,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.430
and he's talking to his
son about how one day he's

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.090
going to die.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.240
But if you look into
the stars, you'll

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.720
be able to see not
only me, but you

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.560
will be able to see
everyone who has

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.810
come before me-- my parents,
their parents before them.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.260
So I thought I was
going to be OK,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.990
and I just was breaking
down while singing the song.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.250
But then when it came around
again to do the reprieves,

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.910
"They Live in You,"
or "He Lives in You,"

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:07.570
sorry, I saw this
light come out.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.414
And I just looked at it,
and started to spread.

00:14:10.414 --> 00:14:12.580
I was like, that's my sister
right there, telling me

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.413
it's going to be OK.

00:14:13.413 --> 00:14:17.260
She's with me, and she's
always going to be with me.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.840
And she's in me right now.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.020
And from that moment on, I
think I understood the show

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.880
on a deeper level.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.800
Just it's a beautiful show.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.910
But once you experience loss, it
speaks to you on another level.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.930
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.170
LINDIWE DLAMINI: For me I think
I have the similar situation

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.000
like Michael.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.450
I've already lost three
members of my family

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.010
while I'm in the
show for 20 years.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.500
And being part of
this family, you

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.350
have people who support you when
you're going through something.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.720
I remember we were
at half hour call

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.702
just before we go on stage,
and the stage manager

00:14:55.702 --> 00:14:57.160
came in the dressing
room while I'm

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.830
putting on makeup, ready to go.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.160
And then they told me the news
that my father has passed right

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.850
before I go on stage.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.510
And I remember that day
I was really doubting,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.520
I was just torn apart.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.860
And I know my father was
very supportive of me

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.750
as a young girl
from South Africa.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.900
He let us leave South Africa
at the age of 18 years

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.270
old to come to the States
to pursue our career.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.440
So I know that if I
don't perform that day,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.020
I just wanted to
feel his presence.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.890
And I know that when I
go on, he will be happy.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:34.420
If I didn't go on, that's
not what he wanted me to do.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.210
So I went on on
stage that day, and I

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.650
remember doing-- it
was hard to do eulogy.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.785
There's a eulogy scene when--

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:44.090
you know, Mufasa's death.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.480
And then it was hard,
but I kept going.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.840
And then we came on started
singing "He Lives in You."

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.960
And at that moment,
you know, I just--

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.440
I remember just looking at the
audience and I saw a vision.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.310
I saw somebody sitting
in the audience.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.400
And I kept blinking because I
was thinking, that's my dad.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.590
You know, immediately
I connected with that.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.510
And then as soon
as we do reprise,

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.740
I had so much joy because that
number in the show uplifts

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.800
people, you're
dancing, you're happy.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.930
You're letting the
audience know that

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.200
no matter what happens to
you, it's going to be OK.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.860
You know, it's a circle
of life, you know?

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.500
We all move on, and
people are born.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.600
I experienced the
birth of my daughter

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.160
while I was in the show.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.080
So for me, it's been both
happy times and sad times.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.390
But because "Lion King" is a
circle of life, it keeps you--

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.810
I know a lot of
people experience

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.940
that in the audience in
other similar situations.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.450
CHRIS JACKSON: I had a--

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:50.800
I think remembering, we
were performing in 2001 when

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.470
September 11th happened, and we
were off, I think, for a couple

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.610
of days.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.870
All of Broadway shut down.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:01.380
And then we opened back
up, and up until the time

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.150
at the New Amsterdam theater,
there was never an empty seat.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.050
Never ever.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.329
There were people waiting
outside in case somebody had

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.089
to go home in the middle of
the show to get in the theater.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.880
And that first show
back after 9/11,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.609
and there were maybe 1,000
people in the audience,

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.880
and the orchestra
not full whatsoever.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.300
Playing Simba and having
to sing "Endless Night,"

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.890
where has the starlight gone?

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.240
Dark is the day.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.630
And then seeing the conductor
try to hold it together

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.620
and losing, and me try
to hold it together.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.560
By the time you get
through that song,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.370
I know that the night must end,
I know that the sun will rise.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:41.692
Any time art, I find, gives you
an immediate sort of context

00:17:41.692 --> 00:17:43.900
by which you can process
all of it-- doesn't heal it,

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.040
doesn't fix it, but it creates
a means by which you can just go

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.260
through the experiencing
of all of that,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.460
it's so cathartic and it's so--

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.090
it can be uplifting.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.550
At the very least it
can be comforting you

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.350
while you process
through these things.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:04.290
MDU MADELA: And on top of
that, we have had a few--

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.520
you know, it shows an
educational element

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.000
of the show, a few parents
bringing in their kids.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.640
I think it must be
the first time there's

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.840
a medium of educating
a kid about loss,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.954
about something will
happen later on.

00:18:19.954 --> 00:18:21.370
Whether it doesn't
happen now, you

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.828
remember when
granddad passed away,

00:18:22.828 --> 00:18:24.190
this is what had happened.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.940
So it becomes a huge
educational element also.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.300
BONGI DUMA: And there's also--

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.950
as you know, South
Africa plays a big part

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.290
in "The Lion King" because
of the music and culture.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:40.430
For some of us,
our generation, we

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.940
were not able to
express ourselves

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.980
through art during Apartheid.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.395
So we started acting and singing
in small churches, and schools,

00:18:49.395 --> 00:18:50.020
and everything.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.940
That as far as we could go.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.370
And for us, some of
us were motivated

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.610
to use the tools
of theater, music,

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.960
to fight in the struggle.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.400
And in "The Lion King," I'll
always find a similar situation

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.360
whereby Nala has to
run away to regroup

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.350
to fight against the hyenas
when they've taken the kingdom,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.890
and eventually find Simba
and come back with Simba,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.600
and rally the troops, and
fight, and eventually reclaim

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.960
the kingdom from the hyenas.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.520
And to me it's always
been a signature

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.310
that South Africa
in 1994, we voted

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.850
for the first black
president, Nelson Mandela.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.390
And that always bring-- because
we left South Africa when

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.860
things were still really harsh.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.910
And I remember when they
left, we were really young,

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.300
we thought we were never
going to see them again.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.920
You know, we come right after.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.756
And when I left South
Africa, when you come back,

00:19:47.756 --> 00:19:49.630
you still had to go
through a lot of grilling

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.990
as to where have you been,
who did you speak to,

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.750
what did you do?

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.400
And that, to me, is always
a reminder to myself

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.836
that through all of
that, the country today

00:19:59.836 --> 00:20:00.710
is in a better state.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.900
So it does relate to what
everyone is going through.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.320
And given the state of
the different democracies

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.300
in the world, you eventually
come in a full circle

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.190
into how things
are supposed to be.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.650
That's the story.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:21.060
CHRIS JACKSON: I think
that's a wonderful segue.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.179
At this time, it's time
for another number, y'all.

00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:24.970
You ready for that?

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.205
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:27.205 --> 00:20:32.350
Can we welcome Joel Karie
and Adrienne Walker, Simba

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.068
and Nala, singing "Can You
Feel the Love Tonight."

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.984
[MUSIC - "CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE
 TONIGHT"]

00:23:08.146 --> 00:23:10.641
CHRIS JACKSON: Y'all so good.

00:23:10.641 --> 00:23:13.160
Wasn't that good?

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.680
Nearly 300 South
African performers

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.530
have worked on "The Lion
King" around the world

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.120
for the past 20 years.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.870
We're lucky to have
four of them today.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.150
I'd love to hear from all
of you about the impact--

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.140
the South African performers--

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.750
in South African
culture on the show.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.960
And especially the four of
our South African brothers

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.270
and sisters, what your
experiences with the show

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.100
have been like.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.480
LINDIWE DLAMINI: For
me, being able to sing

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.300
South African music in these
audiences all over the world,

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.870
and it brings all these
beautiful harmonies that we

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.970
known for as South Africans.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:55.210
We are known for singing
beautiful harmonies.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.620
So "The Lion King" brings
that to these audiences

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.670
all over the world.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.450
And the fact that now
they have employed

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.510
so many thousands,
thousands of young people

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:11.200
from South Africa who
have never gotten a chance

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.440
to go to an international
stage and perform.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.170
So that's what "Lion King"
brings for my people.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.150
CHRIS JACKSON: Now, did
you also participate

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.740
in the "Sarafina" production?

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.830
LINDIWE DLAMINI: Yes.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.950
When I first came
in this country,

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.120
I was in the show called
"Sarafina" during apartheid,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.140
which was different.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.570
Because that show was
more about the struggle,

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.460
it was just a heavy show.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.300
It was sad, you know, we were
just fighting for our freedom.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.730
So we were more like the
ambassadors of South Africa

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.880
to come here and tell the
world what was going on.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.010
And now I enjoy being
in "The Lion King"

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.400
because the music is exciting,
it's uplifting people,

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.350
it's happy music.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.350
So for me, those are two
different experiences,

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.010
and I enjoyed being here and
be able to just experience

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.704
this with everybody.

00:24:59.704 --> 00:25:01.120
TSHIDI MANYE: One
other thing that

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.270
makes me laugh all the time is
that when the audience comes in

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.270
and they ask you a question like
well is what you're singing,

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.050
is it real?

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.880
Is it a real language?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.780
That clicking thing, you
always do a great lip syncing.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.995
No, it's a real language.

00:25:16.995 --> 00:25:18.245
MICHAEL HENRY: Do it for them.

00:25:18.245 --> 00:25:18.870
Do it for them.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.066
CHRIS JACKSON: I think you
have to do a little bit.

00:25:21.066 --> 00:25:22.900
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:30.115 --> 00:25:32.240
JOEL KARIE: Don't clap,
that's her actual language.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.841
That's just her talking,
it's not that impressive.

00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:37.049
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:37.049 --> 00:25:39.090
CHRIS JACKSON: She just
gave you her grocery list

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:40.042
and that's all.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.210
BONGI DUMA: I mean, on
the other side of it,

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.780
I think it is important--

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.880
I always highlight this.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.500
Because for most of us--

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.480
I mean, I think the
four of us here--

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.040
none of us have actually went
to a music school, or a theater,

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:58.580
or anything.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.500
We've never went
to school for that.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.030
I said LA was a tool for us
to fight against the struggle.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.570
And for most of the
singers, and actors,

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.360
and dancers, South Africa,
singing and dancing

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.470
is not really a job.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.650
It is a hobby.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.500
Half the country
knows how to sing.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.050
So when you go up
on stage, it's not

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.440
like they want to
be entertained.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.398
They want to judge you.

00:26:23.398 --> 00:26:25.220
Because at least
someone there is

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.960
waiting to tell you that, oh,
I can do that better than you.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.050
And if you say, can you?

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.230
They say, try me.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.970
And they will literally
come up and prove that.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:37.460
It is a beauty that we have that
we grow up hearing this music,

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.300
because there are songs
culturally for everything that

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.490
are written by random people.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.280
I mean, they are
mostly public domain

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.572
so we grew up hearing
these harmonies whenever

00:26:48.572 --> 00:26:49.280
there's anything.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.650
That's why sometimes
it's a little offensive,

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.940
but it is reality whenever we
see African kids on television,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.870
they're dancing, and
happy, and singing.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.534
It is how we grow up.

00:26:58.534 --> 00:26:59.450
That's how we grew up.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.120
If you take it out of the
political context and just

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.820
look at it, and if you go to
Africa, the first thing you see

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.180
will be children following
and chasing after the car

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.940
seeing a person and
singing and dancing.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.650
And if you ask why
they're dancing,

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:15.110
sometimes there's no
explanation, it's just joy.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:20.080
So most of us, this is amazing
that you calling me-- you

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.560
putting me on a plane
and you telling me

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.150
that you're going to pay
me for singing and dancing.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.670
So I mean, it's amazing.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.640
And all these 300 people,
it's amazing to us

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.660
that from the side
of art perspective

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.280
that we have been
able to get jobs

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.560
that we will not
get in South Africa.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.350
Just because they can just
grab anybody and just put them

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.650
in something, you know.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.670
So it's very special to us,
and we'll always appreciate it.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.570
And I have to highlight that.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.680
When "Lion King"
started, South Africans

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.840
were supposed to be
only for six months

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.460
and go, and leave the country.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.030
And Julie Taymor together
with Tom Schumacher and that

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.275
cast of--

00:28:02.275 --> 00:28:05.300
the American cast, actors
and dancers, they fought.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.460
They say, if these people
leave, we are not doing this.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.790
And that's how we got to stay
as South Africans in the show,

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.790
people like him and the rest
of the original cast members

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.310
fought to make sure that
we remain in the show.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.680
And that we are
forever grateful to you

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.368
guys and everybody else
who come and see the show.

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:26.176
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:29.798 --> 00:28:32.048
CHRIS JACKSON: You can cut
me a check when we're done.

00:28:32.048 --> 00:28:34.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.150
Joking.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:36.830
Not really.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:45.410
A lot of talk about diversity
in casting, obviously.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.210
With shows like
"Hamilton," that certainly

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.870
is one of the first
things that comes to mind,

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.700
because the founding
fathers weren't black.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.710
But what you just
alluded to, people

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.760
don't realize that The "Lion
King" was at the forefront

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.780
when it comes to diverse
casting on Broadway.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.760
One of the things
that comes to mind

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.700
is when I graduated
from college in '95,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.340
there were only two
shows that I could

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.250
have been cast in on Broadway.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.690
And one of them was would
have been because my face,

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.222
I could have been
painted in "Cats,"

00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:26.930
but nobody was trying
to dance like that.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.000
And then "Showboat"
was the other show.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.650
And they weren't trying to
cast me as no riverboat slave,

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.290
because I was too light.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.510
Then "Lion King" comes along.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.210
And it's the longest
running black show--

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.860
predominantly
African-American show--

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.840
in the history of Broadway.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.180
I know that because
of the Disney name

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.260
it's not commonly-- it's
not assumed that that is

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.750
a characterization of the show.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.950
But not only is it predominantly
African-American and South

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.100
African, I've always
found that the show

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.480
serves as a beacon of light for
young performers of color who

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.970
are coming out of
these amazing programs

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.930
and don't really have a show
that they can look to and say,

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.480
I'm going to be on Broadway,
I want to be in that show.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.880
That's a place for me.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.950
And I think that
Broadway's gone a long way

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:27.000
to start the
process of including

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.594
more and more actors of color.

00:30:28.594 --> 00:30:30.510
JOEL KARIE: It's actually
very interesting you

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.310
say that because I'm actually
on the Chris Jackson track.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:37.320
So 20 years later, I do his job
that he did when he first came.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.403
CHRIS JACKSON: Oh, really?

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:41.820
JOEL KARIE: Yeah,
exactly, I'm your track.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.780
And it is the same thing.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:50.880
I was just slightly behind Chris
in age when it came to casting.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.560
But at least I did
have "The Lion King"

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.340
because there was that.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.714
When I was in
school when I first

00:30:54.714 --> 00:30:57.347
started undergraduate
and learning theater,

00:30:57.347 --> 00:30:59.430
people didn't quite know
where to place me either.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.340
Because you'd go into a casting,
and they would always say,

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.290
can you be a bit more urban?

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:05.710
Like that's always like--

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.780
there's certain-- or,
we want to do it again,

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.210
but a little more street.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.440
You know what I mean?

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.870
So there wasn't a
lot of diversity

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.020
even within the type of roles
you could be considered for.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.367
And then "Lion King" came
along and changed that

00:31:18.367 --> 00:31:19.200
for a lot of people.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.210
And you can see
the ripple effects

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.710
almost immediately if you
just look at years following

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:26.670
on Broadway casting.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.370
All of a sudden you're getting
called in for different types

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:29.880
of roles.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.754
And all of a sudden you
were being considered

00:31:31.754 --> 00:31:35.730
for a whole array of
characters that you weren't

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.140
seen just the year before.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.800
It was incredible.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.850
CHRIS JACKSON: I think that
the future will bear this out.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:46.100
But a young Lin
Miranda saw me as Simba

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.080
two years before he
graduated college.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.420
I have to believe that
every time a young--

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.600
especially a young artist,
or a young producer,

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.100
or a young casting director--
someone who hasn't established

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.030
themselves yet--

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.610
comes to see a show and
has a moving experience,

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:03.750
it expands their horizon
of possibilities.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.450
So that when they do get into
the place of their career--

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.180
place of influence,
their place of employment

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.780
in a company such as this, it
broadens their perspective.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.380
And it gives everyone
just a more realistic view

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.940
of what the world looks like.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:23.350
I think that's obviously
art at its best, right?

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.899
I want to get to the funny stuff
that happens behind the scenes.

00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:29.690
Because everybody always
wants to know what

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:35.525
happens when a giraffe falls
going across the savanna.

00:32:35.525 --> 00:32:37.650
MICHAEL HENRY: I have a
funny story about that one.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.400
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah,
please, share, share.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.070
Yes, please.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.960
MICHAEL HENRY: So we have two
dancers who portrayed giraffes.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.250
And in order to get dressed in
them, they are put on a ladder

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.809
and stilts are put on
their arms and their legs.

00:32:51.809 --> 00:32:53.600
CHRIS JACKSON: And
they're attached, right?

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.290
MICHAEL HENRY: And
they're attached,

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.180
like you can't get out of them.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.990
So they're in the last
number, all the way

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.750
through the last number,
and in the bows as well.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:07.700
So I guess this one guy was
feeling a bit extra that day.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.382
And he started rearing up,
and he went back and fell

00:33:11.382 --> 00:33:13.244
on his flailing back like this.

00:33:13.244 --> 00:33:15.410
And there's nothing you can
do, so the stage manager

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.550
comes on, grabs him, pulls him
offstage, curtain comes down.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.120
CHRIS JACKSON: Any
other things come

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.121
to mind that might
be good for a giggle?

00:33:25.121 --> 00:33:25.620
Number

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.661
LINDIWE DLAMINI: I remember,
because usually they

00:33:27.661 --> 00:33:30.470
track the giraffes and
whatever that fell on stage.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.350
One day I fell on stage.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.730
And then what happened is
when we sing one by one,

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:42.189
you know, the second act, these
costumes are so long, so long.

00:33:42.189 --> 00:33:44.480
Like you had to lift them up
when you go off the stage.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.340
For some reason that day I
was into myself, and just

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.940
happy, and excited,
walking up the stairs.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.790
And then I tripped
on the costume.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.820
And I'm the last
person to go on stage.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.370
And that moment I
fall on the stage.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.030
And this costume
is under my legs.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:02.040
And I'm trying to
get up, I'm trying--

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.930
and it's the silk.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.374
So I'm trying to get up, I'm
looking at-- he's my husband,

00:34:07.374 --> 00:34:08.540
and he was singing on stage.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.880
I'm looking so he can get me.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.100
But he's like-- so
he was like, no, I'm

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.281
singing my solo right now.

00:34:14.281 --> 00:34:16.927
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:16.927 --> 00:34:19.330
So I'm looking, I'm like
looking around, I'm like,

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:23.210
oh my God, I can't get
this costume off my feet.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.889
So I'm wrapped around
and I see the stage man,

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.770
[INAUDIBLE] I'm
like, I can't leave.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.920
So finally I get off the
stage, we got downstairs

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.510
in the bunker, everybody,
you could hear a pin drop.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.964
Everybody didn't know, they
wanted to laugh so hard at me,

00:34:36.964 --> 00:34:38.380
but everybody's
looking if I'm OK.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.830
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah, they
did the check, is she hurt?

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.850
If she's hurt it's not funny.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.659
LINDIWE DLAMINI: When
I started laughing,

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.250
everybody started laughing.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:50.000
And they said I look like
the commercial, I'm falling,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.949
I can't get up.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.040
But I was OK, I was OK.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.540
But I never fell again.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.040
CHRIS JACKSON: Oh,
that's fantastic.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.350
OK, I think at this point
we're going to open up

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.180
the floor for some questions.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.140
Do any of you guys
have any questions

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.500
for this wonderful cast?

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.600
Y'all know everything.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.610
Y'all are full from
eating too much at lunch.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:16.470
Hi.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.180
Please give us your name
and ask your question.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.540
JESS: Hi, I'm Jess.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.120
Thank you so much for coming,
this has been amazing.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.890
So I work on our
people operations team,

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.530
which is what we call
HR, human resources.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.990
And we spend a lot
of time thinking

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.210
about how we build
really effective teams,

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.890
and how we make people
feel included and welcome,

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.270
especially when their
new to an organization.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.980
Are there any norms
or things that you

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.660
do when you have
new cast members

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.470
come in to try and create,
like, a cohesive team?

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.460
BONGI DUMA: I don't
know, but maybe this

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.860
will work for your team.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.480
I'm going to share
this with you.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.300
So in my dressing room,
so my dressing room

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.380
is split into two.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.710
It's singers on the
other side, and there's

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:02.530
dancers on the other side.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.440
So right off when you
go up in this board

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.400
that's in there is the
heels with different sizes

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.260
of high heel shoes.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.194
JOEL KARIE: The men.

00:36:11.194 --> 00:36:13.110
BONGI DUMA: The men, the
men, high heel shoes.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.170
So what happens that
when you're new,

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.950
we make you believe that
everyone who's in the room

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.330
has actually put
on these high heels

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.080
and actually walk all
around the dressing room.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.760
So what happened is that
this is just a way of--

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.320
we want to see if you are brave
enough to embarrass yourself

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.940
or to entertain us.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.720
Because that way we've
got some [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.730
So we all-- usually
when half hour comes,

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.380
everybody goes and warm up.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.810
And maybe there's
two or three people.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.640
When you're coming
in here a new person,

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.340
we wait for the stage manager
to bring you to introduce you,

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.290
and we ask ask them to leave.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.345
And then we put
the pop music on,

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:57.300
we let you try the
high heels, and then

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.840
you've got to walk around
the room just in pumps,

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.856
just you have to go up.

00:37:03.856 --> 00:37:05.415
And if you're a
little tight, we've

00:37:05.415 --> 00:37:07.540
got a couple of guys that
already in the high heels

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:10.692
to show you what
you're supposed to do.

00:37:10.692 --> 00:37:13.550
So I mean, I think you
might just try that.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:17.530
I mean, might
work, I don't know.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:21.275
JESS: I'll raise this
with our executives.

00:37:21.275 --> 00:37:23.430
CHRIS JACKSON: That's a
good team builder, right?

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.680
AUDIENCE: One of the things
that I love about the show

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.800
so much is that
along with, I think,

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.290
only Paul Simon's
"Graceland," it's

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.650
the best example of putting
South African music in front

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.100
of a mainstream audience.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.490
And I know for the South
African performance,

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.114
that's just kind of
what you mentioned,

00:37:39.114 --> 00:37:40.410
it's just another day.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.800
But for the non Africans, was
there any adjusting period

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.579
getting used to those
funky harmonies, maybe

00:37:46.579 --> 00:37:48.870
some other stuff that you
weren't really familiar with?

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.630
BONGI DUMA: They asked us--

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.350
oh, non-South Africans.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.724
CHRIS JACKSON:
Pick one, you have

00:37:57.724 --> 00:38:00.362
to be either South African
or non-South African, OK?

00:38:00.362 --> 00:38:02.050
MICHAEL HENRY: I'll start.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.654
When I started--

00:38:03.654 --> 00:38:04.570
I started a while ago.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:05.944
I've been in
different companies.

00:38:05.944 --> 00:38:08.260
I started, I think, in 2003.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.780
They had this thing where
they were doing master classes

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.040
before you got cast.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.200
So you would come in
for like six weeks,

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.647
I think, and they
would teach you

00:38:16.647 --> 00:38:18.730
a little bit of the language,
they would teach you

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.840
some of the songs.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.754
So by the time I
got into the show,

00:38:22.754 --> 00:38:24.420
I think I learned the
show in two weeks.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.340
So it was a bit easier for me.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.350
I don't know what the
process is for you guys.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:32.080
CHRIS JACKSON: I understood the
harmonic structure of it all,

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.040
but marrying that
with the language

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.470
was extremely taxing vocally.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.540
And I went home
after the third day--

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.970
of course, we were singing
for about four hours

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.642
in the morning, and then we
were moving in the afternoon.

00:38:45.642 --> 00:38:48.100
Everybody there had already
had a master class of some sort

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.180
or had done the workshop.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.580
I had never even heard--

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.400
I'd seen the movie, but I
hadn't sung any of it, you know.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.710
So there are certain
African-American vocal

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.690
traditions in the
church that you

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.960
will find a lot of the same
harmonic structures there.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.080
But linguistically
speaking, my chords

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.350
were bleeding by the time the
second or third day was there.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.610
And I had--

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.690
I was fresh.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:17.170
But I just didn't know
how to pace myself

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.977
inside that kind of music.

00:39:18.977 --> 00:39:19.810
And it took a while.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:24.340
But once I got into it,
I remember it so vividly.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:29.120
But once I got into it, it
started to flow a lot easier.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.760
Any more questions?

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.260
Hi.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.218
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you
so much for being here.

00:39:33.218 --> 00:39:34.460
I am the biggest fan--

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.206
OK, maybe not the biggest.

00:39:36.206 --> 00:39:37.687
But I am a huge fan.

00:39:37.687 --> 00:39:39.020
I have a five-year-old daughter.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.436
The minute she
turned three, I had

00:39:40.436 --> 00:39:41.910
to have her watch
"The Lion King."

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:46.080
Because it's such a great story
and still resonates so much.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.780
So I guess my
question is, we are

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.750
in jobs where we
are not facing so

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.970
many people on a daily basis.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.430
And you know, there are days
when I don't like what I do,

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.020
and it's OK.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.060
You have to be on
stage and you have

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.870
to entertain regardless
of how you feel.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.560
So what do you do when
you're not in the mood?

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.662
What are those tricks?

00:40:04.662 --> 00:40:05.870
CHRIS JACKSON: Good question.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:09.046
MDU MADELA: I couldn't wait
to answer that question.

00:40:09.046 --> 00:40:11.330
The thing is, this
is the motivation.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.820
You look at faces
while you-- we are

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.820
fortunate that we have
a show where everything

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.100
doesn't start backstage.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.340
The show starts, half of the
people who are in the cast,

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.690
they start within the audience.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.950
So the moment you enter,
you already feel the vibe.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:32.120
There's no way in me that I
would say I'm tired today,

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.980
I cannot do it.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.800
It just takes you looking
at two or three people

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.910
within the audience
and that's it.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.580
That's it.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.121
NTELISENG NHKELA:
And yes, of course,

00:40:41.121 --> 00:40:45.140
sometimes you come to work
and just like normal people,

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.110
you tired, and you don't
feel like doing it.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:52.520
But what motivates you more like
we open the show walking down

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.570
the aisle.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:56.450
And you see those faces
happy and some of them

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.020
crying because of
just happiness,

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.610
I'm seeing all the animals.

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:02.660
It motivates you to
just want to do this

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.792
more and more with a good
spirit and happiness.

00:41:05.792 --> 00:41:07.250
TSHIDI MANYE: The
other funny thing

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.930
is, I know that a
lot of people when

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:12.770
they come to see this show, they
think that it's a kid's show.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.380
But it's one thing when you
come, the curtain goes up

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.960
and you start singing,
and you're seeing dads

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.920
being the one crying.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.836
And like, oh my God,
look at the-- oh, my God,

00:41:20.836 --> 00:41:22.340
just like little kids.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.160
It motivates you,
you know, makes

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.090
us think that you're
doing something great.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.760
MICHAEL HENRY: I'd say
also our other actors.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.520
We have a lot of
different social cues

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.290
that we'll do with each other
backstage basically every day.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.160
It's like, if I don't do that
social cue with an actor,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.710
they'll be so angry with me.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:46.250
So you know, the other actors
will definitely lift you up

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.020
if you're not feeling it.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:48.770
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.002
I'm definitely one of those
people who's like, yay, look!

00:41:52.002 --> 00:41:52.826
Thank you.

00:41:52.826 --> 00:41:54.830
CHRIS JACKSON: I think
that theater in general

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.740
provides a framework
by which when

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:02.090
you take the discipline that
you develop during a show,

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:03.920
you fall into a
rhythm with that.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.080
And there's comfort
in that rhythm.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.429
And you can know what to expect.

00:42:09.429 --> 00:42:10.970
So that when you
have a cold, or when

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.760
you have a pulled hamstring,
or it's just like a baseball

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.470
player taking swings
in the cage, like,

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.386
there's just something
about the routine of it

00:42:17.386 --> 00:42:20.850
all that puts you in the
place that you need to do it.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:23.900
And because we're
expressing ourselves,

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.900
there's also a great
release, a great catharsis

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.290
that happens by just going
through and allowing yourself

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.560
to feel what you're
feeling, and tell the story,

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.650
and be as dedicated
to it as you can.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.606
We have time for
one more question.

00:42:38.606 --> 00:42:41.022
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm actually
visiting from the San Francisco

00:42:41.022 --> 00:42:42.270
Bay Area, and I'm here today.

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.200
So I like got in at
6:00 this morning.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.710
CHRIS JACKSON: This
is all for you.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.982
My question is, so when I
was younger I was actually--

00:42:50.982 --> 00:42:52.190
I wanted to be like you guys.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:55.020
I wanted to be on
Broadway, but now I'm here.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.880
So my question
is, what would you

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.100
tell a young aspiring
actor, especially

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.959
like an actor of color, what
would you tell them to never

00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:05.750
give up on their dreams
if they were trying

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:06.999
to pursue this type of career?

00:43:10.604 --> 00:43:12.270
JOEL KARIE: I always
say to young people

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.330
when I work with them
that everything you learn

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.780
is important.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.469
I am the opposite of you.

00:43:18.469 --> 00:43:20.010
I went to school
for computer science

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.855
originally and
switched to theater.

00:43:22.855 --> 00:43:24.730
Because they didn't take
back my scholarship.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:26.990
CHRIS JACKSON: That's
just too meta, I can't.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.760
JOEL KARIE: So
like that's spooky.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.182
But also, as a
young person I had

00:43:33.182 --> 00:43:35.640
immigrant parents who they're
like, you will do everything.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.410
You play instruments,
you will speak languages,

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.034
you will do all these
different things.

00:43:39.034 --> 00:43:42.360
Because we're in America
and we're going to do well!

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.810
So all those classes and things
that I took, I never really

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.010
thought would be important.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.385
But the great
thing about theater

00:43:48.385 --> 00:43:51.120
is it's so collaborative.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.480
It's only a matter of time
before a show comes along

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.620
that is going to need
your expertise in coding,

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.710
or in playing the saxophone.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.332
I mean, when "Lion
King" started,

00:44:04.332 --> 00:44:05.790
we didn't think
that there would be

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:11.160
a hugely successful rap-based
musical about the founding

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.335
of this nation.

00:44:12.335 --> 00:44:13.210
You know what I mean?

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:14.779
Like it's only a matter of time.

00:44:14.779 --> 00:44:16.320
So you have to be
when you're young--

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.319
or when you're not--
throughout your whole life,

00:44:18.319 --> 00:44:21.090
you have to be a sponge and
constantly absorb and take

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:24.180
every opportunity it has given
to you to grow and to learn.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.700
Because it will be applicable
to art at some point.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.200
Because that's what
makes art great.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.700
That's what keeps it changing.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.220
CHRIS JACKSON: Broadway is the
pinnacle of commerce and art

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.120
sort of crashing
into one another.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.540
So it's a very specific thing.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.260
I tell anyone, no matter what
line of work that you're in,

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.920
pursue your passion.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.264
So if performing is something
that you care about,

00:44:46.264 --> 00:44:48.680
and that's something that you
just wake up in the morning,

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.670
(SINGING) I got to do this,
go to work, pay your bills,

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:55.550
but there are lots of
places to be an artist.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:58.100
There's lots of different
ways to do that.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.790
There are lots of communities
that completely welcome that.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.590
And I know especially
in the Bay Area,

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:05.240
there's 100 theaters out there.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.257
Get your life, man.

00:45:07.257 --> 00:45:08.090
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:19.646
CHRIS JACKSON: So Guys,
It's time for another song.

00:45:19.646 --> 00:45:22.180
As we kind of, just like in
the show, kind of wrap it up,

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.249
we're going to do a little
"Circle of Life," I think.

00:45:25.249 --> 00:45:27.540
What do y'all think, y'all
ready to do a little "Circle

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:27.970
of Life?"

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:28.800
Think we could do that.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.800
Can we just give it up
another round of applause

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.058
for our amazing panelists?

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.044
[MUSIC - "CIRCLE OF LIFE"]

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:11.670
Give it up for the cast
of "The Lion King," also

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.180
for our amazing band,
Dave [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:19.985
on bass, Matt "Lefty" Black
on guitar, Gary [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:19.985 --> 00:47:23.520
on drums, and on piano,
music director and arranger

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.940
Jim Abbot.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.490
Ladies and gentlemen,
"The Lion King."
