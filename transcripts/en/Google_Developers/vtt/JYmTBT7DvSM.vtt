00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.542
JESSICA DENE
EARLEY-CHA: Giving users

00:00:01.542 --> 00:00:04.390
a personalized experience is key
to building successful actions.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.015
A simple thing, like
getting permission

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.860
to use your user's name and
email, can be a game changer.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.360
With those data
points, you can keep

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.520
track of that particular
user's preferences

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.070
and provide them with a richer
and more customized experience.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.448
For example, you could save
your user's food preferences

00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:19.990
when they've signed
into your actions

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.630
so you could provide better
recommendations in the future.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.030
A frictionless way to do
this is through what's

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.040
called account linking
with Google Sign

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.555
In for the Assistant.

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:30.625
Actions on Google offers
three different account

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:31.570
linking types--

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.892
Google Sign In, OAuth only,
or OAuth and Google Sign In.

00:00:36.892 --> 00:00:39.100
Let's explore the different
scenarios for each option

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.670
and how to implement them.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.570
For the Google Sign In, your
user's ID is managed by Google,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.120
so you don't need to
build an account system

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.620
or worry about OAuth.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.392
This type of account linking is
great for standalone actions,

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:51.850
and if you are
already using Google

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.830
Sign In for mobile or web.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.510
Google Sign In for
Assistant is just

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.910
like Google Sign In
for any other platform.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.770
As the user is engaging
with your action,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.525
you tell Google
when to ask a user

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:03.400
if they want to share
their basic information

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.540
with your action.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.920
If the user agrees to
share their information,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.470
the assistant will
send an ID token

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.310
with each following request.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.950
The ID token is
cryptographically

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.910
signed by Google.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.000
You'll need to code it
using a JWT decoding library

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.260
and Google's public key.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.780
You verify it by checking
the token's issuer is

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.640
the value of your client ID.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.220
Then, you use the JSON
that contains a user's name

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.192
and email address.

00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:26.650
If you're using
our client library,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.030
we handle this for you--

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.795
pretty sweet.

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:31.420
If the user does not consent to
share their profile information

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.060
with your action, you should
still provide the best service

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.543
that you can without associating
an identity with the user.

00:01:37.543 --> 00:01:38.960
The second account
linking type is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.820
OAuth, which supports two
industry standards OAuth

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.760
two flows--

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.143
the Implicit and
Authorization Code Flows.

00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:47.560
You might want to consider
using a [INAUDIBLE] if you have

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.752
an existing implementation
of an OAuth server,

00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:52.210
and you cannot extend the end
points to support Google Sign

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.500
In protocols.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.380
We do discourage using OAuth
only for conversational actions

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.410
because it requires transferring
the user from voice to screen,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.360
which increases user's friction.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.280
The last account linking
type is a combination

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.140
of OAuth and Google Sign In.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.120
Imagine you have an
existing application

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.880
and you allow signups using
multiple identity providers,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.870
not just Google.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.500
You may have existing user data
if, for example, your users

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.637
already have a loyalty card or
membership with your service.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.720
You want to allow users
to engage with your action

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.803
and connect their Google
account with your already

00:02:21.803 --> 00:02:24.700
existing account that uses a
non-Google identity provider

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.018
account in your system.

00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:27.810
To allow for this,
you'll want to implement

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.290
OAuth and Google Sign In.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.525
This combines Google Sign
In with the standard OAuth

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:33.310
flow used as a fallback.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.810
So during that
account linking flow,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.280
you tell Google to
prompt the user.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.530
Ask them if they want to
share their basic information

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.700
with your action.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.440
If their Gmail email
isn't in your database,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.100
you'll provide one of
two options to the user.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.400
The first option is to support
account creation via voice,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.380
which immediately creates
a new account using

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.260
the data contained in
the Google ID token.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.830
The second option is disallowing
account creation via voice.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.570
If you choose this
option, the Assistant

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.590
sends the user to your
web log in on their phone.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.520
So you could use your
authentication system

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.242
to log them in with
a different account.

00:03:06.242 --> 00:03:08.200
You'll want to use the
first option, supporting

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.090
account creation
via voice, if you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.270
want to minimize friction of
the account creation flow.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.520
You want to use a second
option, disallowing

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.170
account creation
via voice, if you

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.540
need full control of the
account creation flow,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.330
or if you want to maximize the
chances that the user will link

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.220
to their existing account
instead of creating

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.690
a new duplicate account.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.820
Connecting their account
to a non-Google account

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.320
is important in
cases where you want

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.110
to provide different
experience options

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.860
or if you're logging
their activities that

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.330
would affect the user later.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.950
As mentioned before,
this is helpful

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.570
if you have a loyalty program.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.490
For example, you
want to keep track

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.920
of any points they earned
during their experience

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.555
using your action when
there are existing accounts.

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:45.943
The OAuth and
Google Sign In flow

00:03:45.943 --> 00:03:47.860
gives you the highest
thinking conversion rate

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.998
because your Google users get a
streamlined linking experience

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:52.540
while other users
that are registered

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.540
using another account type
can still link their account

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.038
and sign into your service.

00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:59.080
These are the different
ways to implement account

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.140
linking so you can
create fantastic actions.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.510

more about account linking?

00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:11.753
with everyone.

linking in your actions.
