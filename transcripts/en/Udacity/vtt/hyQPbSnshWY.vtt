Before I talk more about cloud
computing, I'd like to illustrate

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.090
the opportunities that it delivers
with an example based on Animoto.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.300
This is an example service.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.829
And this was a poster child of cloud
computing in early years, around 2008,

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:16.780
2009.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.520
This example that I'll describe next is
repeatedly referenced in cloud computing

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.220
talks, again, especially in
those early introductory years.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.132
In the mid 2000's, Amazon was already
a dominant online retailer servicing

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:33.480
large volumes of online
sales transactions.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.490
Vast majority of these transactions
were taking place during the US

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.130
holiday shopping season between
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.030
And to deal with this peak load, Amazon
provisioned the hardware resources, so

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.810
made sure that they've acquired
sufficient number of servers for

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.260
this particular load.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.750
What that means is that the rest of the
year a lot of these resources were idle.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.330
Or they were serviced for other company
tasks, for instance, forecasting or

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.430
other analytics.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.379
But regardless,
there were still a lot of idle cycles.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.820
Now, since Amazon had already
developed some software infrastructure

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.690
to allow these machines
to be reprovisioned and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.890
used by other services
within the company.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.390
What they ended up doing in 2006,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.580
they opened up those exact same type
of API's to the rest of the world.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.700
What this did,
it allowed third party work load.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.440
So not just Amazon work loads,
but completely random customers

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.700
to run their workloads on Amazon's
hardware, obviously, for a fee.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.480
This was the birth of
Amazon's Web Services, or AWS, and

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.690
Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.800
One of the companies that appeared
around the same time as Amazon's EC2

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.830
cloud was Animoto.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.630
Some of you may have used the service.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.470
It turns an album of
pictures into a video.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.331
And although this sounds simple,
it's a fairly compute intensive job

00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:02.904
that involves a lot of
image processing steps so

00:02:02.904 --> 00:02:06.000
that the video appears
as smooth as possible.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.610
So they decided to focus their resources

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.580
on the development of the mechanisms
that make better videos.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.870
And instead of buying and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.020
running their own equipment,
they chose to rent some of the web

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.140
provided computer infrastructure that
was part of Amazon's compute cloud.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.990
The company was doing okay, and
it had a relatively steady work load

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.610
which required about 50 of these
Amazon's compute instances.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.600
Now these are not physical servers,
instead they were virtual machines.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.800
They had no control over exactly how
Amazon runs these virtual machines,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.910
whether they are on the same physical
server or many other physical servers.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.150
Then, in April 2008, Animoto became
available on the Facebook platform.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.340
What it means is that it became an
option available to Facebook users with

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.070
a click of a button to turn
their timeline photos or

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.770
albums into cool video.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.410
What happened afterwards was
the definition of going viral.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.880
Within 3 days,
Animoto signed up 750,000 new users.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.370
And from the 50 compute instances, so

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.220
the 50 machines that
it needed on Monday.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.640
That number became 400 by Tuesday.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.160
So an order of magnitude
larger in a day.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.390
And then by the end of that week,

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.900
by Friday,
that number of machines was 3,400.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.000
Two orders of magnitude increase in
the resources, just within that week,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.390
just within those four or five days.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.920
There's no way they could have been able
to respond to this dramatic increase in

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.180
demand if they had gone with
a traditional route of owning and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.990
managing their own infrastructure.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.400
You just would not be able to bring in,
install, wire,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.300
configure, et cetera,
as many machines in such a short time.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.780
Even if by some miracle they actually
did have the physical space and

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.360
could fit all of these machines
in the machine room, and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.420
then that there was sufficient
power to power all that.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.180
The only reason that Animoto
was able to do this is because

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.670
they used a cloud-based deployment and

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.440
then they leveraged the capabilities
that cloud computing offers.
