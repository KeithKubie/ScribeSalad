00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.580
GILBERT STRANG: OK, this is
my second video on the Laplace

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.740
transform, and this one will
be about solving second order

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.050
equations.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.260
So let me remember the plan.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.450
So there's our second
order equation.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.200
And I'm taking
this example first,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.540
with the delta function
on the right-hand side.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.260
You remember, that's
a key example.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.690
And actually, we have a special
letter for the solution.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.080
This is an impulse.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.780
And the solution is
the impulse response.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.750
And I use a little g.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.610
So I should have
turned this y into a g.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.970
So that g is the
solution, starting

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.030
from 0 initial
conditions, with a delta.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.550
So what's the plan?

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.780
We want to take the
transform of every term.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.160
We have to check, what is
the transform, the Laplace

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.280
transform of the delta function?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.569
You remember the definition
of the transform.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.800
It's this integral.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.100
You take your
function-- whatever

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.420
it is, here delta-- multiply
by e to the minus st,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.030
and integrate.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.180
s equals 0 to infinity.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.950
Well, easy to integrate
with a delta function there.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.530
It's 0, except where the
impulse is, at t equals 0.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.710
And at t equals 0, this is 1.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.520
So the answer is 1.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.400
That's the nice Laplace
transform of the impulse.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.770
And now I want the transform
of the impulse response.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.310
So the impulse response
comes from this equation.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.300
So now, transform every term.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.730
So the transform of g
will be called capital G.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.220
And the transform of
the delta function is 1.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.890
And the derivative,
you remember,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.535
has an extra factor, s.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.580
The transform of the derivative
from the first Laplace

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.020
transform video
was s times g of s.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.640
And the second
derivative, another s.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.670
So s squared, times g of s.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.420
We're not surprised to see the
very familiar quadratic, whose

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.140
roots are the two exponents
s1 and s2, showing up here.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.640
We've seen this every
time, because we

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.520
have constant coefficients.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.000
We always see this quantity.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.170
And now we see that, look,
the transform, capital G.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.410
I divide by that.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.700
It's exactly the
transfer function.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.450
So that's connecting in the
idea of the transfer function

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.150
to the Laplace transform
of the impulse response,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.340
because I have this
in the denominator.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.600
OK, so I want now-- I've taken
the transform of the equation.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.530
I've got the transform of
little g, the impulse response.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.770
So now I'm ready to find G,
the impulse response by invert

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.990
Laplace transform.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.750
How do I find the function
with that Laplace transform?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.130
Right now, it's 1
over a quadratic.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.250
The whole idea of
partial fractions

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.840
is, split this so this
G of s, final step.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.500
It's G of s.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.440
Well, you remember that
this is the polynomial that

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.440
has the two roots, s1 and s2.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.180
I'm going to write that
as 1 over s minus s1,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.060
and s minus s2.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.510
Those are the two roots
from the quadratic formula--

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.940
the two poles, we could
say, poles of G of s.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.090
And now I want to use
partial fractions.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.089
So I want to separate
this into two fractions.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:24.660
And it turns out that they
are 1 over s minus s1,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.450
minus 1 over s minus s2.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.740
And it turns out
there's a factor

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.010
there to make it correct.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.060
You could check.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.570
When you put these, this
over a common denominator,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.350
you get this.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.120
And when you put that
over a common denominator,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:54.090
you'll get a numerator,
which you have to cancel.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.140
OK.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.760
So then, now I have
two simple poles.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.900
And I could write here what
I know, what g of t is.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.420
Remember, the function
with that transform

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.800
is just e to the s1 t.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.090
The one most important
of all transforms

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.880
is the transform
of the exponential,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.460
is that simple pole.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.750
So now I invert the
Laplace transform.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.340
So this gives me
an e to the s1 t,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:43.550
minus the function with that
transform, is e to the s2 t.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.550
And I still have this
constant, s1 minus s2.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.710
I've re-discovered
the impulse response.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.520
It's a solution to my
equation with impulse force.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.700
And it's that
particular function

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.050
that plays such
an important part

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.130
in the whole subject of constant
coefficient differential

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.670
equations.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.720
Because you see it's
the critical thing here.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.330
Here's the critical
transfer function,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.000
and here is the inverse
Laplace transform.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.340
The Laplace transform
of that is that.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.810
Good.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.750
That's that example.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.970
And now I just want to take
another function than delta.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.050
OK.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.790
I could go all the way to
take f of t, any f of t.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.910
But let me stay with examples.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:01.620
So now I'm going to do y double
prime, plus b y prime, plus cy.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.750
They're all the most
important example.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:10.760
The best one we could do
would be cosine of omega t.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.050
An oscillating problem,
with an oscillating force,

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.420
at a frequency different
from the natural frequency,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.870
and we also have damping there.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.350
So this is the standard,
spring mass dashpot

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.970
problem, or RLC circuit
problem, certainly

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.390
RLC circuits, highly important.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:38.290
And you might remember the
solution gets a little messy.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.230
A solution gets a little messy.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.160
It's highly important,
but-- so I'll

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.240
carry it through
to the last step.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.040
But I probably won't
take that final step.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.400
Just, what I want you to
see is another example

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.320
of the inverse
Laplace transform.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.596
So what do we need?

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:03.970
We need the Laplace
transform of that.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.030
I plan to take the Laplace
transform of every term.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.430
s squared plus bs plus c.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.530
We'll multiply.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.580
I'm transforming everything.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.840
And here I have to put
the transform of that.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.360
OK.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.740
So how will I get that?

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.560
And of course, there might
be a sine omega t in there.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.380
I would really like to
get them both at once.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.059
So let me put down
them both at once.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:43.620
The cosine and the sine are the
real and imaginary parts of e

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.732
to the i omega t, right?

00:08:48.624 --> 00:08:50.700
Euler's great formula.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.560
e to the i omega t is cosine
omega t, the real part,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.050
plus i sine omega t,
the imaginary part.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:05.880
But now I know the transform of
e to the a t, e to the i omega

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.490
t.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.130
So that transforms
to-- so I want

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:15.590
the real and the
imaginary parts of 1 over,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.780
you remember what it is.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.880
It's just that
simple pole again,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.220
s minus the exponent i omega.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.450
So I'm going to get the cosine
and the sine at the same time,

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.050
from one calculation, finding
the real and imaginary parts

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:41.120
of this, 1 over s
plus s minus i omega.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.840
How do you deal
with a pole, when

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.080
if you want the real
and imaginary parts,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.370
you're happy to get a real
number in the denominator

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.480
and see the real and
imaginary parts up above.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.820
I don't like it when
it's down there.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.840
So what I'm going to do is,
real and imaginary parts of,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.680
I'll multiply s minus i omega.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.970
This is the key trick
with complex numbers.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.330
It comes up enough,
so it's good to learn.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.910
I multiply that by its
conjugate, s plus i omega

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.422
over s plus i omega.

00:10:26.422 --> 00:10:29.470
So I multiplied by 1.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:33.580
But you see, what's
happened now is,

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.170
real and imaginary parts
of-- I've got what I want,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:44.710
s plus i omega is now up in the
numerator, where I can see it.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.560
And what do I have down below?

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.570
s minus i omega
times s plus i omega,

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.990
the very important quantity.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:11:01.040
S squared minus i omega s, plus
i omega s, minus i squared,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.950
that's plus 1 omega
squared plus omega squared.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:06.980
OK.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.570
We've done it.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.950
I've transformed the
cosine and the sine

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:18.290
into s over this,
and omega over this.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.810
So two at once, two transforms.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:28.340
And of course, as always, we're
able to do, and recognize,

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.000
and work with the transforms
of a special group

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.990
of nice functions,
exponentials above all,

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.810
sines and cosines coming from
exponentials, delta functions.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.290
It's a short list.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.880
Those are the ones we can
do, and fortunately those

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.860
are the ones that we need to do.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:58.700
OK, so I'm now ready to
put in the right-- what

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.890
did that turn out to be?

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.130
It turned out to be
s from the cosine,

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.960
I'm not doing the
sine now, the cosine.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.330
I'm taking the real part.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:13.910
It's s over that positive s
squared plus omega squared.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.790
Are you with me?

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.960
Left-hand side, all normal.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.570
I'm starting from 0
initial conditions,

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:27.900
otherwise I would see the
initial values in here.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.930
But I don't, because they're 0.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:35.010
And over here, I've
got the transform

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.360
of the right-hand side.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.520
OK?

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.450
Then I just bring
that down there.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:53.110
So finally, I know y of s
is s over this all-important

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:59.610
quadratic, and then I have the
s squared plus omega squared.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.150
OK.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.800
Well, you see it did get harder.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.190
We have s squared from
a quadratic there.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.320
We have two quadratics.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.490
We have a fourth-degree
polynomial down there.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.220
Partial fractions will work.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:25.050
Partial fractions can simplify
this, for any polynomials,

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.260
but the algebra
gets quickly worse

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.540
when you get up to degree four.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:36.470
But actually, this can
be, it could be done.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.880
And I don't plan to do it.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.480
To me, this would
eventually give the solution

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.750
to this example.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.770
But we have other ways
to get that solution.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.480
And I believe, for me at least,
the other ways are simpler.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.580
I know that the solution is
a combination of cos omega

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.280
t and sine omega t.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.730
And this is the particular
solution I'm talking about.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.680
And I can figure out what
those combinations are,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.790
because I know the right form.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.940
Here, I have to deal with
partial fractions and degree

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.450
four, down there.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.930
I'm going to chicken
out on that one.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.040
I won't completely chicken out.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.070
I'll say what the
pieces look like.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.990
But I won't figure
out all the numbers.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.730
OK.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:39.140
So all this thing, I see as
some constant over-- well,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:45.320
this factors into s
minus s1 s minus s2.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.305
Those are the two
roots, as we saw above.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.880
So I have a linear, a
linear, and a quadratic.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.580
And partial fraction says
that I can separate out

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:04.650
the first linear,
the second linear,

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:11.390
and the third quadratic,
which I could factor too,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.200
but-- I could factor
s squared plus omega

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.840
squared into that
times that, but it

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.050
brings in imaginary numbers.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.950
So I'll put a cs and a d.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.240
OK.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.570
Four numbers to be determined,
or rather not to be determined.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.480
Because I'm going to stop there.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:41.800
What I've discovered
is this part

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.390
would be the null
solution, would

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.540
be a null solution because
it's involves e to the s1 t

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.325
and e to the s2 t.

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:58.100
This part, when I find
the inverse transform,

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.490
it must be the combination of
cos omega t and sine omega t.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.770
So that's some
combination, when I find

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.460
that it's the transform of--

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.010
