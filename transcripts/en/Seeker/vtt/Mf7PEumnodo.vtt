00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:04.279
If you suffer from anxiety, you probably have
a harder time dealing with life’s uncertainties.

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.460
But don’t worry, it’s not a reflection
on you.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.130
It’s a reflection on your brain.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.830
Hey guys, Amy here with you on DNews today,
and let’s be honest, the only thing worse

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.260
than anxiety is when anxiety makes you anxious.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.000
Turns out, it’s a bit of a cycle.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.430
A team of scientists from the University of
California Berkeley and the University of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.590
Oxford recently studied how people respond
to unpredictability and they found that those

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.840
prone to high anxiety have a harder time reading
social and environmental cues that could help

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.469
them avoid a negative outcome.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.519
Imagine if a longtime friend were to suddenly
lash out at you.

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.829
Mood swings might be normal for your friend,
or their outburst might be indicative that

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.710
your friendship is deteriorating.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.089
If you’re prone to anxiety, you might not
be able to draw from your years of friendship

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.859
to know how to react to avoid making things
worse.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.149
It comes down to a glitch in the brain's decision-making
circuitry, which is typically indicative of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.800
anxiety disorders.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.879
Processing incoming information and drawing
on past experiences from memories are vital

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.270
in decision-making, as are using logic and
probability.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.140
We have to draw conclusions from past events
to determine the best course of action now.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.390
But these same parts of the brain are involved
in anxiety reactions.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.030
Key parts of the brain that produce fear and
anxiety include the amygdala and the hippocampus.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.080
Scientists think the amygdala acts as a communications
point between the parts of the brain that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.580
process incoming sensory signals and the parts
that interpret these signals.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.670
Emotional memories are also stored in the
amygdala.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.090
The hippocampus encodes past threatening events
like a near fall from a rooftop into these

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.090
memories.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.700
The memories and experiences the amygdala
draws on can trigger an anxiety response.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.700
We all have amygdalas, hippocampuses, and
memories, so why do some of us experience

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.350
anxiety more than others?

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.910
Some people are genetically predisposed to
anxiety, naturally unable to create some mood-controlling

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.880
neurotransmitters -- chemicals that give your
brain information about how you should react

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.260
and act in a situation.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.750
For other people, anxiety is linked to hormone
imbalance.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.430
To see how anxiety affects decision-making,
this UC Berkeley and Oxford team put 31 young

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.480
and middle-aged adults with a wide range of
baseline anxiety levels through a simple test.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.950
Participants were seated in front of a computerized,
two-armed bandit style terminal.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.080
They were then asked to pick between two shapes,
one of which would give them a mild electrical

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.080
shock when selected.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.579
The goal was for participants to keep a mental
log of which shapes most often delivered electrical

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.310
shocks and avoid choosing those shapes.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.230
The challenge was that the shocking shapes
changed, sometimes frequently and other times

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.299
not for a while.

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.569
Regardless of shape change rate, highly anxious
people had more trouble avoiding shocks than

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.430
their less anxious counterparts.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.000
The researchers also tracked subjects’ eyes
and noticed anxious people had less pupil

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.950
dilation when they received a shock.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.269
Pupil dilation is often a response to an unfamiliar
and possibly hostile situation.

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.639
It indicates alertness and a readiness to
act.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.510
The fact that their pupils stayed small suggests
that they were unable to adapt quickly.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.269
On the whole, participants prone to anxiety
were simply less adept at taking in the new

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.109
information about their environment and processing
the rapidly changing game, a response that

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.329
they would likely carry over in their regular
lives.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.779
So this study helps to explain WHY anxious
people crumble in the face of uncertainty

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.170
- but what can be done to avoid that?

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.840
More research is clearly needed.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.400
So, has all this made you more aware of being
anxious as it has me?
