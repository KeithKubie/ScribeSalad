00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.397
- Does everyone in your
school smoke those Juuls?

00:00:02.397 --> 00:00:04.739
- You know, it was a
big thing at my school.

00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:06.859
My school's a pretty, like

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.629
rebellious school in that sense;

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:09.757
there was a lot of people that got,

00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:10.682
like, suspended and expelled

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:12.427
for Juuling in the bathroom
- Dang

00:00:12.427 --> 00:00:13.928
Juuling, is that what they call it?

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:14.761
- [Milo and Alexis] Juuling.

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.809
- Ooo, Juuling; okay.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.047
- Yeah, but yeah, I mean, it's a problem.

00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:19.877
I mean, it's a problem at every school;

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:20.925
it's not just my school
- Yeah

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:21.765
- You know what I mean?

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:23.962
But, it's a huge, huge epidemic

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:25.311
- Juuling in the bathroom for me

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:28.333
was singing Juul with my
friends in the bathroom.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.452
♪ You were meant for me! ♪

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:30.421
We would just like all

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.254
- (laughs) That's Juuling;

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:32.087
Hey you wanna meet
(laughs)

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:33.589
after school at a Juul in the bathroom?

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.267
- We got in trouble for it so much!

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:38.434
(Pop-punk theme tune)

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:40.499
- Yeah, Milo you became a man

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.846
on one of your dances; everyone knows it,

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:44.326
everyone reacted to it.
- [Milo] Yep.

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:46.903
- And, we're not gonna talk about it

00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:47.736
until you t-

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:50.215
- Turn 18
- March, yeah.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:51.437
- OK, I can't wait to hear about it

00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:52.625
- I wanna know what it is!

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.102
- Yeah, me too; I don't know what it is!

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:55.005
- OK, here's the thing;

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:56.387
Dancing With the Stars is,

00:00:56.387 --> 00:00:58.326
that's why there's
separate show for children

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:01.918
because you can't put children
into these sexy dances.

00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:05.369
It feels weird to watch
because men on the show,

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.952
regardless of who they
are, like, get sexy.

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.537
Women, regardless of who they are

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.846
get sexier than you've ever seen them.

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.646
And it's just like a weird,

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:18.606
and Milo had some dances that were sexy.

00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:19.835
- Yeah
- I'm not gonna lie

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:22.046
- Did something really dirty happen?

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:23.245
- If the ladies are listening,

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.893
here are the dances that
I would direct them to:

00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:27.373
We've got
- His finale dance.

00:01:27.373 --> 00:01:29.514
- His finale dance one hundred percent!

00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:30.347
- One hundred thousand percent.

00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:31.180
- I've watched it

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.272
- [Alexis and Nikki] So many times

00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:34.332
- The little drip sounds

00:01:34.332 --> 00:01:36.788
- The contemporary
- Bloop!

00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:37.851
- Asylum?
- Ohh.

00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:39.287
- That one, oof, that was such a good one.

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:41.086
- The one from the Halloween episode

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:43.638
They do a
- Halloween episode, so good.

00:01:43.638 --> 00:01:46.340
- I mean, it is one of the best dances.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.173
- Honestly one of the best dances

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.006
- [Nikki] He like plays
one of the mental patients.

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:49.166
- I've seen on the show
- Shut up!

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.474
- The problem with that dance,

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:52.307
- [Milo] Tell me the problem

00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:53.922
- So the whole theme of that dance is

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:55.723
- It's like Britney Spears

00:01:55.723 --> 00:01:56.556
- [Milo and Nikki] Toxic

00:01:56.556 --> 00:01:57.612
- But it's to this, like,

00:01:57.612 --> 00:01:59.194
it's done almost acoustically

00:01:59.194 --> 00:02:00.027
It's broken down.
- It's really creepy

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:01.373
- And it's creepy! Yeah, it's like

00:02:01.373 --> 00:02:02.206
(Huming "Toxic" riff)

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:03.194
- But it's also sexy.

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:04.353
- Beautiful, yes;
- [Alexis] Yeah.

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:06.493
- It is sexy, but that's
the problem I had with it.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.042
'Cause Witney's playing his nurse,

00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:09.624
and I'm like there's something going on

00:02:09.624 --> 00:02:10.525
between this patient
- [Alexis] Oh yes!

00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:12.964
- And the nurse, and where's the protocol?

00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:13.797
- There's a story behind it.

00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:14.630
- [Nikki] I mean I wanna
go to HR about this.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.481
- Yes, well it was kind of like

00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:17.879
when we were coming up with the dance

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.268
we were really stuck on the story,

00:02:20.268 --> 00:02:22.222
and we were like-
- Yeah, why is this nurse

00:02:22.222 --> 00:02:24.416
taking advantage of her patient!?

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:26.585
- At first we were like
she's a real nurse.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.446
and she falls in love with me.
- Yeah

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:29.279
- And then we were like

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:31.326
nah, how 'bout I fall in love with her.

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:32.323
And then were were like, wait,

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:34.502
what if she's not even like a real nurse?

00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:35.335
- Oh
- So what we ended up

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:36.483
tryin' to do was that

00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:38.283
she's like a figment of my imagination,

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:39.872
but it didn't really
end up looking that way.

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:40.705
It just kind of looked like

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:41.538
- She was a naughty nurse.

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:43.563
- This insane asylum dude
- [Nikki] (laughs)

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.363
- With this nurse that had, like, a thing.

00:02:45.363 --> 00:02:46.483
- That dance is so good,

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.472
so watch the asylum dance,

00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:51.326
and then, yeah, what was the one,

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:52.427
the weekend one?

00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:54.128
- The, was it the Argentine Tango

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:54.961
where you did that?

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:57.368
- Yeah, that one didn't really,
like, do as well though.

00:02:57.368 --> 00:02:59.187
Like, that one doesn't have
as many views on YouTube.

00:02:59.187 --> 00:03:00.576
- Okay, just stick to the other two then.

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:02.695
- Okay, but I thought that
one was gonna be really good.

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:04.437
That one I feel like is by far my most

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:06.026
underrated dance.
- But to be honest with you,

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:07.478
people on YouTube, all those people;

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:08.908
they want wow factor
- Yeah

00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:11.222
- And, like, they don't
like just good technique.

00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:12.385
- They don't understand, like you get it

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:13.218
- They don't understand,

00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:14.051
they don't care
- Yes!

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:15.742
- So it's like, it could be
an amazing Argentine Tango,

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:18.317
but all they see is like, your
feet flippin' back and forth.

00:03:18.317 --> 00:03:19.717
They wanna see you do cartwheels

00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:20.957
and jump in water, and like,
- [Milo] Yeah.

00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:22.483
- Yes, that's what I wanna see.

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:23.316
I don't care
- [Alexis] Yeah, exactly

00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:24.451
- About technique!
(Cacophony of agreement)

00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:25.707
- You don't care about technique, right!

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:26.850
- That's what I told
Witney all the time too.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.832
I was like, I need to
back-flip off this table.

00:03:28.832 --> 00:03:29.856
We need to get water.
- And it happened!

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:30.689
- Yeah, exactly

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:31.522
- Yeah, yeah

00:03:31.522 --> 00:03:32.659
That's the thing about that show

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.297
is you're constantly trying to manage

00:03:35.297 --> 00:03:37.713
being good for the judges

00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:40.687
so you get those scores, and
being technically perfect.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.615
But also trying to appeal
- Exactly!

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:44.385
- To voters and be entertaining

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:45.506
- That is the hardest thing about it.

00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:49.685
- And you're juggling
those two, and, I mean,

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:51.393
so much of the show is not about dancing

00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:52.914
it's about your packages

00:03:52.914 --> 00:03:54.147
- So much!
- I'd say even more;

00:03:54.147 --> 00:03:54.980
- I would say the packages
are more important.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.822
- More about you as a
person than your dancing.

00:03:57.822 --> 00:03:59.470
- Yeah, so the packages are the things,

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.921
the videos that run before the dance

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:02.969
that kind of, like,
establish the relationship

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.019
between the couple, that's
either brewing or yeah

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.510
I mean you, you were in so many,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.259
- (laughs) Exposed!

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.515
- Hashtag X-posed!
- A lof of people don't know

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:14.865
Alexis Ren
- [Alexis] Jesus Christ

00:04:14.865 --> 00:04:16.801
was with Alan Bernsten
(Alexis clears her throat)

00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:20.732
- Andrew, let me just like
tell you what, okay so,

00:04:20.732 --> 00:04:22.113
we go into the show,

00:04:22.113 --> 00:04:25.182
and before it even begins everyone's like

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.233
Alan's like in love with Alexis

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:28.066
- Well, duh!

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:29.344
- He has a huge crush on her,

00:04:29.344 --> 00:04:30.985
it's like, yeah duh, exactly.

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:32.636
- Like, duh
- [Nikki] Everyone does!

00:04:32.636 --> 00:04:34.518
- Wait, why is it a duh?

00:04:34.518 --> 00:04:35.566
- Look at Alexis' face right now!

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.115
- She's the most unattractive person

00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:37.977
I've ever seen in my life

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:39.814
- Thank you for saying that!

00:04:39.814 --> 00:04:41.291
- You mean this four you put me next to

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.486
for the whole fuckin' radio show?

00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:43.422
(general laughter)

00:04:43.422 --> 00:04:45.059
- Like I give a shit!

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:46.340
- [Nikki] Alexis hasn't been
a four since she was four.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.550
- I'm more attracted to the dude!

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.660
- I know, I would agree
with you on that one.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.560
- Yeah, this guy's more

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.266
of a fuckin' babe than this dump!

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:56.970
- Oh my god!
(laughing)

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.524
- Thank you so much.
- Come on.

00:04:58.524 --> 00:04:59.476
Somebody's gotta take everyone down

00:04:59.476 --> 00:05:01.194
- Yeah, someone.

00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:03.230
- OK, go ahead, I get
it, she's very attractive

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.379
somebody said
- Keep changing the subject

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:06.212
I like this

00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:07.045
Somebody said she's very attractive,

00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:07.909
and then they got a crush on her, right?

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.757
- Yes, exactly so you can imagine

00:05:09.757 --> 00:05:12.223
a world in which someone would
have a crush on her, right?

00:05:12.223 --> 00:05:13.222
I know its kind of a stretch

00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:15.075
- Its hard to imagine but it happens

00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:15.908
- I mean, not for someone

00:05:15.908 --> 00:05:19.088
like me, 'cause, like I
said she's very, very ugly.

00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:20.437
- Yeah, you're into looks

00:05:20.437 --> 00:05:21.706
- I'm not into looks at all!

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:22.586
- No, you are into looks

00:05:22.586 --> 00:05:23.745
- I am into looks

00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:25.131
oh, yeah, that's what it is right;

00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:25.964
that's why I'm not attracted

00:05:25.964 --> 00:05:26.922
- And you know that she's
just not bringin' it

00:05:26.922 --> 00:05:27.755
on that front
(laughing)

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:31.148
- Yeah no, not at all;
not even a little bit.

00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:31.981
And I am a supermodel

00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:32.814
- Another thing about Alexis Ren,

00:05:32.814 --> 00:05:34.147
I was completely

00:05:36.204 --> 00:05:37.993
intimidated to meet her.

00:05:37.993 --> 00:05:39.665
When I first found out
she was on the show,

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:40.964
I was like God dammit.

00:05:40.964 --> 00:05:43.262
Like, I was watching her
looking at her Instagram

00:05:43.262 --> 00:05:45.158
and being like I can't
have this thing around me.

00:05:45.158 --> 00:05:46.097
(Alexis grunts uncomfortably)

00:05:46.097 --> 00:05:48.057
Prancin' around with that
waist, it's just like

00:05:48.057 --> 00:05:48.890
- That waist!

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.126
- That waist!? Oh my god!
- Waist!? (laughs)

00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:52.036
- Those little hips!
- [Nikki] I was so nervous

00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:54.196
about her, but her waist
is like really annoying.

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:55.425
(Alexis laughs)
- Why?

00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:57.353
- 'Cause it's so small
- Yeah, it's tiny?

00:05:57.353 --> 00:05:58.934
- And it's like Disney Princess small

00:05:58.934 --> 00:06:00.204
where it looks like.

00:06:00.204 --> 00:06:01.854
'Cause sometimes they'll break down

00:06:01.854 --> 00:06:02.687
Disney Princesses or barbies

00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:04.041
- [Alexis] (mumbling) Oh
my God, so uncomfortable!!

00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:04.874
- And they go: To achieve this,

00:06:04.874 --> 00:06:08.009
you would have to not have
ribs, and it's impossible.

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.129
- Oh, people think I took my ribs out;

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.038
I was like no, I actually
just fractured them.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.527
- Honestly, people have asked me about it.

00:06:14.527 --> 00:06:15.555
- That's another thing that

00:06:15.555 --> 00:06:17.095
Dancing With the Stars never brought up;

00:06:17.095 --> 00:06:18.714
- She fractured two ribs!
- That entire time,

00:06:18.714 --> 00:06:21.425
I was two ribs, two different weeks.

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:22.524
They didn't say shit.

00:06:22.524 --> 00:06:24.116
I was like, you guys, this like,

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:26.705
I had to take a pain shot in my ass

00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:28.556
every single show day.

00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:29.639
- Yeah.
- Yeah

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:32.746
- Like, we're gonna stick
with the relationship story.

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:33.618
- There was, Nikki, there
were some interviews

00:06:33.618 --> 00:06:36.368
that, like, I fully looked
like I was on some shit.

00:06:36.368 --> 00:06:37.201
- Because you were!

00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:38.425
- 'Cause you were on some shit!

00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:39.513
- (laughs) I was!

00:06:39.513 --> 00:06:41.982
- They're not scared to put,

00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:43.996
and Dancing With the
Stars isn't hiding this;

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:45.914
I mean sometimes it feels like they,

00:06:45.914 --> 00:06:46.897
'cause I got injured too,

00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:48.055
and it was

00:06:48.055 --> 00:06:50.009
constantly like do I tell them about it,

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.500
do I put it out on camera?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.600
- I made a huge deal out
of the smallest injury.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.317
- Don't do it, don't put it out there

00:06:55.317 --> 00:06:56.197
that you're injured,

00:06:56.197 --> 00:06:57.816
and I'd be like wait, but I am,

00:06:57.816 --> 00:06:59.357
and I need people to know,

00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:01.488
I need the producers to
understand how injured I am.

00:07:01.488 --> 00:07:02.797
I need a shot in my back
- [Alexis] Yeah

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.255
- Or I can't do this
- [Alexis] Yeah

00:07:04.255 --> 00:07:06.736
- And, but, you're also
trying to not seem injured

00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:07.569
so that they keep you on.

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:08.728
Like, it's a mindfuck

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.840
- Right, that's the thing
- It's hard.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.651
- I got like barely injured;

00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:14.987
like I pulled my groin
tryin' to do something

00:07:14.987 --> 00:07:17.232
in like the Jive or something.

00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:19.363
And I was trying to like tell everyone

00:07:19.363 --> 00:07:22.453
I need help, I need to
use the physical trainer

00:07:22.453 --> 00:07:23.825
and all that, but I
also didn't want to like

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:25.400
make it a thing on the show
- Yeah

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.712
- Because that's scary, like it's scary.

00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:29.132
- If you're listening,
Dancing With the Stars,

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:30.253
there needs to be a system in place

00:07:30.253 --> 00:07:32.611
in which you can honestly talk to someone

00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:35.472
who it's not gonna affect your

00:07:35.472 --> 00:07:36.803
- Position on the show?

00:07:36.803 --> 00:07:38.732
- Yeah, the EPs aren't gonna find out,

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:40.792
but like you need to
be able to tell someone

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:43.227
when you're injured and not
have it backfire against you.

00:07:43.227 --> 00:07:45.111
Because that is the fear
that you kind of lived with

00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:45.944
on the show
- Yeah, you didn't

00:07:45.944 --> 00:07:47.238
want a it to be a pity party

00:07:47.238 --> 00:07:48.772
- [Nikki] No
- Exactly

00:07:48.772 --> 00:07:51.711
I didn't, I told Alan I was
like I don't wanna tell anyone.

00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:53.200
Like, I don't, I wanna keep this like

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.033
- [Nikki] Sighs
- And he was like no

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:55.469
you should, you should tell people.

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:56.669
Like, that's pretty serious.

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:57.502
- [Nikki] Yeah

00:07:57.502 --> 00:07:58.335
- He was like, if you
pulled something cool,

00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:00.065
but you fractured a rib.
- Yep.

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:01.033
- It really does make sense now.

00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:03.335
- This is how NFL athletes feel

00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:05.015
- Dude, it is
- Think about how,

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:05.848
- It is worse
- I know

00:08:05.848 --> 00:08:08.464
Think about how, they have
to get cortisone shots

00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:09.373
- They're like I have brain damage;

00:08:09.373 --> 00:08:10.866
and like you're fine, get back out there.

00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:12.342
- Oh yeah you're right I mean

00:08:12.342 --> 00:08:15.270
it's the same thing just go out and dance.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.103
- I like how when you were like

00:08:16.103 --> 00:08:18.533
"if Dancing With the Stars is listening"

00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:20.351
the room full of executives
listening to this right now,

00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:21.253
and they're like, we won't!

00:08:21.253 --> 00:08:22.663
We won't change for Nikki, no.

00:08:22.663 --> 00:08:24.645
- No, they're not, I mean
no one changes anything,

00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:25.478
it's a system that works.

00:08:25.478 --> 00:08:26.824
- That's how they make the most money.

00:08:26.824 --> 00:08:27.657
- [Nikki] Clearly it works

00:08:27.657 --> 00:08:30.986
- They wanna keep you scared,
obviously; that's good.

00:08:30.986 --> 00:08:32.394
'Cause if you're under
their thumb a little bit,

00:08:32.394 --> 00:08:33.793
then you're gonna have to
perform and feel that way.

00:08:33.793 --> 00:08:34.961
- When did it set in for you guys

00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:36.745
that you're like, oh wait
I'm on a reality show.

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:38.004
Hold on a second.

00:08:38.004 --> 00:08:39.524
- Not even on the show;

00:08:39.524 --> 00:08:42.191
it was almost until someone recognized me

00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:43.841
that I was like oh yeah,
you're watching this

00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:45.241
like outside of the studio.

00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:46.700
Like, I'm on your TV.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.260
- You're in this little bubble

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.132
that you don't realize.
- Yeah exactly.

00:08:49.132 --> 00:08:51.790
- Right, what I mean by that more is like

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.441
you're being manipulated
to look a certain way on TV

00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.491
because it's a reality, it's not a

00:08:57.491 --> 00:08:58.324
- [Milo] Yes
- [Alexis] Yeah

00:08:58.324 --> 00:08:59.157
- You don't have control is
essentially what I'm saying.

00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:00.285
- 100%
- [Nikki] And I will say

00:09:00.285 --> 00:09:02.516
- Feel like Alexis felt
that more than I did

00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:03.356
- Yeah I mean it's different

00:09:03.356 --> 00:09:04.524
for each person
- I felt like I,

00:09:04.524 --> 00:09:07.743
I mean I, nothing really was that twisted

00:09:07.743 --> 00:09:10.134
in my story if that makes sense, you know?

00:09:10.134 --> 00:09:12.214
'Cause, they were keeping
the pretty innocent

00:09:12.214 --> 00:09:14.577
story of like I'm the kid,
- [Nikki] Yeah

00:09:14.577 --> 00:09:15.918
- In here just havin' a great time;

00:09:15.918 --> 00:09:16.830
we're just tryin' to do a good job.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.379
- And that's truly what I
saw behind the scenes too.

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:20.449
- Yeah, it really was
- It was really, like,

00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:23.012
- Every time I walked into
your guys' like classes

00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:25.372
you guys were doin' some joking, laughing

00:09:25.372 --> 00:09:28.630
like, you know
- I've never laughed so hard.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.601
- Milo (laughs) would like open the door

00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.580
to look at me (laughs) and Alan,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.690
- Then she'd be
- And I'd be like

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.523
I would look at him and be like

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:35.867
- On the floor
- "Help."

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:36.700
- With like tears like
swelling up in her eyes

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.700
- Why!? Why?

00:09:39.184 --> 00:09:42.221
- Well, I'd like, Okay well:

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:44.992
The way Alan teaches, he's
- He's Russian

00:09:44.992 --> 00:09:49.181
- He's Russian, so he has a
very like do or die mentality.

00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:51.981
And, like, I don't react well to that.

00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:55.112
Like, I'm more of like
be loving towards me,

00:09:55.112 --> 00:09:57.083
and like lift me to the light
- I feel that too.

00:09:57.083 --> 00:09:59.555
- Like, be kind, and I
will do my best for you.

00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:02.315
And so it was that constant battle

00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:04.552
of, like, don't be mean please.

00:10:04.552 --> 00:10:07.040
- That's, I relate to that

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.899
- I like Russians 'cause they're mean.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:10.535
- [Milo] They're intense
- They're honest

00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:11.971
- They're like, Do it.
- They're very honest.

00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:13.090
- (Russian accent) Don't be a pussy!

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:13.923
- Exactly!
- Do it!

00:10:13.923 --> 00:10:15.095
- When I went on tour
and I was just with like

00:10:15.095 --> 00:10:16.158
Lev and Val
- (accent) Don't be a bitch

00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:19.771
- And all the Russians I've
never so like hard in my life.

00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:21.177
Like I've never felt like I just

00:10:21.177 --> 00:10:22.223
- Yeah, because they've gone through

00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:23.596
way more than all of us!

00:10:23.596 --> 00:10:24.723
- I know, they really
have gone through a lot.

00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:26.095
- (Russian accent) You
don't like to do the dance?

00:10:26.095 --> 00:10:27.607
I used to eat stones for breakfast.

00:10:27.607 --> 00:10:30.607
- (laughs) That's true, I mean

00:10:30.607 --> 00:10:33.236
I think Gleb was my partner,

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:35.626
it was a similar situation
where it was like,

00:10:35.626 --> 00:10:38.855
and I remember, you know you have a call

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:42.436
with a producer before you
even agree to do the show.

00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:46.340
And she's, and this woman we
all know, I love her, Dina.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.173
- You have a call with her,

00:10:47.173 --> 00:10:48.569
and she kind of talks
you into doing the show,

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:49.500
but like
- [Milo] Yeah, she's great.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.540
- In a really sincere way

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.373
- [Milo] Yes
- [Alexis] She's so sweet.

00:10:51.373 --> 00:10:52.206
- And she tells you what it's gonna be,

00:10:52.206 --> 00:10:53.047
she's honest about it.

00:10:53.047 --> 00:10:54.108
And I remember being,

00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:55.970
her being like, now what
do you want in a partner?

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.796
'Cause she kind of is
like a matchmaker, right?

00:10:57.796 --> 00:10:58.629
- [Milo] Yeah

00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:59.462
- And I was like,

00:10:59.462 --> 00:11:02.197
first I wanna find someone
super hot and single;

00:11:02.197 --> 00:11:04.419
I'm like, well they didn't give me that.

00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:05.699
I was like, I'd like to romance,

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:07.816
I would love a budding
romance on reality TV.

00:11:07.816 --> 00:11:10.059
Like, I don't care, like gimme it!

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:11.859
- [Alexis] Yeah
- So they didn't do that

00:11:11.859 --> 00:11:13.677
'cause they're like we don't
wanna see that out of you.

00:11:13.677 --> 00:11:14.510
(Milo and Alexis giggle)

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.768
- We already have our
sights set on that one.

00:11:17.768 --> 00:11:19.709
And I was like I want it, but, most of all

00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:22.491
what I wanted was someone who would

00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:24.581
'cause I was like this is
gonna be very hard for me;

00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:26.848
I want someone who's emotionally available

00:11:26.848 --> 00:11:29.565
and is going to believe
in me despite everything.

00:11:29.565 --> 00:11:31.819
And it's just gonna be positive.

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:33.987
And there, she was like
I know just the person,

00:11:33.987 --> 00:11:35.477
and I'm like you do? (laughs)

00:11:35.477 --> 00:11:37.296
'Cause Russians don't have that in them.

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:38.129
- [Milo] Yeah

00:11:38.129 --> 00:11:38.962
- [Alexis] No!

00:11:38.962 --> 00:11:40.325
- To be everything' gonna be OK.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:41.613
Gleb would click into that

00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:42.951
and be like it's fine,
everything's gonna be fine,

00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:45.298
and I go, you don't mean
it, you're lying right now.

00:11:45.298 --> 00:11:46.609
And then he wouldn't be able to be,

00:11:46.609 --> 00:11:48.679
he's like yeah yeah
I'm lying, it's not OK.

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:49.604
Like, you're not good.

00:11:49.604 --> 00:11:51.626
It's like he would just reason with me.

00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:53.565
So you had a lot of that with Alan.

00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:54.398
- [Alexis] Yeah

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:55.231
- Where he was hard on you.

00:11:55.231 --> 00:11:56.064
- Yeah

00:11:56.064 --> 00:11:58.037
- 'Cause you're a very, you
wanted to keep it fun, right?

00:11:58.037 --> 00:12:00.099
- Yeah, I mean, it is a dance show,

00:12:00.099 --> 00:12:03.080
so that I had to keep reminding myself

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.033
because I got, you get swooped up into it

00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:05.866
- Yeah

00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:07.233
- Like, it gets very serious.

00:12:07.233 --> 00:12:08.902
- It becomes the only thing

00:12:08.902 --> 00:12:10.774
- [Nikki] Oh, yeah
- It's a little vortex.

00:12:10.774 --> 00:12:12.422
- I mean, my listeners
have heard me talk about

00:12:12.422 --> 00:12:13.921
when I got kicked out I like didn't know

00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:15.292
how to like function
- [Milo] Talk? (laughs)

00:12:15.292 --> 00:12:16.524
- In normal society; I'd be like,

00:12:16.524 --> 00:12:18.713
(fake crying) I think my
salsa coulda been stronger!

00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:20.483
And my friend's like, I have Lyme disease.

00:12:20.483 --> 00:12:22.314
I'm like OK
(Milo and Alexis laughing)

00:12:22.314 --> 00:12:23.505
- Yeah, we should probably

00:12:23.505 --> 00:12:25.134
- [Milo And Nikki] Talk about that

00:12:25.134 --> 00:12:28.014
- That's kinda impacting
everyone's life more

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:30.388
Yeah, I really; it's a bubble to be in.

00:12:30.388 --> 00:12:33.675
The whole Kavanaugh trial happened

00:12:33.675 --> 00:12:34.508
during Dancing With the Stars,

00:12:34.508 --> 00:12:35.813
and I like didn't pay attention to it.

00:12:35.813 --> 00:12:36.924
- I didn't know what was
going on in the outside world.

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:38.564
- I got out of the thing,

00:12:38.564 --> 00:12:39.772
and I'm like I still don't believe women.

00:12:39.772 --> 00:12:41.480
(laughing loudly)

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.444
It didn't get to me.

00:12:42.444 --> 00:12:44.793
I missed so much news;
it was almost nice to

00:12:44.793 --> 00:12:45.840
take a break from
- [Milo] It was!

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.041
- Anything else
- [Alexis] Yeah.

00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:48.499
- To care about anything else,

00:12:48.499 --> 00:12:51.550
but I love, what I saw out of you, Alexis,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.408
and that's when I was like,

00:12:52.408 --> 00:12:54.257
oh my God, she's fantastic.

00:12:54.257 --> 00:12:56.228
Because we were friendly
throughout the show,

00:12:56.228 --> 00:12:58.297
and I definitely saw a side of you

00:12:58.297 --> 00:13:00.887
that I would never have
anticipated before meeting you;

00:13:00.887 --> 00:13:02.304
I thought you were just
gonna be this model,

00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:05.456
this vapid model that is
just hot and knows she's hot

00:13:05.456 --> 00:13:08.283
and doesn't wanna talk to
anyone and wasn't friendly.

00:13:08.283 --> 00:13:10.302
Like, you just project a
bunch of shit onto everyone

00:13:10.302 --> 00:13:11.135
- [Alexis] Yeah

00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:12.293
- And that's what I projected onto you;

00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:14.393
it was immediately disproven
at Good Morning America

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:16.258
when I chatted you up
and gave you 2 seconds

00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:18.056
to be, like, to talk to you

00:13:18.056 --> 00:13:19.767
and then I was like, oh she's great.

00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:22.381
But then I really was
sold on you the last show;

00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:24.065
I went back for the finale,

00:13:24.065 --> 00:13:25.994
and like I wasn't even competing;

00:13:25.994 --> 00:13:28.405
I mean I was far from, I
was just there hangin' out.

00:13:28.405 --> 00:13:31.287
And you had the same vibe as
me of like I'm just hangin'

00:13:31.287 --> 00:13:33.539
you were not letting it get to you

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:35.193
in a way that was like you
weren't gonna enjoy it.

00:13:35.193 --> 00:13:36.026
- Yeah

00:13:36.026 --> 00:13:37.366
- [Nikki] And you were at the finals!

00:13:37.366 --> 00:13:39.644
And everyone else in the finals took it

00:13:39.644 --> 00:13:40.477
- [Milo] Including me.

00:13:40.477 --> 00:13:42.132
- Was stressed
- [Milo] I was freaking out

00:13:42.132 --> 00:13:44.373
- And like just in a mindset of

00:13:44.373 --> 00:13:46.694
(panic voice) if I don't win,
like, what's gonna happen,

00:13:46.694 --> 00:13:50.424
and you really, I don't know what kind of

00:13:50.424 --> 00:13:52.635
placidity you achieved in that moment,

00:13:52.635 --> 00:13:54.550
but you were so chill to be around.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.883
And I was like, why are you so chill,

00:13:55.883 --> 00:13:56.995
how did you do that.

00:13:56.995 --> 00:13:58.563
- It was the shot; no, I'm kidding

00:13:58.563 --> 00:13:59.955
(laughing loudly)

00:13:59.955 --> 00:14:03.435
(pop punk music)

00:14:03.435 --> 00:14:04.268
(Turntable slowdown)

00:14:04.268 --> 00:14:06.212
(Sonar beep)
