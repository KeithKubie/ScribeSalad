00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.180
I want to make a
quick clarification

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.180
based on the last video.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.340
In the last video, we
compared fractions.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.090
For example, we
compared 4/7 to 3/7.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.190
And we saw, clearly,
4/7 is a larger

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.700
fraction of the
whole than 3/7 was.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.550
But you might say, hey, but
what if my whole was bigger?

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.860
What if I took 3/7 of
this big thing here?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.230
Then 3/7 would look like this.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.420
So it would be 1, 2, 3/7.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.770
And so this 3/7--
this looks like I

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.580
have filled in more than I would
have over here for the 4/7.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.460
So doesn't it matter which whole
you're taking the fraction of?

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.110
And the answer is yes.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.200
It does matter.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.390
And when you compare
fractions, you

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.880
assume that you're taking
fractions of the same whole.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.720
So you can only make this
comparison right over here.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.100
So it has to be-- let
me make this very clear.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.190
It has to be the same.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.150
It has to be the same whole that
you're making the comparison.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.760
You can't compare 4/7 of a
mouse to 3/7 of an elephant.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.470
Those are two different things.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.290
You cannot make that comparison.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.860
You could compare 4/7 of a
mouse to 3/7 of that same mouse,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.560
or a mouse the same size.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.700
Then you could make
the same comparison.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.010
When we talk about fractions
as just pure numbers,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.600
then we automatically
go to the number line.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.700
The whole that we talk about
when we're on the number line

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.710
is the section of our
number line between 0 and 1.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.250
So if this is 0 and
then this is 1 here,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.440
when we talk about fractions
as just pure numbers,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.090
we're not saying 4/7 of a
mouse or 4/7 of an elephant.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.730
We're just talking about a
number on the number line.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.520
And so we would split
this into sevenths.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.240
Let me see if I could do that.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.070
Let me draw-- so that's
1/7, 2/7, 3/7, 4, 5, 6,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.760
and that's 7/7 right
over there, or 1.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.310
So this is 7/7, or 1.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:19.056
And this right over here is 1/7,
2/7, 3/7, 4/7, 5/7, and 6/7.

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.930
And so when you look at
the number line here,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.940
it's clear that 3/7, which
is three jumps from 0,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.810
three jumps of a
seventh each-- 1, 2, 3--

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.880
3/7 puts you right there,
while 4/7 is a larger number.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.190
It's to the right of 3/7.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.940
You have to make
four jumps-- 1, 2,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.720
3, 4-- four jumps of a seventh
to get right over there.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.520
So you can make this
comparison as long

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.280
as you're looking at the
fraction of the same whole.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.150
Here, the same
whole is the region

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.430
of our number line
between 0 and 1.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.230
In the previous video, the
same whole was this yellow bar.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.830
You can't compare 4/7
of this yellow bar

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.650
to 3/7 of this much
larger blue bar.
