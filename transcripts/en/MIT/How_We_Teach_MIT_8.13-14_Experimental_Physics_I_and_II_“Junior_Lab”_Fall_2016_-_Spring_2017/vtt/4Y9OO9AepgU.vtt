SEAN ROBINSON: Other
challenges include learning

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.310
how to do data analysis.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.140
You perform an
experiment in such a way

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.130
that it hopefully gives you
data that is worth analyzing.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.040
And data analysis
begins with that.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.280
Did you even perform the
experiment in a good way?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.100
But then there's just
technicalities of I

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.310
have a table of numbers
that my apparatus gave me,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.750
how do I analyze that?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.090
I have to get it into
a piece of software.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.730
I have to tell that
software, make me a plot.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.490
Compute an average.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.270
Just basic mechanical things.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.300
We don't care what
programming language they use.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.390
Whatever they use, we
promise to help them out

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.430
with the basics of it.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.930
But really, some
of the basic tasks

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.846
they're doing in whatever
programming language

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:53.760
it is, they're usually not
very sophisticated tasks

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.860
on the scale of
computer programming.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.070
They're usually
very simple things.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.120
But if you don't
know how to do it,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.460
they're very daunting tasks.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.750
We want students in this class
to struggle with the material.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.720
To really work at the things
that are useful to learning.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.280
We don't want them to struggle
with things that are just,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.891
my computer won't
compile my paper.

00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:23.640
We don't want to
struggle with things that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.750
are not useful to learning.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.180
So again, we have a long
series of small tasks

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.330
that gets people up to speed
with some instructor help.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.830
Gets them up to speed quickly
on these multiple small tasks.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.620
So that they are
spending their time

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.020
learning in an efficient
way, and not just spinning

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.740
their wheels.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.760
And just getting frustrated and
learning to hate the subject,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.660
instead of love the
subject like we do.
