1
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,550
like a boss.

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,170
So Oprah had an in depth interview
with Lance Armstrong was a dumb,

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,190
I was actually fucking hilarious.
I was watching it with the lovely Nia and,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,410
uh,
I was just laughing my ass off.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,290
It was,
it was phenomenal.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,440
Like she's sitting there
going like, um, so will you,

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,920
will you basically injecting,
you know,

8
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:37,780
fucking horse Jizz steroids
into you for every race?

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,520
And he's like,
yes.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,450
Did you ever take banned substances to
enhance your cycling performance? Yes.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,883
Yes or no.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,650
Did you ever use any other banned
substances like testosterone, uh,

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,750
cortisone or human growth hormone?
Yes.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,850
In all seven of your
Tour de France victories,

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,050
did you ever take banned
substances or blood dope? Yes.

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,040
For all tours. He's like, yes, I was.
She's like, did you consider a cheating?

17
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,310
And he's like, Eh, at the
time, no. No, I didn't.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,190
Who said to me earlier, you don't think
it was possible to win without doping?

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,400
Not In their generation.
And,

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,720
and I'm not here to talk about
others in that generation.

21
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:28,770
It's been well documented. Um,
I didn't invent the culture,

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,280
but I didn't try to stop the culture.
And that's that,

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,480
that that's my mistake and that's
where I have to be sorry for it.

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,840
And that's what something in the sport
is now paying the price because of that.

25
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:42,030
And so I am sorry for that.

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,970
It's like a course he didn't,
you know what pissed me off about lance?

27
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:49,090
I guess it was kind of a good move on
his part that he didn't go like Oprah.

28
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,440
Did you do any research into this sport?
Did you notice the top 20 guys?

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,850
We're all fucking doing this shit to,
you got to fight fire with fire.

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,600
You can't bring a knife to a gun fight.
If everybody else is jacked up,

31
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,760
I gotta be jacked up too.
For Fuck Sakes.

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,510
[inaudible]

33
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,410
the worst thing. No, I didn't.

34
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,680
I actually like the opera in interview
and it was kind of funny watching her be

35
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:34,270
dumbfounded
by this guy's complete lack of,

36
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,250
uh, you know, just not giving
a shit when he was cheating.

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,400
Um, and then the whole thing was
funny to me, cause I, you know,

38
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,350
I'm old enough to remember when Oprah
used to interview fucking midgets who want

39
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,580
to fuck their mailman's
brother. You know, so I dunno.

40
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,180
They don't know where to go. They
need a mother and, and unfortunately,

41
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,370
what about the father?

42
00:02:59,900 --> 00:02:59,990
[inaudible] you

43
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,980
don't necessarily need a mother.
They need a parent. May Be, why can't

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,640
anyways,
they do the whole interview and then

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,870
they go on ESPN.

46
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,570
Yeah,

47
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,570
Rick Riley's talking about Lance Armstrong
and I guess Rick Riley was backing

48
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:22,821
Lance and he was just having this hissy
fit about his reputation because he

49
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,510
backed Lance Armstrong.

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,590
Sorry Dude.
Oh sorry dude.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,750
14 years he put egg on my face and I
would even ask him off the record, Hey,

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,970
just tell me off the record
if you're doing this stuff,

53
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,420
because it keeps coming up and up and
every time he would be more and more

54
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:40,840
adamant that he wasn't doing it, then
you can defend me. Don't worry about it.

55
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,460
Like anybody gives a flying
fuck about Rick Riley.

56
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,260
Yeah.

57
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,320
And when Lance Armstrong, when he finally,
you know, came out that he did it,

58
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:52,290
did anybody go like,
oh my God,

59
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,630
now what happens to Rick Riley?

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,700
Like he made that whole fucking thing
about himself. You know, he made,

61
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:03,010
he said they go,
he made me look like a fool.

62
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,860
I was typing things,
supporting him. Rick, relax.

63
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,270
Nobody's blaming you. Nobody
gives a flying. Fuck this.
This really isn't on you.

64
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,660
This is about lance. This
isn't about you. Okay,

65
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,620
so why don't you just close your laptop,
fucking relax.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,600
Like he felt betrayed. It's like, Rick,

67
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,790
what are you fucking special?
He lied to the whole world.

68
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:33,250
He's not going to lie to you
like a brick. You listen. I know.

69
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:35,980
I just went on national
television and said that I, uh, I,

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,760
I don't cheat in those races,
but I, I actually am cheating.

71
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:41,880
Ah,

72
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,180
I've cheated every race and I plan
to continue cheating in the future.

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,200
And now that you know that,
um, I have to kill you.

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,320
You know,
I don't know.

75
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,970
I was really hoping for more on all
both of those subjects. I would,

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,300
I was hoping that I was going to
have something a little more funnier.

77
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,970
Kenny,
we

78
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,420
came back for me now,
I never really left.

79
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,660
It's illegal.
We shouldn't have it just out.
