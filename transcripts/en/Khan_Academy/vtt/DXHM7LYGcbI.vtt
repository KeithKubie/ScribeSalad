00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:02.785
- [Instructor] Let's say we're
going to trace out a curve

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:05.159
where our X coordinate
and our Y coordinate

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:07.328
that they are each defined by

00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:10.467
or they're functions
of a third parameter T.

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:13.476
So, we could say that X is a function of T

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:17.004
and we could also say
that Y is a function T.

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.561
If this notion is completely
unfamiliar to you,

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.523
I encourage you to review the
videos on parametric equations

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.202
on Khan Academy.

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:25.678
But what we're going to think about

00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:27.758
and I'm gonna talk about in
generalities in this video.

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:29.786
In future videos we're going to be dealing

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:32.769
with more concrete examples

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.726
but we're gonna think
about what is the path

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:35.858
that is traced out

00:00:35.858 --> 00:00:38.025
from when T is equal to A,

00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:42.188
so this is where we are
when T is equal to A,

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:45.917
so in this case this
point would be X of A,

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:47.000
comma Y of A,

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:50.055
that's this point

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:52.603
and then as we increase from T equals A

00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:54.186
to T is equal to B,

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:59.668
so our curve might do something like this,

00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:02.355
so this is when T is equal to B,

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:03.224
T is equal to B,

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:06.087
so this point right over here is X of B,

00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:07.170
comma Y of B.

00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:10.611
Let's think about how do we figure out

00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:12.806
the length of this actual curve,

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:17.311
this actual arc length from
T equals A to T equals B?

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:18.400
Well, to think about that

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.686
we're gonna zoom in and
think about what happens

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:24.546
when we have a very small change in T?

00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:26.045
So, a very small change in T.

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:28.616
Let's say we're starting at
this point right over here

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:30.636
and we have a very small change in T,

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:34.957
so we go from this point
to let's say this point

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.803
over that very small change in T.

00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:38.091
It actually would be
much smaller than this

00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:39.102
but if I drew it any smaller,

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:40.487
you would have trouble seeing it.

00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:43.085
So, let's say that that
is our very small change

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:46.752
in our path in our arc
that we are traveling

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.179
and so, we wanna find this length.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.246
Well, we could break it down

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:54.244
into how far we've
moved in the X direction

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:56.603
and how far we've moved
in the Y direction.

00:01:56.603 --> 00:01:58.792
So, in the X direction,

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.490
the X direction right over here,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.002
we would have moved a
very small change in X

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:04.640
and what would that be equal to?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.823
Well, that would be the rate of change

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:08.794
with which we are
changing with respect to T

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:11.963
with which X is changing with respect to T

00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:14.368
times our very small change in T

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.860
and this is a little hand wavy,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.673
I'm using differential notion

00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:20.002
and I'm conceptually using the idea

00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:23.813
of a differential as an
infinitesimally small change

00:02:23.813 --> 00:02:25.731
in that variable.

00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:27.449
And so, this isn't a formal proof

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.011
but it's to give us the intuition

00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:30.898
for how we derive arc length

00:02:30.898 --> 00:02:33.163
when we're dealing with
parametric equations.

00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:35.736
So, this will hopefully
make conceptual sense

00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:36.868
that this is our DX.

00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:38.184
In fact, we could even write it this way,

00:02:38.184 --> 00:02:42.351
DX/DT, that's the same thing
as X prime of T times DT

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:44.752
and then our change in Y

00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:47.162
is going to be the same idea.

00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:49.686
Our change in Y, our
infinitesimally small change in Y

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:52.117
when we have an infinitesimally
small change in T,

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:53.482
well, you could view that
as your rate of change

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.392
of Y with respect to T

00:02:55.392 --> 00:02:57.189
times your change in T,

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.275
your very small change in T

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:00.588
which is going to be equal to,

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:03.838
we could write that as Y prime of T DT.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.816
Now, based on this,
what would be the length

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:12.498
of our infinitesimally small
arc length right over here?

00:03:12.498 --> 00:03:15.219
Well, that we could just
use the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.392
That is going to be the square root of,

00:03:18.392 --> 00:03:20.094
that's the hypotenuse
of this right triangle

00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:21.002
right over here.

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:22.006
So, it's gonna be the square root

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.357
of this squared plus this squared.

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:26.497
So, it is the square root of,

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:28.390
I'm gonna give myself a
little bit more space here

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.110
because I think I'm gonna use a lot of it,

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.190
so the stuff in blue squared,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.216
DX squared we could
rewrite that as X prime

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.466
of T DT squared

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:43.536
plus this squared which
is Y prime of T DT squared

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.524
and now let's just try to
simplify this a little bit.

00:03:50.524 --> 00:03:52.963
Remember, this is this
infinitesimally small arc length

00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:54.444
right over here.

00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:58.798
So, we can actually
factor out a DT squared,

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:00.654
it's a term in both of these

00:04:00.654 --> 00:04:02.985
and so, we can rewrite this as,

00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:05.540
let me, so I can rewrite this

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.642
and then write my big radical sign,

00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:10.828
so I'm gonna factor out a DT squared here,

00:04:10.828 --> 00:04:14.224
so we could write this as DT squared

00:04:14.224 --> 00:04:16.391
times X prime of T squared

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.913
plus Y prime of T squared

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:27.282
and then to be clear

00:04:27.282 --> 00:04:29.850
this is being multiplied
by all of this stuff

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.069
right over there.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.624
Well, now if we have this DT
squared under the radical,

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:35.595
we can take it out

00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:36.910
and so, we will have a DT

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.750
and so, this is all going to
be equal to the square root

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.127
of, so the stuff that's
still under the radical

00:04:44.127 --> 00:04:47.044
is going to be X prime of T squared

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.464
plus Y prime of T squared

00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:57.522
and now we took out a DT

00:04:57.522 --> 00:04:59.863
and now we took out a DT.

00:04:59.863 --> 00:05:03.029
I could have written it right over here

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.260
but I'm just writing it on the other side,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.268
we're just multiplying the two.

00:05:06.268 --> 00:05:08.655
So, this is once again just
rewriting the expression

00:05:08.655 --> 00:05:12.830
for this infinitesimally
small change in arc length.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.512
Well, what's lucky for us is in calculus

00:05:15.512 --> 00:05:17.856
we have the tools for adding up

00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:21.559
all of these infinitesimally small changes

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.141
and that's what the definite
integral does for us.

00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:26.177
So, what we can do if we wanna add up that

00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:27.933
plus that plus that plus that

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:30.016
and remember, these are
infinitesimally small changes.

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:32.321
I'm just showing them
as not infinitesimally

00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:34.284
just so that you can
kind of think about them

00:05:34.284 --> 00:05:35.857
but if you were to add them all up,

00:05:35.857 --> 00:05:38.614
then we are essentially
taking the integral

00:05:38.614 --> 00:05:40.647
and we're integrating with respect to T

00:05:40.647 --> 00:05:43.862
and so, we're starting at T is equal to A,

00:05:43.862 --> 00:05:46.600
all the way to T is equal to B

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.600
and just like that we
have been able to at least

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:52.932
feel good conceptually

00:05:52.932 --> 00:05:55.522
for the formula of arc length

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:59.456
when we're dealing with
parametric equations.

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:00.840
In the next few videos

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.224
we'll actually apply it
to figure out arc lengths.
