00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:02.125
- [Host] So, I'm here with Jeffrey Rosen

00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:05.294
head of the National Constitution
Center in Philadelphia

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:06.680
and we're continuing to talk about

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.823
Article II of the US Constitution

00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:11.018
which talks about the
powers of the president.

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:12.289
And now we're gonna focus a little bit

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.824
on the first part of section two

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:17.560
which talks about among other things

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.910
that the President shall
be the Commander-in-Chief

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.460
of the Army and Navy of the United States,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.234
essentially the military
of the United States.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.343
And this seems like there's
a bit of a balance here

00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:32.028
because in Article I which describes the

00:00:32.028 --> 00:00:35.510
powers of the congress in section eight,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.847
it says the congress shall have power

00:00:37.847 --> 00:00:41.022
and it starts listing a bunch
of stuffs, a bunch of things

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:42.528
but one of the things that it list is

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:44.682
the power to declare war,

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:47.682
grant letters of marque and reprisal

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:53.170
and make rules concerning
captures on land and water.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.490
How do these two things
fit together, Jeffrey?

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.400
- [Jeffrey] Well, they've led to the most

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.222
dramatic constitutional
controversies in American history

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:03.527
as Justice Robert Jackson put
it in the Steel Seizure case.

00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:06.086
These cryptic words of the
commander-in-chief clause

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:07.579
have given rise to some of the most

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.596
persistent controversies in
our constitutional history.

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:13.905
Everyone agrees that congress
has the power to declare war

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:15.132
and once war is declared,

00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:17.276
the president has total control

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.997
over the conduct of the war.

00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:20.927
There's civilian control of the military,

00:01:20.927 --> 00:01:23.153
there's a single leader
once the war starts

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:25.965
but how the president can
act to deploy the troops

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:28.757
in the face of emergencies
when congress is silent,

00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:30.927
and how much congress
can constrain its power

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:34.659
has led rise to some huge
constitutional controversies.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.381
- [Host] And the Steel Seizure
case that you talked about,

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:37.730
this was in 1952,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.836
this was arguably talking
about the Korean War.

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:41.879
What was the context there?

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:44.326
Why did this need to be ruled on?

00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:45.553
- [Jeffrey] Well, it's an amazing case

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:48.228
and the steel companies
are gonna go on strike,

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:49.664
and President Truman decides

00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:51.274
this is a threat to national security

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:54.761
because the army needs steel
to conduct the Korean War.

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:57.860
He decides on his own without
congressional authorization

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.969
to seize the steel mills
as part of his authority,

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.469
his military authority
as commander-in-chief

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.900
and this goes up to the supreme court

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.020
and the supreme court strikes him down.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.514
They say he can't seize
the steel mills on his own.

00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:12.609
Truman is shocked, he's
appointed many of the justices

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.621
but the most influential opinion
in the steel seizure case

00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:18.088
is the concurring opinion
by Justice Robert Jackson,

00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:20.303
and I want our listeners to
go check it out on the web

00:02:20.303 --> 00:02:21.655
because it's so important.

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:23.727
And Justice Jackson
identified three categories

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:26.071
of executive power that
every law student learns

00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:27.541
and they're easy to remember.

00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:29.137
Basically, when the president acts

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:30.856
with congressional approval,

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:32.916
his authority is at its height.

00:02:32.916 --> 00:02:35.255
When he acts in the face of
congressional disapproval,

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.621
his authority as at its lowest ebb.

00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.800
And when congress has neither
approved or disapproved,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.044
the president acts in a zone of twilight,

00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:44.251
as Justice Jackson said.

00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.426
It sounds like the Twilight Zone

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.790
and I always think of
that music. (mumbles)

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.446
But it means that in
the Steel Seizure case,

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:55.385
although the congress had
not authorized the seizure

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:57.921
and the president had
no civilian authority

00:02:57.921 --> 00:02:59.348
to seize the steel mill,

00:02:59.348 --> 00:03:01.244
so he had no independent authority

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:02.994
to rely on them in the zone of twilight,

00:03:02.994 --> 00:03:07.109
and therefore, the court held
he acted unconstitutionally.

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.594
- [Host] And Truman's
argument might have been

00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:11.496
hey, look the constitution
makes me the commander-in-chief.

00:03:11.496 --> 00:03:12.993
If I read that broadly I should be able

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:15.942
to do whatever I need to
execute in times of war.

00:03:15.942 --> 00:03:19.576
Steel is a very important
input into making

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:21.794
the things that you need
to execute your war with.

00:03:21.794 --> 00:03:22.860
And so, if they're gonna go on strike,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.696
that's gonna keep me from
being able to conduct our war.

00:03:26.696 --> 00:03:27.529
- [Jeffrey] That's exactly right.

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:28.849
That's just what he argued

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.526
and although some justices bought it

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:32.951
including Chief Justice Fred Vinson

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.993
who Truman had appointed,

00:03:34.993 --> 00:03:36.966
a majority of the supreme court said

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.068
that civilian power over the military

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:40.695
doesn't authorize the president

00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:43.417
to use his power in the United States

00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:46.120
in ways that might be
helpful to the war effort.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.509
He needs explicit congressional
approval for that.

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.457
It really upset President Truman.

00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:54.180
He invited the whole supreme court.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.984
They actually invited him for drinks

00:03:55.984 --> 00:03:57.209
at Justice Hugo Black's house

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.575
after the decision came down,

00:03:58.575 --> 00:04:00.338
and Truman sulked for a while and he said,

00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:02.203
"Hugo, I don't think much of your law

00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:04.196
"but my golly, this bourbon is good."

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:05.316
So they kind of,
(laughs)

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:06.962
they made up after the case.

00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:08.314
(laughs)

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.131
- [Host] And another I guess relevant,

00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:13.143
this isn't a case but a resolution,

00:04:13.143 --> 00:04:17.448
is War Powers Resolution
1973, historical context.

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.362
We're nearing the end of the Vietnam War.

00:04:19.362 --> 00:04:21.088
What was the background there?

00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:22.442
- [Jeffrey] Well, congress was very upset

00:04:22.442 --> 00:04:25.787
that President Nixon had
sent bombers into Cambodia

00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:27.568
without congressional approval,

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:29.824
and there'd been other disputes about

00:04:29.824 --> 00:04:32.675
the president's power in Vietnam.

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:34.630
Congress decided to try to codify

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.476
exactly when the president could act

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.919
to repel sudden attacks,

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.005
which everyone agrees that
he has the right to do.

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:43.716
So, congress said, "President,
you've got to notify us

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.381
"within 48 hours of the time

00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:47.321
"that you send troops on your own

00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:48.686
"and you can only keep those troops

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:50.712
"on the ground for 30 days,

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:53.375
"except under extraordinary circumstances,

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:55.827
"otherwise you need
congressional approval."

00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:57.841
Despite this effort to kind of set out

00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:00.792
congressional approval for
these extraordinary situations,

00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:02.027
some presidents have argued

00:05:02.027 --> 00:05:04.105
that the War Powers Resolution itself

00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:06.558
is unconstitutional as a violation

00:05:06.558 --> 00:05:08.846
of the president's
commander-in-chief power.

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:10.339
Others on the other
side they said congress

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.261
is sitting too much power to the president

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:14.876
but so far the supreme
court has not struck down

00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:16.387
the War Powers Resolution,

00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:18.154
and presidents are
supposed to abide by it,

00:05:18.154 --> 00:05:19.529
although sometimes they haven't.

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:22.429
President Bill Clinton
sent troops into Kosovo

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:24.717
without following the
War Powers Resolution

00:05:24.717 --> 00:05:26.890
and notifying congress.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.200
- [Host] What's the argument
that a president would make

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.369
that the war powers or anyone could make,

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:34.452
that the War Powers Resolution
is unconstitutional?

00:05:34.452 --> 00:05:36.506
That somehow conflicts with section two.

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:37.992
- [Jeffrey] The argument is

00:05:37.992 --> 00:05:42.003
that the president's unitary
authority under Article II

00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:46.569
gives him complete power
as commander-in-chief

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.002
to conduct military
operations as he thinks best,

00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:50.810
and that includes the ability

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.265
to send troops into the field

00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:55.166
despite the explicit provision

00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:56.781
in Article I, section
eight of the constitution

00:05:56.781 --> 00:05:59.450
that says the congress has
the power to declare war.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.489
The unitary executive people

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:04.743
and President George W.
Bush's administration

00:06:04.743 --> 00:06:06.609
claim this explicitly say

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:07.935
that the president basically can do

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:09.870
whatever he thinks is necessary

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.266
to preserve national security.

00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:16.433
That led after the
terrorist attacks of 9/11

00:06:18.165 --> 00:06:22.103
other presidents including
President Obama said

00:06:22.103 --> 00:06:24.269
that because of the
commander-in-chief clause,

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:26.176
various attempts by congress to limit

00:06:26.176 --> 00:06:30.230
the president's unitary
authority were unconstitutional

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.998
and the Bush administration said

00:06:31.998 --> 00:06:33.798
the forbidding of torture of detainees,

00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:35.161
warrantless surveillance,

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.741
the detention of U.S.
citizens as enemy combatants,

00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:40.632
all of these were unconstitutional.

00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:43.240
The supreme court rejected
many of those claims

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.648
including most famously in the

00:06:44.648 --> 00:06:47.688
Hamdan and Rumsfeld case in 2006

00:06:47.688 --> 00:06:48.983
where the court said that the president

00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:51.213
could not set up military tribunals

00:06:51.213 --> 00:06:52.930
without congressional authorization.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.233
The big lesson from
all these cases is that

00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:58.215
when the president acts
side by side with congress,

00:06:58.215 --> 00:07:00.942
then the supreme court tends
to uphold executive power.

00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:03.413
But when this president
acts unilaterally on his own

00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:05.826
especially in the face of
congressional disapproval,

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:08.756
the supreme court is
likely to slap him down.

00:07:08.756 --> 00:07:09.875
- [Host] But across all of these,

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:12.349
there is a, even though these cases

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.194
especially the ones we cite seem to

00:07:14.194 --> 00:07:17.155
limit presidential
authority to some degree.

00:07:17.155 --> 00:07:18.316
There is this general notion

00:07:18.316 --> 00:07:20.709
even our founding fathers thought of

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:24.175
which is yes, the congress
has the power to declare war

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:26.248
but as the commander-in-chief,

00:07:26.248 --> 00:07:28.246
what if we're suddenly
attacked by someone.

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:29.724
Obviously, you don't wanna
go through the process

00:07:29.724 --> 00:07:31.595
of getting all the congressmen
together and to vote,

00:07:31.595 --> 00:07:33.174
you need to be able to act quickly.

00:07:33.174 --> 00:07:35.043
It has always been understood that

00:07:35.043 --> 00:07:37.049
as commander-in-chief, the president could

00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:39.671
engage in conflict quite quickly.

00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:41.530
- [Jeffrey] No question about it

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.524
and presidents have done
so from the beginning,

00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:48.980
the response to 9/11 is
a famous example as well.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.708
But many of the framers thought

00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:54.427
that congress' approval was necessary

00:07:54.427 --> 00:07:56.459
for serious wars, the war of 1812

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:57.819
there was a former declaration

00:07:57.819 --> 00:07:59.286
but there were lesser uses of force

00:07:59.286 --> 00:08:01.948
like the war with France in 1798,

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.231
conflict with the Barbary
states in Tripoli and Algeria,

00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:06.543
conflict with Native American tribes.

00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:08.717
All of these are approved by congress

00:08:08.717 --> 00:08:10.497
although without formal declarations.

00:08:10.497 --> 00:08:12.364
In the modern era though,
things have really changed

00:08:12.364 --> 00:08:14.486
and presidents have used military force

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:17.014
without expressed consent from congress.

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:19.653
On lots of occasions,
the Korean War, Libya,

00:08:19.653 --> 00:08:22.486
Grenada, Lebanon, Panama, Noriega,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.080
all of these are cases where the president

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.832
has used this force without
congressional authorization.

00:08:29.832 --> 00:08:32.216
And we haven't had a
formal declaration of war

00:08:32.216 --> 00:08:34.457
since World War II.

00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:36.895
- [Host] I mean, that
statement I think is worth

00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:39.014
writing down that's why I--
(laughs)

00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:41.414
- [Jeffrey] Okay, Let's write it down.

00:08:41.414 --> 00:08:43.308
- [Host] Since World War II.

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:45.998
I mean, when I, when you say that

00:08:45.998 --> 00:08:47.448
to me it's like well, what's,

00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:49.128
it kind of feels like well,

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:50.621
we've clearly had what you and I

00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:52.540
would consider wars since World War II,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.959
Korea, Vietnam War, obviously post 9/11

00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:57.252
what happened in Afghanistan.

00:08:57.252 --> 00:09:00.714
We have the Iraq war, actually
we have both the Iraq wars.

00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:02.846
And you've had all
sorts of military action

00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:04.535
whether we're talking about drone strikes

00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:08.045
or kind of very surgical interventions

00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:11.067
and all of those were done without

00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:13.447
a formal declaration of war by congress.

00:09:13.447 --> 00:09:14.962
So, to what degree does
this even matter anymore?

00:09:14.962 --> 00:09:17.306
It seems like in modern times,

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:20.970
presidents are able to do what
they need to do militarily.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.445
- [Jeffrey] Well, that seems right.

00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:24.321
Now, that's not to say
congress hasn't acted.

00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:25.659
Many of the wars we've talked about

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:28.422
have had informal statutory authorization

00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:30.712
including most famously recently,

00:09:30.712 --> 00:09:34.261
the authorization of the use
of military force after 9/11

00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:35.980
which was said to authorize

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.800
a lot of what happened after 9/11.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.840
And it's now contested
whether that continues

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.473
to authorize the war not against Al-Qaeda

00:09:42.473 --> 00:09:43.958
which it was originally passed for,

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.931
but also against ISIS.

00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:47.659
But it certainly seems to be the case

00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:49.398
that formal declarations of war

00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:51.294
have now been replaced with these more

00:09:51.294 --> 00:09:53.889
informal authorizations

00:09:53.889 --> 00:09:57.269
or even with presidential
unilateral action.

00:09:57.269 --> 00:10:00.103
- [Host] And I guess, maybe
one argument there is that

00:10:00.103 --> 00:10:01.268
in some of these wars,

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:04.058
it gives more flexibility to
the president to be flexible

00:10:04.058 --> 00:10:05.808
and there might not even be a state

00:10:05.808 --> 00:10:07.688
to declare war against.

00:10:07.688 --> 00:10:09.696
- [Jeffrey] That's true
although there have been

00:10:09.696 --> 00:10:12.011
a bunch of these wars where
there are clear states.

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:14.594
Korea, Libya, Grenada, Lebanon.

00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:19.354
More literalist conceptions
of the president say

00:10:19.354 --> 00:10:20.906
the president could have
and should have asked

00:10:20.906 --> 00:10:22.785
for formal declarations of war,

00:10:22.785 --> 00:10:26.318
but that's not the way that
the modern executive want.

00:10:26.318 --> 00:10:27.151
- [Host] Fascinating.

00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:28.076
Well, thanks so much Jeffrey.

00:10:28.076 --> 00:10:29.627
This is really informative.

00:10:29.627 --> 00:10:32.877
- [Jeffrey] Thanks. A pleasure to talk.
