10 Superheroes You Didnâ€™t Know were Stolen
When comic book writers create superheroes,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.590
they can draw inspiration from all kinds of
sources.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.139
They can be based on real people - perhaps
someone the writers know personally or a famous

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.840
person they admire - and they can be based
on other fictional characters, but sometimes

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.450
they are quite clearly blatant rip-offs of
other comic book characters.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.250
Marvel and DC may be bitter rivals, but that
hasn't stopped them from taking inspiration

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.269
from each other on numerous occasions when
it comes to character creation - in some cases,

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.730
it's to the extent that you could even say
they stole from each other.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.100
Whether it's a character's name, their appearance,
or their general concept or schtick, a number

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.839
of Marvel and DC characters were obviously
copied - and we're going to run through a

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:42.839
few of them now.

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.080
Here are ten superheroes you didn't know were
stolen.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.470
Wolverine
In most of these cases, the stolen characters

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.500
are either nowhere near as popular as the
characters they were based on, or, at best,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.170
they have merely equalled the popularity of
their templates.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.170
However, in Wolverine's case, he has surpassed
the character he was based on by a large margin.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.280
That character was Timber Wolf - a DC character
who first appeared in 1964, ten years before

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.320
Wolverine - and the similarities between the
pair are staggering.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.170
For starters, they look almost identical,
but the fact that they were both experimented

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.470
on and both have similar powers confirms that
Wolverine was stolen by Marvel.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.640
Both characters have superhuman reflexes,
enhanced senses, a regenerative healing factor,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.140
claws and super strength, and both are prone
to violent outbursts.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.640
Who knew the most famous X-Man was ripped-off
from DC?!

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.290
Hawkeye
Hawkeye is the first character on this list

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.390
to prove that character stealing is a two-way
thing between Marvel and DC.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.800
Having first appeared in 1964, he arrived
a massive 23 years after Green Arrow and is

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120
blatantly modelled on his DC counterpart.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.280
They're both ordinary humans fighting alongside
gods and metahumans, they both lost their

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.440
parents at a young age, Green Arrow has a
close relationship with Black Canary and Hawkeye

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.750
is close to Black Widow and, of course, there's
the most obvious similarity in that they're

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.100
both incredibly skilled with a bow and arrow.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.761
Cyborg
Cyborg AKA Victor Stone is a DC character

00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:07.070
and a prominent member of the Justice League
and Teen Titans.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.470
He first appeared in 1980 and was quite obviously
copied from a Marvel concept that first hit

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.670
comic books in 1974.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.299
That Marvel concept is Deathlok - the name
of several characters who had died and been

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.180
reanimated using cybernetic technology, which
is exactly what happened with Stone.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.909
Although the Deathlok title has been bestowed
on a number of characters, what they all have

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.379
in common with Stone is a constant struggle
to retain their humanity and a difficulty

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.999
in coming to terms with being part-machine.

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:32.999
Swamp Thing
DC's Swamp Thing is probably the most obvious

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:33.999
rip-off of a Marvel character - that character
being Man-Thing.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:34.999
Their names are obviously similar, they look
the same as each other and their powers and

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:35.999
back-stories are almost identical.

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:36.999
It should come as no surprise, then, that
Swamp Thing's creator, Len Wein, was living

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:37.999
with Man-Thing's co-creator, Gerry Conway,
at the time of the latter's creation.

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:38.999
Man-Thing first appeared on panel in May of
1971 and then, two months later in July, Swamp

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:39.999
Thing emerged.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:40.999
Wein had clearly and shamelessly stolen the
idea from his housemate.

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:41.999
Aquaman
When it comes to underwater superheroes, there's

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:42.999
nobody more well-known than DC's Aquaman.

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:43.999
Although he's often unfairly the butt of jokes,
he's also an undeniably iconic character and

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:44.999
a founding member of the Justice League of
America - but he was actually a stolen idea,

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:45.999
inspired by Marvel's Namor the Sub-Mariner.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:46.999
The two character's personalities couldn't
be more different, but their origins are near-identical.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:47.999
They're both Atlantean royalty and were both
born when sea-dwelling princesses liaised

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:48.999
with human men.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:49.999
And with Namor first appearing in 1939 - a
full two years before Aquaman - it's obvious

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:50.999
that it was Marvel's idea being stolen.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:51.999
Sentry
There are so many Superman analogue characters

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:52.999
in comic books that we could easily fill a
video with them, but one of the most blindingly

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:53.999
obvious examples is undoubtedly Marvel's Sentry.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:54.999
The man known as Robert Reynolds does have
some powers that differentiate him from the

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:55.999
Man of Steel, but his powerset is more or
less the same as Superman's; he possesses

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:56.999
super-strength, super-speed, incredible durability
and flight.

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:58.950
But Superman came 62 years before Sentry,
way back in 1938, and when you also bear in

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.579
mind that the latter wears a tight-fitting
costume with a cape and has an "S" on his

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.340
chest, the fact that he was a stolen idea
becomes all the more blatant.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.219
Rocket Red
While there's no concrete evidence to suggest

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.780
that the idea for Rocket Red was stolen from
Marvel by DC, the comparisons with a certain

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.480
well-known character are obvious.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.950
Iron Man first appeared back in 1963 and Rocket
Red didn't surface for another 24 years, and

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.970
while Tony Stark is an American billionaire
and Dmitri Pushkin is a kind-hearted Russian

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.919
with a taste for American culture, the red-powered
armour worn by the latter was obviously copied

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:32.999
from that of Iron Man.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.680
Then, when you consider the fact that Iron
Man is a member of the Avengers and Rocket

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.709
Red fought with DC's counterparts - the Justice
League - you can clearly see where the influence

00:03:40.709 --> 00:04:18.370
for the character came from.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.840
Power Princess
Power Princess - also known as Zarda - is

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.139
Marvel's belated answer to Wonder Woman, and
the idea for the character was clearly stolen

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.639
from DC's iconic Amazonian warrior (albeit
41 years after Wonder Woman first appeared

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.210
back in 1941).

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.830
Like Wonder Woman, Zarda was raised on an
isolated and hidden island called Utopia Isle

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.139
and is a Greek Goddess.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.650
She also became the first emissary to Earth,
fought in World War II and became romantically

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.400
involved with the first guy she met outside
of her home island - just like her DC counterpart.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.490
Not only that, but their powers and abilities
are strikingly similar, all of which is clear

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:26.800
evidence that Marvel liked what they saw with
Wonder Woman and stole 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.990
the idea.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.410
Bumblebee
DC's Bumblebee is the alter-ego of the company's

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.199
first African American supheroine, Karen Beecher-Duncan.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.680
Having first appeared as Beecher-Duncan in
1976 - and a year later in her super-powered

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.139
form - the character's concept is clearly
stolen from Marvel's Wasp, who predates her

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.729
by thirteen years.

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.900
Both characters are tiny in size but display
an increase in strength in that form - although

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.819
Wasp can regrow to normal size and Bumblebee
can't - and there are undoubtedly parallels

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.710
in their physical appearances and their more
intricate powers and abilities, such as the

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.860
powerful concussive blasts that each character
can expel.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.479
Deadpool
After starring in a fantastic 2016 movie,

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.789
Deadpool is the man of the moment in the superhero
world - but Marvel's Merc with a Mouth was

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.740
actually quite clearly ripped-off from a DC
character.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.069
Deathstroke AKA Slade Wilson first appeared
in 1980, while Deadpool - whose real name,

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:28.189
Wade Wilson, is very similar to his DC counterpart's
- didn't appear until eleven years later.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.740
Both characters are morally ambiguous anti-heroes
and mercenaries, both gained their healing

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.969
abilities through experiments, they both have
severe disfigurements that prompt them to

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:41.759
wear extremely similar-looking costumes, and
both regularly use guns, explosives and bladed

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:51.340
weapons - although Deadpool is undoubtedly
a hell of a lot crazier than Deathstroke!

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.840
