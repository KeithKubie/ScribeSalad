00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.010
Anna Freud was the daughter of the founder
of Psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.620
She was born in Vienna in 1895 – when her
father’s radical theories of sex and the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.700
mind were starting to make him famous across
Europe. She became a school teacher and then

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.500
a psychoanalyst – and pioneered the treatment
of children, establishing clinics and nurseries

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.160
for children who were war victims, survivors
of the holocaust or just generally troubled

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.620
by their lives.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.210
Perhaps most importantly for us, she is our
finest guide to what we call

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.809
DEFENCE MECHANISMS

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.800
which she described best in her 1936 book
The Ego and Mechanisms of Defence.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.250
The book laid out for the first time the core
idea that we instinctively try to protect

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.550
our ‘ego’ (our acceptable picture of who
we are) with a variety of defences.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.829
The problem is that in the act of defending
ourselves against pain in the immediate term,

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.649
we harm our longer-term chances of dealing
with reality and therefore of developing and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.649
maturing as a result.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.970
Anna Freud highlighted ten key types of defence
mechanisms.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.450
Firstly, Denial

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.240
Denial is when we don’t admit there is a
problem. We think things like: ‘I enjoy

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.429
drinking very much and I sometimes get quite
bad hangovers. But I can handle it.’

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.789
If other people try to get us to face up to the
problem, we tend to react very badly. The

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.659
immediate survival mechanism – the short
term instinct to feel alright about oneself

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.619
– means refusing to recognise our need for
change.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.020
Projection

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.240
In projection, you attribute a bad feeling
you have in someone else. For example, you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.149
might develop the impression that your partner
is going to be extremely critical if you don’t

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.829
make more money this year than last. But in
reality they may be quite understanding and

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.590
sympathetic. The harsh, bitter thoughts are
not in your partner. They are in you – and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.479
they came from, let’s say, your mother.
But you have given the negative feelings,

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.039
which you don’t want to recognise in yourself,
to someone else. That’s projection.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800
Turning against the self

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.189
This is when we think badly of ourselves as
a way of escaping from an even worse thought:

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.479
that someone we hope loves us doesn’t actually.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.030
Anna Freud learnt that children do this a
lot. A child abused by a parent will typically

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.099
seek refuge in a thought which, though grim,
is less awful than the alternatives. He or

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.110
she will think: I must be bad and worthless
– that’s why my parent is behaving this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.870
way towards me. So, really – the thought
goes – I still have a good parent.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.090
It’s painful to think we’re bad and worthless,
of course – but for a fragile child especially,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.700
it can feel less catastrophic than the alternative:
thinking we’re in the hands of a parent

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.740
who doesn’t care.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.489
Sublimation.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.090
We sublimate when we redirect unacceptable
thoughts or emotions - often about sex or

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.510
violence - into ‘higher’ and finer channels.
Many artists and especially musicians have

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.400
used sublimation to turn negative life experiences like - drug addiction, social ills, family problems, and

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.280
so on—into popular and resonant works of
art. Sublimation is still a defence mechanism,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.360
but it’s one of the very best.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.650
Regression

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.159
Anna Freud believed that when things become
tough, we often regress to a way of behaving

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.519
that we practiced when we were a younger.
In particular, we do what children typically

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.090
do, which is evade responsibility. It is - for
the child - always someone else’s fault,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.790
usually the parents - and they should put
it right.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.609
IN regression, we adopt an infantile sense
of our own purity and innocence: the rest

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.989
of the world is to blame. They should sort
it out. For Anna Freud, it’s normal for

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.310
many otherwise perfectly sane adults to go
through regressive moments when under pressure.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.930
It only beco   mes a problem when it goes on
too long.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.910
Rationalisation.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.459
Rationalisation is a smart sounding excuse

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.349
for our actions (or what happens to us). But
it’s carefully tailored to get the conclusion

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.430
we feel we need: that we are innocent, nice,
worthy. After being rejected for a job, for

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.040
example, the defensive rationaliser will say:
“it was a boring company” or “I never

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.280
wanted the job anyway”.
They may have very much desired the job,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.829
but it can be agonising and deeply humiliating
to admit this to the ego.

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.089
Intellectualisation

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.549
Intellectualisation is similar. The scarring

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.100
sense of loss, guilt, betrayal and anger on
breaking up with a partner might be neutralised

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.570
by thinking about the history of the late
Roman Empire or the government’s plan to

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.310
raise interest rates. Many intellectuals are
not merely thinking a lot. They are also guilty

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.850
of ‘intellectualisation’; which means making sure their researches keep a range of more pertinent

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.400
issues at bay.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.120
Reaction formation

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.970
Reaction formation involves doing the opposite
of our initial, unacceptable feelings. Someone

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.350
who has a strong interest in the sexuality
of teenagers may, for instance, join a religion

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.380
with a particular emphasis on abstinence among
the young.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.760
We are often guilty of reaction formation
in childhood. When we are embarrassed about

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.240
being attracted to a classmate, we might be
mean or aggressive towards them, instead of

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.540
admitting that we like them.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.920
Displacement

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.330
Displacement is the redirection of a (usually
aggressive) desire to a substitute recipient,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.010
usually someone who is less threatening or
easier to blame. So a classic case is someone

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.500
who may feel threatened by their boss, comes home and starts shouting at their partner.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.520
Fantasy

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.740
Fantasy avoids problems by imagining them

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.860
away or disassociating oneself from reality—from
daydreaming to reading literature to looking

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.830
at porn. We use these moments to transport
ourselves from the threatening world to find

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.500
comfort elsewhere.
***

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.520
Anna Freud’s tone when writing about defence
mechanisms is tender and generous.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.950
She knows these defences are natural, but
she also observes how many difficulties they

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.420
bring in their wake. They hold back our careers,
are boring for others and hurt those who love us.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.620
Freud argued that most of us employ at least

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.900
5 of her 10 defence mechanisms every day - without
being in any way aware of it.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.850
She wrote her great book as a way of helping
us see a little better what we’re doing,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.260
in the hope that we would, in future, be a
little more mature and a little less - as

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.840
we still say in unknowing tribute to her

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.960
defensive towards those around us.
