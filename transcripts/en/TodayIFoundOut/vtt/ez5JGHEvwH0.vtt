00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.430
While there are certainly exceptions, as we’ll
get into shortly, according to the majority

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.560
of firsthand accounts from people who’ve
been shot we could find, having a hunk of

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.939
searing hot metal traveling around Mach 1
tear through part of your body doesn’t really

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.890
hurt much… at first.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.320
For example, consider this account from one
Deborah Cotton who was struck by a bullet

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.230
during a Mother’s Day parade in 2013- “When
the bullet hit me, surprisingly it didn’t

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.230
hurt at all.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.570
Not one bit, which shocked me.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.270
I remember thinking, ‘That felt like someone
just chucked a small pebble at me.’”

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.670
In Deborah’s case, the bullet hit her in
the side around her hip and traveled up, finally

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.310
stopping around her rib cage on her left side.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.559
She went on to have 36 surgeries, losing her
colon, gallbladder, one kidney, part of her

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.370
pancreas, two-thirds of her stomach, and the
duodenum, which, we’re not going to lie,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.370
we had to look up.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.460
Turns out that’s the initial bit of small
intestine directly connected to the stomach.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.160
**The More You Know**

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.470
Interestingly, despite the severe damage to
her body, which nearly cost her her life later

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.180
at the hospital, she states,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.969
After about 90 seconds passed, I realized,
‘Hmm…

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.610
I may not be dying after all.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.610
I wonder if…

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.920
God forbid, am I paralyzed?’

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.270
I wiggled my toes, then my ankles; it was
all good.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.499
So I wasn’t dying, and I wasn’t paralyzed…

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.790
There still was no sharp or shooting pain,
nothing like what you think you’ll feel

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.560
when a metal object rips through your body…

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.490
I was later told that the 9mm used in the
shooting accounted for the lack of initial

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.450
pain: The bullets were the kind that stay
intact, rather than the kind that explode

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.329
into flesh-tearing shrapnel.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.289
If you suspect Deborah Cotton might just be
a bit of a badass to shrug off having her

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.029
insides eviscerated, consider this account
from one Ryan Jarcy, a guy who was attempting

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:00.840
to dial 911 to report he’d just been robbed
only to have his shotgun slip from his hand

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630
as he was dialing the number.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.490
When he reflexively attempted to grab it,
he accidentally pulled the trigger, shooting

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.069
himself in the leg, more or less making it
look like, to quote him, “a pile of Alpo

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.480
dog food smushed up against what used to be
just below my knee”.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.069
He goes on:

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.739
My brain didn’t actually register what had
happened until a few seconds later.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.040
My shin bone was sticking out about 2 to 3
inches from the ragged end of my stump, but

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.610
I felt nothing, nor did I notice it…

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.320
I attempted to stand, and then felt it.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.950
I yelped in pain, fell flat on my face, and
made the foolish decision to try standing

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.950
up once more.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.690
The entire weight of my body was now on that
bone.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.710
And that bone, weakened by 96 tiny lead pellets
traveling at twice the speed of sound, didn’t

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.710
hold up very long.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.160
It snapped like a piece of blood-soaked chalk,
jamming the shards into my newly opened calf

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.250
muscle and feeling, oh, let’s go with “uncomfortable”.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.540
(Incidentally, to add insult to life threatening
injury, Mr. Jarcy notes that all of this occurred

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.500
a mere 12 hours after he’d been removed
from his parent’s health insurance coverage

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.170
and he had not gotten any of his own yet,
with the whole thing, including amputation

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.190
of his leg, costing him a little over $60,000.)

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.710
So, for many, there is little pain at first.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.900
But what about other sensations?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.330
While various people report everything from
a bee-sting sensation to getting hit with

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.240
a baseball bat, minus the pain, one nearly
universal report is of extreme and persistent

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.410
burning sensation in the initial aftermath,
as redditor Tia_Jamon states:

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.610
I’m not one of those, ‘I didn’t even
realize I was shot’ people, though I can

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.050
definitely understand where they’re coming
from.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.740
The very first thing I felt can only be described
as a sudden impact of no sensation.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.840
I felt numbness wash over the area.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.160
If I had not realized I was about to be shot
shortly before I was, I could see how I could

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.290
have easily have been too distracted to notice
this immediate response.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.010
That feeling then gave way to a horrible burning
sensation.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.920
It’s a very ‘hot’ pain.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.550
It feels the way a very flushed face or a
blister feels, but intense and painful.”

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.280
Going back to Deborah Cotton she corroborates
this, stating, “As I continued to take inventory

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.310
of my body and soul, that burning sensation
in my stomach where the bullet traveled began

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.650
to take over my focus.”

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.370
Yet another account relates, “It’s a bit
of [a] burning sensation mainly…

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.519
Best way I can describe it is that it feels
like being continuously poked as if someone

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.009
is holding multiple sharp pricks to you and
pushing in, but not stabbing.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:26.009
”

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.090
From there the similarities in accounts of
what it’s like to get shot vary much more

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.319
significantly, depending on location of injury.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:36.389
For some, pain comes quickly after the initial
shock wears of, sometimes extremely quickly.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.969
For example, in the case of a lawyer who got
shot in the knee, he reported almost no blood,

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.940
but “for me at least, the ‘it doesn’t
hurt because of the shock’ part lasted about

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.220
2 seconds.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.039
Then, immense pain that I can’t even begin
to compare to anything else.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.710
By the time I got some morphine, I was drenched
in sweat and writhing uncontrollably from

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.199
the pain, and I normally have a high pain
tolerance.”

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.780
Others simply report waves of general achenes
growing to an extreme level, while in a minority

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.060
of cases, some don’t note much of any real
pain after.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.300
As one man shot in the calf by a .22 jokes,
“Honestly, it didn’t hurt that bad.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.770
Hopefully, being shot by a smaller caliber
has helped me build my immunity up towards

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.419
larger bullets.”

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.479
One side note here is what getting shot in
the head feels like.

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.350
It turns out plenty of people actually survive
this type of wound, with those who are still

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.629
quite cognoscente of the incident universally
reporting extreme headache like symptoms.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.409
For example, one Michael Moylan actually didn’t
even know he’d been shot.

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.870
Turns out his wife had “accidentally”
shot him in the head while he slept…

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.759
The result was simply him waking up and noting
he had a severe headache and asking his wife,

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.190
April, to drive him to the hospital, which
she did.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.349
It was only after a nurse looked him over
that she informed him he’d been shot in

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.919
the head, at which point April bolted…

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.620
What’s more interesting than the headache
symptoms, though, is something else universally

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.590
reported in the handful of accounts of head
shot survivors we reviewed.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.740
They all report an accompanying ringing.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.930
As Gary Melius, who was shot in the head and
also likewise didn’t realize what had happened

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.719
until at the hospital, states “there was
a ringing inside of my head.

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.539
It was a noise that I’ll never forget.

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.970
Never heard it before, and never heard it
since.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.639
It was like being in a can, I guess.

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.059
Just so loud.”

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:15.499
Joab Hodge further states of his experience
getting shot in the head, “their is this

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:20.400
very loud buzzing, almost a sort of ringing
type sound as to when it happens.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.779
Surprisingly it is very loud, like two bees
inside of your ears, but sounds more like

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:27.960
how your ears would normally ring, just uncomfortably
loud.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.979
The initial ‘ping’ as I call it, can be
heard before the ringing commences, like someone

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.879
hitting metal on metal, but it’s high-pitched.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:40.150
After that, very loud and scary ringing commences,
but no pain is registered at that moment.”

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.940
As for the long term aftermath of getting
shot in general, this varies considerably,

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.499
again based on the extent and location of
the damage, though victims often reported

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.189
the recovery and rehab is worse than the initial
pain of getting shot.

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.539
Going back to the case of the aforementioned
lawyer shot in the knee, he states, “What

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.199
the movies seem to miss most though is the
long term recovery.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.610
It was months of continuous pain afterward.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.110
Oxy barely took the edge off.”

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.369
More than potential long term chronic pain
and the like, perhaps unsurprisingly for people

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:12.150
who endured such physical trauma and in many
cases near loss of life, the psychological

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.020
side of being shot is also occasionally noted
as being something else that makes the whole

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.490
experience awful.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.789
As stated by Deborah Cotton,

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:22.289
The impact of the shooting on my mental health,
though, showed up in surprising ways.

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.719
I endured bouts of PTSD during the first few
months after the shooting.

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:31.030
Once home, I began counseling sessions with
two psychologists, both PTSD experts.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.300
For a while, I was terrified of being in a
car going over 35mph, and I’m not exactly

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.949
sure why, since driving doesn’t seem to
have anything in common with guns…but eventually

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:42.449
the fear faded away.

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.830
So there you have it, while specific accounts
of what it’s like to be shot vary wildly,

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.630
in the general case it would seem you can
expect little in the way of initial pain,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.759
or even much sense that you may have just
been mortally wounded, followed by an onset

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:00.770
of extreme burning, followed by some measure
of general pain, followed by chronic pain

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.719
throughout recovery and maybe beyond, and
potentially a little side of psychological

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.680
trauma just for fun.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:35.180
That is, if you simply don’t die in the
first place.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:09:24.760
Good times…
