Challenges and we thought it might be a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
Challenges and we thought it might be a
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.610
Challenges and we thought it might be a
nice way to start by thinking about what

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
nice way to start by thinking about what
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.620
nice way to start by thinking about what
we mean by the phrase Grand Challenges

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630
we mean by the phrase Grand Challenges
 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.720
we mean by the phrase Grand Challenges
and I suspect we have rather different

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
and I suspect we have rather different
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.310
and I suspect we have rather different
views on that so I'm going to ask the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
views on that so I'm going to ask the
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.080
views on that so I'm going to ask the
panelists this would you start

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
panelists this would you start
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.190

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
what we can think of this mini Grand
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.630
what we can think of this mini Grand
Challenges but I started thinking well

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640
Challenges but I started thinking well
 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.120
Challenges but I started thinking well
well what really brings all of those

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130
well what really brings all of those
 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.710
well what really brings all of those
together what is the really sort of

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720
together what is the really sort of
 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.610
together what is the really sort of
super grand challenge that is

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620
super grand challenge that is
 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.320
super grand challenge that is
encapsulated by the components that she

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330
encapsulated by the components that she
 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.870
encapsulated by the components that she
she outlined and and I'm starting to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
she outlined and and I'm starting to
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.420
she outlined and and I'm starting to
think this is something that's risen out

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
think this is something that's risen out
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.940
think this is something that's risen out
of my research which lint lent itself

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
of my research which lint lent itself
 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.830
of my research which lint lent itself
more and more to the question of how do

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
more and more to the question of how do
 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.830
more and more to the question of how do
we as individuals and then more and more

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840
we as individuals and then more and more
 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.870
we as individuals and then more and more
societies how do we thrive and I so I

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880
societies how do we thrive and I so I
 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.130
societies how do we thrive and I so I
think really our grand challenge is

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140
think really our grand challenge is
 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.420
think really our grand challenge is
bringing to not just lucky us here but

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430
bringing to not just lucky us here but
 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.630
bringing to not just lucky us here but
the much greater world of people who are

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640
the much greater world of people who are
 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.630
the much greater world of people who are
often very impoverished very threatened

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640
often very impoverished very threatened
 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.569

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.970
getting the sort of lifting all of the
many parts of humanity up to the best

interesting example maybe we can take
 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.960
interesting example maybe we can take
off from that and say how do we use

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970
off from that and say how do we use
 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.200

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190
and regional and government way in what
 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.930
and regional and government way in what
can be brought to humanity by all of the

can be brought to humanity by all of the
 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.970
can be brought to humanity by all of the
technological and scientific advances

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980
technological and scientific advances
 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.550
technological and scientific advances
that we have thank you what a wonderful

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560
that we have thank you what a wonderful
 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.860
that we have thank you what a wonderful
ambitious all-embracing vision of

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870
ambitious all-embracing vision of
 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.740
ambitious all-embracing vision of
challenges thank you David so given the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750
challenges thank you David so given the
 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.420
challenges thank you David so given the
title of this panel was challenges I was

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430
title of this panel was challenges I was
 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.260
title of this panel was challenges I was
thinking about what are challenges it

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270
thinking about what are challenges it
 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.960
thinking about what are challenges it
seemed to me that we should distinguish

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970
seemed to me that we should distinguish
 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.750
seemed to me that we should distinguish
between at least between two or three

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760
between at least between two or three
 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.110
between at least between two or three
kinds of challenges one is an area like

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120
kinds of challenges one is an area like
 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.870
kinds of challenges one is an area like
global warming or the environment where

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880
global warming or the environment where
 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.750
global warming or the environment where
the science has been my opinion been

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760
the science has been my opinion been
 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.230
the science has been my opinion been
done and it's conclusive the challenge

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240
done and it's conclusive the challenge
 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.510
done and it's conclusive the challenge
is open and evident and the problem is

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520
is open and evident and the problem is
 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.650
is open and evident and the problem is
political but then there are challenges

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660
political but then there are challenges
 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.650
political but then there are challenges
that we're only beginning to realize are

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660
that we're only beginning to realize are
 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.320
that we're only beginning to realize are
coming and we can't even define them

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330
coming and we can't even define them
 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.590
coming and we can't even define them
very precisely and certainly although

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600
very precisely and certainly although
 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.010
very precisely and certainly although
science might provide some answers not

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020
science might provide some answers not
 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.690
science might provide some answers not
even clear what the question is for

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700
even clear what the question is for
 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.490
even clear what the question is for
example the information revolution

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500
example the information revolution
 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.990
example the information revolution
robotics and the the complete change

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000
robotics and the the complete change
 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.870
robotics and the the complete change
that that portends for the economy and

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880
that that portends for the economy and
 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.980
that that portends for the economy and
its effect on society or the incredible

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990
its effect on society or the incredible
 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.420
its effect on society or the incredible
advances in medicine and genetics and

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430
advances in medicine and genetics and
 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.190
advances in medicine and genetics and
which are going to affect society and

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200
which are going to affect society and
 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.980
which are going to affect society and
all of us in ways which I'm not I'm

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990
all of us in ways which I'm not I'm
 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.720
all of us in ways which I'm not I'm
certainly going to be challenging but

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730
certainly going to be challenging but
 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.040
certainly going to be challenging but
it's hard to enunciate

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050
it's hard to enunciate
 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.770
it's hard to enunciate
the challenges are in a sense those are

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780
the challenges are in a sense those are
 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.779
the challenges are in a sense those are
the most interesting challenges the

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789
the most interesting challenges the
 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.260
the most interesting challenges the
others are decided and clear we know how

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270
others are decided and clear we know how
 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.390
others are decided and clear we know how
to solve many of those challenges and

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400
to solve many of those challenges and
 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.640
to solve many of those challenges and
it's truly an issue of politics

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650
it's truly an issue of politics
 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.909
it's truly an issue of politics
economics money and power and then

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919
economics money and power and then
 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.249
economics money and power and then
finally there's the area in which many

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259
finally there's the area in which many
 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.309
finally there's the area in which many
of us work which is the most challenging

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319
of us work which is the most challenging
 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.589
of us work which is the most challenging
and the most exciting which are

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599
and the most exciting which are
 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.140
and the most exciting which are
scientific challenges and those are not

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150
scientific challenges and those are not
 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.529
scientific challenges and those are not
posed by us or by society but by nature

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539
 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.330
beautifully said thank you the challenge

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340
beautifully said thank you the challenge
 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.170
beautifully said thank you the challenge

please well briefly I'm biased in

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810
please well briefly I'm biased in
 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.330
please well briefly I'm biased in
answering this question about challenges

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340
answering this question about challenges
 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.990
answering this question about challenges
because I did participate must have been

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000
because I did participate must have been
 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.839
because I did participate must have been
almost a decade ago in what we thought

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:15.849
almost a decade ago in what we thought
 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:18.600
almost a decade ago in what we thought
was the first Grand Challenge sort of

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610
was the first Grand Challenge sort of
 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.620
was the first Grand Challenge sort of
team which was organized by the National

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630
team which was organized by the National
 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.749
team which was organized by the National
Academy of Engineering in the u.s. I

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759
Academy of Engineering in the u.s. I
 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.730
Academy of Engineering in the u.s. I
remember we met in California and so on

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740
remember we met in California and so on
 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.670
remember we met in California and so on
above it was a very multidisciplinary

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680
above it was a very multidisciplinary
 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.610
above it was a very multidisciplinary
group and challenges is what what you

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620
group and challenges is what what you
 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.180
group and challenges is what what you
normally once you can think of for

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.190
normally once you can think of for
 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.980
normally once you can think of for
example connected with climate change

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990
example connected with climate change
 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.420
example connected with climate change
and so on there is an engineering

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.430
and so on there is an engineering
 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.850
and so on there is an engineering
challenge how do we make sure that we

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860
challenge how do we make sure that we
 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.040
challenge how do we make sure that we
can come up with ways to generate energy

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050
can come up with ways to generate energy
 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.070
can come up with ways to generate energy
with sustainable means so that we don't

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080
with sustainable means so that we don't
 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.379
with sustainable means so that we don't
harm the environment that's very much an

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:52.389
harm the environment that's very much an
 

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.350
harm the environment that's very much an
engineering challenge and there there

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360
engineering challenge and there there
 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.050
engineering challenge and there there
has been much advance there another

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.060
has been much advance there another
 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.029
has been much advance there another
challenge what sort of question but

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039
challenge what sort of question but
 

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:01.890
challenge what sort of question but
finally agreed to put it on the table

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:01.900
finally agreed to put it on the table
 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.950
finally agreed to put it on the table
anyhow is how does the human brain work

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960
anyhow is how does the human brain work
 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.950
anyhow is how does the human brain work
ok what is the physics this chemistry

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960
ok what is the physics this chemistry
 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.070
ok what is the physics this chemistry
the biology the science and so these are

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.080
the biology the science and so these are
 

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.559
the biology the science and so these are
sort of engineering or scientific

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:13.569
sort of engineering or scientific
 

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:15.839
sort of engineering or scientific
challenges but then I thought of that

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:15.849
challenges but then I thought of that
 

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:18.959
challenges but then I thought of that
was no longer part of our job but some

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:18.969
was no longer part of our job but some
 

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:21.139
was no longer part of our job but some
of the big challenges that society has

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:21.149
of the big challenges that society has
 

00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:24.310
of the big challenges that society has
are not just science or engineering

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:24.320
are not just science or engineering
 

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.450
are not just science or engineering
they are social and economic as well and

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.460
they are social and economic as well and
 

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.850
they are social and economic as well and
one I can simply put here as an example

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:30.860
one I can simply put here as an example
 

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.159
one I can simply put here as an example
we could discuss it in much more detail

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:33.169
we could discuss it in much more detail
 

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.000
we could discuss it in much more detail
is how do we improve education how do we

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.010
is how do we improve education how do we
 

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.159
is how do we improve education how do we
educate the masses because clearly many

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:39.169
educate the masses because clearly many
 

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.200
educate the masses because clearly many
of the difficulties that we have is

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.210
of the difficulties that we have is
 

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.010
of the difficulties that we have is
because we don't have the the citizens

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.020
because we don't have the the citizens
 

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.900
because we don't have the the citizens
at the level of the what we call a

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:46.910
at the level of the what we call a
 

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.690
at the level of the what we call a
democracy that we would like to have and

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:49.700
democracy that we would like to have and
 

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.180
democracy that we would like to have and
much has been learned about the

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.190
much has been learned about the
 

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.460
much has been learned about the
application we know much more

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:53.470
application we know much more
 

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.540
application we know much more
scientifically about how people learn

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:55.550
scientifically about how people learn
 

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.080
scientifically about how people learn
and so basically the technical and

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.090
and so basically the technical and
 

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.510
and so basically the technical and
scientific components are reasonably

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:01.520
scientific components are reasonably
 

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.370
scientific components are reasonably
well understood so the big challenge is

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:03.380
well understood so the big challenge is
 

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.550
well understood so the big challenge is
social how do we manage to make sure

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560
social how do we manage to make sure
 

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.610
social how do we manage to make sure
that this new much better ways to learn

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:09.620
that this new much better ways to learn
 

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.970
that this new much better ways to learn
to teach and so on are actually

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:11.980
to teach and so on are actually
 

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.400
to teach and so on are actually
implemented because the sort of the

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.410
implemented because the sort of the
 

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.590
implemented because the sort of the
culture of teaching beginning in

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600
culture of teaching beginning in
 

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.120
culture of teaching beginning in
elementary school high school and so

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.130
elementary school high school and so
 

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.810
elementary school high school and so
it's very difficult to change so I'm

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:22.820
it's very difficult to change so I'm
 

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.990
it's very difficult to change so I'm
just labeling the different components

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000
just labeling the different components
 

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.570
just labeling the different components
and again to summarize I believe it's

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:28.580
and again to summarize I believe it's
 

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.060
and again to summarize I believe it's
more the social challenges that are the

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.070
more the social challenges that are the
 

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.450
more the social challenges that are the
ones that we should do something about

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:34.460
ones that we should do something about
 

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.080
ones that we should do something about
it

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.090
it
 

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.640
it
about them because they have huge

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:36.650
about them because they have huge
 

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.090
about them because they have huge
implications for the benefit of society

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:39.100
implications for the benefit of society
 

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.290
implications for the benefit of society
thank you very much indeed I'm beginning

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:41.300
thank you very much indeed I'm beginning
 

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.610
thank you very much indeed I'm beginning
to think that an hour and 15 minutes

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:42.620
to think that an hour and 15 minutes
 

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:49.360
to think that an hour and 15 minutes
isn't gonna be enough so I you know

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.370
isn't gonna be enough so I you know
 

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.000
isn't gonna be enough so I you know
couldn't agree more with the rest of the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.010
couldn't agree more with the rest of the
 

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.190
couldn't agree more with the rest of the
panelists and so I think I'm going to

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200
panelists and so I think I'm going to
 

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.040
panelists and so I think I'm going to
narrow in on a few things so I agree

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.050
narrow in on a few things so I agree
 

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.510
narrow in on a few things so I agree
with you Mario that educating the public

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:01.520
with you Mario that educating the public
 

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.430
with you Mario that educating the public
at some level that students of course

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440
at some level that students of course
 

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.360
at some level that students of course
are part of the public that is one of

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.370
are part of the public that is one of
 

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.860
are part of the public that is one of
the big grand challenges and in

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:08.870
the big grand challenges and in
 

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.670
the big grand challenges and in
particular for an appreciation for an

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680
particular for an appreciation for an
 

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.090
particular for an appreciation for an
understanding of the process of science

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.100
understanding of the process of science
 

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.120
understanding of the process of science
and you know there I even bring it up

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.130
and you know there I even bring it up
 

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.760
and you know there I even bring it up
but the whole issue of what fake news is

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:21.770
but the whole issue of what fake news is
 

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.670
but the whole issue of what fake news is
and and the ability to have judgment

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680
and and the ability to have judgment
 

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.130
and and the ability to have judgment
that's built in through an education

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:30.140
that's built in through an education
 

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.400
that's built in through an education
process that gives each person

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:33.410
process that gives each person
 

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.030
process that gives each person
confidence that what they are

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040
confidence that what they are
 

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.030
confidence that what they are
working with is close to the correct

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040
working with is close to the correct
 

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.910
working with is close to the correct
answer so this can only come from really

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920
answer so this can only come from really
 

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.800
answer so this can only come from really
you know understanding how to educate

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:47.810
you know understanding how to educate
 

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.670
you know understanding how to educate
but also providing the opportunities for

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:50.680
but also providing the opportunities for
 

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.410
but also providing the opportunities for
students and the public to engage in

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:53.420
students and the public to engage in
 

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.809
students and the public to engage in
problem solving themselves to gain that

00:10:55.809 --> 00:10:55.819
problem solving themselves to gain that
 

00:10:55.819 --> 00:10:58.780
problem solving themselves to gain that
confidence as they are working so how

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:58.790
confidence as they are working so how
 

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.160
confidence as they are working so how
can we do this at scale and so that's

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.170
can we do this at scale and so that's
 

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.590
can we do this at scale and so that's
one of my big challenges would be how do

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600
one of my big challenges would be how do
 

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.710
one of my big challenges would be how do
we engage the public in the process and

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720
we engage the public in the process and
 

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.930
we engage the public in the process and
understanding of a research and science

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:10.940
understanding of a research and science
 

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.329
understanding of a research and science
and then the other big challenge is

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:13.339
and then the other big challenge is
 

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.910
and then the other big challenge is
something that David alluded to which is

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920
something that David alluded to which is
 

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.420
something that David alluded to which is
the artificial intelligence revolution

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:18.430
the artificial intelligence revolution
 

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.860
the artificial intelligence revolution
so what's the point of learning anything

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:20.870
so what's the point of learning anything
 

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.040
so what's the point of learning anything
if the machines are gonna do it all for

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.050
if the machines are gonna do it all for
 

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.090
if the machines are gonna do it all for
us anyways right so so I think one of

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:28.100
us anyways right so so I think one of
 

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.939
us anyways right so so I think one of
the big challenges is to make it clear

00:11:30.939 --> 00:11:30.949
the big challenges is to make it clear
 

00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:33.370
the big challenges is to make it clear
that there is a complementary

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:33.380
that there is a complementary
 

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.499
that there is a complementary
relationship between the artificial

00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:35.509
relationship between the artificial
 

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:37.449
relationship between the artificial
intelligence that is being developed now

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:37.459
intelligence that is being developed now
 

00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:42.189
intelligence that is being developed now
and the humans that will be taking

00:11:42.189 --> 00:11:42.199
and the humans that will be taking
 

00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:44.949
and the humans that will be taking
advantage of the artificial intelligence

00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959
advantage of the artificial intelligence
 

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:47.860
advantage of the artificial intelligence
so I think there's they're coupled in a

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:47.870
so I think there's they're coupled in a
 

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.590
so I think there's they're coupled in a
sense but they're two distinctly

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600
sense but they're two distinctly
 

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.090
sense but they're two distinctly
different challenges how do we have

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.100
different challenges how do we have
 

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.980
different challenges how do we have
combined human and artificial

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:56.990
combined human and artificial
 

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.170
combined human and artificial
intelligence working in the best way

00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.180
intelligence working in the best way
 

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.199
intelligence working in the best way
possible at the same time how do we

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:02.209
possible at the same time how do we
 

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:05.259
possible at the same time how do we
engage the public in scientific research

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:05.269
engage the public in scientific research
 

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:07.509
engage the public in scientific research
and understanding thank you very much

00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519
and understanding thank you very much
 

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:07.840
and understanding thank you very much
indeed

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:07.850
indeed
 

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.379
indeed
so already I think we've seen an

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:11.389
so already I think we've seen an
 

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:14.590
so already I think we've seen an
enormous d broad interpretation of Grand

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600
enormous d broad interpretation of Grand
 

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.389
enormous d broad interpretation of Grand
Challenges and the mind expanding one

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399
Challenges and the mind expanding one
 

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.439
Challenges and the mind expanding one
and there's an orphan there are many

00:12:17.439 --> 00:12:17.449
and there's an orphan there are many
 

00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:19.300
and there's an orphan there are many
threads to pick up on the reason I

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:19.310
threads to pick up on the reason I
 

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.650
threads to pick up on the reason I
wanted to come to Wendy last is there's

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:20.660
wanted to come to Wendy last is there's
 

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.660
wanted to come to Wendy last is there's
also a very specific way that the work

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:22.670
also a very specific way that the work
 

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.309
also a very specific way that the work
that were the Grand Challenges are used

00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:24.319
that were the Grand Challenges are used
 

00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:26.139
that were the Grand Challenges are used
of course and Wendy is particularly

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:26.149
of course and Wendy is particularly
 

00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:27.759
of course and Wendy is particularly
concerned with that so how do you see

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:27.769
concerned with that so how do you see
 

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:30.730
concerned with that so how do you see
Grand Challenges well and I think this

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:30.740
Grand Challenges well and I think this
 

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.550
Grand Challenges well and I think this
is actually a great introduction to many

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560
is actually a great introduction to many
 

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.490
is actually a great introduction to many
threads that we can pursue in this panel

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:36.500
threads that we can pursue in this panel
 

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.780
threads that we can pursue in this panel
but I think one way to distinguish a few

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:40.790
but I think one way to distinguish a few
 

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.920
but I think one way to distinguish a few
of the things I've heard is there's

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:41.930
of the things I've heard is there's
 

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.439
of the things I've heard is there's
there's both the what are the big grand

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:44.449
there's both the what are the big grand
 

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:46.929
there's both the what are the big grand
challenges that we need to solve and we

00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:46.939
challenges that we need to solve and we
 

00:12:46.939 --> 00:12:49.490
challenges that we need to solve and we
could come up with a really great list

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500
could come up with a really great list
 

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.110
could come up with a really great list
since the University of Minnesota is

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120
since the University of Minnesota is
 

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.480
since the University of Minnesota is
actually now taking on Grand Challenges

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:53.490
actually now taking on Grand Challenges
 

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.630
actually now taking on Grand Challenges
all of you can help solve them but but

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:56.640
all of you can help solve them but but
 

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.270
all of you can help solve them but but
also it's that how do we solve these

00:12:59.270 --> 00:12:59.280
also it's that how do we solve these
 

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.400
also it's that how do we solve these
grand challenges and there's actually a

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:01.410
grand challenges and there's actually a
 

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.740
grand challenges and there's actually a
if there's it's so it's more of a the

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:03.750
if there's it's so it's more of a the
 

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.740
if there's it's so it's more of a the
method and one of the things that I've

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:06.750
method and one of the things that I've
 

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.040
method and one of the things that I've
worked on is is really using at Grand

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.050
worked on is is really using at Grand
 

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.680
worked on is is really using at Grand
Challenges as a tool to be able to solve

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:12.690
Challenges as a tool to be able to solve
 

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.930
Challenges as a tool to be able to solve
big problems and so we're hearing the

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940
big problems and so we're hearing the
 

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.370
big problems and so we're hearing the
term Grand Challenges thrown around

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380
term Grand Challenges thrown around
 

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.530
term Grand Challenges thrown around
quite a bit which is actually quite

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540
quite a bit which is actually quite
 

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.310
quite a bit which is actually quite
exciting but it's it encompasses often

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320
exciting but it's it encompasses often
 

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.290
exciting but it's it encompasses often
many different tools we can issue a

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300
many different tools we can issue a
 

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.080
many different tools we can issue a
Grand Challenge competition that has

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.090
Grand Challenge competition that has
 

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.030
Grand Challenge competition that has
grant funding tied to it where you're

you elevate the focus of attention on a
well-defined problem and it needs to be

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:20.520
well-defined problem and it needs to be
 

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.600
well-defined problem and it needs to be
a well-defined problem how do you

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:22.610
a well-defined problem how do you
 

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:28.520
a well-defined problem how do you
catalyze and and inspire new solvers to

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:28.530
catalyze and and inspire new solvers to
 

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.820

come at solving a problem and sometimes

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:31.830
come at solving a problem and sometimes
 

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.980
come at solving a problem and sometimes
it's actually bringing in people who

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:33.990
it's actually bringing in people who
 

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.360
it's actually bringing in people who
have never thought about the problem

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:35.370
have never thought about the problem
 

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.730
have never thought about the problem
before and have a new perspective that

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.740
before and have a new perspective that
 

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.760
before and have a new perspective that
they can bring to bear to a problem that

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:40.770
they can bring to bear to a problem that
 

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.380
they can bring to bear to a problem that
that comes up with completely new

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:42.390
that comes up with completely new
 

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.980
that comes up with completely new
solutions and then how do you generate

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:44.990
solutions and then how do you generate
 

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.380
solutions and then how do you generate
those ideas and those innovations those

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:48.390
those ideas and those innovations those
 

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.210
those ideas and those innovations those
solutions that that will ultimately

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:50.220
solutions that that will ultimately
 

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.270
solutions that that will ultimately
solve the problem and and so there are

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:53.280
solve the problem and and so there are
 

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.340
solve the problem and and so there are
these are tools that you can use it's an

there I mean one of the things that is
 

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:53.840
there I mean one of the things that is
is great about these challenges is you

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:53.850
is great about these challenges is you
 

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.579
is great about these challenges is you
can put them out there and different

00:16:55.579 --> 00:16:55.589
can put them out there and different
 

00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:57.230
can put them out there and different
challenges appeal to different people so

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240
challenges appeal to different people so
 

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.269
challenges appeal to different people so
we put them out there and you're

00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279
we put them out there and you're
 

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.679
we put them out there and you're
appealing to engineers and entrepreneurs

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:00.689

they might not think beyond the margins
 

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.760
they might not think beyond the margins
and in new ways and that's actually that

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:41.770
and in new ways and that's actually that

so so there is kind of an art to
 

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.330

some extent which is the funding okay

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.030
some extent which is the funding okay
 

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.800
some extent which is the funding okay
but I'm thinking of space exploration

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:43.810
but I'm thinking of space exploration
 

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:48.120
but I'm thinking of space exploration
for example or the big colliders and so

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:48.130
for example or the big colliders and so
 

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.410
for example or the big colliders and so
on so when we're talking about very

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:49.420
on so when we're talking about very
 

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.770
on so when we're talking about very
large investments but for example with

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:52.780
large investments but for example with
 

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.440
large investments but for example with
space exploration there is the question

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:55.450
space exploration there is the question
 

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.440
space exploration there is the question
is there life somewhere else okay so

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:58.450
is there life somewhere else okay so
 

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.050
is there life somewhere else okay so
that's a very big question but it's it's

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:01.060
that's a very big question but it's it's
 

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.020
that's a very big question but it's it's
sort of goes beyond pure science it's

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.030
sort of goes beyond pure science it's
 

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.860
sort of goes beyond pure science it's
more a matter of we as humans are really

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:07.870
more a matter of we as humans are really
 

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.690
more a matter of we as humans are really
only ones here and what have you so this

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:09.700
only ones here and what have you so this
 

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.690
only ones here and what have you so this
is this sort of moves more into the

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:12.700
is this sort of moves more into the
 

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.710
is this sort of moves more into the
philosophy philosophical parts of that

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720
philosophy philosophical parts of that
 

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.690
philosophy philosophical parts of that
but I think it's a point we cannot

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:18.700
but I think it's a point we cannot
 

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.910
but I think it's a point we cannot
ignore because how do we allocate

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:20.920
ignore because how do we allocate
 

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.400
ignore because how do we allocate
resources and again for high energy

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:23.410

physics some of the experiments are very

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.410
physics some of the experiments are very
 

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.890
physics some of the experiments are very
expensive what you're trying to find out

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:28.900

how matter works it will pay off okay

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400
how matter works it will pay off okay
 

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.120
how matter works it will pay off okay
but I also mentioned that because it's

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.130
but I also mentioned that because it's
 

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.890
but I also mentioned that because it's
one of the challenge with politicians

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:37.900
one of the challenge with politicians
 

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.830
one of the challenge with politicians
okay see where are you giving me back

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840
okay see where are you giving me back
 

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.280
okay see where are you giving me back
for the money I'm giving you and I think

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:44.290
for the money I'm giving you and I think
 

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.830
for the money I'm giving you and I think
that's often very short-sighted so a

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840
that's often very short-sighted so a
 

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.760
that's often very short-sighted so a
challenge is to

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:48.770
challenge is to
 

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.590
challenge is to
particularly when we're talking about

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600
particularly when we're talking about
 

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.870
particularly when we're talking about
the current administration it's to

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880
the current administration it's to
 

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.390
the current administration it's to
really continue to doing basic science

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400
really continue to doing basic science
 

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.910
really continue to doing basic science
which is fundamental for the progress of

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:57.920
which is fundamental for the progress of
 

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.640
which is fundamental for the progress of
of humanity that's something we can talk

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:00.650
of humanity that's something we can talk
 

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.770
of humanity that's something we can talk
about for a long time but it it's

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:02.780
about for a long time but it it's
 

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.530
about for a long time but it it's
obvious for historical reasons that we

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:05.540
obvious for historical reasons that we
 

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.870
obvious for historical reasons that we
should really keep spending with keep

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880
should really keep spending with keep
 

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.450
should really keep spending with keep

second Mary oh but um Lucy yes please

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:15.260
second Mary oh but um Lucy yes please
 

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.070
second Mary oh but um Lucy yes please
yes so I think you touched on a few very

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080
yes so I think you touched on a few very
 

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.470
yes so I think you touched on a few very
key things there and and one of them is

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480
key things there and and one of them is
 

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.980
key things there and and one of them is
what the public thinks of as a grand

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:23.990
what the public thinks of as a grand
 

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.440
what the public thinks of as a grand
challenge is not necessarily what we

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:26.450
challenge is not necessarily what we
 

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.990
challenge is not necessarily what we
would think of as Grand Challenges so

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000
would think of as Grand Challenges so
 

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.210
would think of as Grand Challenges so
you could be crass and say well it's our

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:31.220
you could be crass and say well it's our
 

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.490
you could be crass and say well it's our
job to figure out how to sell the grand

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:33.500
job to figure out how to sell the grand
 

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.990
job to figure out how to sell the grand
challenge to the public so that they're

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000
challenge to the public so that they're
 

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.350
challenge to the public so that they're
along for the ride to the moon when we

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360
along for the ride to the moon when we
 

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.720
along for the ride to the moon when we
all know that the reason we went to the

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:40.730
all know that the reason we went to the
 

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.710
all know that the reason we went to the
moon is was not necessarily a grand

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720
moon is was not necessarily a grand
 

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.180
moon is was not necessarily a grand
challenge in that sense it was a grand

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:46.190
challenge in that sense it was a grand
 

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.740
challenge in that sense it was a grand
political challenge so so you know so

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:49.750
political challenge so so you know so
 

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.060
political challenge so so you know so

well so an a couple of people already

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:54.590
well so an a couple of people already
 

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.760
well so an a couple of people already
mentioned this as well you have to

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:57.770
mentioned this as well you have to
 

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.770
mentioned this as well you have to
motivate the the public you have to get

00:24:59.770 --> 00:24:59.780
motivate the the public you have to get
 

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.290
motivate the the public you have to get
them engaged and you and you know I

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:02.300
them engaged and you and you know I
 

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.640
them engaged and you and you know I
think I've already said this and Laura

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:03.650
think I've already said this and Laura
 

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.200
think I've already said this and Laura
you said this it's something it's about

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:05.210
you said this it's something it's about
 

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.140
you said this it's something it's about
the education it's about giving them the

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:08.150
the education it's about giving them the
 

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.830
the education it's about giving them the
tools that they can then use over a life

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840
tools that they can then use over a life
 

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.810

long time of learning
so that they they can help us define

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:18.020
so that they they can help us define

so that they they can help us define
what the Grand Challenges are they can

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:20.150
what the Grand Challenges are they can
 

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.440
what the Grand Challenges are they can
participate in some of the USA Grand

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:23.450
participate in some of the USA Grand
 

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.020
participate in some of the USA Grand
Challenges they can even participate in

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:26.030
Challenges they can even participate in
 

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.720
Challenges they can even participate in
some of Hilbert's challenges that some

of those mathematical challenges are
 

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.670
of those mathematical challenges are
being crowd-sourced as well I'm not sure

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:33.680
being crowd-sourced as well I'm not sure
 

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.710

at the beginning we were communicating

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:14.690
at the beginning we were communicating

we were quite successful even though we

we were quite successful even though we
had to convince the public in general we

had to convince the public in general we
were quite successful with decision

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:36.529
were quite successful with decision
 

00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:38.799
were quite successful with decision

thing that you have to do both at the
 

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.580
thing that you have to do both at the
same time but eventually we thirdly we

same time but eventually we thirdly we
 

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.029

at it and they finally got around to
 

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.159
at it and they finally got around to
some kind of arms control and

some kind of arms control and

preserve the the atmosphere okay so I'm

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:21.930
preserve the the atmosphere okay so I'm
 

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:25.130
preserve the the atmosphere okay so I'm
not going to touch that one but the you

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140
not going to touch that one but the you
 

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.600
not going to touch that one but the you
know the risk of climbing up on my

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:26.610
know the risk of climbing up on my
 

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.480
know the risk of climbing up on my
soapbox again I'm gonna say there is

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:29.490
soapbox again I'm gonna say there is
 

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.580
soapbox again I'm gonna say there is
another example which is the Flint

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:31.590

Michigan water crisis which was it so

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640
Michigan water crisis which was it so
 

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.610
Michigan water crisis which was it so
well yeah yes and and it was solved with

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620
well yeah yes and and it was solved with
 

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.490
well yeah yes and and it was solved with
a lot of help by citizen scientists who

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500
a lot of help by citizen scientists who
 

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.710
a lot of help by citizen scientists who
were who took matters into their own

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720
were who took matters into their own
 

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.200
were who took matters into their own
hands and so this is where there is hope

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:51.210
hands and so this is where there is hope
 

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:55.790
hands and so this is where there is hope
when we have the the public for their

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:55.800
when we have the the public for their
 

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.650
when we have the the public for their
own reasons and and you know this is

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:57.660
own reasons and and you know this is
 

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.750
own reasons and and you know this is
definitely a motivational force when

00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760
definitely a motivational force when
 

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.820

00:34:55.339 --> 00:34:55.349
but they were they pursued they
 

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:56.960
but they were they pursued they
persevered and they were actually able

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:56.970
persevered and they were actually able
 

00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:00.499
persevered and they were actually able
to convince the state that there was an

00:35:00.499 --> 00:35:00.509
to convince the state that there was an
 

00:35:00.509 --> 00:35:03.259
to convince the state that there was an
issue with the water quality and it was

00:35:03.259 --> 00:35:03.269
issue with the water quality and it was
 

00:35:03.269 --> 00:35:05.870
issue with the water quality and it was
damaging their health and at the end of

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880
damaging their health and at the end of
 

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.729
damaging their health and at the end of
the day they were actually able to make

00:35:07.729 --> 00:35:07.739
the day they were actually able to make
 

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:10.880
the day they were actually able to make
policy change so the point being that if

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:10.890
policy change so the point being that if
 

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:15.529
policy change so the point being that if
you start local to things that matter to

00:35:15.529 --> 00:35:15.539
you start local to things that matter to
 

00:35:15.539 --> 00:35:18.859
you start local to things that matter to
people at you know we are human and

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:18.869
people at you know we are human and
 

00:35:18.869 --> 00:35:21.349
people at you know we are human and
we're tribal in some sense right so we

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359
we're tribal in some sense right so we
 

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:23.870
we're tribal in some sense right so we
we care about things that are local so

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880
we care about things that are local so
 

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.279
we care about things that are local so
this goes back to my point about

00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:25.289
this goes back to my point about
 

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:27.440
this goes back to my point about
rephrasing how do we phrase the Grand

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:27.450
rephrasing how do we phrase the Grand
 

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.200
rephrasing how do we phrase the Grand
Challenges so that the people at the

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:30.210
Challenges so that the people at the
 

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:34.359

you know places in the world where they
 

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.819
you know places in the world where they
don't care about Google they care about

00:35:40.819 --> 00:35:40.829
don't care about Google they care about
 

00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:43.729

finding a way to survive how how can we
 

00:35:47.009 --> 00:35:51.229
finding a way to survive how how can we
translate all of the tools and what not

then that will bubble up and hopefully

00:36:06.759 --> 00:36:06.769
then that will bubble up and hopefully

in a way that sort of open it up to new
 

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.740
in a way that sort of open it up to new
communities and and you have to think

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:25.750
communities and and you have to think
 

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.200
communities and and you have to think
about how are you incentivizing the

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.210
about how are you incentivizing the
 

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.390
about how are you incentivizing the
kinds of people that might be able to

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400
kinds of people that might be able to
 

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.980
kinds of people that might be able to
come to the table and solve a problem

which I think was in 1919 which is a for

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:39.630
which I think was in 1919 which is a for
 

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.770
which I think was in 1919 which is a for
the first transatlantic flight and I

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780
the first transatlantic flight and I
 

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.849
the first transatlantic flight and I
think there was a $25,000 reward and and

00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859
think there was a $25,000 reward and and
 

00:47:46.859 --> 00:47:50.059
think there was a $25,000 reward and and
maybe that decent money back then but

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:50.069
maybe that decent money back then but
 

00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.550
maybe that decent money back then but

gonna respect could guess that with the

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720
gonna respect could guess that with the
 

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.630
gonna respect could guess that with the
question of basic science i think what

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640
question of basic science i think what
 

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.160
question of basic science i think what
you're saying works very well when

00:48:59.160 --> 00:48:59.170
you're saying works very well when
 

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:00.990
you're saying works very well when
there's a defined a more defined goal

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000
there's a defined a more defined goal
 

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.480
there's a defined a more defined goal
but basic science i don't know anybody

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:03.490
but basic science i don't know anybody
 

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.940
but basic science i don't know anybody
in basic sciences who said well okay i'm

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:05.950
in basic sciences who said well okay i'm
 

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:07.500
in basic sciences who said well okay i'm
gonna start this hard career because I

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:07.510
gonna start this hard career because I

know did it because they were just

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:11.590
know did it because they were just
 

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.220

journey and the curiosity and the
 

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.390
journey and the curiosity and the
satisfaction of doing what you do right

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400
satisfaction of doing what you do right
 

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.370

so so I think what you're saying is it's

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:20.380
so so I think what you're saying is it's
 

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.930
so so I think what you're saying is it's
it's a toolbox thing but I think we

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:21.940
it's a toolbox thing but I think we
 

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.480
it's a toolbox thing but I think we
shouldn't mistake it for the really long

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:24.490
shouldn't mistake it for the really long
 

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:26.460
shouldn't mistake it for the really long
term investment in basic and

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:26.470
term investment in basic and
 

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.740
term investment in basic and
foundational research that we really

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:28.750
foundational research that we really
 

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.950
foundational research that we really
have to make sure is not lost and I

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960
have to make sure is not lost and I
 

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.860
have to make sure is not lost and I
think I mean I we keep hearing basic

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:34.870
think I mean I we keep hearing basic
 

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.630
think I mean I we keep hearing basic
science come up and I think absolutely

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640
science come up and I think absolutely
 

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.340
science come up and I think absolutely
no one should walk away saying that this

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:38.350
no one should walk away saying that this
 

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:42.060
no one should walk away saying that this
this is an alternative to making really

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:42.070
this is an alternative to making really
 

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.760
this is an alternative to making really
robust investments in basic science this

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:44.770
robust investments in basic science this
 

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.470
robust investments in basic science this
is really almost when you're further

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480
is really almost when you're further
 

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.510
is really almost when you're further
down the line you're benefiting from

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520
down the line you're benefiting from
 

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.230
down the line you're benefiting from
that knowledge yes and you actually have

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240
that knowledge yes and you actually have
 

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.810
that knowledge yes and you actually have
the potential to leverage all of these

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:54.820
the potential to leverage all of these
 

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.400
the potential to leverage all of these
insights and be able to sell probably

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:56.410
insights and be able to sell probably
 

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.200

Lucy there's there's another thing that
we've learned so I

00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960
we've learned so I
 

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.660
we've learned so I
co-founded a crowdsourcing platform

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:01.670
co-founded a crowdsourcing platform
 

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:06.039
co-founded a crowdsourcing platform
called suniverse that organ and we we

00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:06.049
called suniverse that organ and we we
 

00:50:06.049 --> 00:50:08.980
called suniverse that organ and we we
have you know nearly 1.7 million people

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:08.990
have you know nearly 1.7 million people
 

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:10.269
have you know nearly 1.7 million people
worldwide that contribute to our

00:50:10.269 --> 00:50:10.279
worldwide that contribute to our
 

00:50:10.279 --> 00:50:13.480
worldwide that contribute to our
projects and so we have I failed the

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:13.490
projects and so we have I failed the
 

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:18.249
projects and so we have I failed the
tutorial we were having discussions

00:50:18.249 --> 00:50:18.259
tutorial we were having discussions
 

00:50:18.259 --> 00:50:27.279
tutorial we were having discussions
about this before but yes depends on the

00:50:27.279 --> 00:50:27.289
about this before but yes depends on the
 

00:50:27.289 --> 00:50:31.680
about this before but yes depends on the
project and the incentive structure

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:31.690
 

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:37.230
going to yes so so we have found that

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240
going to yes so so we have found that
 

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.269
going to yes so so we have found that
the incentive that people they actually

00:50:40.269 --> 00:50:40.279
the incentive that people they actually
 

00:50:40.279 --> 00:50:43.930
the incentive that people they actually
want to participate in research it isn't

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:43.940
want to participate in research it isn't
 

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.690
want to participate in research it isn't
having to do with an e come competitive

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:46.700
having to do with an e come competitive
 

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.910
having to do with an e come competitive
aspect so in our first project we

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920
aspect so in our first project we
 

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.009
aspect so in our first project we
actually had leaderboards because we

00:50:51.009 --> 00:50:51.019
actually had leaderboards because we
 

00:50:51.019 --> 00:50:52.390
actually had leaderboards because we
figured of course you know we're kind of

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400
figured of course you know we're kind of
 

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.480
figured of course you know we're kind of
gamifying things here and so we want to

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:55.490
gamifying things here and so we want to
 

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:57.099
gamifying things here and so we want to
have the people who classified the most

00:50:57.099 --> 00:50:57.109
have the people who classified the most
 

00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:59.769
have the people who classified the most
galaxies be able to show up and that'll

00:50:59.769 --> 00:50:59.779
galaxies be able to show up and that'll
 

00:50:59.779 --> 00:51:03.249
galaxies be able to show up and that'll
incentivize people we were dead wrong so

00:51:03.249 --> 00:51:03.259
incentivize people we were dead wrong so
 

00:51:03.259 --> 00:51:05.079
incentivize people we were dead wrong so
it turns out that the people who

00:51:05.079 --> 00:51:05.089
it turns out that the people who
 

00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:08.170
it turns out that the people who
actually want to contribute to our

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:08.180
actually want to contribute to our
 

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.650
actually want to contribute to our
projects are actually turned off by

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:11.660
projects are actually turned off by
 

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.229
projects are actually turned off by
competition we have found we have done

00:51:14.229 --> 00:51:14.239
competition we have found we have done
 

00:51:14.239 --> 00:51:16.660
competition we have found we have done
research on that so understanding the

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:16.670
research on that so understanding the
 

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:19.150
research on that so understanding the
complexities of the human brain they

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160
complexities of the human brain they
 

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.370
complexities of the human brain they
feel they want to actually be part of a

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:21.380
feel they want to actually be part of a
 

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.910
feel they want to actually be part of a
larger whole and contribute and and when

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920
larger whole and contribute and and when
 

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.849
larger whole and contribute and and when
they are pressured into competition they

00:51:27.849 --> 00:51:27.859
they are pressured into competition they
 

00:51:27.859 --> 00:51:29.979
they are pressured into competition they
actually remove themselves from the site

00:51:29.979 --> 00:51:29.989
actually remove themselves from the site
 

00:51:29.989 --> 00:51:32.259
actually remove themselves from the site
so we find there there there are

00:51:32.259 --> 00:51:32.269
so we find there there there are
 

00:51:32.269 --> 00:51:33.489
so we find there there there are
definitely different incentive

00:51:33.489 --> 00:51:33.499
definitely different incentive
 

00:51:33.499 --> 00:51:36.190
definitely different incentive
structures and so people do things for

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.200
structures and so people do things for
 

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.370
structures and so people do things for
and it said that you know people look at

so on so that they can actually get the

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:00.590
so on so that they can actually get the
 

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.950
so on so that they can actually get the
benefits of doing research if you put

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960
benefits of doing research if you put
 

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.590
benefits of doing research if you put
all that together then it makes a lot of

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:05.600
all that together then it makes a lot of
 

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.410
all that together then it makes a lot of
sense just historically from an economic

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:08.420
sense just historically from an economic
 

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:12.490
sense just historically from an economic
perspective to invest both in basic and

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:12.500
perspective to invest both in basic and
 

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:16.360
perspective to invest both in basic and
and in applied technologies and there I

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:16.370
and in applied technologies and there I
 

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:19.540
and in applied technologies and there I
want to bring up again that one very

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:19.550
want to bring up again that one very
 

00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:22.000
want to bring up again that one very
important investment in very basic

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:22.010
important investment in very basic
 

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:25.270
important investment in very basic
science in universities is so that you

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280
science in universities is so that you
 

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.089
science in universities is so that you
can have very good

00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099
can have very good
 

00:56:26.099 --> 00:56:30.109
can have very good
teachers and so education is for the

00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119
teachers and so education is for the
 

00:56:30.119 --> 00:56:32.569
teachers and so education is for the
benefit of humanity and we know that

00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579
benefit of humanity and we know that
 

00:56:32.579 --> 00:56:34.849
benefit of humanity and we know that
basic science and so on is best thought

00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859
basic science and so on is best thought
 

00:56:34.859 --> 00:56:36.859
basic science and so on is best thought
when you have students actually doing

00:56:36.859 --> 00:56:36.869
when you have students actually doing
 

00:56:36.869 --> 00:56:40.549
when you have students actually doing
research themselves with research units

00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559
research themselves with research units
 

00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:43.009
research themselves with research units
it doesn't have to be expensive Applied

00:56:43.009 --> 00:56:43.019
it doesn't have to be expensive Applied
 

00:56:43.019 --> 00:56:45.650
it doesn't have to be expensive Applied
Research things so yes there's a big

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:45.660
Research things so yes there's a big
 

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.380
Research things so yes there's a big
question how do you allocate resources

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:47.390
question how do you allocate resources
 

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:49.940
question how do you allocate resources
but I think we have enough experience so

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:49.950
but I think we have enough experience so
 

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:53.569
but I think we have enough experience so
it can done very cleverly there's a

00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579
it can done very cleverly there's a
 

00:56:53.579 --> 00:56:55.940
it can done very cleverly there's a
support for basic science in this

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:55.950
support for basic science in this
 

00:56:55.950 --> 00:57:00.170
support for basic science in this
country is very small even though it

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:00.180
country is very small even though it
 

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:03.920
country is very small even though it
sounds expensive nothing compared to

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:03.930
sounds expensive nothing compared to
 

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:08.589
sounds expensive nothing compared to
what we were what we spend on on

00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599
what we were what we spend on on
 

00:57:08.599 --> 00:57:11.859
what we were what we spend on on
important things like the military and

00:57:11.859 --> 00:57:11.869
important things like the military and
 

00:57:11.869 --> 00:57:16.700
important things like the military and
and getting smaller and I would say that

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:16.710
and getting smaller and I would say that
 

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:18.410
and getting smaller and I would say that
the amount of money that we put into

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420
the amount of money that we put into
 

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.829
the amount of money that we put into
development assistance is smaller even

00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839
development assistance is smaller even
 

00:57:21.839 --> 00:57:23.809
development assistance is smaller even
than was what is going into the basic

00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819
than was what is going into the basic
 

00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:27.079
than was what is going into the basic
science so lesson 1 percent of the

00:57:27.079 --> 00:57:27.089
science so lesson 1 percent of the
 

00:57:27.089 --> 00:57:29.150
science so lesson 1 percent of the
federal budget goes into supporting

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160
federal budget goes into supporting
 

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.190
federal budget goes into supporting
development programs which is a lot less

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200
development programs which is a lot less
 

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.229
development programs which is a lot less
than I think people think about and I

00:57:33.229 --> 00:57:33.239
than I think people think about and I
 

00:57:33.239 --> 00:57:34.910
than I think people think about and I
would argue as a development person that

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920
would argue as a development person that
 

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.620
would argue as a development person that
we absolutely have a responsibility to

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:36.630
we absolutely have a responsibility to
 

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:38.900
we absolutely have a responsibility to
be addressing challenges that people are

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:38.910
be addressing challenges that people are
 

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:42.650
be addressing challenges that people are
facing all over the world and sometimes

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660
facing all over the world and sometimes
 

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.779
facing all over the world and sometimes
when we're making the advocacy argument

00:57:44.779 --> 00:57:44.789
when we're making the advocacy argument
 

00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:47.209
when we're making the advocacy argument
for it we have to actually bring it back

00:57:47.209 --> 00:57:47.219
for it we have to actually bring it back
 

00:57:47.219 --> 00:57:49.969
for it we have to actually bring it back
home and help people figure out why they

00:57:49.969 --> 00:57:49.979
home and help people figure out why they
 

00:57:49.979 --> 00:57:53.569
home and help people figure out why they
should care I work in health and so so

00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579
should care I work in health and so so
 

00:57:53.579 --> 00:57:55.849
should care I work in health and so so
we can think about it in multiple ways

00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859
we can think about it in multiple ways
 

00:57:55.859 --> 00:57:58.099
we can think about it in multiple ways
the health of our planet is inextricably

00:57:58.099 --> 00:57:58.109
the health of our planet is inextricably
 

00:57:58.109 --> 00:58:01.700
the health of our planet is inextricably
linked to the health of humans and there

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:01.710
linked to the health of humans and there
 

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:05.390
linked to the health of humans and there
are really great opportunities to be

00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400
are really great opportunities to be
 

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.529
are really great opportunities to be
able to be addressing both diseases

00:58:09.529 --> 00:58:09.539
able to be addressing both diseases
 

00:58:09.539 --> 00:58:11.870
able to be addressing both diseases
infectious diseases know no boundaries

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880
infectious diseases know no boundaries
 

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:14.420
infectious diseases know no boundaries
they certainly know no walls and can get

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:14.430
they certainly know no walls and can get
 

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:18.950
they certainly know no walls and can get
over walls and so so so we and we saw

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960
over walls and so so so we and we saw
 

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.569
over walls and so so so we and we saw
this with Ebola as how suddenly a

00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579
this with Ebola as how suddenly a
 

00:58:20.579 --> 00:58:23.059
this with Ebola as how suddenly a
problem that was in West Africa suddenly

00:58:23.059 --> 00:58:23.069
problem that was in West Africa suddenly
 

00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:25.880
problem that was in West Africa suddenly
became a global problem that everybody

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:25.890
became a global problem that everybody
 

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:29.029
became a global problem that everybody
was acutely aware of and so so I would

00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039
was acutely aware of and so so I would
 

00:58:29.039 --> 00:58:31.190
was acutely aware of and so so I would
say absolutely we need to be investing

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200
say absolutely we need to be investing
 

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.019
say absolutely we need to be investing
and and we need to be focusing attention

00:58:33.019 --> 00:58:33.029
and and we need to be focusing attention
 

00:58:33.029 --> 00:58:36.469
and and we need to be focusing attention
and we need to be able to empower people

00:58:36.469 --> 00:58:36.479
and we need to be able to empower people
 

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:38.359
and we need to be able to empower people

beyond the diseases because when you

beyond the diseases because when you
talked about acute diseases they catch

talked about acute diseases they catch
 

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:55.040

this wonderful thing which was you think

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:49.829
this wonderful thing which was you think
 

00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:53.540
this wonderful thing which was you think
research is expensive try disease right

00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:53.550
research is expensive try disease right
 

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:55.790
research is expensive try disease right
and but I think it's the really

and but I think it's the really
 

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.370
and but I think it's the really
long-term ones that we don't understand

long-term ones that we don't understand
 

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.950

all the unfolding steps yet but getting
much closer and understanding the

much closer and understanding the

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.940
do more of that
to replace the Scientific Americans and

to replace the Scientific Americans and
 

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:28.060
to replace the Scientific Americans and

again you know we see when there are the

that work on our
our projects they will look up they will

our projects they will look up they will
 

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.920
our projects they will look up they will
go into the literature and they will

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:16.930
go into the literature and they will
 

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:20.370
go into the literature and they will
familiarize themselves with the topic

01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:20.380
familiarize themselves with the topic
 

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.950

and and they will discuss amongst

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240
and and they will discuss amongst
 

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.250
and and they will discuss amongst
themselves on our discussion boards but

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:32.260
themselves on our discussion boards but
 

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.290
themselves on our discussion boards but
if they did not have the access to those

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:36.300
if they did not have the access to those
 

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:40.170
if they did not have the access to those
publications they would not be able to

publications they would not be able to
 

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.380
publications they would not be able to
have those exchanges and so I think the

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:43.390
have those exchanges and so I think the
 

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:46.200

off each other's knowledge so you can
 

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:45.070
off each other's knowledge so you can
actually figure out how to solve a

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480
problem quickly and and that was an
 

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.240
problem quickly and and that was an
example of where some of the publishing

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:49.250
example of where some of the publishing
 

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:51.940

and somebody had made a very extravagant
 

01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:03.700
and somebody had made a very extravagant
claim and people just immediately went

that you like that you're good at and
 

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:11.660
that you like that you're good at and
then do it with passion and then you're

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:11.670
then do it with passion and then you're
 

01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:14.180
then do it with passion and then you're
going to probably be excellent at that

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:14.190
going to probably be excellent at that
 

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:17.359
going to probably be excellent at that
but just adding to that

01:16:17.359 --> 01:16:17.369
but just adding to that
 

01:16:17.369 --> 01:16:19.550
but just adding to that
if you're doing something and you

01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560
if you're doing something and you
 

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.100
if you're doing something and you
realize it benefits society it's even

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:22.110
realize it benefits society it's even
 

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:25.070
realize it benefits society it's even
more rewarding and if you are doing

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080
more rewarding and if you are doing
 

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.720
more rewarding and if you are doing
something that you realize you are the

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:26.730
something that you realize you are the
 

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:29.089
something that you realize you are the
first one on this planet that you're

01:16:29.089 --> 01:16:29.099
first one on this planet that you're
 

01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:32.510
first one on this planet that you're
finding something new it's extremely

01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520
finding something new it's extremely
 

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.169

have made a big difference to the speed
 

01:18:38.349 --> 01:18:39.300
have made a big difference to the speed
with which you would have got to the

a very fundamental facts that have been

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920
a very fundamental facts that have been
 

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.979
a very fundamental facts that have been
revealed by experiments so if there'd

01:19:13.979 --> 01:19:13.989
revealed by experiments so if there'd
 

01:19:13.989 --> 01:19:17.010
revealed by experiments so if there'd
been more experiments a lot along the

01:19:17.010 --> 01:19:17.020
been more experiments a lot along the
 

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.930
been more experiments a lot along the
path I followed would have made it

01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:18.940
path I followed would have made it
 

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:22.050
path I followed would have made it
easier it's the only thing I can think

01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:22.060
easier it's the only thing I can think
 

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:29.189
easier it's the only thing I can think
of anything well my own personal

01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199
of anything well my own personal
 

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:31.709
of anything well my own personal
experience somehow or other I became

01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:31.719
experience somehow or other I became
 

01:19:31.719 --> 01:19:34.350
experience somehow or other I became
fascinated with science in spite of

01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360
fascinated with science in spite of
 

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:40.700
fascinated with science in spite of
school my teachers were very boring and

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:40.710
school my teachers were very boring and
 

01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:42.810
school my teachers were very boring and
furthermore some of things were actually

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:42.820
furthermore some of things were actually
 

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.959
furthermore some of things were actually
wrong I realized that later explaining

01:19:45.959 --> 01:19:45.969
wrong I realized that later explaining
 

01:19:45.969 --> 01:19:48.959
wrong I realized that later explaining
the seasons so well I would very much

01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:48.969
the seasons so well I would very much
 

01:19:48.969 --> 01:19:53.089
the seasons so well I would very much
encourage this education you can really

01:19:53.089 --> 01:19:53.099
encourage this education you can really
 

01:19:53.099 --> 01:19:56.129
encourage this education you can really
make children very enthusiastic about

01:19:56.129 --> 01:19:56.139
make children very enthusiastic about
 

01:19:56.139 --> 01:19:58.770
make children very enthusiastic about
science if you do it right okay they

01:19:58.770 --> 01:19:58.780
science if you do it right okay they
 

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.660
science if you do it right okay they
work together and they do experiments

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:00.670
work together and they do experiments
 

01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:03.660
work together and they do experiments
and they discuss them with each other

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:03.670
and they discuss them with each other
 

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:05.939
and they discuss them with each other
and so on it can be fascinating so I

01:20:05.939 --> 01:20:05.949
and so on it can be fascinating so I
 

01:20:05.949 --> 01:20:08.520
and so on it can be fascinating so I
would very much suggest that this would

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:08.530
would very much suggest that this would
 

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:11.939
would very much suggest that this would
be the large improvement for everybody

be the large improvement for everybody
 

01:20:11.949 --> 01:20:14.310
be the large improvement for everybody
if you change the educational system

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320
if you change the educational system
 

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.910
if you change the educational system
appropriately okay well let's stop there

01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920
appropriately okay well let's stop there
 

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.919

there's been an enormous amount to take
 

01:20:21.849 --> 01:20:23.790
there's been an enormous amount to take
away but I wouldn't like to try and

01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800
away but I wouldn't like to try and
 

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.290
away but I wouldn't like to try and
summarize it I think what I'd like to do
