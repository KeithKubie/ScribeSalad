00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:03.114
Voiceover:Long ago in
algebra class, we learned

00:00:03.114 --> 00:00:07.482
to factor things like X
squared minus Y squared.

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.526
We saw that this was a
difference of squares

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:15.159
that you could factor this
as X plus Y, times X minus Y.

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.775
This is a little bit of a refresher,

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:18.327
you can multiply these two together

00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:20.679
to verify you get X
squared minus Y squared.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.391
In fact, let's just do that for fun.

00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:26.501
X times X is X squared, X times negative Y

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:31.126
is negative XY, Y times X is positive XY,

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:36.119
and then Y times negative
Y is minus Y squared.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.295
These two middle terms cancel out

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:42.198
and your left with X
squared minus Y squared.

00:00:42.198 --> 00:00:44.437
What I want to tackle in this video

00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:47.623
is something that we didn't
know how to factor before

00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:50.969
and that's the sum of the squares.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.863
So if we were to factor X,
let me use a brighter color,

00:00:55.863 --> 00:01:00.311
if we want to try to factor
X squared plus Y squared,

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:04.255
before we knew about imaginary numbers,

00:01:04.255 --> 00:01:06.838
complex numbers, we didn't
know how to factor this.

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:09.894
But now that we do,
what I want to try to do

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:11.430
and I encourage you
actually to pause the video

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.384
and try to do it before me,
is to try to express this

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:21.040
as a difference of squares,
using the imaginary unit I.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.310
So let's try to do this.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.470
So the first we want to
write as a difference

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.207
of squares, so X square
we'll just keep as X squared,

00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:30.281
but now I want to write
this part, I want to write

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:36.252
the second part, right over
here, as subtracting a squares.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.418
I want to subtract a square.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:41.072
So we could write this part as subtracting

00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:44.671
negative Y squared, obviously you subtract

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.031
a negative that's the
same thing as adding.

00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:50.191
Now how does this help us?

00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.551
Well this is the same thing as subtracting

00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:55.582
negative one times Y squared.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:02:00.191
If we wanted to write this
whole thing as a square,

00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:05.311
how would we do it?

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:07.183
Well we have Y squared and

00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:09.295
what's negative one the square of?

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:16.095
Well we know by definition,
negative one is equal to

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:20.463
I squared or that I squared
is equal to negative one.

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:23.919
Let's rewrite it that way,
so this is going to be equal

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:28.590
to X squared minus,
instead of negative one,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.888
I'll write that as I squared,
minus I squared Y squared.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:40.511
All I did was replace this
negative one with an I squared.

00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:42.319
And now this is interesting.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.807
I think you see where this is going,

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:45.287
but I'll just make it very explicit.

00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:56.565
This is now X squared minus IY squared.

00:02:56.627 --> 00:03:00.431
And just like that, using
I, I've been able to write

00:03:00.508 --> 00:03:03.715
this sum of squares as
a difference of squares.

00:03:03.715 --> 00:03:06.338
And now we can factor
just the exact same way

00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:08.451
we factored this original expression.

00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:12.632
This thing is going to be equal to

00:03:12.632 --> 00:03:32.188
X plus IY times X minus IY.

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:35.379
And we can verify that
if you multiply these two

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.651
expressions together, you're going to get

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:38.789
X squared plus Y squared.

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:45.204
Let's do that, X times X is X squared.

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:53.461
X times negative IY is
negative IXY, and then

00:03:53.461 --> 00:04:01.269
IY times X is positive
IXY, and then finally

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.420
let me do this in a
color I'm not using yet,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.077
finally, IY times negative IY is equal to

00:04:09.077 --> 00:04:13.127
negative I squared Y squared.

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:15.909
Now these middle two terms cancel out,

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.933
I squared is negative one, and so we have

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:22.972
X squared minus negative one Y squared,

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:25.772
so this is subtracting a negative,

00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:26.971
the same thing as adding a positive,

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:34.269
and so this simplifies to
X squared plus Y squared.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:36.635
So hopefully this now
gives you an appreciation

00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:41.692
of using the complex imaginary unit I,

00:04:41.692 --> 00:04:44.251
how you can actually
factor this expression

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:48.251
into essentially the product
of two complex numbers.
