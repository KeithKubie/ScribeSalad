00:00:00.313 --> 00:00:01.473
- [Voiceover] What I'd
like to do in this video

00:00:01.473 --> 00:00:05.733
is give you an overview of the
Khan Academy SAT resources.

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.673
The official SAT resources that
we've been able to construct

00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:11.753
alongside with our partners
at the college board.

00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:14.093
So right when you go to the resource,

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:15.253
it'll ask you a few questions.

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:17.453
The first one is "Are
you trying to practice

00:00:17.453 --> 00:00:20.293
"for the SAT or the PSAT?"

00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:22.633
The tests are obviously
related but then this will help

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:26.433
the system just know what
you're actually trying to target

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:27.713
and in the first version of this,

00:00:27.713 --> 00:00:29.473
it's primarily about SAT but that's still

00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:31.373
going to help you for the PSAT.

00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:33.133
That says next to question two.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.753
I got to answer four questions here.

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.413
The SAT is changing in March 2016.

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:39.593
Which SAT do you want to practice for?

00:00:39.593 --> 00:00:42.973
The current SAT, the new
SAT, or I'm not sure.

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:45.736
Let's say I want to do the new SAT.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.296
And then we'd like to
be able to let you know

00:00:48.296 --> 00:00:50.356
about upcoming SAT events in your area,

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:52.356
such as Saturday in-person practice tests

00:00:52.356 --> 00:00:53.596
and local study groups.

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:55.776
This is actually something
we're very excited about

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:56.916
and of course, we're never going to

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:58.414
sell your personal information.

00:00:58.414 --> 00:00:59.874
It's just to notify you when

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:01.294
interesting things are going on.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:04.314
So I could put in my ZIP
code right over there

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.874
and then, question four:

00:01:06.874 --> 00:01:09.314
Our system will create a personalized plan

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:10.754
that focuses you on practicing

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:13.454
the skills you need to improve the most.

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:16.934
It's going to start me on
four short diagnostic quizzes

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:18.734
that should each take
about ten minutes each

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:20.894
and says where do I
want to focus on first.

00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:24.394
Let's just say I want
to focus more on math.

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:26.456
Let's do this thing.

00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:27.796
So here we are.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.816
We said we wanted to focus on math first

00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:30.696
and you see there's two tabs.

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:33.476
There's reading and writing
and then there's math.

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.096
It defaulted me to math because that's

00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:36.796
what I said I want to focus on first

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.956
and then we see here that there are,

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:41.976
that there are four
quizzes that I could take.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:44.556
Each of them should take
me roughly 10 minutes.

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:46.156
They're going to have 10 questions on them

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:47.736
and the goal of these, and I encourage you

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:49.756
to kind of take the time out to do these

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:51.196
as well as you can.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.716
Don't just kind of guess the answers

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:54.736
because this will inform the system

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:57.316
where you are at different skills.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.336
The goal of doing four
quizzes with 10 questions each

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:01.996
is by doing these 40 questions,

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.616
you're essentially covering
all of the major dimensions

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.936
that you might see on a math SAT

00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:09.476
and so the system will be able to say,

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:10.516
"Okay, what are you stronger at

00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:11.536
"and what are you weaker at?"

00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:13.656
And it will be able to give
you personalized practice.

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:14.816
Let's take one of these quizzes

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:16.636
just to see what it looks like.

00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:19.619
And so it says the quiz is not timed.

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:20.939
We'll assign you a starting strength

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.359
for every skill on the quiz.

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.139
It says calculators are not allowed

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.039
and once again, this is
all for your benefit,

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.499
to get a sense of what you
know and what you don't know.

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.799
And like on the new SAT,
there's no penalty for guessing.

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.219
So let's start, let's start this quiz.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.279
Alright, so I'm gonna kind of pseudo try

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:37.999
and answer some of
these and a few of them,

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.189
I might just guess just
for the sake of time.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.343
Slema is filling her water jugs

00:02:42.343 --> 00:02:44.043
with spring water at the supermarket.

00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:46.563
The above equation gives the empty space

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:50.403
in her jugs, V, in US
gallons after T minutes

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:51.903
at a constant fill rate.

00:02:51.903 --> 00:02:55.183
How many minutes will it
take to fill the jugs?

00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:56.343
So let's think about it.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.443
When the jugs are filled,

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.983
there's not going to be any empty space

00:02:58.983 --> 00:03:01.023
so this is going to be equal to zero.

00:03:01.023 --> 00:03:03.943
So what time will make V equal zero?

00:03:03.943 --> 00:03:05.583
You have no empty space left.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.423
Well, time would be 6.4.

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:10.803
So after 6.4 minutes,
so let me type that in.

00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:15.763
6.4, let's finish this diagnostic.

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:17.463
And what do we have?

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:18.803
All right, well we get a report

00:03:18.803 --> 00:03:20.923
and on this report, we see

00:03:20.923 --> 00:03:25.623
that I was able to get nine
out of the 10 questions right.

00:03:25.623 --> 00:03:27.623
For the ones that I was able to get right,

00:03:27.623 --> 00:03:30.263
I'm going to start at skill level 3.

00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:32.663
What is skill level 3, you ask?

00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:36.403
Well, we've broadly been able to chunk

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.023
the types of items that
you've seen on the SAT

00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:40.363
into three skill levels:

00:03:40.363 --> 00:03:44.203
Skill level 2, skill level
3, and skill level 4.

00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:46.963
You might say, "Well what
is skill level 1, then?"

00:03:46.963 --> 00:03:48.083
Well, skill level 1 would be

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:49.503
the pre-requisite knowledge

00:03:49.503 --> 00:03:51.203
that you might not actually see on the SAT

00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:53.483
but if you're having
trouble with skill level 2,

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.083
we have resources that will allow you

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:59.163
to build those foundations
in that pre-requisite work.

00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:01.403
But you saw the things that I got right,

00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:03.283
linear equality word problems,

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:04.623
linear function word problems,

00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:06.083
operations with polynomials.

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.543
The system is now going to say,

00:04:07.543 --> 00:04:09.063
"Hey Sal, I'm going to start you

00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:11.143
"at a higher skill
level, at skill level 3,

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:13.163
"which is not the most challenging,

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:14.803
"but the second most challenging level

00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:15.963
"because you got everything,

00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:17.143
"you got these right here."

00:04:17.143 --> 00:04:18.883
And you can see that
here in this little dial

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.543
right over here where
three out of the four

00:04:20.543 --> 00:04:22.963
are filled in but I got one wrong

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.363
and as far as the system knows,

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:25.728
well hey, maybe we'll start you at

00:04:25.728 --> 00:04:27.788
a slightly less challenging level for

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:30.368
interpreting non-linear expressions

00:04:30.368 --> 00:04:31.608
because of that one there.

00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:35.628
But if I want to say hey, I
feel like I got this one right,

00:04:35.628 --> 00:04:37.168
let me see why I got it wrong,

00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:38.948
I can review my answers.

00:04:38.948 --> 00:04:40.208
So I click review answers.

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:41.528
I got that one right.

00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:42.548
And this was the wrong,

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.448
this was the one that we got wrong.

00:04:44.448 --> 00:04:47.728
So not only does it
show me what I selected

00:04:47.728 --> 00:04:50.408
but it tells me why it is wrong.

00:04:50.408 --> 00:04:52.908
We would use vertex form to
reveal the maximum/minimum.

00:04:52.908 --> 00:04:54.508
This model has a minimum.

00:04:54.508 --> 00:04:56.628
And it tells us what the answer is.

00:04:56.628 --> 00:04:59.488
The right answer was this
right over here, was C.

00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:02.288
And we could review the
rest of our questions

00:05:02.288 --> 00:05:04.908
or we could just exit the diagnostic.

00:05:05.908 --> 00:05:07.888
And now once we exit the diagnostic,

00:05:07.888 --> 00:05:10.128
we can take more of the quizzes.

00:05:10.128 --> 00:05:12.728
Once again, I encourage
you to take the time out

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:14.608
to properly do these quizzes.

00:05:14.608 --> 00:05:16.248
Have some scratch paper in hand

00:05:16.248 --> 00:05:17.948
so you can give your best shot at 'em,

00:05:17.948 --> 00:05:19.988
so you can give the best
information to the system

00:05:19.988 --> 00:05:22.568
so it can give you the best
recommendations afterwards.

00:05:22.568 --> 00:05:24.748
After you've finished these four quizzes,

00:05:24.748 --> 00:05:29.028
then the system is ready to
start recommending things to you

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.148
and so this is what it will look like

00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:31.888
after you've finished your four quizzes.

00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:34.508
And you see these four,

00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:36.288
I guess you could call them activities

00:05:36.288 --> 00:05:37.608
are things that the system thinks

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:38.788
that you can work on.

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:40.848
So data collection and conclusions.

00:05:40.848 --> 00:05:42.648
And notice right here, it has,

00:05:42.648 --> 00:05:44.408
this is just this one bolded up.

00:05:44.408 --> 00:05:45.228
If we click on this one,

00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:47.228
then that one gets bolded up on top.

00:05:47.228 --> 00:05:47.868
If we click on that one,

00:05:47.868 --> 00:05:49.288
that one gets bolded up on top.

00:05:49.288 --> 00:05:53.008
And it says this is the
system's current best guess

00:05:53.008 --> 00:05:54.848
of the skill level that I'm at,

00:05:54.848 --> 00:05:56.468
that I'm at two out of four.

00:05:56.468 --> 00:05:57.628
Now I'm going to practice.

00:05:57.628 --> 00:05:59.208
If I click on practice these skills,

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:01.488
then I'm actually going
to get exercises in them.

00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:02.888
And if I were to get,

00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:05.168
if I were to get them right,

00:06:05.168 --> 00:06:07.568
then I'm more likely to be promoted

00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:09.528
to start working on
more challenging skills.

00:06:09.528 --> 00:06:12.288
And so the whole idea here is that

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:15.588
I'm always able to work on the skills

00:06:15.588 --> 00:06:18.008
and the difficulty level
or the challenge level

00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:19.868
that is appropriate to keep me

00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:21.548
getting better all the time.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.848
It doesn't help you if
you're working on stuff

00:06:22.848 --> 00:06:24.368
that you already know really well

00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:25.868
and it doesn't help you
if you're working on stuff

00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:27.228
that you have a lot of trouble with.

00:06:27.228 --> 00:06:28.308
You're best working on the stuff

00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:30.108
that you have a decent chance of getting

00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:31.808
but you're still struggling
with a little bit.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.088
That's what's going to
improve you the most.

00:06:34.088 --> 00:06:38.508
Now these three are just
standard practice sections,

00:06:38.508 --> 00:06:39.488
I guess you would say,

00:06:39.488 --> 00:06:41.928
and this one over here
is a timed mini-session.

00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:43.448
It says calculators okay so you can get

00:06:43.448 --> 00:06:44.828
your calculator out for this one.

00:06:44.828 --> 00:06:46.608
And this one is to kind of give you a mini

00:06:46.608 --> 00:06:50.168
kind of a practice under a
little bit of time pressure

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:51.808
because obviously when
you take the standard,

00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:54.568
the SAT or really any standardized test,

00:06:54.568 --> 00:06:56.268
you're going to be under time pressure

00:06:56.268 --> 00:06:58.468
and so this will let you practice under,

00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:00.308
under those conditions.

00:07:00.308 --> 00:07:03.028
Now, if you scroll down,
if you scroll down,

00:07:03.028 --> 00:07:05.148
you can see that there's
all this stuff down here.

00:07:05.148 --> 00:07:06.228
What is this?

00:07:06.228 --> 00:07:08.808
Well up here, this is
what the system thinks

00:07:08.808 --> 00:07:11.028
that you're best off working on

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:12.568
but it also recognizes hey,

00:07:12.568 --> 00:07:14.208
you might have in your own mind the things

00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:15.528
that you want to work on most.

00:07:15.528 --> 00:07:17.328
and so that's what you can pick over here,

00:07:17.328 --> 00:07:20.788
heart of algebra, and it
gives all the subtopics there,

00:07:20.788 --> 00:07:23.548
passport to advanced mathematics.

00:07:23.548 --> 00:07:25.748
It gives all the subjects there.

00:07:25.748 --> 00:07:28.128
It gives the best read
on how much you have,

00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:30.048
what level you are at each of these.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:31.688
And you can either click right over here

00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:34.908
and get practice problems
in that exact section

00:07:34.908 --> 00:07:38.088
or you could click on the videos

00:07:38.088 --> 00:07:40.688
to see example videos in that,

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:43.068
in that, in that topic.

00:07:43.068 --> 00:07:44.208
And if you click on easier,

00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:45.468
it's going to give you an easier example.

00:07:45.468 --> 00:07:46.488
If you click on harder,
it's going to give you

00:07:46.488 --> 00:07:49.168
a video of a harder example.

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:51.208
So that's what's, and you just,

00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:53.648
I'm going to ideally
just keep working on that

00:07:53.648 --> 00:07:55.408
a little bit every day so you keep

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.528
getting better and better,

00:07:56.528 --> 00:07:57.808
do a lot of deliberate practice

00:07:57.808 --> 00:07:59.268
and really kind of build your muscles

00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:02.688
in the areas where you
might be less familiar.

00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:04.008
And once again, all of this is stuff

00:08:04.008 --> 00:08:05.808
that you will have seen in school

00:08:05.808 --> 00:08:07.888
and so a lot of this
might be review for you

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:09.708
or filling in gaps that you might have

00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:12.448
not filled in the first time
that you saw it in school.

00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:13.848
Now that's on the math.

00:08:13.848 --> 00:08:15.948
That's only part of the SAT.

00:08:15.948 --> 00:08:17.408
We also have a very similar thing

00:08:17.408 --> 00:08:18.768
for the reading and writing.

00:08:18.768 --> 00:08:21.328
So once again, you have
your diagnostic quizzes

00:08:21.328 --> 00:08:22.268
like we mentioned

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:24.908
and after that, it'll give
you suggested practice.

00:08:24.908 --> 00:08:26.948
And just to see what it looks like,

00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:28.868
we can check and go down to see

00:08:28.868 --> 00:08:30.468
what these things look like,

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.628
say on writing argument.

00:08:33.628 --> 00:08:36.788
You can see that it actually
matches very similar

00:08:36.788 --> 00:08:40.908
to the form factor that you
would actually see on the SAT

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:43.588
so that when you actually
take it in real life,

00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:45.468
you are familiar with kind of what,

00:08:45.468 --> 00:08:47.808
hey, what does this one
with a dark box on it mean?

00:08:47.808 --> 00:08:49.148
Well, you'd be familiar with it

00:08:49.148 --> 00:08:50.448
when you take the actual SAT

00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:52.308
but you have your, you have your passages

00:08:52.308 --> 00:08:55.828
or your sentence correction
right over there.

00:08:56.848 --> 00:08:59.008
And so that's math, that's
reading and writing.

00:08:59.008 --> 00:09:01.468
Those are kind of your two main dashboards

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:03.888
for practicing and doing
deliberate practice.

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.888
If you want some kind of high
level things about the SAT,

00:09:06.888 --> 00:09:08.508
you can go to tips and planning

00:09:08.508 --> 00:09:11.168
and then you can click
on any of these videos

00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:12.988
or read some of these articles.

00:09:12.988 --> 00:09:16.428
And then if you want real
full-length practice exams,

00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:17.848
you click up over here.

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:20.508
And you see these complete practice exams

00:09:20.508 --> 00:09:22.848
and these, I encourage you to really take

00:09:22.848 --> 00:09:24.588
as much time out as necessary

00:09:24.588 --> 00:09:27.548
to simulate real test-taking conditions

00:09:27.548 --> 00:09:29.828
because this is where you're going to,

00:09:29.828 --> 00:09:31.708
well you'll take these, simulate the test,

00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:33.008
get practice in that,

00:09:33.008 --> 00:09:34.768
and then that's also
going to give information

00:09:34.768 --> 00:09:37.348
to the system on what
you need to work on more

00:09:37.348 --> 00:09:38.828
so you could take these practice exams

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.708
just kind of with a
standard paper and pencil

00:09:41.708 --> 00:09:43.648
but the value of taking it on this system

00:09:43.648 --> 00:09:44.908
is after you take it,

00:09:44.908 --> 00:09:47.208
one, it will be auto-graded
but on top of that,

00:09:47.208 --> 00:09:49.248
that information of what you got wrong

00:09:49.248 --> 00:09:51.128
and what you got right will be used

00:09:51.128 --> 00:09:54.568
to give you better guidance
and give you better practice.

00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:57.228
So anyway, there's a lot
to think about just now

00:09:57.228 --> 00:09:59.588
but hopefully you find this as valuable

00:09:59.588 --> 00:10:03.068
or as fun as some of us do

00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:04.878
and good luck with everything.
