00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670
That product looks organic.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.510
Should I buy it?

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.010
Here, here, let me hold it.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.760
Whoa, I'm getting it.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.220
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.680
Hey, shoppers, this is
D News, and I'm Trace.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.280
When you're at the store how
do you feel about labels like

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.980
"cage-free," "organic,"
"not tested on animals,"

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.050
"phosphate-free."

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.150
Are these claims more likely
to make you buy an item?

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.270
And new study in the Journal of
Business Ethics says you will,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.200
especially if it goes
in or on your body.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Researchers from the Concordia
University School of Business

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.020
determined when
we touch products

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.980
with labels like
"organic," we receive

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.630
what's called a positive
contagion effect.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.630
When we come in contact
with or eat something

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.610
that has an ethical
feel to it, we

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.570
believe those ethical benefits
are transferred into us-- which

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.859
I have to say is kind of
weird, but totally true.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.900
They did the research to
find other products that

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.524
could be labeled with
ethical branding.

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:54.520
Printer ink, for
example, we don't touch,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.910
so saying biodegradable
won't help its sales.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.570
But moisturizer or paper
towel, we touch a lot,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.170
and every positive touch
reinforces our feelings

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.380
of ethical awesomeness.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.130
We explained on D News
a few months back--

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.080
organic foods are not more
nutritious than other foods,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.030
though this positive contagion
effect does make us feel better

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.090
about eating them.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.830
And "organic" doesn't really
mean what we think it means.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.970
In this country, the US
Department of Agriculture

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.090
took over the term
"organic" in 2002.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.870
It is defined as having been
produced using methods which,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.580
quote, "integrate
cultural, biological,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.010
and mechanical practices that
foster cycling of resources,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.770
promote ecological balance,
and conserve biodiversity."

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.120
Additionally, things like
synthetic fertilizers, sewage,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.160
or genetic engineering
can't be used.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.060
However, chickens in a
cage-- still organic.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.930
As are cows packed
into a barn eating

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.670
genetically modified grain.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.811
The grain isn't organic,
but the cow still is.

00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:50.310
Some farmers and activists don't
agree with this definition,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.990
so they've created other
terms, like "pastured," meaning

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.490
an animal was literally
raised in a pasture.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.330
The Northeast Organic
Farming Association

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.880
created its own "Certified
Naturally Grown" label,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.660
which has similar requirements
to USDA but without control

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.340
of the USDA.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.120
Labeling is getting crazy.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.900
As of now, only a small fraction
of the 2.2 million farms

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.910
in the United States have been
labeled USDA-certified organic.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.100
The rest can't use
the word "organic"

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.050
without paying
fees and navigating

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.700
through federal
requirements, lest they

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.350
be slapped with a $20,000 fine.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.700
And "organic" isn't the
only label you commonly see

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.020
nowadays. "Cage-free"
just means no cages.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.090
That's all it means.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.970
"Free range" means
they're provided an area

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.850
to go outside, though that
area can be fenced and covered

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.860
and at the far end of a barn.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.667
"Grass-fed" means the
animals are fed mainly grass,

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:37.500
but they can still use
pesticides, hormones,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.960
and antibiotics, and feed
them grain as long as, again,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.620
it's mostly grass.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.710
So knowing all of
this, do you still

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.940
feel that positive contagion
effect with organic products?

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.050
Are they still ethical?

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.330
We'd like to believe so, but
without further research,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.210
we can't really be sure.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.800
What do you think of all
this labeling business?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.575
Do you even care?

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:55.200
Tell us so we know
if we should explore

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.890
this more in the comments below,
and subscribe for more D News.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.940
Thanks for watching, everybody.
