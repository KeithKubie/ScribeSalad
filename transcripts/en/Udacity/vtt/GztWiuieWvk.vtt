00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.670
Here's what we're going to do that's
actually going to be even better than

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.270
dying one ninth at a time.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.550
What we're going to do is we're
going to introduce a third party, so

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.775
here's Here's Smooth
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:14.895
&gt;&gt; And here's Curly.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:15.395
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.975
&gt;&gt; And then,
here's my best sort of drawing of Chris

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.095
who's helping us with this class,
our course creator.

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:23.614
&gt;&gt; Course creator [CROSSTALK] I
like course creator better because

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:24.283
then it's CCC.

00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:24.942
&gt;&gt; CCC.

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:27.773
[CROSSTALK] The course developer
CD which is on the screen.

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:30.425
That's true, course developer Chris,
OK we'll do that.

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:31.345
Does sound like a good hip hop name.

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:32.750
You know what we should do?

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.230
We should do some kind
of wrap of some sort.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.320
&gt;&gt; You're going to have to teach me
because I don't know how to do that.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Well, we'll talk about it later.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.820
Okay.
So,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.240
we're going to put our little CD here
and he is going to stand between us so

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.120
he's going to act as a kind of go
between, and what he's going to do is

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.730
he's going to make a decision for
us of a certain sort.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.680
S, here's the decision that
we're going to have Chris do.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
Chris is going to Write
down three cards.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.420
One's going to say (C, C),
one's going to say (D, C), and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.050
one's going to say (C,D).

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.420
&gt;&gt; Three cards.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.290
&gt;&gt; Three cards.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.790
Okay?

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And he's going to shuffle those cards

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.930
and then pick one of them.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.030
So in other words he
is going to uniformly,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.780
randomly choose among (C,
C), (D, C), and (C, D).

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.600
Comedy.
Okay.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I get it.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.610
&gt;&gt; So, you'll notice that's
three of the four strategies.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.830
&gt;&gt; It's three of the four strategy.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.470
Yeah, you're missing Deedee.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.740
&gt;&gt; Deedee, which is the worst one.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you should put that one in.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.720
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.620
&gt;&gt; Well, I could put it in and give it
and assign it a probability of zero.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.410
&gt;&gt; But I like that you're their cards
and they have equal probability.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.010
&gt;&gt; Right, they'll have equal
probability, so uniform choice.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.950
All right, so are you with me?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.570
&gt;&gt; I guess so.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.720
Chris randomly picks one
of these three things.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.490
Neither of us knows what it is and we
don't know anything about what the other

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490
has but Chris gets to pick up this card.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.580
And then what Chris is going to
do is something very simple.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.420
Chris is going to inform one of us,
perhaps both of us, one after the other,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.870
and Chris is going to, let's say for
the purposes of this discussion,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.310
Chris is going to inform one of us
of what that person's action is.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.740
Let's say Chris picks c,c.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.190
Chris will turn to me and
will say, I want you to choose c.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.830
Now, Chris would also turn to you and
say, I want you to choose c.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.330
Okay?
&gt;&gt; And there's no conflict there,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.050
because we can both chicken.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.030
&gt;&gt; Do whatever you want to do.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.320
I'm just telling you.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.419
Here's what the card says you should do.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.830
All right card says you
should chicken out.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.400
&gt;&gt; And
he's going to force me to do that now?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.170
&gt;&gt; No, let me do one more example though
before I really answer that question.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.110
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Let's say Chris had accidentally and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.150
that is uniformly probabilistically
chosen the comma c.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.870
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.470
&gt;&gt; Then Chris would turn to me and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.520
say the card says
&gt;&gt; You should do D.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.150
Chris would turn to you and
say the card says you should do C.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.090
&gt;&gt; But I would know that he was
actually just making me chicken out

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.770
because that's what people do.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.320
&gt;&gt; No, that's because
that's what the card says.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.280
Now let me be a little bit
clearer here because I wasn't.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.130
These three cards
are known to both of us.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.540
And we know that there's a uniform
probability of getting any of

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.530
those three cards.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.140
And we trust Chris enough that he's not
going to always give you the good thing.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.620
&gt;&gt; Yes, he's going to with
probability one-third.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.970
&gt;&gt; Do that, okay?

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.620
&gt;&gt; I trust Chris.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.280
&gt;&gt; I trust Chris.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.050
Look at that hair.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.040
How could you not trust Chris?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.780
Okay, so Chris is going to pick one of
these cards, and then tell each of us

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.700
what it is we're going to do or
what we're being asked to do.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.350
&gt;&gt; But not tell us what the other
person is being asked to do.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.070
Okay.
&gt;&gt; So that's important, got it?

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's interesting.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.390
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; because I can use inference.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.230
&gt;&gt; You can use inference.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.080
So in fact, let me ask you
what inference you should use.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.720
So-
&gt;&gt; Bayesian inference, or

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.540
you didn't ask it, I'm sorry.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.070
&gt;&gt; I didn't ask it.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.780
So, in fact, I'm going to,
because you said Bayesian.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.440
&gt;&gt; I didn't say Bayesian.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.960
&gt;&gt; You just said Bayesian inference,
I'm going to make this a quiz.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.530
&gt;&gt; As punishment for
saying Bayesian, okay.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.040
&gt;&gt; Yes, how dare you.
