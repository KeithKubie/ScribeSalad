00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.050
What I want to do in this video
is find the area of this region

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.200
that I'm shading in yellow.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.140
And what might seem challenging
is that throughout this region,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.810
I have the same lower function.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.540
Or I guess the
lower boundary is y

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.870
is equal to x squared
over 4 minus 1.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.242
But I have a different
upper boundary.

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:20.700
And the way that
we can tackle this

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.290
is by dividing this
area into two sections,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.640
or dividing this region into two
regions, the region on the left

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.250
and the region on
the right, where

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.730
for this first region,
which I'll do--

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.310
I'll color even more in
yellow-- for this first region,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.950
over that entire interval in x.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.360
And it looks like x is
going between 0 and 1.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.280
y equals-- when x is equal to
1, this function is equal to 1.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.220
When x is equal to 1, this
function is also equal to 1.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.810
So this is the point 1 comma 1.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.320
That's where they intersect.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.250
So for this section, this
subregion right over here,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.420
y equals square root of x is the
upper function the entire time.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.230
And then we can have
a-- we can set up

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.860
a different-- we can
separately tackle figuring out

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.920
the area of this region.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.960
From x is equal to 1
to x is equal to 2,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.890
where y equals 2 minus
x, is the upper function.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.450
So let's do it.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.710
So let's first think
about this first region.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.050
Well, that's going to be
the definite integral from x

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.640
is equal to 0 to
x is equal to 1.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.120
And our upper function is square
root of x, so square root of x.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.390
And then from that, we want to
subtract our lower function--

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.320
square root of x minus x
squared over 4 minus 1.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.400
And then of course,
we have our dx.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.350
So this right over here, this is
describing the area in yellow.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.730
And you could imagine it, that
this part right over here,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.660
the difference between
these two functions

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.164
is essentially this height.

00:01:53.164 --> 00:01:54.580
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.680
And then you
multiply it times dx.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.390
You get a little
rectangle with width dx.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.600
And then you do that for each x.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.860
Each x you get a
different rectangle.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.650
And then you sum them all up.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.570
And you take the limit as
your change in x approaches 0.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.664
So as you get ultra,
ultra thin rectangles,

00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:18.330
and you have an
infinite number of them.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.060
And that's our definition,
or the Riemann definition

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.820
of what a definite integral is.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.370
And so this is the area
of the left region.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.370
And by the exact same
logic, we could figure out

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.972
the area of the right region.

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:30.680
The right region--
and then we could just

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.127
sum the two things together.

00:02:32.127 --> 00:02:34.210
The right region, we're
going from x is equal to 0

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.530
to x-- sorry, x is equal to
1 to x is equal to 2, 1 to 2.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.130
The upper function is 2 minus x.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.220
And from that, we're going to
subtract the lower function,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.660
which is x squared
over 4 minus 1.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.060
And now we just
have to evaluate.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.800
So let's first simplify
this right over here.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.100
This is equal to the
definite integral

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.220
from 0 to 1 of square root of x
minus x squared over 4 plus 1,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.020
dx-- I'm going to write
it all in one color now--

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.710
plus the definite integral
from 1 to 2 of 2 minus x,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.330
minus x squared over 4.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.330
Then subtracting a negative is
a positive 3-- or a positive 1.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.650
We could just add it to this 2.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.330
And so this 2 just becomes a 3.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.747
I said 2 minus
negative 1 is 3, dx.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.705
And now we just have to
take the antiderivative

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:39.310
and evaluate it at 1 and 0.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.130
So the antiderivative
of this is-- well,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.480
this is x to the 1/2.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.730
Increment it by 1.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.500
Increment the power by
1, you get x to the 3/2,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.200
and then multiply
by the reciprocal

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.650
of the new exponent-- so
it's 2/3 x to the 3/2.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.410
Minus-- the antiderivative
of x squared over 4

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.160
is x to the third, divided by 3,
divided by 4, so divided by 12,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.660
plus x.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.510
That's the antiderivative of 1.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.590
We're going to
evaluate it at 1 and 0.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.640
And then here the
antiderivative is

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.670
going to be 3x minus x
squared over 2 minus x

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.029
to the third over 12.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.450
Once again, evaluate it
at-- or not once again.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.460
Now we're going to
evaluate at 2 and 1.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.610
So over here, you evaluate
all of this stuff at 1.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.690
You get 2/3 minus 1/12 plus 1.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.410
And then from that, you
subtract this evaluated at 0.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.010
But this is just all
0, so you get nothing.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.260
So this is what the yellow
stuff simplified to.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.740
And then this purple stuff,
or this magenta stuff,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.070
or mauve, or whatever color this
is, first you evaluate it at 2.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.330
You get 6 minus-- let's see,
2 squared over 2 is 2, minus 8

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.920
over 12.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.650
And then from that,
you're going to subtract

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.460
this evaluated at 1.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.270
So it's going to be 3 times 1--
that's 3-- minus 1/2 minus 1

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.604
over 12.

00:05:14.604 --> 00:05:16.270
And now what we're
essentially left with

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.889
is adding a bunch of fractions.

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.180
So let's see if we can do that.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.930
It looks like 12 would
be the most obvious

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.300
common denominator.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.430
So here you have 8/12
minus 1/12 plus 12/12.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.310
So this simplifies
to-- what's this?

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.440
This is 19/12, the part
that we have in yellow.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.190
And then this business,
let me do it in this color.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.280
So 6 minus 2, this is
just going to be 4.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:51.100
So we can write this as
48/12-- that's 4-- minus 8/12.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.460
And then we're going to have to
subtract a 3, which is 36/12.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.410
Then we're going to add to
1/2, which is just plus 6/12,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.030
and then we're
going to add a 1/12.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.730
So this is all going to simplify
to-- let's see, 48 minus 8

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:18.410
is 40, minus 36 is 4, plus
6 is 10, plus 1 is 11.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.614
So this becomes plus 11/12.

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.030
Let me make sure
I did that right.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.830
48 minus 8 is 40,
minus 36 is 4, 10, 11.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.040
So that looks right.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.955
And then we're ready
to add these two.

00:06:31.955 --> 00:06:36.010
19 plus 11 is equal to 30/12.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.290
Or if we want to simplify
this a little bit,

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.990
we can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 6.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.960
This is equal to
5/2, or 2 and 1/2.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.630
And we're done.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.560
We figured out the area
of this entire region.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.255
It is 2 and 1/2.
