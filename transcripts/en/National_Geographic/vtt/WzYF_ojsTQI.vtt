sea turtles often have organisms that

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.919
attach themselves to their shell some

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.710
are in fact parasitic while others are

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.710
commensal posing no threat to the turtle

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.710
crabs barnacles shrimp oysters algae and

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.040

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:52.280
the turtle as a form of transportation

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.799
green sea turtles have amazingly long

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.400
lifespans often reaching 80 or more

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.420
endangered species they are killed for

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.420
their meat and eggs

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.430
loss of habitat boating accidents and

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.730
fishing nets also contribute to a

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:35.870
declining number of the species
