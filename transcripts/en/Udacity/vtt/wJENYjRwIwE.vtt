00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.490
Now before we make some of these projects, I

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.390
want to share with you of how I learned to

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.800
program. I remember in many of my introductory computer

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.050
science classes. The instructor would start out slow and my

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.440
friends and I, we would understand everything, but then

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.930
boom, the difficulty level would skyrocket. This would make a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.760
lot of other students inside the class feel extremely

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.450
frustrated and intimidated by code and ultimately they would quit.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.540
We will avoid that in this class. In

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.080
this class we will make challenging projects, but at

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.360
the same time we will ensure that you're comfortable

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.940
with the learning curve. So it is in that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.880
spirit I want to ask you, how confident

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.660
do you feel in your ability to write computer

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.260
programs? Programs like the ones we are going to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.810
build in this class. Here are some answer choices.
