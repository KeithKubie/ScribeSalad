00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.080
It would be good if when I get to
the end of my story, I could start over.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.680
So that I can see all the different
possibilities for the tigers fate.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.876
Here's what that would look like.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.390
Where in the storyboard,
should we put the start over button?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.760
We could drag separate buttons into
each of the end points in Storyboard.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.470
But we need to consider this,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.630
what class is the object that
would receive these actions?

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.490
If we look in the Identity Inspector,
we see that the View Controller for

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.820
each story node is a UIViewController.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.520
We can't add an action method directly
to a Stock UIViewController class.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.240
The name of the subclass we're
using is MYOAViewController,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.920
as you can see here in
the project navigator.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.820
So, we'll go back to the Identity
Inspector, and we'll add that class name

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.795
so that we can programmatically
add a button to each story node.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:55.355
By the way,

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:59.435
a detailed review of these steps will be
provided in the next part of the lesson.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.905
Okay.
Let's see about adding that

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:03.015
button in code.

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:06.440
Every View Controller has a property
called a Navigation Item.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.003
This item can be used to
control the title and buttons.

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:13.535
Here in the Navigation Item
documentation,

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:16.000
you can see that it has
a right bar button item.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.740
With these two lines of code,
we can add the right bar button item in

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.190
the viewDidLoad method and
specify the title, start over.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.400
Now, we'll run it and see where we are.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.940
Well, there's our button, but

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.970
naturally it doesn't lead anywhere
because we haven't set the target yet.
