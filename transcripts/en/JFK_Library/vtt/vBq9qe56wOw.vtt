00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:01.759
And he also wanted to
go to church every week,

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:03.191
and I'm like this too.

00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:06.724
It's a better week if
you've been to church.

00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:08.426
Nobody believes that anymore I guess.

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:09.568
I believe that.
That's good.

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:11.601
And I think Jack thought that.

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:15.641
Bobby became in the end sort of interested

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.963
in the Dorothy Day,
Catholic Worker Catholicism.

00:00:18.963 --> 00:00:21.467
The radical concern about the poor.

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:22.610
But he was also trying to figure out

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.438
what was the religious motivation

00:00:24.438 --> 00:00:26.811
behind somebody like Cesar Chavez?

00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:30.484
What role does Catholicism
play in his getting up

00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:32.500
in the morning and
leading a labor movement

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.396
in the California fields?

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:36.080
How did that move Dorothy Day living

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.368
down in the bowery of New York?

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:38.627
How did that move her?

00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:43.439
He wanted to find a connection
between his religion

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:44.764
and his purpose.

00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:48.149
He really wanted to figure
out life as he understood it.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.100
I thought that was
something that got to me.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.819
He's the genuine article.

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:52.946
I mean, he's not perfect obviously,

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.422
but I wasn't looking for that.
