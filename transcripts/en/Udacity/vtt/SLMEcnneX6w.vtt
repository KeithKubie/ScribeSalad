00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's our optional unit. It involves programming and what I want is really simple.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I want to input a sample and a hypothesis and out should come

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
a simple yes or no whether whether I should accept it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This piece of code should just do it,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and for simplicity I assume 95% confidence and two-sided-tests.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here's what I'll do.  I'm going to give you functions you already know.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You've already programmed with the mean function. Here it is again.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Notice the use of the word float, in case the list doesn't have a float happens to be an artifact

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of type conversions in Python, but never mind.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then we have a variance function that you programmed before,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and here's the variance function in a very compact way.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And then, I also should really implement the T table but I was lazy so I'll just give 1.96,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
even though we know that's not quite correct.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm going to give you a list. This was the list of height in my basketball club and I print the mean.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That is hard to see but I should indeed get 201.5. Give it a try.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What I want you to implement now is the function conf,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which is the plus/minus term in the confidence interval below and above the mean.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
If I run it for this data sequence over here from 199 to 204, I indeed get 1.366544.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So back in  your code, we left the function conf open and please insert your code right here.

00:01:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can do this in one line.
