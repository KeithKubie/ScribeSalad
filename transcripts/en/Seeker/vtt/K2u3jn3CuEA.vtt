00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.500
4200 meters above Melbourne, Australia, 
a chemistry experiment is in progress.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.809
These are the samples, which will be injected with metal and organic particles to form crystals at low gravity.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.460
And this guy back here is Dr. JJ Richardson, 
the lead researcher.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.820
JJ and his team study nanomaterials 
called Metal-Organic Frameworks,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.280
which are considered the fastest-growing 
and most innovative class of materials in chemistry.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.520
They're special because they have giant gaps in them, 
so they can act kind of like a nano-sponge

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.200
or a nano-sieve, where you can really selectively let molecules in or let molecules out of these crystals.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.860
Their spongy quality means that MOFs can be used to both extract and deliver substances,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.380
for instance, removing greenhouse gases 
from fossil fuels, or delivering therapeutic drugs

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.740
to targeted areas in our bodies.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.600
MOFs are very customizable; 
there are now over 20,000 different types.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.240
Altering even a single factor in the formation process, like temperature or water,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.960
can yield a different type of MOF crystal application.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.620
Forming Metal-Organic Frameworks, or MOFs,
can be quite challenging...

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.860
often it was done at high pressure, with high temperature, and with toxic ingredients.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.580
I don't want to use any toxic materials,
so myself and colleagues, we started looking at ways

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.360
to make them kind of at room temperature.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.960
The material we were using is a completely new material; it's sort of a super material.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.860
We had a metal, which was either zinc or terbium,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.680
and then we had an organic ligand 
that would bridge the metal nodes,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.240
so we get that crystal framework.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.980
In their quest to confirm which factors 
produce a more perfect MOF,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.820
JJ's team decided to experiment
with the ultimate variable: gravity.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.240
Crystals normally have defects in them, and these defects occur because of dust,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.460
or it gets too hot or too cold.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.020
And so NASA wanted to see how they grow in the perfect conditions of outer space,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.040
where gravity isn't sort of changing things.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.500
So when we grow crystals in that, we don't have an up or down, and the crystals can grow in every direction,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.320
very cleanly and uniformly.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.992
But finding a low-gravity lab to experiment in 
would be expensive and difficult.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.680
So JJ and his team considered other alternatives.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.670
Looking at this experiment, we thought, 'you know,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.800
we could use a centrifuge,' 
but that only increases gravity.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.776
We can throw it off a building, which we did,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.740
but it's quite quick and quite darty.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.520
We could use a drone, 
but we had to get a professional drone pilot,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.860
and there's limitations on how high they can fly.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.400
We could toss it out of a hot air balloon,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.440
but a) we'd have to not hit anybody, and b) we'd have to find it after we drop it.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.960
and so we decided we had to jump out of a plane.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.420
The experiment was designed to have three scientists skydive, and inject samples once in freefall.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.060
We were in freefall for about 30 seconds.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.220
We jumped, you'd go down really really close to 0g,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.780
you have an air cushion, and you're at 1g again.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.380
We had two guys on the ground.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.239
They ran over, grabbed the samples, spun them down and washed them to stop the crystal growth

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.080
so we wouldn't get any artifacts.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.560
It was a really smooth operation.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.560
And the results were clear: low gravity yielded 
larger and more perfect crystals.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.620
Their customizable crystalline structures create huge surface areas that become a chemistry playground.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.520
Think of it this way: if you unfolded 
just one gram of a MOF,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.860
it would cover an entire soccer field.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.660
That's why they're considered miracle materials: 
the larger the MOF you're working with,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.100
the more gasses you could theoretically store or chemical reactions you could catalyze.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.680
That's why they have such exciting potential, 
from carbon capture to artificial photosynthesis,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.500
to even next generation batteries and electronics.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.260
Big, perfect crystals are important for everyday life, for pharmaceuticals, for energy.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.480
So the more perfect they are, the better 
you can separate toxic molecules;

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.260
and we could also use them as sensors and detectors.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.000
If you have some toxin or some cancer molecule,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.300
it could go in those pores and tell you that this person's sick, or they've been poisoned, or something like that.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.860
So this research potentially has has impacts all over.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.200
The good thing with some of the research we're working on is that it will help everybody across the world,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.920
rather than very small segments of society

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.680
and we really want to have that broad positive impact.
