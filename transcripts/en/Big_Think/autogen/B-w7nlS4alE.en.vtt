element which is novelty so relatability
 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.890
element which is novelty so relatability
isn't very good if it's all boring its

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900
isn't very good if it's all boring its

something that's new it was a survival
 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.870
something that's new it was a survival
mechanism from prehistoric times and we

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880
mechanism from prehistoric times and we
 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.430
mechanism from prehistoric times and we
saw something new it was a potential

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440
saw something new it was a potential
 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.490

um and so when we see something new our

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780
um and so when we see something new our
 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.960
um and so when we see something new our
brains line up that city of our brains

brains line up that city of our brains
lumen ated it's going like crazy but if

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810
lumen ated it's going like crazy but if
 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.780
lumen ated it's going like crazy but if
something is too novel it becomes

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790
something is too novel it becomes
 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.270
something is too novel it becomes
confusing to our brains um if there's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280
confusing to our brains um if there's
 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.240
confusing to our brains um if there's
too much novelty we either get scared or

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250
too much novelty we either get scared or
 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.729
too much novelty we either get scared or
disinterested and our brain starts to

disinterested and our brain starts to
 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.320
disinterested and our brain starts to
shut off and go into a survival

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330
shut off and go into a survival

those first two elements there is this

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100
those first two elements there is this

great Venn diagram between relatability

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590
great Venn diagram between relatability
 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.699
great Venn diagram between relatability
and novelty and that sweet spot where is

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709
and novelty and that sweet spot where is
 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.650

it's relatable enough that we feel

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660
it's relatable enough that we feel
 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.360
it's relatable enough that we feel
comfortable being transported into that

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370
comfortable being transported into that
 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.789
comfortable being transported into that
world but it's novel enough that it

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799
world but it's novel enough that it
 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.140
world but it's novel enough that it
keeps our interest but it doesn't go too

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150
keeps our interest but it doesn't go too
 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.420

this should be pretty obvious right on

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769
this should be pretty obvious right on
 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.590
this should be pretty obvious right on
the tension is something that carries a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600
the tension is something that carries a
 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.920
