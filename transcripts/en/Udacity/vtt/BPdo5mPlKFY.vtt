00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For these next few problems, we're going to introduce a new tool for us to work with. Springs!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Springs are a whole lot of fun, and we can use them to make all sorts of fun things

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
like trampoline and spring scale.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We can even use them to protect people if elevator cable snapped,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and springs add all sort of fun problems to physics, so we're going to do a few those now.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But first, I just want to introduce a few of the concepts we are going to need

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to understand how springs behave.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
To make sure we're all in the same page for our discussion of springs,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I want to go over some of the assumptions we make when we're talking about springs.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We are going to assume that we can either compress springs like this or stretch them like this,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but we're not going to deal with springs being pulled and angled like this.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, you can actually handle problems like this in physics but that's a bit beyond a scope of this class.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're going to assume that the spring only moves in one dimension.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It can either be squished or it can be pulled on to extend it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're also going to assume that the mass our spring is 0 so the mass was springs

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and that doesn't seem very realistic, but it's really a helpful assumption for solving our problems.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And it turns out that in many cases, the mass of the spring is pretty small

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
compared to the masses of the other things we're dealing within the problem.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This assumption isn't the terrible one but just know

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that if you're doing super realistic problems, we couldn't say the springs are massless.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
One important concept we'll need in our discussion of spring is the idea of equilibrium length,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and to see what this is, let's look at a few examples.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
First imagine that we have a spring here that no forces are acting on.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Nobody's pulling it or pushing it or anything like that.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Even though it's not being pushed or pulled, it has some natural length that it likes to be at.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It may be 10th of a meter or something like that.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We called this natural length of the spring, the equilibrium length.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now, if we pull on the spring or push on the spring to compress it or extend it,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
then we're going to change the length of the spring away from the equilibrium length.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And the amount that the length of the string changes, we called Δx.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Δx is the change in the length of the spring away from the equilibrium length.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It is important to note that both extending the spring and compressing the spring

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
can change the length of the spring away from the equilibrium length.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
All right. Now, we're ready to talk about energy.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If you push a block against the spring, you'll notice that you have to fight keep it in that same spot.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It wants to bounce back in the other direction.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Similarly, if I try and pull on the block extending the spring, it tries to pull back to the other direction.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now, if I let the block go, in either the case when I'm compressing the spring

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
or in the case where I've extended the spring, the block is going to accelerate

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and go bouncing back and forth, which means that it's gaining kinetic energy.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And if the blocks gained kinetic energy, that energy must to come from somewhere,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and it turns out that energy was potential energy stored in the spring,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and you'll notice that the more I stretch the spring, the more dramatically, the block will rebound.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In other words, it will have more kinetic energy if I stretch the spring further or compress it further.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This means that the energy stored in the spring, the potential energy,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
should probably scale with the distance away from the equilibrium length, and in fact, it does.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It turns out that we can write the potential energy stored in the spring

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
as 1/2 times some constant k times Δx² and remember that Δx is the difference

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
between the spring's current length and it's equilibrium length.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Now, this constant k is something that's particular to the spring itself.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It's a measure of how stretchy or stiff the spring is.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Then you may be wondering whether this equation came from.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm afraid I'm not actually going to derive it for you because that requires calculus,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but I will say that it is not a mathematical coincidence

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that this equation looks a lot like the equation for kinetic energy.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That's the topic we can discuss more on the forms.

00:03:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
All right. Now, I think we are ready to do a few problems using springs.
