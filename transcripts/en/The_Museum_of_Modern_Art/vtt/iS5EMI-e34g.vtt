00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.570
Yannyck: This for fights for freedom, expression,
liberty, death, you know?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.090
Launching, happening, and still trying to
get freedom.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.330
So this is expression of a black liberation,
black activism.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
So you have Sojourner Truth over here.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.320
That acting, I mean, leading the black people
to the freedom.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.369
You have Frederick Douglass.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.940
Booker T Washington.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.750
You have Carver here.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.360
My name is Yannyck Kao Sy from MoMA.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm an artist.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.640
An activist too.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.760
Esther: So this is Charles White's first mural
called "Five Great American Negroes."

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.899
I'm Esther Adler.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.170
I'm a curator of the Charles Wright retrospective
exhibition.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.960
The Chicago Defender, which was an incredibly
important African-American newspaper, both

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.000
at the time and remains so today, does a survey
among its readership.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.759
And I think the question posed is who the
readers think the five greatest race leaders

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.240
of their time are.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.210
Marian Anderson is maybe my favorite selection
in this painting.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.439
Marian Anderson was denied the right to perform
at the Daughters of the American Revolution

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.090
Hall in Washington, DC.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.539
And Eleanor Roosevelt famously gets involved
and makes it possible for her to perform on

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.229
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.549
[singing] Marion Anderson: “My country tis
of thee…”

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.889
Esther: White has included her kind of fresh
from the pages of the newspaper in this massive

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:46.060
tribute to the accomplishments of African-Americans
in United States history.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.200
Toyin: The thing that really strikes me is
how unforgiving he was about layering.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.819
Like he was really like, he trusted himself
a lot.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.799
Like I wouldn't go as far in some of the parts
he did with the eyes, but he was like it's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.820
gonna look like an eye.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.680
Gosh, I mean, this part, are you kidding me?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.840
This is when you know he's just flexing.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.190
I think a lot of people think you only use
one type of tool to get this image.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.190
It's like no.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.580
He must have used like five different pens
with this.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.330
Different widths obviously, different degrees
of color.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.750
Esther: The furrow in the brow, and that kind
of look into the distance.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.060
It's like he's giving them space to process
the world.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.031
I don't think he was trying to put a rosy
face on anything.

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:33.390
I think he was incredibly aware of the injustice,
and the suffering, and the exact hardship

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.670
of being black in America.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.390
But I think he was also aware of the incredible
resiliency, and strength, and I think will,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.811
to change things, that he certainly had, and
he saw reflected in his community.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.020
[singing] Harry Belafonte: “I don't want
no bald-headed woman.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.440
She can be mean, lord, lordy, she too mean.”

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.220
Esther: Charles White meets Belafonte when
they are both young up-and-comers in Harlem,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.460
and they meet through this advocacy group
called the Committee for the Negro and the Arts.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.900
And it's a group that's really aimed at changing
the way that African Americans are presented

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.960
and perceived in popular culture.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.110
This is a drawing that Harry Belafonte commissions
White to make essentially of him in performance.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.960
Toyin: This is so good.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960
It's kind of insane.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.380
I'm speechless.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.100
I'm quite seriously speechless.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.600
[singing] Harry Belafonte: “Lord, lordy,
well bow your head.”

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.680
Toyin: It's like the face is so exact, but
then the body is loose.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.240
Esther: This kind of shape of the body you
get, this kind of curvature, is really reflective

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.510
of what Harry Belafonte's body looked like
when he was producing song,

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.900
the sense of that kind of spirit, that intense
emotional power coming from within is something

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.730
that I think White captures perfectly.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.200
[singing] Harry Belafonte: “Hold that line!”

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.020
Esther: He uses it as the image to open up
his television special.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.160
Television announcer: “Tonight with Belafonte.”

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.120
Esther: It's an entire hour on CBS that's
given to Belafonte to kind of program as he sees fit,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.500
which is kind of incredible at that moment
for an artist, especially a black artist,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.979
to have that kind of creative control.

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.120
Harry Belafonte: “Many of the songs which
our children sing, at least many I'm familiar

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.389
with, is written by a man who spent most of
his life on the chain gang.”

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.729
Esther: That opportunity to work with Belafonte,
to get the drawing out there and to make it

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.639
so available to so many different audiences
that way was really an incredible one,

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.159
and I think one that made White up his game.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.520
I think he did believe very strongly that
African Americans were the people to make

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.330
the change that they wanted.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.680
Oversized hands are really something that
White becomes known for.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.820
And I always think of it as being a sign of
agency, the idea of showing that these were

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.711
fully realized figures who were doing things,
who were accomplishing things, who were I

00:04:57.711 --> 00:04:59.819
think leaders to be reckoned with.

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.479
Toyin: To me, that's the most gorgeous hand
I've ever seen.

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.659
I mean, look at the tips.

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.069
Goodness gracious.

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.289
Like it's really hard to get something that's
so stylized, but yet feels so natural.

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.569
Even that slight highlight right there.

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.169
He really must have worked his way to get
that distinction between the hand, and the

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.169
sweater, and the pants.

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.780
Like that's really difficult to do in a monochromatic
palette.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.969
Esther: He's taking oil paint out of a tube,
and he's thinning it down incredible with

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.449
turpentine, with solvents, until it's really,
really thin.

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:37.520
And then he's using rags, and Q-Tips, and
sticks to draw with the very, very thinned-out paint.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.680
Once you make a mark with that oil wash, you
can't take it back.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.280
Esther: He really thought of it as a drawing.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.220
Toyin: Are you kidding me?

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.600
This is incredible.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.139
This actually makes this piece so much more
interesting to me because he must have really

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.330
tried some different things.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.620
Esther: I think because you're seeing the
marks made originally, and then the marks

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.650
layered over it again and again, there's a
sense that there's more in there, more encapsulated

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.610
in the work than we may be seeing at first
glance.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.889
Laura: I'm Laura Neufeld.

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.749
I'm an assistant paper conservator at the Museum
of Modern Arts.

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:16.030
You can capture images that help you see more
closely kind of through the paint.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.669
Esther: He's wearing a sandwich board, and
the sandwich board just says "Now."

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.910
Laura: You can see the "Now" very clearly,
and then you can that he had ruled out a second

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.910
line of text.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.500
Esther: He had initially thought about putting
another word underneath "Now."

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.849
Laura: We can clearly see a J. You can see
what's probably an S. And then two letters

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.349
that he seemed to start, and then change,
and then he abandoned this altogether.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.710
Some people say Jesus.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.270
Some people say justice.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.560
Camera Woman: What do you think it is?

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.020
Laura: Hmmm...

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.300
Toyin: Joseph?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.320
Or Jesus?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.480
Laura: There was actually a source photograph
published in a book that this image originally

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.490
came from.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.439
Esther: It's called “Black and White America,”
and it's by the German-American photographer

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:02.789
Leonard Fried.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.520
And it was a book that he put together of
lots of different photographs he had taken

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.999
of African-Americans in various parts of the
United States.

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:16.610
You can see right here the image of the "Black
Pope," or the figure who then White makes the

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.610
“Black Pope.”

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.210
Toyin: It's the catalyst for what it's gonna
become, and it's like I'm not interested in

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.210
this image.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.900
I'm interested in it going through the filter
of you and what comes out of that, right?

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.170
And all kinds of stuff gets attached to that
image.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:35.039
And when it comes out and regurgitated, it's
this amazing like presence of a man with glasses.

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:37.800
Like aviators never looked so good.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.080
He may have even come to this around the 70s
or maybe even later that he's like I don't

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.220
have to create everything for something.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.680
It can just be for me to explore.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.520
And that's a freedom that not a lot of artists
of color have.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.740
Everything had to have a purpose, right?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.539
We have to fight for pushing forward of things.

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:56.979
And he was finally saying I just want to do
this as an artist.

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:01.139
And that's something that we are now just
getting the privilege to do, but he was already

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:02.169
fighting for them.

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.599
So I think that's pretty amazing.
