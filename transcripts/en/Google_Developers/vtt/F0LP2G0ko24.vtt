00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.930
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of GDL-IL--

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.210
GDL Israel.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.270
Today we're going to go over
real briefly on several

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.220
updates and news that I gather,
and I'll try to share

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.210
with you some of the useful
links that I'm

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.875
using day in, day out.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:32.110
We had this week here in Campus
Tel Aviv, a great event

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.400
on Google Cloud and all the new
features, services, and

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.680
new APIs that you
could leverage.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.500
And I'll put in the show notes
the links to one other

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.710
recording from this event, and
second, the presentation, so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.840
even if you missed it, you
will be able to check the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.190
videos, and of course,
go with the slides.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.430
So without further ado, let me
just share my screen with you

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.470
and let's jump right in.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.380
This is a place where I'm trying
to gather old and new

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.030
cool things that are happening
in Chrome platform, in Chrome

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.095
environment.

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:14.580
Now for those of you that are
not aware, today Chrome is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.735
quite a huge platform.

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:20.170
It's not only the browser, which
is very, very popular

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.600
and conquering more and more
users every day, it's Chrome,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.120
Chrome on Mobile, of course
Chrome on Android, Chrome on

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.590
iOS, Chrome in Google TV, and
of course, Chrome in all

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.590
laptop, desktop, mobile
devices, and tablets.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.250
So from four inch screen size up
to 70 or 90 inch TV, you've

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.540
got Chrome there
as a platform.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.550
Not to mention Chrome OS with
all the great new devices,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.800
like the Pixel and the
Chromebook and the ChromeVox

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.650
that letting you enjoy this
powerful ecosystem.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.880
So this is the site.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.690
I'll try just to put it maybe a
bit bigger here, so for the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.330
ones of you that watch
it afterwards--

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.350
let's just do that.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.820
So this is the link.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.150
And one of the very new, cool
things that I put here is some

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.830
summary of all Chrome
use that are

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.600
happening around the world.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.790
And we just touch about
a few of them.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.700
So first and foremost is this
great source that if you are

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.900
not aware of-- it's Peter
Beverloo blog, and he's one of

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.240
the powerful, great guys out
there that is bringing to us

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.500
all the latest and greatest in
terms of what's going on in

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.910
Chromium Open Source Project.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.270
So if you want to save yourself
the trouble of going

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.430
and do a commitdiff and trying
to check and see what are all

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.390
the thousands of contributors
or hundreds of contributors

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.780
are doing inside Blink,
Chromium, et cetera.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.690
Peter is bringing us almost on
a weekly basis all the latest

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.930
and greatest in terms of news,
and as you can see here, there

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.030
are some very, very
nice things.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.920
Some are really important, like
we going to have now a

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.050
new, fancy dinosaur on all the
offline page in Chrome.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.780
Let me make it bigger so
it will be better.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.230
Yes.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.530
So this is a very important
one, of course.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.100
But there are some real
important features that you

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.460
might want to check and see how
they are influencing your

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.510
mobile web app or your desktop
next development or project.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.780
So this is one source--

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.030
Peter.sh.

00:03:42.502 --> 00:03:46.410
Let me put it a bit bigger here
so you could all see it

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.800
later on nicely as well.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800
So this is the site.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.120
Definitely register to his RSS
feed or just check out the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.420
blog from time to time, because
you get a great, great

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.440
summary of what's going on
inside the Chrome kingdom.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.970
Another great source, that
basically it's just a few

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.750
other links over here, is
Chrome Release blog.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.300
So I got this week few questions
from developers--

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.300
how can I be updated about
new channels that are

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.850
being pushed live?

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.280
And as you all know, Chrome is
being updated every six weeks.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.470
And in this Google Chrome
Releases blog--

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.460
this is the URL, of course--

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.740
you could just keep yourself
updated on all the new things

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.100
that are happening and
are going out there.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.070
It could be the dev channel
[INAUDIBLE], it could be the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.120
beta, it could be their release
candidate, and of

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.010
course, the final versions
of Chrome.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.430
And one of the nice things here
is that you could also

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.410
register yourself to
certain labels.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.360
So if you, let's say, interested
in Chrome for iOS

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.010
or Chrome Better Version,
because you want to test

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.680
things automatically before they
are being pushed to their

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.650
final version, you could just
go, and as you see here, very

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.020
easily go on a specific label
and just keep yourself update

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.650
with this specific
type of Chrome.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.950
Other useful links are here.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.700
The official Chromium blog and
Chrome blog, of course, and

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.220
for those of you that are active
on G+, you probably

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.830
want to follow Chrome on G+.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.860
Another great source that
I found from time

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.360
to time quite helpful--

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.280
it's an unofficial source, but
nevertheless, it's bringing

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.070
some new, exciting things
into your place--

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.640
is just this blog which called
Google System Blog post.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.290
Again, it's unofficial blog, but
from time to time, I find

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.540
myself checking out what's going
on here, and they're

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.850
pretty good at catching and
updating what's going on in

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.100
Google ecosystem.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.960
In terms of what happening in
the past month-- so I had this

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.700
really cool event about startups
and the slides are

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.030
here, so you are most welcome
to check them out.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.420
Except that we did several very
interesting GDLs in July.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.080
If you want to test the water
and see what is Compute Engine

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.060
and what is all about, please go
ahead and check this link.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.680
Let's open it and see.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.670
So this is basically a short
tutorial that I put and it's

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.970
part, of course, of GDL-IL
series, which lets you test

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.800
the water if you will.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.690
On Compute Engine,
quite quickly--

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.290
it's written here
five minutes.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.460
I guess that for some of you,
it will take even less.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.280
If you're taking out all the
manual process of putting the

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.150
billing in place, then very
quickly you could launch your

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.190
own virtual Box.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.730
It might be CentOS, might be
Debian, and quite quickly you

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.980
could work and be productive
on it.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.810
Some very, very interesting
things--

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.370
here are all the five easy steps
that you need to follow.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.380
And another very important
link that I would love to

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.638
share with you is the
cloud.google.com.

00:07:08.638 --> 00:07:15.000
Basically on this one URL, we're
trying to gather all the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.460
vast, enormous actually,
offering in our Cloud

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.800
resources, products,
and solutions.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.420
So quite quickly, if you're
going to this one link, you

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.740
could click on Products and
see all the different area

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.810
that you could utilize
and leverage.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.875
And in our specific
case-- let's jump

00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:34.500
in to Compute Engine--

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.330
quite quickly you could see what
are the benefits, what

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.660
are the main features
that you gaining.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.780
If you wish you compare it with
a current Cloud provider

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.700
or a current, let's say, private
Cloud that you are

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.860
using or any other different
solution, quite quickly here

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.330
you could find what will move
the needle for you and then

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.280
follow up on it and make sure
that this is the right tool

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.750
for the job.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.770
One click here and you could
try it, and it's again

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.730
something very, very cool to
check out, specifically, if

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.810
you have cases where Google App
Engine is not support your

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.970
specific technology.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.580
Without mentioning names, I met
big company that's still

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.260
using Perl in production, and
of course, Google App Engine

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.750
would be a good solution
for them.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.195
But they definitely wanted to
test and check Compute Engine

00:08:27.195 --> 00:08:29.730
because their working with
Debian in production, and then

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.510
it might be a perfect
solution for them.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.299
BigQuery--

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.860
it's another very interesting
big topic.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.620
If you have terabytes of log or
any other big data that you

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.770
want to check, here in this
episode of GDL-IL, I just show

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.250
you how you could work with
BigQuery from JavaScript, and

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.280
most specifically from
Appscript, and be productive

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.825
with it and analyze your
enormous data.

00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:02.690
It's quite amazing to see
BigQuery these days, because

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.760
in that specific example, we
showed how you are slicing and

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.810
dicing more than 400 gigabytes
of data from HttpArchive and

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.220
basically getting for some real
interesting insights in

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.060
terms of trends on what
going on the leading

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.990
sites on the web.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.475
So this is the place where you
want to check it, BigQuery

00:09:25.475 --> 00:09:29.400
Power With JavaScript, and quite
quickly here you could

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.490
see how easy it is to work with
simple SQL statements

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:40.430
like these that are returning in
less than a few seconds and

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.450
letting you have some
interesting thought and

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.390
results out of it.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.620
In this specific example by the
way, we are going all over

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.730
Wikipedia and just seeing what
are the most popular topics,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.430
articles basically, that's
being changed.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.980
And here you can see the
leading of the table.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.720
And this is the example that I
mentioned about HttpArchive

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.350
and how you could utilize
this specific

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.072
big data with BigQuery.

00:10:12.072 --> 00:10:14.860
Last but not least is, of
course, what I mentioned--

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.440
yesterday, we had a big Cloud
event, and this is

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.090
the summary of it.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:24.700
And you have here the slides and
of course more than three

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.300
hours of talks that you are most
welcome to just watch and

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.910
see what's interesting
for you.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.910
So let's see, today as
I promised, we're

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.490
going to keep it short.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.720
We have a few people
here that I see.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.690
If someone have any questions,
now is a perfect time to ask,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.780
and if not, just please feel
free to reach out on me on

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.260
GBlast, Twitter, or
any other channel.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.900
Let me put here, again, just so
you could see what is the

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.050
best channels.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.780
So on G+, of course, it will be
GreenIdo in one word, and

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.290
on Twitter, it will
be the same.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.400
Just use whatever channel you
feel comfortable with.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.980
And of course, we have here down
at the bottom a summary

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.610
of all the GDL Israel episodes
that we had in the past.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.790
Quite a lot of really good
content here, so if you

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.830
interesting in design, in web
components, HTML5, Chrome,

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.900
Chrome OS, Angular, and more and
more, just feel free to go

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.670
here and check it out.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:37.280
So until next time, thank you
very much for joining me.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.380
And I hope that you'll have
a very productive week.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.630
Bye bye.
