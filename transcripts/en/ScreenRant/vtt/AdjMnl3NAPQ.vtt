00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.049
once upon a time

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.709
It was easy to tell the difference between a disney and pixar film just by looking

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.739
Disney films were hand-drawn and Pixar was digital

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.350
And that was that well sort of but Disney hasn't made a film using hand-drawn animation since 2011

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.840
Disney broke Tradition with films like Zootopia and Pixar went into it to produce brave

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.280
it's been common for people to think they were done by the opposite animation house

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.039
Having worked together since the 1990s their similarities make sense

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.199
But since Disney acquired pixar in 2006, lines have had more gaussian Blur added to them

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.279
So we're taking a look at how to tell the animated works of Disney and pixar apart

Before I begin, can you guess the film from these emojis? Stay tuned until the end of the video to find out?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.060
Once upon a time or wouldn't it be cool if

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.410
Legendary Disney animator Glen Keane once said that the main differences between Disney and pixar can be seen if you reduce both to a single phrase

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.680
Disney would be "once upon a time" and Pixar would be "wouldn't it be cool if?"

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.420
the man saved us a lot of time there

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.959
We're just gonna head on home and what do you mean we've still got nine more entries? Oh, right.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.630
Well, we'll stay just for you but you better keep us company Disney is all about retelling fairy tales

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.929
And other old stories making them sweeter and more magical

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.630
It's their classic formula so much so that if someone mentions the little mermaid we don't think of Hans Christian Andersen

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.130
We think of Disney. Disney puts us into older more magical versions of our world

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.180
Allowing us more believability and transporting us to literal once upon a times'

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.139
Was it just us who believed that there used to be magic in the world thanks to Disney?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.160
I don't think so

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.020
Pixar's films are more about curiosity

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.720
If Disney retains magic within each frame then Pixar retains a sense of wonder

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.960
the ideas behind the films like monsters and closets, living toys

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.139
are all things that most kids have wondered about and yes, it would be cool if

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.460
The art is different

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.840
The most obvious difference between Disney and Pixar is the art

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.780
The films look different more recently

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.849
It's become harder to spot with films like Zootopia making it even harder

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.788
But there was a time when you could tell by the type of animation

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.400
They used if it was hand-drawn it was Disney

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.440
If it was CGI it was pixar, but then Disney had to go and confuse us by using CGI

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.000
Right, I'm sorry. I just, you lost me there

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.546
Even with CGI both retain different styles

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:31.340
Disney has updated its stylization of young women with heart shaped faces and large eyes

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.580
and men with large chests and large noses

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.360
They just can't get my nose right

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.427
No, seriously, why does nobody talk about that?

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:41.760
Pixar on the other hand are still pretty stylized and cartoonish

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.430
But they're also a bit more realistic

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.220
They focus more on things like textures, as can be seen by things like hair and flowing water

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.280
Everything within their films feels like it can breathe

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.080
The stylization of their characters tends to serve more of a purpose than Disney's do

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.600
Think about the characters and the Incredibles especially Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.200
Mr. Incredible has a large chin and a large chest while Elastigirl has a narrow waist and wide hips

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.260
Their superhero proportions, a homage to the comic books which inspired it

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.540
Pixar builds bigger worlds

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.310
It's not just the art bringing pixar's worlds to life. They build rich and complex worlds for their stories

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.579
They've managed to create stories which span the entire Galaxy

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.389
Taking place literally in space like Wall-e or in somewhere as small and intimate as a child's bedroom in the toy story films

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.640
Even when the worlds are completely alien to us, Pixar has a knack for making us feel welcome in them

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.760
Disney also builds worlds and their stories have been set worldwide and in all sorts of time periods

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.799
They give audiences a chance to sample whole new worlds

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.640
But we don't get to see a whole lot of these worlds. Generally we get to see inside the castle and the forest but not much beyond that

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.880
For the most part their films are set in maybe two or three locations

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.419
This can make the world seem much smaller than those Pixar creates

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.430
They're able to make it so that a single bedroom can feel massive due to the scale and sense of adventure

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.989
They're able to make us feel like the toys, and transform the room into an entire world

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.659
More recently Disney looks set to follow in their footsteps

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.268
As films like Moana and Zootopia build much larger and complex worlds than those before them

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.209
Pixar is more grounded in reality

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.160
Despite their films featuring some pretty outlandish things like talking fish, talking toys

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.260
And an entire world of monsters who come through kids closets in order to scare them as fuel for their own world

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.600
Pixar has a pretty good grounding in reality. They produce films about real people in situations which we can all relate to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.040
Even toy story felt realistic, and that is a film about talking toys

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.460
At its core it's a film about friendship

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.400
When Buzz lightyear comes along, Woody he finds himself replaced by his best friend

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.720
Buzz and woody are able to put their differences aside and end up becoming best friends themselves

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.680
The process of making and losing friends is something most of us are familiar with

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.340
They also touch on growing up and outgrowing your toys in the third film

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.200
It was nostalgic and heartbreaking to those who saw the film as teenagers or adults

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.060
Because it was a process we'd had to go through. We were Andy

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.900
Inside Out is set inside the head of an 11 year old girl, personifying her emotions

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.720
It deals with a reality of emotional health growing up and change

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.240
Oh, you caught us

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.660
And shows us how our own minds work

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.600
It was so good at doing that it's been used to teach kids about their emotions and mental illness

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.290
Disney is mainly fairy tales and old stories

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.880
Disney doesn't tend to do the realistic thing that's favoured by Pixar

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.840
While they are by no means limited to just fairy tales, it's definitely their structure of choice

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.820
Many of their films are adaptations of old stories like the Hunchback of Notre Dom and fairy tales like the Little Mermaid

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.400
They're unbeatable when it comes to fairy tales

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.200
To most of us fairy tales are familiar stories with familiar structures

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.900
They are some of the earliest stories many children read

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.040
This makes them perfect for family films because they're already loved and known

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.380
The three part structure and the archetypal characters also make them perfect for Disney to graft their own ideas over

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.760
They have a particular special affinity for princess movies and these are generally some of their most popular

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.160
You can get pretty much any product for the Disney princess on it from dolls to clothes

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.020
As of the summer of 2017 their Disney princess line totals Eleven princesses

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.780
This doesn't even include Frozen's Anna and Elsa who are currently being kept separate due to their popularity

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.920
It does however include Merida from Pixar's only princess film, Brave

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.520
Her inclusion only adds the confusion between Disney and Pixar

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.640
Bring back her heart

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.300
In this

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.040
Disney uses Villains

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.639
Due to Disney's much older story template, their films almost always feature a villain

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.360
This is likely because older stories stuck to the idea that one evil entity is to blame for all the worlds wrong

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.580
And hence, all the conflict in a person's life

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.960
It is what the villain does that drives the plot and causes all the problems for the protagonist

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.660
Disney is about good versus evil. In sleeping beauty none of the story would have even been possible if not for Maleficent

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.920
She curses Aurora and causes the events of the film and as such in the end has to be defeated so good can triumph

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:11.180
It's only been in the past five years or so that they have really started to become a bit looser with this and follow Pixar's murkier morality

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.500
Pixar uses antagonists but even then they aren't the sole cause of conflict, like in life it's all just circumstance

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.200
The antagonist just adds more drama to the film as a result there are no quick fixes by defeating the bad guy

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.780
The problems just have to be dealt with

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.340
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not and idea we promote on my planet

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.740
In toy story the main problem is the conflict between Buzz and Woody and how they chose to deal with it

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.600
Sid was just there to up the stakes

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.720
We have steak, pasta, what are you hungry for?

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.120
Tony Rydinger

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.980
Shut up

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.480
Well, you are

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.180
That's it

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.100
Pixar's characters are more relatable

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.620
Pixar's realness can also be felt in their characters they go through real situations

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.060
But they also act in the way real people might act

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240
This is about Dash

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.360
You want to do something for Dash? Then let him actually compete, let him go out for sports

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.959
I will not be made the enemy here

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.060
They face tough decisions in situations none of which seem outlandish and they respond to them in perfectly normal ways

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:18.120
The director of Finding Nemo, Andrew Stratton, confessed he had based Marlin on himself because raising a child is tough work

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.520
The traditional pitfalls of parenting are presented as ocean reefs and parties with sharks

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.460
and many parents can relate to the sheer panic and protectiveness that Marlin has over Nemo

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:33.200
like most of the parents watching the film with their own kids, he would literally go to the end of the Earth for him

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.920
they really capture the reality of the human experience in their films and are great at presenting loss whilst making us really care about it

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.020
the first few minutes of Finding Nemo establishes the loss of Marlins wife and all but one of his children being eaten

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.560
and it hits at our own fears and the reality of losing loved ones

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.280
this kind of thing is rarely seen in Disney films except for more recent ones

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.599
Moana's feelings towards the loss of her grandmother and her desire to go out into the world to find who she really is

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.750
are relatable to most audience members

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.120
Disney doesn't really make sequels anymore

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.180
it used to be that you couldn't swing a cat around without hitting a new Disney sequel

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.040
It was especially painful for parents who found they had to hide them in the attic so they never got to see the light of day again

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.880
The film's not the kids, that would be illegal

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:24.780
From 1994 to 2008 Disney released at least one sequel to a classic a year and 2005 had five sequel releases

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.500
Since then Disney has produced a handful of shorts and Made-for-TV movies which could be called sequels

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.700
like Tangled Before Ever After which is the pilot pretaining to the series

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.260
but the only official sequels they've made since then are in the tinkerbell film series

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:44.220
that being said, Disney's currently working on a sequel to 2013's frozen so that looks set to change

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:50.560
In that time Pixar have put out a number of sequels most of them were far more successful than any of Disney's

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.240
with Cars 2 being the first to receive a bad review

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.740
Both Toy Story sequels were consistently well received by fans and critics alike

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.769
And it looks like Pixar is keen to continue with the sequels

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.820
Having released Finding Dory and Cars 3 recently and the long-awaited the Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4 in the next few years

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.420
Leave the singing to Disney

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.660
Music is a serious part of filmmaking and both Disney and Pixar know it well

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.400
It's vital for mood, atmosphere, character development and storytelling

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.400
Pixar is well known for the beautiful compositions which accompany their films

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.480
Their work has been scored by everything from pop to orchestras

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.673
they capture the mood of the film and each individual scene perfectly

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.480
Do you know what they don't tend to do? Sing

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.660
They leave that part to Disney.  The majority of Disney's classic movies are musicals

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:43.640
And they have put out countless hits most of the songs are now so iconic that everybody knows them, most of them off by heart

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:50.380
And they make for a really good time on the karaoke machine not to mention a sing-along with each repeat watching, we can't get enough of them

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.920
The songs are essential to the storytelling, giving us key parts of the story and character development

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.240
Take I'll make a man out of you from Mulan as an example here

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:05.500
as the song goes on we watch as shang actually manages to do just that as Mulan and the rest of the Chinese army gets stronger and better

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.620
And you know what, we kind of feel like you made a man out of us too. Now on to defeat the Huns

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.360
Look I'm Picasso

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.720
I don't get it

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.920
You uncultured swine

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.840
Comedy

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.440
Okay, so we aren't exactly defeating the Huns here

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.860
but in this entry we're going to look at something that Disney and Pixar actually share, a sense of humor

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.020
You married Elastic Girl, and got BUSY!

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:36.600
Both of these companies have a knack for getting laughs out of the audience and they both have a particularly special knack for adult humor

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.360
didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.180
Yes they did

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.300
We all know Disney films are family films and many a staff member at Pixar has said that the movies

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.060
they make are just as much adult films as they are for kids

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.420
Every Disney and Pixar film from the Disney Renaissance onwards

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:59.320
Has been laced with adult jokes, which have left adults laughing while kids sit there completely and utterly oblivious to it

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.700
