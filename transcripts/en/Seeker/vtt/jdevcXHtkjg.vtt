00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.700
I’m about to tell you how to win an argument,
but before I break into psychology and debate

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.490
tactics, why not try my personal winning strategy
that actually got me this job.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.740
[crying]

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.150
Hey master debaters, I’m Jules for Dnews,
and… you’re wrong.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.859
I’m sorry about that, but you’re simply
incorrect.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.329
I challenge you to prove me otherwise.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.330
Argue your point, change my opinion.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.079
Chances are, you can’t.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.661
Not because I’m alone in a studio and screen
all my phone calls, but because, according

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.830
to neuroscience, it’s really difficult to
win an argument.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.110
That is, if you define winning an argument
as “effective persuasion”.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.960
It turns out arguing and persuading are incompatible
goals for most people.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.710
Psychology professor Drew Weston headed up
a study in 2004 where researchers took supporters

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.920
of George W. Bush and John Kerry and showed
them videos of their preferred candidate contradicting

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.920
himself.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920
1

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.840
Simultaneously, the participant’s brains
were scanned in an MRI machine.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.870
When subjects were shown videos challenging
their beliefs, the part of the brain associated

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.689
with logic and reason, the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, didn’t light up very much.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.119
However, the orbital frontal cortex, the anterior
cingulate and the posterior cingulate all

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.289
lit up, and those areas are mainly associated
with emotion, conflict resolution, and moral

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.329
judgement.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.530
Instead of processing whether or not their
beliefs were right, the subjects instead processed

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.079
how the information made them feel, and how
to resolve that incongruence.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.479
As soon as they figured out how to justify
the incorrect information without challenging

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.869
their own beliefs, so maybe something like
saying that the candidate accidentally misspoke,

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.570
their brains released a bunch of dopamine
as a reward and made them feel great!

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.450
Even when presented with evidence challenging
their beliefs, the subjects resolved their

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.399
internal confusion without being persuaded
to change their minds.5 And we know this rings

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.789
true even outside of the laboratory.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.249
According to research by another psychology
professor, John Gottman, roughly 69% of the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.450
things married couples argue about are never
resolved and are perpetual.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.390
Most of the time, arguing doesn’t solve
anything.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.050
But hey, you came here to learn how to kick
ass next time you argue, not learn about why

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.869
arguing is messy and stupid.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.360
So how do you actually win an argument?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.200
Well, by not arguing1.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.890
Yeah, I know, it sounds like I’m promoting
the abstinence theory of debate, but hear

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.890
me out.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.400
Arguing is a war; it has a winner and a loser,
and nobody wants to be a loser.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.250
Being wrong is okay as long as nobody knows
it, but if you have to admit that you’re

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.989
wrong, AND change your behavior, you’re
probably going to look for any possible reason

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:31.989
not to.

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.310
The real trick is to make an argument look
as little like a war as possible.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.910
And you know who’s really good at that?

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.900
FBI hostage negotiators.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.170
The FBI uses a method of persuasion known
as the Behavioral Change Stairway Model, and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.390
it actually only consists of five steps.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.370
Step One: Actively listen.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.459
Show your opponent that you are taking in
what they’re putting out.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.160
Step Two: Empathize.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.840
Let them know that not only do you understand
where they’re coming from, but you understand

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.650
how they feel about their position.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.959
Don’t dismiss feelings or negate their experiences,
even if you disagree.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.989
Which you probably do.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.110
Keep all those adversarial feelings bottled
up for now.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.989
Step Three: Build a rapport.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.049
Once you’ve shown them that you understand
how they feel, now you want them to understand

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.370
how you feel.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.430
Because if you both lay all the cards on the
table, then you can trust each other, or at

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.840
the very least, they’ll trust you.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.890
Step Four: Influence.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.280
This is the first place where you’re going
to actually make your point after building

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.550
a strong foundation of empathy and trust.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.920
If you’re both listening, then you can start
problem solving with them, not against them.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.599
And finally, Step Five, which is less of a
step and more of a conclusion: they change9.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.019
For the FBI this means they surrender, but
for you, it might mean you get to stay out

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.620
past curfew, or get the wallpaper you like,
or eat 200 hot dogs in an hour, whatever floats

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.620
your boat.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.489
Pretty much all of those self-help books about
arguing follow these same basic steps, because

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.689
in the end, the thing we most want to do when
someone tells us we’re wrong, is almost

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.590
always the exactly wrong thing to do.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.909
We can’t do episodes like this without our
sponsors.

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.890
If you listen to music and podcasts and are
looking for a new Bluetooth speaker, check

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.870
out Monster’s reimagined boombox, the Monster
Blaster.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.080
It’s available for monthly payments starting
at $25.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.919
The Monster Blaster has the power to bring
music to life indoors and out.

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.220

So now you know how to win an argument, congratulations!

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.310
Too bad Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump didn’t
watch this video before their debate, but

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.940
do debates even matter in the first place?

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.460
Watch me talk about whether or not they can
actually affect the election in this video.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:48.690
But it 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.780
is impossible for some people to see eye to
eye?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.740
Are conservative and liberal brains actually
different?

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:15.210
Find out in this video 
by Tara.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.310
