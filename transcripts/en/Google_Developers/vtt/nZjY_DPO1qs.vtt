00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.542
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Welcome to release 7.8

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:08.510
of Google Play Services.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.280
You are here because you
want to build better apps,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.020
and that's exactly
what Google Play

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.930
Services is all about-- allowing
you to build better apps.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.230
Let's get started with the
highlights in this release,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650
because we are excited
to present some really

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.310
new cool stuff.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.490
Let's start it off with--
yeah, that's right.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.250
We have a new API.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.760
Let's welcome the Mobile Vision
API with a round of applause.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.590
The new Vision API enables you
to build really amazing things.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.090
One part of it is
the Faces API that

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.800
allows you to detect faces
and different characteristics

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.410
of faces in images or
even in real time video.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.070
So here, for example, are
some of my friends working

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.970
at Google.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.080
And as you can see, the
location of all of their faces

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.840
has been detected
by the Faces API.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.480
And faces can be detected
in different angles too.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.860
It doesn't have to be
oriented straight forward.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.560
It can, for example,
be tilted and turned

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.150
and all the other
possible positions

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.620
that you can see here,
but that I don't have time

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.240
to perform with my own head.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.050
And once a face
has been detected,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.750
you retrieve the
different landmarks

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.900
in the face-- for
example, the location

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.800
of the eyes, the mouth,
the cheeks, the nose

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.970
space, and even the ear tips.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.850
How cool is not that?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.630
And believe it or not, you
get even more with this one

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.880
is my favorite.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.300
You can detect whether
certain facial characteristics

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.500
is present using
classifications-- for example,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.730
if an eye is closed
or open, or how

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.430
much smiley-ness the face has.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.386
For example, this here
would be close to zero,

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:49.210
but this one would be a
smiley-ness close to one.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.410
And remember,
since the Faces API

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.970
can detect these things
in real time video,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.200
you can create really cool apps.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.550
Let's look at one in real life.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.670
So here I am,
sitting on the sofa,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.850
trying out an app
that uses the Faces

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.270
API to detect if my eyes are
open and whether I'm smiling

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.000
or not.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.064
Let's try it out, starting with
eyes closed and not smiling.

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:13.980
FACES API: I detect that
your eyes are closed.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.710
Please open your eyes.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.560
That's beautiful.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.500
You should always
keep your eyes open.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.290
Now wipe that grumpy grin off
your face and smile instead.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.800
Lovely.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.860
Smiling is good for you.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.200
You should always smile.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.340
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Amazing.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.030
As you may think now that that
was it for the Vision API,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.920
but it's not.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.210
You get even more, because
in addition to the Faces API,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.970
the Vision API also
has a Barcode API.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.820
So pretty much in the same
way that you can detect faces

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.910
in images or videos, you
can also detect barcodes.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.950
So go out there and create some
great apps with the Vision API.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.330
And remember, it has both a
Faces API, as well as a Barcode

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.970
API.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.560
And it can detect things
in images as well as

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.960
in real time video.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.540
In this release, we also have
announcements for Google Cloud

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.380
Messaging where we have
expanded notification

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.990
to support localization.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.460
So you can now construct
notification messages

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.260
that will be displayed using
the locale of the device it

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.160
is sent to.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.350
And to get ready for
the Android M release,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.570
we've added high and normal
priority to GCM messaging.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.350
This allows you to set messages
that need immediate attention

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.350
to high priority-- for
example, a chat message

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.880
alert or an incoming
voice call alert.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.150
This brings us to--
yeah, that's right.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.570
It's time to announce another
new API in this release.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.070
Let's welcome the
Nearby Messages API

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.130
with a round of applause.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.580
Nearby Message is a
cross-platform API

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.960
to find and communicate with
mobile devices and beacons

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.360
based on proximity.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.730
You may recall that
in a previous version,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.520
we introduced a
Nearby Connections

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.280
API that allows you to
discover other devices

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.390
and create connections,
allowing them

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.190
to communicate in real time.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.580
Great for local
multi-player gaming

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.330
where players can
use their own device

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.740
as a remote control connecting
to a central game server.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.290
And now we're extending
the Nearby API

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.790
with the introduction
of Nearby Messages.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.440
Nearby Messages
allows your users

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.740
to find devices and
share messages with them

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.980
through a Publish
and Subscribe API.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.100
This allows you to build apps
with rich local interactions

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.220
between devices.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.870
For example, to collaborate
on content, forming a group,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.080
vote on something, or
broadcasting a resource.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.900
So how does Nearby Messages
send these messages?

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.330
Well, first of all, it can use
the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signals

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.020
to connect and exchange data.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.110
But it goes even beyond that.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.120
Ultrasonic sounds can also
be used to transmit messages.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.010
That's right.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.280
Sounds that we humans cannot
hear and that contains

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.330
the information.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.000
That's pretty,
pretty amazing stuff.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.290
And there's even more.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.980
This API is also used to pick
up information from beacons.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.420
So beacons are these devices
you can put up that broadcast

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.320
information through the
Nearby Messages API.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.670
And any device that is close by
can then pick this information

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.540
up and act on it.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.120
And that's it for this release
of Google Play Services.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.270
But be sure to check out
these resources as well.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.350
Now you have some work to
do to use these fantastic

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.790
APIs to build better apps.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.710
That's right.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.500
Go out there and
create some great apps.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.010
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.760
