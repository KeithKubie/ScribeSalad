FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
I'm Fantastic Negrito.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.390
There's only one Fantastic
Negrito in the world.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.565
I googled it before
I made the name.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.620
You better believe that I
did, and there was none.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.670
And then I knew that
name was for me.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.100
It's very hard getting up here.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.060
Because despite being a
self-absorbed recovering

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.430
narcissist, I love
being up here.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.455
But it's terrifying.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.930
So I had to do my
thing in the bathroom.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440
I have a routine.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.880
And I will play some
songs from the album,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.170
"The Last Days of Oakland."

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.190
This song is kind of
like a therapy session.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.605

[MUSIC - FANTASTIC NEGRITO,

00:04:09.638 --> 00:04:13.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:14.984
Thank you.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.810
It's obvious from that song
I have a lot of demons.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.010
I have a lot of
personal problems.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.050
But I'm willing to share them.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.390
And that's what makes this
whole experience so beautiful.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.590
I'm in a collective.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.100
I think everyone should
be in a collective

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.630
because I don't have all
the power, and that's good.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.440
In our collective, it's made
up of about-- now about five

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.150
people, I guess.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.160
But it started off with just
two street hustling criminals

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.250
turned into creative people.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.940
And we decided we'd
vote on everything.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.440
So we vote on everything.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.200
And I come out on the
losing end of that.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.612
I actually voted against
being on the NPR Tiny Desk

00:05:16.612 --> 00:05:20.010
competition, because
I thought just

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.820
my format didn't fit NPR because
I say bitch, nigger, pussy.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.930
I say all kinds of things.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.560
And I don't like political
correctness at all.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.650
It should take a hike.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.730
I don't want to be mean, but I
just come from a certain place.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.290
We all come from
different places.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.190
And I think when we can
share our experiences

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.820
and listen to each other,
then it's a real world.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.670
Speaking of the
collective, Malcolm

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.140
Spellman, who's
here today, said,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.040
you're a great songwriter.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.200
You pull people in.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.240
It's great.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.720
But if you want to
connect with people,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.340
I need you to stop writing
about yourself all the time.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.730
So thank god he did that.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:20.490
And so he taught me to go out,
go to the streets, the Bay

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.830
Area, and watch people, not just
attractive women, because I'll

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.030
do that, like all the time.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.235
I'm sneaky too.

00:06:32.235 --> 00:06:36.360
If I'm wearing shades, that
means I'm looking at you.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.180
So it was kind of like
don't call me again

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.430
until you have a song
that's not about you.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.296
And I came back with this.

 "LOST IN A CROWD"]

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.713
Thank you.

00:12:38.713 --> 00:12:41.530
Thank you.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.890
That was called
"Lost in a Crowd."

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.850
I felt lost in the crowd,
singing about other people.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:49.985
I wanted to sing about me.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.520
I decided to sing
about my mother

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.320
on this last song I'm
going to do for you.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.910
It was a remake.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:05.630
It was a cover, something
I'm admittedly terrible at.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:11.640
I can't do covers because
I'm such a freak on a song.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.460
And I always want
to hear the artist

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.972
that I'm trying to cover.

00:13:16.972 --> 00:13:19.660
I say, if they sound better.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.725
So my idea was to take
a song that was in E

00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:27.090
and put it in F. Ah.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:32.625
And then I thought
to myself, when

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:39.630
they wrote that amazing,
great song that's a classic,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.680
they didn't put a bridge in it.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.190
So I put a bridge in it.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:53.730
And the song was
so meaningful to me

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:59.770
because it was a
lot about washing

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.221
my 14-year-old brother's
blood off the ground.

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:05.970
He was a victim of gun violence.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:11.200
And watching my
16-year-old cousin

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.800
lay in a coffin, and a kid that
I played with in junior high

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.570
grew up to be pretty
big time drug dealer,

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.500
which is what I
really aspired to be.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.070
I failed.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.920
And he was murdered
in a barber shop.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.500
And I always thought about
my mom, the look on her face.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.880
I thought about
my aunt, the look

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.230
on her face, all these mothers.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.340
And they bury their children.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.340
And I just-- I was like we're
like the greatest country,

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.440
we always say that.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.739
But I think too frequently
maybe this happens

00:14:50.739 --> 00:14:52.030
and people don't know about it.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:57.290
So I thought that the last
act of doing the cover

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:03.407
was to change the lyrics, just
half of them, half of them.

00:15:03.407 --> 00:15:05.490
Because I thought it was
just such a powerful song

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.420
and a powerful
message that I wanted

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:14.030
it to be relevant
to mothers who bury

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:19.426
their children, their babies,
which shouldn't happen.

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:20.800
So I thought of
my mother's face.

on, but we had MC Hammer.

to claim the Bay Area at all.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.230

the Bay Area all the way.

FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Does he all the way?

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.540
So I don't know
much about Tupac.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.120
And that was amazing.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.980
That was incredible.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.070
But with a lot of that
incredible creativity

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.300
and culture, there was
also a crack epidemic.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.640
And there was some tragedy.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.080
And sometimes things
that are amazing

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.640
come from things
that are tragic.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.756
So he calls me the bridge.

00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:35.880
I won't take credit for it.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.860
So I'm kind of like the bridge.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.937
And you know, I'm in the new
Oakland now making this music.

00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:43.520
And there's these
new people that come

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.230
and tech and all these
amazing new people.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.290
Let's say it out loud,
because I like to say it.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.950
A lot of the black
people are gone.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.200
I like to just say
things out loud.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.770
Some people say, like,
"that neighborhood."

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.603
I'm like, no, that's
the black neighborhood.

00:20:55.603 --> 00:20:56.740
They're gone now.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.680
Not all of them.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.860
I'm still here.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.970
But yeah, like about
25%, so it's different.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:05.967
For me, I can't front.

00:21:05.967 --> 00:21:06.800
It's very different.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.130
I think that I'd like
to say to both sides,

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:14.180
OK, the side over here, old
Oakland, that was amazing.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:14.790
That happened.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.840
Everything changes.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.660
We got to get with
this new Oakland

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.440
and welcome them in and be
excited to see them and find

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.665
out ways that we
can work with them.

00:21:24.665 --> 00:21:26.790
And I like to say to the
people in the new Oakland,

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:32.230
I like to ask them,
why's Oakland cool?

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.852
Somebody made it cool.

00:21:34.852 --> 00:21:36.143
Me-- no, not me, but somebody--

00:21:36.143 --> 00:21:38.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.274
Someone made it
cool, and there's

00:21:40.274 --> 00:21:42.190
a reason why you get
this feeling, man, you're

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.800
in the Bay Area.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.780
There's all these vibrations.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.920
And they're like, yeah.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.870
It's hella cool.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.470
You tell this--
There's a reason.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:53.767
People paid a lot of
dues and sacrificed a lot

00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:54.850
to make you feel that way.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:59.820
So be very respectful of
that and try to include.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.010
And then we all
find a way to try

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.900
to make it a really
delicious pot of soup.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.045
That's organic and all that,
but got some pig fat in it.

00:22:09.045 --> 00:22:10.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.370
The album is a lot about
my feeling of that.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.169
It's interesting because
I was in New Orleans

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.460
when I came up with that title.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:24.440
Because wherever I was
going in the US at the time,

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.120
it just felt like there
was this huge shift.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.880
It felt like people
weren't going

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.020
to be able to afford to live
in these really cool places.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.780
They're cool, and they
have coffee shops.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.270
And they're fancy.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.810
You know, it's going to be
boring in about 10 years

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.540
if you're not careful
about really understanding

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.146
why the city was
great, it was cool.

00:22:47.146 --> 00:22:49.020
When I went to Europe
just in the last month,

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.940
I kind of had the same feeling,
like in Paris and London,

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.920
especially.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.800
It's just super,
super expensive.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.350
And all the artists and
cool people are leaving.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.642
JAMES DRISCOLL: So what can
we do to keep Oakland cool?

00:23:03.642 --> 00:23:05.058
Because what's
going on in Oakland

00:23:05.058 --> 00:23:06.790
is also going on
in San Francisco.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.730
It's going on in New York.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.210
How does a place change
but keep that soul

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.430
that makes it so desirable,
that attracts people

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.880
from all over the world?

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.255
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Give us money.

00:23:16.255 --> 00:23:17.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.900
Let him answer that.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.470
JAMES DRISCOLL: By the way,
I want to introduce you.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.900
So this is Malcolm Spellman.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.710
He's a writer and
producer for "Empire."

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.330
And he came up with
Xavier, Fantastic Negrito.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.310
I'm going to let him talk
about that a little bit later.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.890
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Yeah,
we've been around each other,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.830
had very similar
trajectories in our careers

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.360
with the starts and stops,
his a little bit more

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.200
dramatic than mine.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.180
But that's why he's
the entertainer.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.644
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: That's
why I'm sitting here.

00:23:45.644 --> 00:23:47.060
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
I think you have

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.710
to be real about how
grim the reality is.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.370
Like, what he's
saying is important.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.080
There is a counterculture.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.505
Oakland's a city
of 300,000 people

00:23:56.505 --> 00:24:00.024
and has a national imprint
on the level of New York

00:24:00.024 --> 00:24:01.190
and Los Angeles, everything.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.820
And the Hells Angels
came out of Oakland.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.153
The Oakland Raiders came out--
you know what I'm saying?

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:06.370
That's done, right?

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.112
And now it's the remnants there.

00:24:10.112 --> 00:24:13.290
As these new companies
and new entities come in,

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:17.270
there's a value to
what's been driven out.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.320
And there should be a
sense of obligation.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.410
I think this country in
general, what makes it amazing

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.800
is we innovate and
we course correct.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.750
And we just do shit.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.070
Whatever it takes to
win, we do that to win.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:33.400
The problem with that is
we don't really believe,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.950
not in a national way, we don't
value tradition and culture

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.535
and ritual, whatever.

00:24:39.535 --> 00:24:40.910
And so I think
the first thing is

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.210
that we talk about how
you keep Oakland cool,

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.310
you've got to recognize most
of what was cool about Oakland

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.800
and this tiny city that had
this giant imprint is gone.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:59.360
And there's this giant
super entity coming in,

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.730
stomping something out.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.110
It's like this giant
comes into a town

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.920
and wants to save the
villagers down there

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.969
and is stomping on their
houses or whatever.

00:25:07.969 --> 00:25:09.260
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.426
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: And the
first thing you have to do

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:13.570
is fucking stop and
acknowledge there's

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.740
very little of this left.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:22.040
And then you ask them
what can be done now.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.060
If we encroach, if we come your
way, we're not of your world.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.880
We don't know-- and our
abilities and our movements

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.790
are so big and potent.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.350
We don't know how to
preserve what this is.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.595
It has to come, I think,
from the other side.

00:25:35.595 --> 00:25:37.470
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: I
think some of the people

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.913
are on the other side,
but yeah, he's right.

00:25:38.913 --> 00:25:40.496
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
Yeah, it has-- yeah.

00:25:40.496 --> 00:25:41.610
[LAUGHS]

00:25:41.847 --> 00:25:43.930
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: I just
said some of the people.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.160
You can't ask all of them.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.400
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Yeah.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.304
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: We
grew up with all of them.

00:25:46.304 --> 00:25:47.540
We know.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.330
JAMES DRISCOLL: So it sounds
like building bridges,

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.624
creating a dialogue,
having communication.

00:25:52.624 --> 00:25:54.790
And it seems like-- what
strikes me about your music

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.524
is art brings people together.

00:25:56.524 --> 00:25:58.065
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Yeah, that's true.

00:25:58.065 --> 00:25:59.920
JAMES DRISCOLL: You don't have
to have any amount of money

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.460
or be from anywhere to listen
to your music or any music

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.800
and be moved.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.450
And so how do you see
your music or just art

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.470
having the potential to
bring people together,

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.090
to start these discussions, to
stop the giants from stomping

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.420
on the people and just
build something together?

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:23.730
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Well, I
know that I overuse the word

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.690
honesty and authenticity.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.950
But I think that for
myself personally,

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.400
when I came up with the
idea of Fantastic Negrito,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.955
I thought, man, this is amazing.

00:26:32.955 --> 00:26:36.510
And I thought, why
don't I go and play

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.980
this music for the people
in the city that live in,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.360
the people that
don't to hear it?

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.690
And so what I would do--
that kept it honest.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.300
I'd go out at 5:00 PM.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.090
You'd go to BART, start playing.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.050
Hey, here's my song.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.230
They're trying to get home.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.380
And I think if I could
connect with those people

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.990
that there was-- that
connection was very real.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.240
Because these people, they
didn't come pay to see you.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.830
They want to go home.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.455
Or like 2:00 AM in front
of Colonial Donuts,

00:27:04.455 --> 00:27:05.860
after people have been drinking.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.230
They do not care about anything.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.220
But if you can
connect with them,

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.140
then there's something
in the music.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.530
And I think will all art and all
very creative people, I always

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:20.330
say this, is this is our time.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.850
If you're creative,
man, get busy

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:28.830
now because people need
you now more than ever.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.610
Because our so-called
leaders, whoever they are,

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.676
they're completely
bought and sold.

00:27:36.676 --> 00:27:39.400
And they listen to someone else.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.370
And they're not very
genuine, and they

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.370
don't have you in mind.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:45.720
But I think people
can look to artists,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.420
and it's our responsibility to
be the kind of light out there

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.450
and be willing to take chances--
something that we learned

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.390
from David Bowe, something
that we learned from Prince,

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.010
a couple of people that are
big influencers to me-- the

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.625
take chances artists.

00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:07.510
And people really need you.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.677
JAMES DRISCOLL: So thinking
about taking chances.

00:28:09.677 --> 00:28:11.010
The two of you are sitting here.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.000
You just came out
with a new album.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.470
Your profile the
music industry has

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.954
skyrocketed in the last year.

00:28:15.954 --> 00:28:18.370
You're writing and producing
one of the most popular shows

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.620
on TV.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.780
So you're pretty successful,
but you both came from Oakland.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.740
How did that happen?

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.040
How did your creativity
and your innovation

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.919
get you from there to here?

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:32.210
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: You mean
right here at Google today?

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.150
JAMES DRISCOLL:
Right here at Google,

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.620
where you are after this,
where you are on Monday

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.994
at a Bernie Sanders
rally playing

00:28:35.994 --> 00:28:37.240
for thousands of people.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.930
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Do you
want to talk about it?

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.430
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: It will take
up the rest of this interview

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.046
if I do it.

00:28:42.046 --> 00:28:43.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.130
For him, we had a
mutual friend in common.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:50.730
And we were being knuckleheads
in the industry to whatever.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.104
And he had an encounter that
was very, very dangerous,

00:28:54.104 --> 00:28:56.520
when we were caught up in the
streets, hustling, whatever,

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.200
right?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.210
And he had been really,
really attracted to music,

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.060
leading up to this time.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.180
So we knew each other,
weren't really tight,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.310
but we both had the
same best friend.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:13.580
And this encounter sent
him to Los Angeles, right?

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:18.860
While he was in LA, I ended
up getting into some trouble

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.080
out here also.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.600
And so a few years behind
him, with this best friend,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.520
me and his best friend
had to move to LA.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.970
We had to get out the Bay Area.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.970
During this time-- I'm
forgetting the exact time

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.895
frame or whatever-- he
got a huge record deal.

00:29:33.895 --> 00:29:35.770
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Bigger
than anyone else's.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.145
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
At the time, it

00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:39.900
was the biggest record deal
ever For an unsigned artist.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.920
And that turned into a disaster.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.660
And mind you--

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.920
--me and him hate each
other at this time.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.779
We have this mutual best friend.

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:51.070
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: We're
competing for the best friend.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.362
Look at me.

00:29:53.362 --> 00:29:55.570
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: While he
has his record deal going,

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.710
I break into Hollywood.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.150
I write a spec script,
sell it to Fox or whatever.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.640
And I'm now the hot
dude who came out

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.220
of nowhere in Hollywood.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.720
And I'm making it
as a screenwriter.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.053
And I'm a little bit behind him.

00:30:07.053 --> 00:30:10.310
His trajectory's ahead of mine.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:14.020
A few more famously tragic
things happen to this cat,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:18.160
beyond like the label
sort of not knowing

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.590
what to do with him and him
not being-- he was a kid.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.130
He was in his 20s.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.650
Him not having
enough of an identity

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:29.430
to penetrate the giant
label's lack of vision.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.840
And so he got shelved, then
got into a car accident.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.577
He fucked up his hand, mangled
his hand, his whole body.

00:30:34.577 --> 00:30:36.160
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
My hand is mangled.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.125
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Years
of rehab or whatever.

00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:40.441
For me, a similar thing
happened, less dramatic

00:30:40.441 --> 00:30:40.940
of course.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.940
But my career went dead,
completely out of Hollywood,

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.370
lost all my agents.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.220
Was not on the radar, whatever.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.720
And when he was in
the hospital, that's

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.070
when me and him got tight.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.120
It's just too real.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.620
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Yeah it was real.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.880
When I heard-- I mean, he
came to see me every day.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.476
I was in a coma three weeks.

00:31:00.476 --> 00:31:01.600
And Malcolm came every day.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.101
And I was like, wow.

00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:04.100
That was kind of moving.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:04.940
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: I
hated this motherfucker.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.370
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: He hated--

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:05.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.420
I hated him too.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.542
I think we hated each other when
our eyes met in high school.

00:31:12.542 --> 00:31:14.018
I was like, I hate him.

00:31:14.018 --> 00:31:15.250
He was like, I hate him.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.550
We had a legacy of hate.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:21.340
And, yeah, so what happens
is I'm in this coma.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.002
I'm mangled.

00:31:22.002 --> 00:31:23.210
Man, I have all these braces.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.890
I look crazy.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.770
I used to walk up to
your apartment sometime,

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.960
because we were
not too far away.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.514
So then I decided to get into
the illegal nightclub business.

00:31:32.514 --> 00:31:33.430
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Yep.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.910
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
And so I'd open up

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:35.715
these illegal nightclubs.

00:31:35.715 --> 00:31:36.896
And everybody would come.

00:31:36.896 --> 00:31:38.020
Celebrities would all come.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.709
But they'd open at midnight and
close at 6:00-- best parties.

00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:42.250
Best parties.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.270
And I only got arrested once.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:48.380
And he was kind of part of it.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.910
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Motherfucker,
yes, I was part of it.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.310
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Yeah, he was part of it.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.194
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Instrumental.

00:31:53.194 --> 00:31:54.078
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
I'm a terrible--

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:55.410
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: [LAUGHS]

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:55.610
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: I'm terrible.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.193
I'm the worst.

00:31:56.193 --> 00:31:58.060
But I was still growing
as a human being.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.240
I was very mean.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.320
But let's get past that part.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.350
And then I took the--

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.350
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Let's
get you back to Oakland.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.240
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Oh,
back to Oakland already?

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:06.613
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Yeah.

00:32:06.613 --> 00:32:07.360
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
We're back to Oakland.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.740
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: And has a kid.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.890
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: I had a kid.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:12.098
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: And I'm
slowly rebuilding my career

00:32:12.098 --> 00:32:14.670
in Hollywood, which is
extremely difficult.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.530
And the kid inspires
him to start

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.295
playing music or whatever.

00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:20.089
And we have now
become like brothers,

00:32:20.089 --> 00:32:21.130
you know what I'm saying?

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:25.100
And we were already family, but
now we operated like brothers.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:30.486
And we had a pot thing
going up in open.

00:32:30.486 --> 00:32:32.110
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
We had a very nice--

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.623
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: This
is the kind of guy I am.

00:32:34.623 --> 00:32:36.123
He was like, all
right, Malcolm, I'm

00:32:36.123 --> 00:32:38.470
ready to go all the way
in with the music thing.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.030
And I gave up my half
of the weed organization

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.050
and gave-- I was like,
just let that fund you.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.530
Because of his background,
he struggled a lot as a kid.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.110
And he was out on his own.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.030
He is terribly
uncomfortable with help,

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.301
and he is terribly
uncomfortable with the idea--

00:32:55.301 --> 00:32:56.800
like when he sits
here and tells you

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.420
guys about having
a collective, it

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.570
took a lot for him
to get to the point

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.940
that he would be able to admit
I have these people who support

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.670
me, and I can't move without.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.950
And even when I said, yo, dude,
you can take over this thing,

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.850
and you can keep the
money, he was like, naw,

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:15.350
naw, I'll pay you
back, don't worry.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.933
I'm going to give
you this money back.

00:33:16.933 --> 00:33:18.990
He wouldn't let it be a
partnership initially.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.080
He starts making this music.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.990
He grows more and
more comfortable.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.720
We started battling
over the music.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.580
Again, as a
creative, I think one

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.010
of the things that got him in
trouble with the record deal

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:34.840
is Xavier likes a lot
of music and if you

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.800
let him go will just
play a lot of everything.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.740
His first album
sounded like what

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.050
his fifth album should've been.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:47.530
And so my job was to pin
him down and say, yo dude,

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.560
you know, we're old now.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.454
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
We're damn old.

00:33:51.454 --> 00:33:53.120
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
It's time to get real,

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.022
and if you've got to
put something out there,

00:33:56.022 --> 00:33:56.980
what do you want to do?

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.980
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: I
remember that conversation.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.660
He asked me what I wanted to do.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.240
Because we'd grown all the weed.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.020
That was great.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.950
It was great for
a lot of you too.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.984
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:09.525
We had the best weed
in the Bay Area.

00:34:09.525 --> 00:34:11.550
That's what they would say.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.034
It's always the best with us.

00:34:13.034 --> 00:34:13.909
It's always the best.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.719
Get used to it.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:18.100
And I remember.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.750
He was like, man, you know, you
should get back in the music.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.150
And I wanted to
get back into it.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.139
But I was terrified.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.780
And he's like, what
do you really like?

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.940
And I said, what
do I really love?

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.148
Really at this point I'm
listening to this black root

00:34:30.148 --> 00:34:33.110
stuff, this old
black roots music

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.739
that, say, my grandfather
and her one armed brother

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:39.360
used to listen to on the porch
in deep Southern Virginia

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.790
when I used to visit them,
drinking Johnnie Walker

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.469
Red and grape juice.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.134
I said, I'm listening to that.

00:34:45.134 --> 00:34:48.719
But I couldn't imagine that
what my take on that would be.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.320
And I couldn't imagine that
anyone would be interested.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.590
But the good thing about
being in a collective

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:57.490
and not having all the
power is that I really

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:00.730
had other people, such
as Malcolm, mainly--

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:06.180
Malcolm all the way, actually--
to help guide me so I wouldn't

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.739
go off and write an opera.

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:09.530
Because I'll do that
and be like, oh, look,

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.970
I wrote an opera.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:17.510
And that really helped
Fantastic Negrito stay on track,

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:22.010
and it was good to be
challenged and someone

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.840
could tell me that sucks.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.010
I grew up with you.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.500
We robbed people together.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.100
We did this together.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.645
And I know who you are.

00:35:30.645 --> 00:35:32.520
You buried your brother,
like shit like that.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.990
I'm like, aw, man,
why'd you say that?

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.790
Now I hate you, really.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:47.200
And it helped the songs remain
very genuine and edgy, as I am

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.600
and as the Bay Area is.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.470
I think everyone should
join a collective.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.850
Google, become a collective.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.850
It's better.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.308
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
It fancies itself

00:35:58.308 --> 00:36:01.410
as a collective, a giant,
world-conquering collective.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.240
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Yeah, world-conquering.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.850
I really learned as
a creative person

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.460
that you erally-- I
remember, I was 40 years,

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:09.280
and it just hit me.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.610
I was like, damn, you
can't do this alone.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.859
You young people,
don't wait till your 40

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:14.650
to figure that out.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.030
Because it's just stagnation.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.610
I mean, I was such
an ego maniac.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.555
I mean, I still am,
but I'm in check now,

00:36:20.555 --> 00:36:22.500
you know what I mean?

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.980
I just couldn't believe
that you needed people.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.470
I'd grown up on
the streets, man.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.970
I left home at 12,
and I never came back.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.090
My father died, whatever.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.910
I see my mother
again when I was 19.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:36.480
I was an independent dude.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.310
So yeah, the power of sharing.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.440
It's amazing.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.290
Share that power.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.933
You can't do it alone.

00:36:44.933 --> 00:36:46.320
JAMES DRISCOLL: You're
talking about sharing power,

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.778
but you're also
sharing your music.

00:36:47.778 --> 00:36:50.794
And it makes me wonder
what your intention is.

00:36:50.794 --> 00:36:52.210
One of my favorite
lyrics of yours

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:56.490
is, "I'm trying to rehabilitate
from the self-hate."

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.710
Is music just a catharsis, a
way for you to heal yourself?

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.050
Or is it something more?

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.430
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Some
people call them gigs.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.300
I call it therapy.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.520
For me, it's just therapy.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.090
It's like it's a platform where
I can be completely naked.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.250
And that's why I have such
terrible stage fright,

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:19.000
and it always takes so
much to get up here, man.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.480
Because it's probably the
purest that one can catch

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:30.800
me is up there,
singing those songs.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.030
And I found out,
which I always think

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.974
everything's about
me-- what I found out

00:37:34.974 --> 00:37:36.640
was that it was helpful
to other people.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.220
And then I latched onto that.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.410
And I said, see, look.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.890
I'm doing something good.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.470
So yeah, so I
think it's probably

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.780
therapeutic for everyone.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.650
Because there always has to be
someone who will say it-- it.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.190
I'll say it, even if it
makes people uncomfortable.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.040
It's OK.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.700
JAMES DRISCOLL: I'm
wondering, Malcolm, for you,

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.294
you're an artist as well
with what you write.

00:38:01.294 --> 00:38:02.210
What's your intention?

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.510
Is it also rehabilitation?

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:05.710
Is it making money?

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.700
Is it connecting with people
and trying to change the world?

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.699
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Yeah,
I make money to get him.

00:38:09.699 --> 00:38:10.684
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:10.684 --> 00:38:11.760
No, It's different.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:19.891
It's twofold because I
feel like on "Empire,"

00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:21.140
that is an entertainment show.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.990
And it does investigate shit
that people need to see.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:30.310
Like, it was a big deal for
a young black gay character

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:31.816
to come out in that world.

00:38:31.816 --> 00:38:36.230
But the primary imperative on
that show is entertainment.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.140
It's fun.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.630
And that's what we have
to do first and foremost.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.880
When I'm working with
him, and again, my job

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.804
is mostly to--
but it's creative.

00:38:45.804 --> 00:38:46.970
It taps into the same thing.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.345
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Very creative.

00:38:48.345 --> 00:38:53.150
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: When I'm
working with him, it's fun.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:57.230
It's very, very gratifying
and challenging because he

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.510
is a dude, like-- you guys
have probably heard the story.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.810
I've been around
for a long time,

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:06.190
and I know what's real with
this dude and I know what's not.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:11.250
And I know when he's resisting
the layers that he has.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:17.590
And so, creatively for me, it is
about wrangling this dude down

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:23.250
and trying to find a
specificity and something that's

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.390
all his own-- get
him into something

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.760
that's very specifically his.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.120
Because when he can do
that, at that point,

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.440
and when you're in the
realm of true honesty

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.080
and not being guarded and
letting some shit just

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.140
go out there or whatever, the
specificity of your own stuff

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.760
is actually universal.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:47.050
So for me, guiding thing
is specificity and honesty

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.100
from him.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.843
And I do consider that a
creative process, even though--

00:39:51.843 --> 00:39:54.156
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
It's very creative.

00:39:54.156 --> 00:39:56.150
I think it's the hardest
thing in the world

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.950
to do for-- stop
yawning or get out.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.790
I'm just kidding.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.950
It hurts my massive ego.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.460
Being honest.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.830
But I do love you though.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:11.090
So does Jesus!

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:14.140
And all the other gods,
they all love you.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.990
So yeah, being honest is
the hardest fucking thing

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.190
in the world, at
least it is for me.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:22.340
But I think that
it is universal.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:28.500
And we need help getting there
or we self-destruct on pills,

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.126
liquor, drugs.

00:40:30.126 --> 00:40:32.500
I mean, the entertainment
business actually kills people,

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.770
if you think about.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:34.832
Kurt Cobain, just Prince.

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:36.040
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Kind of me.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.370
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Who?

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:36.690
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Me.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.620
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Him, he's
dying right now, right in front

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.920
of you.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.980
No, it's a killer.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.830
Because-- I don't know--
they commodify your soul,

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.320
your spirit, and that's weird.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:56.076
And being creative is
a very sacred task.

00:40:56.076 --> 00:40:57.575
But when it's mixed
with capitalism,

00:40:57.575 --> 00:41:01.910
it becomes weird quick.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:02.949
AUDIENCE: Buy my album.

00:41:02.949 --> 00:41:04.740
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
[CHUCKLES] Buy my album.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.169
Buy my soul!

00:41:06.169 --> 00:41:07.710
JAMES DRISCOLL: So
where do you think

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:12.670
the balance is between being
creative, creating connections,

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.940
and the reality that we do have
a capitalism system, society

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.000
that we live in?

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.670
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: I
think you just better

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.460
have people to help you.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:28.780
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Yeah,
again, that's me and him.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.234
And I think you have to
understand you compromise

00:41:33.234 --> 00:41:34.150
as little as possible.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.690
First of all, you understand
the price of compromise.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.380
And it's great.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.310
It is to be successful
on a high level.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:46.130
Like, every single
ring of success

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.760
ultimately is a massive amount
of compromise creatively

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.860
and integrity to get there.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.670
So for us, what
we cherish, is we

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:59.100
don't allow anyone to talk
about hits, record sales, data.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.580
We don't allow none
of that shit so

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.700
that if anyone
comes to us, what we

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.160
hope is going to happen, with
the reaction to his music

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.370
is that if we are pure
while he's in that studio,

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.060
and that it does not matter
if one single person likes

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.890
this song or whatever,
he can stand behind it.

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.030
It's real.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:18.040
It's got its own sound.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.830
It was all done in 100% earnest.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:26.440
You take that out to the world,
and then the compromises begin.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.330
But in the studio, there are
zero, zero, zero compromises.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:29.900
He can cuss.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.870
Oh, won't be on the radio.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:31.453
It's too long.

00:42:31.453 --> 00:42:33.170
It won't be on record.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.300
No compromises in there.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.040
Then you take it out to world.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.880
What the world is
recognizing when

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:45.320
they see this dude is
that vibe and that-- I

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.860
don't if the word-- culture,
whatever, that's behind it.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.390
And that allows us-- you
do have make compromises.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.610
When he goes on a
stage, he might not

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:57.410
be like-- if you all were
going to give this man 50 grand

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.740
and said but you can't cuss,
he's not going to cuss.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.156
Those are the
compromises you make

00:43:01.156 --> 00:43:02.860
because that's after the fact.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.130
So you see what I'm saying?

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.700
Once you leave
the studio, that's

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.880
when the compromises begin.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.415
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: That's true.

00:43:07.415 --> 00:43:08.080
I agree, yeah, 100%.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.621
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
What we don't allow

00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:11.964
still is any conversations
about the money

00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:13.130
it takes to feed his family.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.510
They cannot come into
the creation stage.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.719
All that has to happen
outside of the creation stage.

00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:24.384
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Yeah, because
you can't underestimate people.

00:43:24.384 --> 00:43:25.800
I mean, by just
feeding them over

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.600
and over again this formulaic
cookie cutter music that you

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.200
hear, or movies that
you see, that people

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.630
are a lot smarter than
marketers think, I believe.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:43.562
They want to hear
all kinds of things.

00:43:43.562 --> 00:43:46.020
JAMES DRISCOLL: So one theme
that I heard from both of you,

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.260
especially in talking
about your stories,

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.380
was rebirth-- from
the car accident,

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.380
from the lives that
you guys were leading.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.472
How do you see rebirth
playing into your music?

00:43:58.472 --> 00:44:00.430
Do you have the intention
for the audience that

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.346
here's your music to
feel some kind of rebirth

00:44:02.346 --> 00:44:03.600
within themselves?

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.612
Do you feel like
Oakland needs a rebirth

00:44:05.612 --> 00:44:07.070
or it's in the
middle of a rebirth?

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.737
Or did Oakland not even
die in the first place?

00:44:09.737 --> 00:44:11.070
What do you think about rebirth?

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.750
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: That's
a lot to think about.

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:15.043
You gonna have a rebirth?

00:44:15.043 --> 00:44:16.010
OK.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.290
Get ready.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:18.670
No, I don't think about that.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:23.087
I think about contributing.

00:44:23.087 --> 00:44:24.170
That's always my big word.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:28.640
I mean, as a human being,
all of us have this value.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.530
And we all have an experience.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.750
And what makes a great
family, which is what we are,

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:37.175
whether we want
to be one or not--

00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:38.550
we're kind of this
human family--

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.320
is that we all contribute.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.380
And so I think what I get out
of it-- you can cut me off

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:55.050
in a minute-- is just a
contribution to people.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.180
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: But I think
particularly because his story

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.600
is a literal like--
the story of rebirth,

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.585
that's what I'm most proud of.

00:45:03.585 --> 00:45:06.330
Way more than working
on successful shit,

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.322
I'm proud that I
survived and got

00:45:08.322 --> 00:45:10.780
to a point where a lot of people
dropped off and got there.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.280
But I don't only care about
that because it's screenwriting.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.440
For him, this story
of rebirth, I think,

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:22.120
is probably the primary thing
because people of every age

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:26.175
or whatever are failing
and giving up on dreams.

00:45:26.175 --> 00:45:28.330
And I've seen-- this
dude has a heart.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:31.900
When he tells a story, he likes
to be the hero of his stories,

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.840
and sometimes he talks
about, oh, you know.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.350
I left Interscope
and [INAUDIBLE],

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.270
and I never gave up.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.800
But that's actually not true.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.150
He literally gave up.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.710
First of all, he almost died.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:44.320
He got--

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.452
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: That
was almost, though.

00:45:46.452 --> 00:45:47.812
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: That's true.

00:45:47.812 --> 00:45:49.520
He did not give up
when they were talking

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.700
about cutting his arm off.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.100
But he sold all his music.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.350
I'm telling you, I've seen it.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.000
He sold all his
musical equipment.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.930
He used to call me up and make
fun of people who made music.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.040
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: [LAUGHS]

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:58.620
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: He'd be like--

00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.280
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: That's true.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.800
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: --fucking
idiots, making music.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.240
So that's how far he went.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.500
And I think that that's what
makes his message so potent

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.320
is because at the forefront
of it is true, true rebirth.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:14.260
And the fact that if a dude can
completely give up, and then

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.217
come back from that
in his 40s, whatever

00:46:17.217 --> 00:46:19.550
it is that we're harboring--
because we're all harboring

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:24.781
a lot of damage and stunted
dreams or whatever-- yes,

00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:26.030
that's what it's tapping into.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:28.110
That narrative of his
is tapping into the fact

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:29.997
that everybody in this
room, something died.

00:46:29.997 --> 00:46:30.955
It could be a romantic.

00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:33.990
It could be a dream
to have a business.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:35.030
Whatever it is.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:36.210
And there's always hope.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.918
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
That's why I have him.

00:46:37.918 --> 00:46:39.620
He thinks about all this stuff.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.244
He's much smarter than me.

00:46:41.244 --> 00:46:42.660
JAMES DRISCOLL:
Well, Malcolm, I'm

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.118
also interested in
your perspective

00:46:44.118 --> 00:46:47.990
on-- you write for a show
that's about making music

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:49.320
in the music industry.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.770
And then you're also
making music with Xavier.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.285
And how much does
reality reflect what--

00:46:54.285 --> 00:46:55.660
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
It helps a lot.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.700
It really does.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.530
You don't even know
that, but it is

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.720
watching what he goes through.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.550
When you're dealing
with Hollywood stuff

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.280
on a big level with
a giant production,

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.290
a dash of authenticity
goes a million miles.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:11.940
It really does.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.523
Because so much of
the shit that's out

00:47:13.523 --> 00:47:15.000
there is completely fraudulent.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.790
And it's still fun,
but you don't feel

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:21.246
like there was nothing there.

00:47:21.246 --> 00:47:23.120
It's missing those
details that make you say,

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.260
man, somebody really,
really touched on something

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.200
real at least in this moment.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.480
And dealing with him,
I'm able to a lot

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.870
of times infuse that
into the stories that

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:36.939
come out of that writers' room.

00:47:36.939 --> 00:47:38.522
JAMES DRISCOLL: Do
you watch "Empire"?

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.465
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
I do when I can.

00:47:40.465 --> 00:47:41.085
I do.

00:47:41.085 --> 00:47:42.260
AUDIENCE: When you're on it.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:42.970
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Yeah, when I'm on it.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:43.866
Naw, that's a lie.

00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:44.609
It's a lie.

00:47:44.609 --> 00:47:45.400
It's just terrible!

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.270
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: Ep 2, 15.

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.180
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: No,
no, I do when I can.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.200
I'm touring a lot.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.490
I binged on the first season,
some of the second season.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:55.820
I haven't even seen my episode.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.840
It's been so busy.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.910
I did like 45 days, 43 dates
in four different continents.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:02.800
I came back.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.250
Then I'm in San Diego.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:05.102
I'm in Los Angeles.

00:48:05.102 --> 00:48:06.185
It's kind of been nonstop.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.110
When I get my chance, I
watch everything that I can.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.790
JAMES DRISCOLL:
And with touring,

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.090
how does that affect
you as a songwriter?

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:18.230
Are you writing anything?

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:21.357
Or do you feel like you're so
depleted after working so hard?

00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:23.190
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: You
know, my saving grace

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.920
was always that I
could write songs

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.400
over and over and over again.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.320
So the songs are always there.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.670
They're not always good,
but they're always there.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:38.940
So I think touring can help.

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.520
You're in a different country
sometimes every other day.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.430
And there's a lot to
take from that experience

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:50.660
and traveling, watching
people, interacting

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.052
with different people.

00:48:52.052 --> 00:48:53.510
And just playing
the songs, I mean,

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:59.940
I just came off a tour where I
was playing in symphony halls.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.000
And that was bizarre.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.916
You know, you're sitting
there with the guitar

00:49:02.916 --> 00:49:06.570
at the Royal Albert Hall and
all these different places.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:11.490
So that has a really
different dynamic.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:15.300
JAMES DRISCOLL: And has your
opinion or feeling about people

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.430
just in general change
from touring and playing

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:19.409
in front of so many
people, sharing your music

00:49:19.409 --> 00:49:21.950
with so many different audiences
in so many different places?

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:24.241
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Well, I've
definitely learned a lot.

00:49:24.241 --> 00:49:26.010
And I give Chris
Cornell a lot of credit

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.320
because I just sat
and watched him

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.570
because I was opening for him.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:32.679
I was like, this is
so weird, sitting up

00:49:32.679 --> 00:49:33.720
in front of these people.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.690
It's kind of like this.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.280
They sit down.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.390
And people don't usually
sit down at my shows.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:41.400
So it was an education.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.810
You get to test out how
good your songs are.

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:47.110
Because these are like
Scandinavians, Germans,

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.500
Viennese-- what are
they, from Vienna?

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.580
Those people.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.290
Croatians, all kinds
of different people.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:55.740
So you're definitely
learning how

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:59.850
to deliver it, how to put
your own story into it.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:01.850
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: What
about the people have you

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:06.200
noticed like from when you
broke in and had nobody.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.350
You were playing Van Cleef
or whatever, then Tiny Desk,

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:11.140
and touring to now.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.160
What do you see coming
at you as far as who's

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.160
listening to your music?

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.795
Or has that surprised
you, who likes

00:50:15.795 --> 00:50:17.889
your music, who jives with it?

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:20.430
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: I always feel
like my audience is thirsty.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:21.970
I think Field came up with that.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:22.610
That's Field.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:24.680
He's another guy in
the collective, the guy

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.612
with the shiny dome back there.

00:50:28.612 --> 00:50:30.100
[LAUGHS]

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.260
We all love each other.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.510
Yeah, I think they're thirsty.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:38.170
I look at my audience,
no matter what country

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:40.380
it is, they want something.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:44.340
And I think they
may have opinions,

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.840
and they want someone to say it.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.570
Of course, from "Empire,"
now we get all the brothers,

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:51.390
get like all the tough guys.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:52.640
I'm like, damn, they come too.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.464
That's interesting.

00:50:54.464 --> 00:50:56.680
They'll be like, man, I
don't even buy music, man,

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.390
but I'm buying your shit.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:59.370
And that's cool.

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:02.930
So sometimes my
shows can be odd.

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:05.100
You see grandma and teenagers.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.770
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: That's a trip.

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:07.424
That is a trip.

00:51:07.424 --> 00:51:08.840
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
It's these kids

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.820
like-- the kids will
be like, I've never

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.250
seen anything like this before.

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.810
And then the old
people are like,

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.860
I remember when they
played songs like that.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.310
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
You get uncomfortable

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:16.320
when little kids are
there too, right?

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.180
FANTASTIC NEGRITO:
Say that again.

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.072
MALCOLM SPELLMAN:
You get uncomfortable

00:51:18.072 --> 00:51:19.410
when little kids are
there sometimes, right?

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:20.530
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Yeah,
because sometimes I

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.600
wonder if-- I don't know
if they're ready to hear

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.550
some of the content.

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.450
But sure they are.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.210
There's people who
bring their kids.

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.630
And I'm like, wow, you're
bringing your kids.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:32.880
Because I wouldn't bring mine.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.590
Because this guy is fucked up.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:37.820
But it's good.

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.630
Maybe that's good.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.250
Maybe we need to
see fucked up as

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:43.160
long as it's not evil
or trying to get you

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.826
or anything like that.

00:51:45.826 --> 00:51:47.760
It's part of the spectrum.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.480
So when you have kids,
all that changes.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.290
You get nervous.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.350
But no, I have a very
interesting audience,

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:56.510
I'll say that.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:59.275
[WHISTLES] All over.

00:51:59.275 --> 00:52:00.650
JAMES DRISCOLL:
Well, given that,

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.066
thank you so much
for coming today

00:52:02.066 --> 00:52:04.530
and for sharing
your music with us.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:07.020
Keep making a lot
more of it, please.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.880
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: Thank
you so much for having us.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.480
JAMES DRISCOLL: Cool, thanks.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.688
FANTASTIC NEGRITO: All right.

00:52:09.688 --> 00:52:13.030
[APPLAUSE]
