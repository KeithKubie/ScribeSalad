00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670
In this unit I'm going to introduce you to 3 computer problems

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.670
that will actually turn out to be quite challenging.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.910
And I'm going to do this by introducing you to 3 computer scientists, Alice, Bob, and Carol.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.820
All 3 haven't yet had the chance to learn theoretical computer science or about challenging problems.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.600
Maybe they just didn't have the time or didn't think it was useful to them.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.460
But they're all pretty good practical computer scientists.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.360
So they have experience in programming, and know their way around basic algorithms.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.630
That's also why all of them work in very high-profile jobs.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670
Alice works in telecommunications; Bob works in biotech or bioinformatics,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.060
and Carol works in finance.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.650
Throughout this unit, you'll learn more about the problems that Alice, Bob, and Carol are working on,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.850
and you'll also meet some additional computer scientists throughout this course.

00:00:48.850 --> 99:59:59.000
But let's focus on Alice first.
