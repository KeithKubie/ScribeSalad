TELLE WHITNEY: It is such
a pleasure and an honor

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.030
to be here today.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.370
I'm very committed
to technology.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.820
I'm very committed to being
a woman in technology.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.120
How many of you are?

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.780
Look around the room.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.790
There are so many people
that you can connect with.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.210
And connection is an important
part of, certainly, my story.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.050
This last week, I
had the pleasure

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.460
to meet with Melissa
Pierce, who's doing

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.450
a documentary on Grace Hopper.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.042
How many people know
who Grace Hopper is?

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:50.860
Oh, good.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.220
Well, you should know more
once the documentary comes out.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.710
Well, she and I were
talking about how important

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.090
it was in our lives to find
other women to connect with.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.470
I'm going to tell you
a couple of stories

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.530
about my own journey,
but also talk

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.060
about how to pay it forward.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.230
Everything that I do, I find
a way to work with others.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.755
That really, ultimately,
is what it's about.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.640
At heart of my story
is taking risks.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.070
The picture you
see on the screen,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.860
I was at the base camp of Mt.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.610
Everest.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.103
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:44.210
Something I had
always wanted to do.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.360
I was a technologist.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.310
I'm a computer
scientist by background,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.050
and I worked in the
semiconductor field.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.800
And I built chips.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.350
That's what I did, and
a lot of my self-worth

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.380
and self-awareness
was as a technologist.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.170
But there were not
very many women,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.000
and so I made a point of finding
women who I could talk to,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.910
even if they weren't in my job.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.110
And that's how I met Anita Borg.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.100
Anita and I founded the
Grace Hopper Celebration.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.030
Anita founded the Institute
for Women in Technology.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.950
She was then two years later
diagnosed with brain cancer.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.724
She had a great
board-- Maria Klawe,

00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:32.140
who's the president
of Harvey Mudd

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.510
and who was the founding chair.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.620
Bill Wolfe, who is the head
of the National Academy.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.100
But she needed help.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.420
But I was a technologist.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.860
So I was willing to help
her, but not step in.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.276
They did a search
for a president,

00:02:49.276 --> 00:02:52.369
but the financials--
they couldn't

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:53.410
attract the right people.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.600
So rather reluctantly, I
stepped in as interim president

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.910
in 2002 of June.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.180
And I have stayed.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.660
So not only did I take the risk
of going to an organization

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.020
that needed my help, I
took at will a left turn.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.930
I think that often, careers
are about seeing opportunities

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.830
and going for it.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.330
I have the best job on
the face of the planet.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.280
You know, nowadays I do
work with lots of people

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.540
who are starting non-profits.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.550
This last week I met with two
young men who are starting

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.170
a 501(c)(3) to have computer
coding camps at local

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.820
universities.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.480
When people reach
out, I make the time.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.080
Just like when I needed
it and I reached out,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.340
other people made the time.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.730
But I do often think that
we don't take enough risks.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.040
How many people can
remember that time

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.620
when there was something
that you really wanted to do,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.730
and you decided not to do it?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.980
Finding a way to
take that plunge--

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.730
I will encourage all of you.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:31.660
And as part of taking risks, you
want to ask for what you want.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.840
There's a great book
called Women Don't Ask.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.990
I would encourage each and
every one of you to read it.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.440
If you look at that negotiation
of that first salary-- I mean,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.690
men do it.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.290
Women don't.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.660
If any of you heard
Satya Nadella's comments

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.650
at Grace Hopper, you know
that you have the backlash.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.120
You know that women need to ask.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.750
You can see that
in this picture.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.210
This is Alan Eustace,
who's on our board, who's

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.590
at Google, with all these
people around him asking him

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.370
for help and advice.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.400
When I went to
Malleable Technology--

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.540
we built a voiceover
IP processor--

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.670
they gave me a good salary,
and they gave me stock.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.310
The CEO was somebody I knew.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.400
And once again, I
was taking a risk.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.910
I was employee number four.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.020
We had enough money in
the bank for six months.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.220
We built that organization.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.630
We sold it 18 months
later to PMC-Sierra.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.660
And I hired the vast majority
of the people in the company.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.930
So imagine my shock when we were
sold and the amount of shares

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.225
became public that my peer
on the executive team-- there

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:55.200
was three of us-- had
significantly more stock

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.830
than I did.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.035
I was hurt.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.836
I was ashamed.

00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:05.525
And I was so angry.

00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:07.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.590
And so I went to my boss,
this person who I was sure

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.210
was going to take care of me.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.120
He knew what kind of
contributions I was making.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.600
He knew how significant
my contribution--

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.200
and the entire part of
developing the company was.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.650
I ask him, why?

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.740
Tell me.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.140
And he said, you didn't ask.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.990
Since that day, I
really make it a point

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.990
to understand what I
want and to really decide

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.390
what it is that I'm asking.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.540
But perhaps more
important-- and this

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.770
gets back to the
fundamental belief

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.420
that you have to
pay it forward--

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.960
I talk to others about it.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.890
One of our two
student board members

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.510
is a young woman
from Southwestern,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.790
and she's now graduating
and looking for a job.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.100
And she and I were
talking about the fact

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:07.700
of how important it was to reach
out and ask for what you want.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.780
It's just one of those things
that I take home every day.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.130
And then the last point
I'll make about taking

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.070
risks is to ask for help.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.730
On the screen,
you see the people

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.470
who are the most
important to me--

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.940
my most important connections.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.580
On the left is my PhD
thesis adviser, Carver Mead.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.590
He was the ultimate sponsor
for the first many years

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.280
of my career.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.230
He introduced me to people
who were starting companies.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.630
He supported me in my work.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.590
On the top, you see my good
friend, Valerie Taylor,

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.180
the Executive Director of
the Center for Minorities

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.190
and People with
Disabilities in IT.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.610
I go to her for advice all the
time, and I sit on her board

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.250
and I help her understand
how to create a nonprofit.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.680
This is all new for her.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.240
Maria Kalwe, who's on
the stage with myself

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.970
and Sheryl Sandberg, is the
ultimate close personal friend.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.190
Very much a mentor.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.380
Maria has always
been there for me,

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.850
but she always
tells me how it is.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:26.300
She gives me the hard truth when
I don't really want to hear it.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.390
And then both Sheryl
Sandberg and Megan Smith

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.700
are supportive of
the work that we

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.250
do at the Anita Borg Institute.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:39.500
They are in my larger
network, and they make a point

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.460
to really support our work.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.000
Who's in your network?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.760
And I talked a lot about how
these are the people that

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.150
allowed me to thrive.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.580
If you think about it,
the next generation,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.390
who are the people who
allow them to thrive?

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:07.380
I make it a point to meet
with anybody who wants to.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.590
I told you about
Natalia Rodriguez,

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.130
who's a young student.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:17.440
But those times where people are
making an important transition

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.765
and they reach out to have a
conversation today-- actually,

00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:24.160
I had an event earlier today and
a young is starting a company

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.600
and she says, can we talk?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.550
And I said yes.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:33.600
So think about how you can
reach out to those around you

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.660
and help them.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.470
Yes, you need to
get your own help.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:45.990
Yes, you need to have the best
career you can possibly have.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.560
But what can you
do to help others?

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.730
The network-- I mean,
look around the room.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.880
These are connections.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.640
These are possible
peer mentors, everyone

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.860
of the people in this room.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.390
Find out what they're doing.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.920
Find out how you can learn
from every one of them.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.450
Think about your job.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.460
Who are the young engineers?

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.760
And I would say, this
is both men and women

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.650
who you can share
your experience with.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.160
Think about your
local high schools.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.770
Many of the technical
people I know volunteer

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.920
at their local high schools.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.360
They talk about their job.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.470
There are so many
young kids that

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.328
just don't even know
what we do, don't even

00:10:34.328 --> 00:10:35.453
know if it's a possibility.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:45.910
In the same way that I
needed help in order for me

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:51.610
to be successful, I
want to give back.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.350
One of the greatest experiences
that I have in my life

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.790
is at the Grace
Hopper Celebration.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.680
One of those great joys
is a walk around the room,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.560
and these young women
come up to me and say,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.490
this conference changed my life.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:14.710
To see for so many young women
who are working in an area

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.820
where they're just
one of very few women,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.170
the chance to have a
conversation with somebody

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.740
who's just a few years older
than them, to understand

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.600
what's possible.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.760
When people ask you
for help, give back.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.960
Pay it forward.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:46.340
The other thing along the
topic of asking for help

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.210
is that for you
to be successful,

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.190
people need to know what you do.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:00.651
It's not what you know,
it's not who you know,

00:12:00.651 --> 00:12:04.488
but it is who knows
what you know.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.850
And as you think
about asking for help,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.530
think about what the
people in your organization

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:20.800
or other organizations
can do to advise you

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.270
about how to get ahead.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.390
So I know that you're going
to have a wonderful day.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.992
I hope that you
remember to take risks,

00:12:33.992 --> 00:12:38.760
to ask for what you want,
and to ask for help.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:49.400
We want you to be at the table
creating the technology that

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.440
will change all of our
lives, and each one of you

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.860
can help make that so.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.980
Thank you so much.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.530
