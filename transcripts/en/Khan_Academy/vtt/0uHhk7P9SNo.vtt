00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:02.524
- So, this right over
here is a screenshot of

00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:06.201
the Describing Subsets
of Sample Spaces exercise

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:08.334
on Khan Academy, and
I thought I would do a

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:10.366
couple of examples, just
because it's good practice

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:14.368
just thinking about how do
we describe sets and subsets.

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:17.660
So it reads, Harry Potter
is at Ollivanders Wand Shop.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.032
As we all know, the wand
must choose the wizard,

00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:23.531
so Harry cannot make the choice himself.

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:27.209
He interprets the wand
selection as a random process

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:30.561
so he can compare the probabilities
of different outcomes.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.943
The wood types available are

00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:34.584
holly, elm, maple, and wenge.

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:37.509
The core materials on offer are

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:41.390
phoenix feather, unicorn
hair, dragon scale,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.576
raven feather and thestral tail.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:44.738
All right!

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:48.374
Based on the sample space of
possible outcomes listed below,

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:50.939
what is more likely?

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.672
And so, we see here, we have
four different types of woods

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:55.937
for the wand, and then each of those

00:00:55.937 --> 00:00:58.842
could be combined with five
different types of core,

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:01.260
Phoenix Feather, Unicorn
Hair, Dragon Scale,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.489
Raven Feather and Thestral Tail.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.132
And so, that gives us four different woods

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:09.549
and each of those can be combined
with five different cores.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.584
20 possible outcomes.

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:13.084
And they don't say it here but

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:14.852
they way they're talking I guess we can,

00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:16.531
I'm going to go with the assumption that

00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:17.855
they're equally likely outcomes,

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:19.655
although it would have been
nice if they said that,

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:22.199
"These are all equally likely"

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:23.931
but these are the 20 outcomes.

00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:26.514
And so, which of these are more likely?

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:27.875
The wand that selects Harry

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:30.943
will be made of holly or unicorn hair.

00:01:30.943 --> 00:01:32.853
So, how many of those
outcomes involve this?

00:01:32.853 --> 00:01:35.900
So if, Holly are these five outcomes

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.440
and if you said, "Holly or Unicorn Hair"

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.606
it's going to be these five outcomes plus,

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:41.999
well this one involves Unicorn Hair

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.555
but we've already included this one,

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:46.892
but the other ones that's
not included for the Holly,

00:01:46.892 --> 00:01:49.432
that involve Unicorn
Hair, are the Elm Unicorn,

00:01:49.432 --> 00:01:51.545
the Maple Unicorn and the Wenge Unicorn.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.470
So it's these five, plus
these three, right over here.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.294
So eight of these 20 outcomes.

00:01:57.294 --> 00:01:59.651
And if these are all
equally likely outcomes,

00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:04.651
that means there is an
8/20 probability of a wand

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:08.692
that will be made of
Holly or Unicorn Hair.

00:02:08.692 --> 00:02:10.460
So this is 8/20 or, that's the same

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.871
thing as 4/10 or 40% chance.

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.248
Now, the wand that selects Harry

00:02:14.248 --> 00:02:16.786
will be made of Holly and Unicorn Hair.

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.039
Well, Holly and Unicorn Hair,

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.561
that's only one out of the 20 outcomes.

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:22.386
So this, or course, is going
to be a higher probability.

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:24.925
It actually includes this outcome

00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:26.807
and then seven other outcomes.

00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:30.634
So, the first choice includes the outcome

00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:34.129
for the second choice
plus seven other outcomes.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.825
So this is definitely going
to be a higher probability.

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:39.473
Let's do a couple more of these

00:02:39.473 --> 00:02:42.231
or at least one more of these.

00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:46.482
You and a friend are
playing "Fire-Water-Sponge".

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:47.963
I've never played that game.

00:02:47.963 --> 00:02:49.895
In this game, each of the two players

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.800
chooses fire, water or sponge.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.726
Both players reveal their
choice at the same time

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:57.724
and the winner is determined
based on the choices.

00:02:57.724 --> 00:03:00.379
I guess this is like
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.264
Fire beats sponge by burning it.

00:03:03.264 --> 00:03:05.864
Sponge beats water by soaking it up.

00:03:05.864 --> 00:03:08.425
And water beats fire by putting it out.

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:10.260
Alright, well, it kind of makes sense.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.808
If both players choose the
same object, it is a tie.

00:03:13.808 --> 00:03:17.201
All the possible outcomes of
the game are listed below.

00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.720
If we take outcomes
one, three, four, five,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.402
seven and eight, as a
subset of the sample space,

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:27.197
which of the statements
below describe the subset?

00:03:27.197 --> 00:03:30.854
So let's look at the outcomes
that they have over here.

00:03:30.854 --> 00:03:32.160
Well, it makes sense that there are

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.227
nine possible outcomes because,

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:36.563
for each of the three choices I can make

00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:39.323
there's going to be three
choices that my friend can make.

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:41.642
So, three times three is nine.

00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:44.304
They've highlighted these red outcomes.

00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:47.351
Outcome one, three, four,
five, seven and eight.

00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.038
So let's see what's common about them.

00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:53.504
Outcome one, Fire, I get
Fire, friend get's Water.

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:56.271
OK, so let's see, my friend would win.

00:03:56.271 --> 00:04:00.619
Outcome three, I pick Fire,
my friend does sponge,

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.133
so actually I would win that one.

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:07.790
And then outcome four, Water, Fire.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.248
And then outcome five, Water, Sponge.

00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:13.837
I don't see a pattern just yet,.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.687
Let's see what the choice is.

00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:18.355
The subset consists of all outcomes where

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:20.529
your friend does not win.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.206
All outcomes where your
friend does not win.

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:25.418
Well, that's not true because look,

00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:28.351
outcome one my friend wins.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.764
Water puts out fire so,

00:04:30.764 --> 00:04:32.879
we're not going to
select this first choice.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.615
So let's see, the subset consists of

00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:37.514
all the outcomes where your friend wins

00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:39.099
or there is a tie.

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.260
So let's see.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.595
Where the friend wins or there's a tie.

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:46.595
Well, outcome three, this is
an outcome where I would win.

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:49.847
Or you, or whoever "Your" is,

00:04:49.847 --> 00:04:51.321
whoever they're talking about.

00:04:51.321 --> 00:04:53.045
This is one where the friend doesn't win

00:04:53.045 --> 00:04:54.577
because Fire burns Sponge so,

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:56.632
I'm not going to select that one either.

00:04:56.632 --> 00:04:58.319
Choice three, the subset consists of

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.260
all of the outcomes where
you win or there is a tie.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.007
Well, we just said, "Outcome one,

00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:05.714
I don't win that, my friend wins that.

00:05:05.714 --> 00:05:09.290
Water puts out the Fire."

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.936
Now let's look at the last choice.

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:13.109
The subset consists of all the outcomes

00:05:13.109 --> 00:05:15.852
where there is not a tie.

00:05:15.852 --> 00:05:17.925
Alright, so this is
interesting because look,

00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:20.180
outcome two there is a tie.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.374
Outcome six, there is a tie.

00:05:22.374 --> 00:05:23.963
Outcome nine, there is a tie.

00:05:23.963 --> 00:05:26.945
There's actually only three
scenarios where there's a tie.

00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:28.065
Either it's Fire, Fire.

00:05:28.065 --> 00:05:28.780
Water, Water.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.194
Or Sponge, Sponge.

00:05:30.194 --> 00:05:31.646
And those are the ones
that are not selected.

00:05:31.646 --> 00:05:33.808
So, all of these, someone is going to win.

00:05:33.808 --> 00:05:37.002
Outcome one, three, four,
five, seven or eight.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:41.269
So, definitely, definitely
go with that one.
