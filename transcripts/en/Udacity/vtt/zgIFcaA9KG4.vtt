00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.771
The International Classification
of Disease is the oldest data

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.783
standard dating back to the 1800s.

00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:11.947
And in a sense, even to earlier
centuries when researchers first became

00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:15.500
interested in the causes
of human mortality.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.379
Traditionally, it's been a list or
classification of medical diagnoses.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.740
It's maintained by the World Health
Organization, and is updated every ten

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.490
years, with the latest version being
ICD-10, which was adopted in 1994.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.773
Here in the US, where still using ICD-9,

00:00:34.773 --> 00:00:38.715
even though most other countries,
are using 10.

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:46.700
ICD-10 is a major expansion capable of
representing many more clinical details.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.460
We can see that, here, by comparing
the coding systems' capabilities for

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.280
breast cancer.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.319
In ICD-9, we know what portion
of the breast is involved.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.610
The central portion, here, but
we don't know which breast.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.100
In ICD-10, we not only know which
portion of the breast is involved,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.068
but we know whether it's the right or
the left breast.

00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:17.460
So in ICD-10, laterality is represented,
which greatly increases the number

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.632
of codes, which is a big part of the
objections to using it here in the U.S..

00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:26.140
In fact, ICD-10 really becomes
an ontology capable of

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.900
representing clinical relationships.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.925
Here, we can see that
the patient has gout, affecting

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:38.180
their left shoulder.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.020
But they have not yet
developed a uric acid deposit,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.360
called a tophus, in that shoulder.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.300
We can also see that the etiology,
or the reason for

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.978
their gout, is kidney failure.

00:01:53.978 --> 00:02:01.120
The current U.S. target date for
ICD-10 adoption is October 1st, 2015.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.510
But given how close we are to ICD-11,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.639
there are some proposals
to skip ICD-10 entirely.
