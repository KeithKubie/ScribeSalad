00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.109
Everyone and their mother know about the most
famous superhero couples of all time like

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.480
Superman and Lois Lane or Harley Quinn and
The Joker but there are tons of other super

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.070
powered relationships that are totally hot.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.520
Whether they haven’t had a chance on the
big screen yet or they have just slipped past

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.000
people unnoticed to we are taking a look at
some of the lesser known steamy super couples

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.820
in our list of 10 Hot Superhero and Villain
Relationships You Didn't Know About.

day!

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.850
Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne
Ant-Man briefly introduced us to the relationship

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.130
between Scott and Hope and from the looks
of it; we are excited to see what comes next.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.260
That being said, their relationship starts
out in pretty awkward way because they do

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.149
meet when Scott wakes up with her watching
him sleep.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.329
They then spend most of the film taking jabs
at each other until they finally share that

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.000
great kiss at the end of the movie.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.791
In 2018, we will get to see the next Ant-Man
movie, called Ant-Man and The Wasp, which

00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:04.799
will feature both Scott and Hope as a superhero
couple that we can only imagine will be very

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.610
hot and wildly entertaining.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.540
Aquaman and Mera
The King and Queen of Atlantis may have a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.979
somewhat dysfunctional relationship but there
is no denying that it is fueled by hot passionate

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.979
love.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.120
The couple originally bonded over being outcasts
to their people despite holding positions

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.180
of great power within their society and they
have always had a magnetic connection in the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.180
comics.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.950
For some reason, Aquaman has often been considered
a lame and soft superhero so we are hoping

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.159
that a grittier movie is coming his way and
that it will feature some hot scenes between

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.250
him and Mera.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.350
With Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard lined up
to play these roles, we are excited for the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.530
world to get to see Aquaman and Mera on the
big screen in 2018!

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.150
Spiderman and Mary Jane (Spiderman 1,2,3)
While this hot couple may seem very obvious

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.189
to some, we will need to mention it as we
can guarantee that there are people who have

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.520
only seen The Amazing Spiderman series that
pairs Peter Parker with Gwen Stacy.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.830
While that relationship was okay, it definitely
doesn’t measure up to the more raw and passionate

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.970
couple of Spidey and Mary Jane.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.151
In the comics and in the Toby Maguire Spiderman
movies this couple was at the center of the

00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.890
action and had some pretty steamy scenes.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.290
For years, the famous upside down alleyway
kiss has been copied and referenced and that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.690
is the most sincere form of admiration.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.120
Mary Jane will be coming back in Spiderman
Homecoming and we imagine it will be awesome!

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.130
Sara Lance and Nyssa Al Ghul
In the DC TV show Arrow, Sara Nance finds

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.860
herself on the brink of starvation when Nyssa
Al Ghul, the daughter of Ra’s Al Ghul, saved

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.860
her.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.870
Sara then began to train with Nyssa to become
part of the league and during this process

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.720
she and Nyssa also started an intimate and
very hot relationship.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.950
Unfortunately, their relationship was as complicated
as it was steamy due to Nyssa’s father being

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.950
a crime king.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.620
Even after they parted ways, Sara and Nyssa
still have love for each other and are willing

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.099
to put themselves at serious risk in the name
of protecting each other.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.370
The superhero world is flooded with male/female
relationships so it was a nice change to see

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.480
an LGBT couple featured so prominently on
the show.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.110
Luke Cage and Jessica Jones
These two heroes now both have their own Marvel

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.370
Netflix series and from the early hints of
their relationship, it’s going to be a hot

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.370
one.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.940
Both physically strong but emotionally weak,
Jessica Jones and Luke Cage find connect through

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.480
sex and alcohol.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.670
When Luke and Jessica have their first encounter,
it’s purely a one night stand with no feelings

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.670
involved.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.489
But once their friendship progresses, Jessica
finds herself opening up more to him, and

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.840
Luke wants to protect her as much as he can.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.160
These two are so powerful and messed up that
end up trying to hurt and save one and other

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.350
multiple times in throughout their relationship.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.810
If the shows follow the same storyline as
the comics, we may get to see Luke and Jessica

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.019
actually get hitched and have a little super
baby of their own.

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.060
Vision and the Scarlet Witch – The Avengers
This couple is the classic case of two people

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.750
being very different but for some reason being
attracted to each other all the time.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.870
For starters, Vision is a robot and Scarlet
Witch is absolutely not.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.611
The Vision’s artificial intelligence was
based on the brain of Wonder Man who had a

00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:03.600
bit of a thing for the Scarlet Witch himself
back in the day.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.490
In other words, he is somewhat programmed
to be in love with her.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.350
What’s more is that Scarlet’s brother,
Quicksilver, is very much not a fan of his

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.269
sister being with a robot and has been very
open with his feelings.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.280
Forbidden love is a common theme in story
telling and that’s probably because it makes

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.099
for such hot couples.

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.710
Cyclops and Emma Frost
Although Cyclops, A.K.A.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.770
Scott Summers has most famously been paired
with Jean Grey in the comics and the movies,

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.620
he has more recently been couples with Emma
Frost.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.650
Jean Grey might be a fiery red head but Summer’s
relationship with the cool and sexy Emma Frost

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.449
is actually much hotter.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.840
For starters, Jean Grey often dies and leaves
Scott alone and there is also the ongoing

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.810
complication of the love triangle including
Wolverine.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.369
The relationship between Emma Frost and Cyclops
is a more fun and undeniably sexy even though

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.150
she is somewhat of a lunatic.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.939
January Jones didn’t do a very good job
with the character in the 2011 film, but hopefully

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.509
she’s not gone for good!

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.580
Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor
When you are talking about hot superheroes,

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.900
Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman has to be at the
top of the list.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.270
Not only is she absolutely stunning to look
at, but she is a total badass with what looks

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.539
to be a great solo movie on the way.

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.999
One aspect of the movie that fans don’t
know too much about yet is her relationship

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.310
with Steve Trevor, played by Chris Pine.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.439
The trailers haven’t given too much detail,
but it looks like their relationship will

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.979
be very important and very hot.

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.930
When you have two great looking movie stars
like that paired together, all you can hope

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.610
for is great on screen chemistry that you
can sit back and enjoy.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.100
Robin/Nightwing and Starfire — The Teen
Titans

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.379
This romance began in Teen Titans Issue #2
when these two overly-hormonal teens met while

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.259
Nightwing (then Robin, the Boy Wonder) was
lying flat on his back, and Starfire, the

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.300
golden-skinned alien beauty sucking on his
face like it was a scuba mouthpiece.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.339
In later comics it was revealed that she was
actually absorbing his language through physical

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.969
contact, and this was the most enjoyable way
to do it, for the both of them.

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.930
When people first read this comic it may have
taken them by surprise and made them begin

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.559
to question whether or not this is really
how love works.

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:09.059
While we don’t suggest random face sucking,
we will just have to call this hot relationship

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:12.069
a tale of love at first sight.

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.580
Harley Quinn and Deadshot
Wait, don’t you mean Harley Quinn and The

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.580
Joker?

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.240
Well although that couple could be considered
hot (however dysfunctional it may be) it is

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.050
definitely one that most people already know
about.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.710
What fans might not know is that Harley and
Deadshot have actually been romantically involved

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.879
in the comics for years through little flings
and flirtatious encounters.

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:34.490
News has surfaced that there was actually
plans to set this romance up in the Suicide

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.749
Squad movie, but the plans were finally scrapped.

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:41.679
We think this would have been awesome to see
as Will Smith and Margot Robbie were the best

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:45.449
parts of that movie and they have already
shown off their on screen chemistry in the

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.009
con artist film, Focus.

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.599
So there’s our list of ten super hot superhero
and villain couples that you may not have

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.710
known about!

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.330
Which one of these is your favorite?

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.169
