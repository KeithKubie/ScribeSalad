00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.960
And problem 124.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.490
According to a car dealer sales
report, 1/3 of the cars

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.640
sold during a certain period
were sedans, and 1/5 of the

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.160
other cars sold were
station wagons.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.800
So 1/3 of the cars sold,
so the total,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.000
were equal to sedans.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.150
And 1/5 of the other cars sold
were station wagons, so 1/5 of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.260
the remainder of this.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.420
So that's 1/5 of the 2/3 cars
that weren't sedans.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.650
So 1/5 of the 2/3 of the total
were station wagons.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.490
Let's call it W for wagons.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.310
If N station wagons were sold
during that period-- so W is

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.460
equal to N-- how many sedans
in terms of n were sold?

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:03.000
So we know that 1/5 times 2/3
times the total is equal to N.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.489
Let's just substitute S for T.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.810
If we multiply both sides of
this top equation times 3, we

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.030
know that the total is
equal to 3 times

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.715
the number of sedans.

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:14.270
So let's substitute
that here for T.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.370
So you get 1/5 times 2/3
times 3S is equal to N.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.250
3 cancels out.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.500
3 divided by 3.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.030
So you have 2/5 S is equal
to N, or-- let me

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.200
just write it up here.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.970
So multiply both sides by 5/2.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.703
You have S is equal to 5/2 N.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.240
And that is choice D.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.570
Problem 125.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.810
If p/q is less than 1, and p and
q are positive integers,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.880
which of the following must
be greater than 1?

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.670
So think about this.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.770
If p/q is less than 1,
that tells us that p

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.430
is less than q.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.039
You can multiply both
sides of this times

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.220
q, and you get that.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.660
p has to be less than q.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.315
And they're both positive
integers.

00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:17.860
So there's nothing tricky here
with negative numbers.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.800
So just the instincts, which
of the following must be

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.595
greater than 1?

00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:22.830
I don't know if this is going to
be a choice, but if this is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.160
less than 1, if you invert
it it's going to be

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.410
greater than 1.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.560
So divide both sides
of this by p.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.060
You'll get 1 is less than q/p.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.100
And that makes sense.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.360
If 1/2 is less than 1, then
2/1 is going to be

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.010
greater than 1.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.800
If 2/3 is less than 1, then
3/2 is going to be

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.400
greater than 1.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.310
So if p/q is less than 1, then
q over p is going to be

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.920
greater than 1.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.990
And we did it algebraically by
just multiplying both sides by

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.110
q and then multiplying
both sides by p.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.060
That is a choice.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.510
E, q/p.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.605
That made it easy.

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:00.220
I thought I might have
to do more work if

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.310
that didn't show up.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.630
So q/p is definitely
greater than 1.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.050
Next question, 126.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.280
It would take 1 machine 4 hours
to complete a large

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.620
production order.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.240
So machine 1, it would
take 4 hours.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.780
So you could say 1 order
every 4 hours, or

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.600
1/4 order per hour.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.705
That's machine 1.

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:34.720
And another machine, 3 hours
to complete the same order.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:44.460
So machine 2 does 1 order in 3
hours, or 1/3 orders per hour.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.950
How many hours would it take
both machines working

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.330
simultaneously at their
respective constant rates to

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.850
complete the order?

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.690
If they're working together,
you're going to have one

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.130
machine producing at 1/4 order
per hour, plus another machine

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.840
producing at 1/3
order per hour.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.410
So their combined rate is going
to be what over 12?

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.510
And then 1/4 is the same thing
as 3/12, and 1/3 is the same

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.540
thing as 4/12.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.120
So their combined rate
is going to be

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.120
7/12 order per hour.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.190
And you want to know how long
it's going to take them to

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.550
make 1 order.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.750
So you can think of production
is equal to rate times time.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.050
And time is equal to production
divided by rate.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.190
Or if you don't want to think
about them, just think if I

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.980
can make 7/12 orders per hour,
if I have to make 1 order, I'm

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.740
just going to be 1
order divided by

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.600
7/12 order per hour.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.420
This might seem a little
confusing to you, but if these

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.790
were constant numbers,
try to play with it.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.540
If I had to make 10 orders, and
I can make 2 orders per

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.920
hour, then I just divide
10 by 2, which

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.890
would tell me 5 hours.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.940
But it's just a little more
confusing when I have to make

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.010
1 order and my rate is
7/12 orders for hour.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.760
But hopefully if you substitute
whole numbers in

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.570
your head it makes little
bit of sense.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.460
So this is the same
thing as 12/7.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.410
And then of course the orders
cancel out, and you end up

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.510
with hours in the numerator.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.280
So 12/7 hours or 1 5/7 hours.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.830
What do they have?

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.160
Yes, that's choice C.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.390
Question 127.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:39.750
To mail a package, the rate is
x cents for the first pound,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:48.310
and y cents for each additional
pound, where they

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.840
tell us that x is
greater than y.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.820
2 packages weighing 3 pounds and
5 pounds respectively can

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.310
be mailed separately or combined
as one package, so 3

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.490
pounds and 5 pounds.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.090
That's one package.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.080
Which method is cheaper, and
how much money is saved?

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.060
Let's think about it.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.950
If you keep them separate, how
much are you going to pay?

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.090
For the 3 pound packet,
you're going to pay x

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.180
for the first pound.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.470
And then you're going to have
2 pounds left that you are

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.310
going to pay y at.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.840
And then for this one, you
are going to pay x

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.640
for the first pound.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.260
You're going to have 4 pounds
left, so plus 4y.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.645
So when you add them together,
your total expense is going to

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:34.210
be 2x plus 6y.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.760
That's if you mail
them separately.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.910
Now if you combine them
into one 8 pound

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.510
package, what do you have?

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.190
You have to pay x for the first
pound, and then you have

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.120
7 pounds left that you're
going to pay for y.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.490
So it's going to
cost x plus 7y.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.230
So first of all, we know that
this is going to be more.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.820
Why do we know this is more?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.960
Because essentially we're taking
one of the y's-- and

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.130
when you pay them separately for
that one extra pound that

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.310
here you're paying it as in x
cents, instead of y cents that

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.750
you're paying in this case.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.360
And x is more than y.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.250
And that will hold out when we
actually subtract the 2 out.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.020
Actually, hopefully you
understand the reasoning why

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.730
this is going to be larger
because x is greater than y.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.600
So let's figure it out.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.960
What's the difference?

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.330
This is the higher number.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.880
And let's subtract out
the lower number,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.340
minus x minus 7y.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.600
I just subtracted x plus 7y.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.960
And that you end up
with x minus y.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.440
6 minus 7y is minus 1y.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.620
So x minus y.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.685
And the fact that x is greater
than y lets you

00:07:43.685 --> 00:07:44.490
know this is positive.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.610
So that also tells you that this
is the more expensive of

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.400
the alternatives.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.150
Separate is the more
expensive.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.710
And the difference
is x minus y.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.780
So they ask which method
is cheaper?

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.210
So the combined method
is cheaper and you

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.760
save x minus y cents.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.000
And that's choice A.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.650
Choice B, they say combined
is cheaper with a

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.270
savings of y minus x.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.860
But y minus x is going to
be a negative number.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.470
So you can't say you saved
a negative number.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.650
They tell us that x is greater
than y, so you

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.590
could cancel that out.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.390
And the other ones don't
make any sense at all.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:34.720
Next problem, 128.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.669
If money is invested at r%
interest compounded annually,

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.450
the amount of the investment
will double in approximately

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:53.960
70/r years.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:01.420
If Pat's parents invested $5,000
in a long-term bond

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:08.790
that pays 8% interest compounded
annually, what will

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.530
be the approximate total amount
of the investment 18

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.980
years later as Pat is
ready for college?

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:25.470
It doubles every 70/r
years, where r is 8.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.000
They gave us that information,
so let's try to use it.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.540
So how long does it take to
double at an 8% rate?

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.800
So it's 70 divided by
8 is equal to what?

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.050
It's equal to 8.5?

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:48.230
8 goes into 70 eight
times, 64.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.130
6, 0.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.360
8 goes into 60 seven times.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.460
7 times 8 is 56.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.030
And you have a 40.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.840
8.75 years.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.210
This isn't going to be exact,
but you're going to double

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.650
your money roughly every 8.75
years if using this formula

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.820
they give you at an
8% interest rate.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.210
And they say what will be the
total amount of the investment

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.880
18 years later?

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.110
So 18 years, that's roughly
two doublings.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.190
So you're going to start with
$5,000, and after 8.75 years

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.520
you're going to be at $10,000.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.580
You're going to double
in 8.75 years.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.635
And then after another
8.75 years, you are

00:10:30.635 --> 00:10:33.600
going to be at $20,000.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.830
This isn't exactly 18 years.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.280
This is 17.5, but that's
about as close as

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.110
we're going to get.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.290
So in 17.5 years, you
get to $20,000.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.210
They are asking 18 years,
and this is all about

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.860
approximation because they
don't want you to do some

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.620
hardcore exponent math here.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.940
And so the answer is A.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.510
And if you look at that 8.75,
that's roughly you're doubling

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.260
every 9 years.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.390
They ask us how long.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.380
So you could say after 9 years
I'm at $10,000, after another

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.040
9 years I'm at $20,000.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.760
So after 18 years, I'll
be at $20,000.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.610
And I'm all out of time.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.300
See you in the next video.
