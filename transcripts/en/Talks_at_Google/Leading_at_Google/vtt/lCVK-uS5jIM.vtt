00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.461
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming.
Appreciate you guys taking time out of your

00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:10.880
day.
My name is Erica Fox.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm a manager in Google University, and it's
my great pleasure and honor to introduce my

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.460
friend, Ngahihi o te ra Bidois and affectionately
known as Ngahi.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.659
Ngahi is an indigenous native Maori from New
Zealand.

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:35.620
And he's just published a book called, "Ancient
Wisdom, Modern Solutions." about his quest

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.800
to become a modern day warrior.
I met Ngahi in May in Kuala Lumpur.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:53.670
We were both speaking at a human resources
conference where we were kind of sharing some

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.560
innovative and best practice ideas around
all sorts of human resources topics.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:43.249
And I heard Ngahi give a presentation and
a speech about leadership, and particularly,

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:51.619
about what leadership means in the Maori culture.
And I just thought it was something so interesting

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.869
and that would resonate with Google.
So I invited him here.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.000
So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce
Ngahi.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:31.650
Ngahi Bidois: [chanting in Maori] Now,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.400
just in case any of you have no idea what
I just said, I brought along a dictionary

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.390
and -- the reality is, if I gave you the dictionary,
it wouldn't make any sense.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.200
And hopefully, I'll be able to explain things
a lot better in person.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.150
And, of course, I've written a book about
it as well.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.330
But, we have come from New Zealand.
This is our first time here in New York, and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.670
it is a real privilege to be here.
My name is Ngahihi o te ra Bidois, as Erica

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.540
said.
Ngahihi o te ra is Maori.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:16.250
It means "the rays of the sun".
Bidois is French. It means "handsome". [laughter]

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.779
"Highly intelligent", and there was another
one I keep forgetting -- ah, that's right

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:24.510
 -- "humble".
And I still have not met a Bidois who disagrees

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.361
with me.
It's really good to be here in your beautiful

00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:32.800
city.
And my wife and I -- a few years ago now -- were

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.019
sitting in our lounge and watching TV.
And as we were watching TV, we were crying,

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.980
because it was the 11th of September.
And we have had the privilege of attending

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.540
and going to a memorial while we've been here
over in the county of Wayne in New Jersey,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.040
with our hosts -- with Karen and Mark -- who
are hosting us.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.900
And I remember standing in the middle of that
memorial, and I was crying for the things

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.750
that have happened in your beautiful nation.
And for us to be here in the midst of New

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:21.870
York so many years later, to say to you, [speaking
in Maori], [translating] "From our people,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:30.380
the Maori people, I give you our sympathy
and our deepest wishes for those of you who

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.860
I know may be still hurting."
And, in our culture, it is appropriate that

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.830
we acknowledge those who have passed in your
culture.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:51.830
And so, I do that, [speaking in Maori] I greet
you once. [in Maori] I greet you twice. [in

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.630
Maori] I greet you three times. [in Maori]
I'm aware that there are three kinds of people

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.039
in this audience today.
First, obviously, visual learners -- and we're

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:09.310
going to fly through some Powerpoint presentations
behind me to help you, because you learn by

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.430
seeing and by reading.
Audible listeners -- we'll be telling a few

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.259
stories along the way.
And the final group of learners amongst you

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:25.540
are obviously kinesthetic.
So, for the kinesthetic listeners -- and this

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.200
is just to prove that I met Erica in Singapore,
at the HID Congress Conference -- and, I must

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.699
admit, Erica was just an outstanding ambassador
for Google, not only on the stage, but off

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.099
the stage as well.
And she was one of the celebrity speakers

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.949
of the engagement.
And at times, we felt more like bodyguards,

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.669
and it was really nice to meet you there,
Erica, and great to be here today as well.

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.740
I would like to ask everyone to please stand
for the kinesthetic learners.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.520
I had a friend who was dying.
And it was the last time that I would meet

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.319
him -- see him -- on this earth.
And in Maoridom, we call this 'nohaki'.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:16.700
And as I was talking to him, I said, "You
know, I'm finding it very difficult that you're

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.349
going to be leaving and I don't think I can
survive."

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:30.139
And he said to me, "Ngahi, every answer that
you will ever need in your life can be found

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.301
if you look in the mirror. And if you ask
the right questions of the person looking

00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:41.620
back at you, you will have the answer to every
problem that you face."

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.560
And what I'm going to do today is just encourage
you to look into your mirror.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.270
And we're going to be looking at proverbs,
people, and purpose.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.169
But, I'm going to ask you questions and I
don't want to know the answer, but I want

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.819
you to think about that question and think
about the answer for yourself.

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:13.570
Are you ready for your first question?
[pause] Why am I standing?

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.240
Ask yourself, "Why am I standing?" What has
happened -- many of you have never met -- in

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.861
fact, I'd say I've only met half a dozen of
you in this room.

00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:28.909
There are things that I have done to influence
your behavior.

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:36.750
And as John C Maxwell, one of your leadership
gurus, says, "The true measure of leadership

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:43.539
is influence -- nothing more, nothing less."
And all we're going to do today is look at

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:49.340
three ways to increase your influence.
And as I said earlier, we're going to look

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:56.560
at proverbs, people, and purpose.
And the importance of those when it comes

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.360
to influence.
You may now be seated.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:08.240
Unless you choose not to, and -- I would also
like to take this opportunity to thank Google.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.360
I come from a group of people known as the
Maori race in New Zealand.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:20.810
We are the indigenous people of New Zealand.
And not that long ago, Craig -- in association

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:30.030
with some people from my home city in Rotorua
 -- developed Google in Maori.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:36.430
And that enabled my children, for example
 -- who attend an education institute where

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:42.610
their first language of instruction is Maori
 -- to be able to get on their computers and

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:48.720
Google in their indigenous language.
And for them to be able to do that has not

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:56.750
only opened a whole new world for them from
very young age, but it has given us as people

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.630
what we call 'manah'.
It has given us prestige.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:08.870
It has given us a sense of belonging, because
you made our language -- which was also already

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.420
an official language of New Zealand -- more
official.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.670
So I would like to take this opportunity as
well to thank you at Google, because I know

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:23.620
that you all would have had a part to play
in it for making it possible for us to Google

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.890
in our official language.
So we're going to look quickly at three ways

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:35.130
to increase your influence.
How many of you have been to prison?

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.030
I actually don't expect you to answer it.
[laughter]

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.940
I do see the hand down the back though.
Oh, sorry, you're eating your -- yeah, yeah.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.790
I have.
And it's about now Erica and the others think,

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:54.079
"Uh-oh, that wasn't on the form."
But the prison I went to was not a prison

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:59.760
of concrete walls and steel bars; it was the
prison of my mind.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.550
And this prison looked like this.
When I was young, I saw a helicopter flying

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.000
above and it had Santa Claus in it who was
throwing us lollies.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.860
And I said to one of my mates, as we're picking
up these lollies, "I'm going to fly in one

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.470
of those one day."
And they looked at me and said, "Yeah right,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.790
Ngahi. Few too many lollies, I think."
It goes like this.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.720
People in my life saying, "Ngahi, your life
will never amount to anything.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.570
You? Go to university? I don't think so.
You didn't even pass the national exams that

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.480
we have.
You? Write a book? You can't even write proper

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.740
essays.
You? Speak to people? Wasn't it that day that

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.780
you skipped school or were very sick because
there was speech contests on at school? I

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.310
don't think so."
So all of these bars, [chufe!] [chufe!] [chufe!]

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:53.700
were being put around my mind.
And people would say things like, "You can't

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.570
do that. You just can't do that."
[chufe!] There's another bar.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:04.720
And it got to the stage that, whenever I went
to go and do something, all I could see was

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.620
a bar in front of me, stopping me from achieving
anything -- until an incredible thing happened

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:18.100
in my life.
I stayed with my grandmother for two years.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:25.329
And in those two years, she taught me an incredible
proverb.

00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:37.250
And that proverb was, [speaking in Maori]
[translating], "The thought creates the person."

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:45.399
And she said this to me, "Ngahi, it doesn't
matter what other people think of you.

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:50.839
What matters is what you think of you."
And then, she would give me a big hug, and

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:56.390
she'd say, "And, by the way, I think you can
do anything."

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:04.790
[speaking in Maori] There's another man who
was a hero in my life, and his name was Bruce

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:15.190
Lee. Have you heard of Bruce Lee? Yeah. Yeah.
Bruce Lee said this, "As we think, so shall

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:22.199
we become."
In fact, if you'd have seen Bruce Lee, he

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:28.580
would have said it like this, "As we think,
so shall we become."

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:37.389
I think it was the dubbing of the movies that
was -- And if a man who was known for his

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:45.820
physical prowess would say something like
that, and remind us that, "As we think, so

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:52.090
shall we become," then how important is it
for us to keep thinking as well?

00:12:52.090 --> 00:13:00.672
Leaders think, and thinkers lead.
So, for you as leaders, I would like to say

00:13:00.672 --> 00:13:09.300
this.
I believe you are paid to think more than

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.970
any other skill you have.
And walking around your building, it was just

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:21.860
so wonderful to see the many places where
you can think -- opportunities that you have

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.310
to think in this very building.
Leonard Ravenhill said, "Opportunities of

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.820
a lifetime must be seized in the lifetime
of the opportunity."

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:37.790
And you have so many opportunities here every
day to think.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.850
Here's something for you to think about.
Who are my eagles?

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.100
Look in your mirror and say, "Who are my eagles?
Who are my mentors?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:52.190
Who are the people who get me from A to B?"
Because you will be the same person in five

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:57.800
years time except for two things.
One, the information that you learn. And two,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.490
the people that you meet.
Let's take an example of that.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:11.850
Think of your five best friends.
It is highly likely that your income is their

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.829
average.
So you want to earn more money?

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:22.130
Dump your friends and get -- nah, nah.
You want to be a better leader?

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.779
Look to leaders that you want to be like and
ask them to mentor you.

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:31.800
Ask them to be your eagles.
Eagle -- as many of you will know -- is an

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.839
amazing bird.
It has in its wing a bone that it locks.

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:43.190
And it locks this wing as the storm approaches,
and can fly above storms.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.269
Eagles have been seen at over 15,000 feet
by airline pilots.

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:52.610
They fly so high, that ice starts forming
on their backs.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.790
And their wings are locked up here above the
storm.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.730
And they're able to descend down the other
side of the storm as well.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:05.160
Guess who the storm hurts?
Yep. All the turkeys.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.050
You guys have heard of that saying?
"How can I fly like an eagle when I'm surrounded

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:15.079
by turkeys?" Well, where are the eagles?
They're up here.

00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:23.639
So when you are working those long hours,
take note of who else is working with you.

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:30.779
When you are doing those hard jobs that allow
you to fly above the storm, take note of the

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:35.940
other eagles who are flying above the storm
with you.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:42.170
Go and meet them. Get to know them.
They will make you a better person.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:47.800
So, who are my eagles?
Let's keep moving.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:54.600
"Do I think like a leader?" is your next question.
Remembering the things that I've seen around

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.410
here in Google as well -- you just think way
outside of the box or the square or the circle

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:04.190
or the star, whatever it is.
And I encourage you and exhort you to continue

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.160
to do that.
Let's look at people.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.820
In our culture, people are very important.
And this is a proverb which reemphasizes it.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:19.710
[speaking in Maori] He aha te mea nui?, He
tangata, he tangata, he tangata.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.440
[translating] "What is the most important
thing in this world?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.389
If you would ask me what is the most important
thing in this world, I would say to you, it

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:35.240
is people, it is people, it is people."
And on the first of March, 2004, some very

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:42.270
important people came and visited my home.
It was the person who would put this tattoo

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:47.510
 -- this Ta Moko, Traditional Maori Tatoo
 -- onto my face.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:53.480
And he visited me in March, and I thought
he was visiting me to talk about putting my

00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:01.980
Ta Moko on later in the year.
And as we sat at our family dinner together

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:10.270
with our two guests with us, he looked across
at me after we had our main meal, and he said

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:19.160
this, "Ngahi, I have my gear in the car."
Now remember, this had taken eight years of

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.450
planning and waiting.
And I'm thinking, "We're going to be doing

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.880
this in October. It's now March."
And he said, "Ngahi, I have my gear in the

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:48.910
car. We can do this tonight."
[pause] "Yes. Yes, I'm ready. I want to do

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:56.020
this tonight."
Suffice to say, I didn't get dessert that

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:02.120
night.
Eight o'clock at night until midnight; midnight

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:11.010
until four o'clock in the morning -- one night.
We got to midnight, and he said to me, "We

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:15.090
can take a break, and you can do this another
time. We can finish this another time if you

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.820
want."
And I said, "No, I waited eight years for

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.320
this. And I'm not leaving this house until
it's done."

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:30.570
And we finished the rest tonight.
So eight hours to put my tattoo onto my face.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:37.661
This part of my tattoo -- my Ta Moko -- emphasizes
the importance of listening, which you are

00:18:37.661 --> 00:18:44.800
doing so well now.
This part of my tattoo -- my Ta Moko -- emphasizes

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:51.280
the importance of seeing and observing and
looking.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:59.040
There is nothing on my forehead to emphasize
the importance of thinking.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:11.980
And on my chin is a pattern that looks like
a hammerhead shark [pause] on my chin.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:17.090
And that is very significant to my tribe.
The name of the tribe that I come to you from

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:22.920
in New Zealand is called tiarowa.
And we are named after a shark.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:31.660
And when our canoe left our original place
that we came from, it was caught in a whirlpool.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:38.930
And the priest of our canoe said a prayer,
which enabled us to come out of the whirlpool

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:46.560
and at the same time a shark appeared.
And this shark led us -- not only out of the

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:53.540
whirlpool, but on to the resting place called
Maketu in the Bay of Plenty of New Zealand,

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:59.280
where our canoe rested.
In fact, this event with the shark was so

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.281
significant that, when we left here, we were
known as the [speaking in Maori]

00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:11.080
It changed our name to become known as the
tiarowa people after that shark.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.910
And we changed the name of our canoe as well
to 'The Tiarowa Canoe' before traveling on.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:25.480
And so, this shark, known as the tiarowa shark,
is on my chin because of the importance of

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.770
speaking.
And as I work with leaders around the world

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:37.560
 -- we've just come from Singapore and England
to be here today -- what I emphasize is that

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:51.380
leaders listen, look and observe, and think
before they speak.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.940
Talking about my Ta Moko, which one -- and
looking like a leader is very important.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.970
Which one looks more like a leader?
One of them is taken like this, with a camera

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.180
pointing at myself.
And the other one is taken by a professional

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.530
photographer.
As leaders, we need to be careful where our

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:15.870
image ends up, because -- as we all know -- it
can be on YouTube or anywhere within a split

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.570
second.
And beware of the roaming camera, especially

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:24.190
at those social functions that we tend to
attend.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:30.780
Be aware of our image as leaders.
I was working in Quomu, and they gave me a

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:36.390
silver Pujo car to drive around in.
And I was driving down the street, saw this

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.780
sign, "Fresh scallops."
Thought, "Yep, that's me."

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:46.160
Pulled into a parking space, went to the shop,
and the shop was closed.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.560
I thought, "Awh."
Came out, got in my car, it was a brand knew

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.410
Pujo they had given me.
Went to start the car, and the car wouldn't

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:59.280
start.
And I thought, "Awh, must be the alarm on

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.780
the keys."
Pulled the keys out, pushed the button, and

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:12.790
the car in front of me went [jin jin] I remember
looking at the key thinking, "Why would they

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:20.810
give you keys for two cars?" [laughter]
And then I thought, "Okay, let's try it again."

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:26.630
Put it in, start, wouldn't start, pull it
out, push the button, car in front went [ji]

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.810
Ah ha ha.
So I'm a bit slower than a lot of you here

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.230
in this room would have been.
Sure enough, looked around the car -- not

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:39.140
my car.
Get out of this car, enter the silver Pujo

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:44.950
in front of me -- this car was also silver
 -- started up, took off.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:52.680
Now, the funny thing was, when I got into
the first car, someone pulled up to take my

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:58.480
parking space.
So, can you imagine, I'm dressed in my suit

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.760
and Quomu, with my Ta Moko, them watching
all of this happening. [laughter]

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:10.580
Can you imagine the conversation at the police
station?

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.490
"Were there any distinguishing features?"
[laughter]

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:20.760
If we were in New Zealand, they would have
said, "Yes, he was Maori, and he was wearing

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:29.311
a suit." [laughter]
So, our appearance as leaders is very important,

00:23:29.311 --> 00:23:35.260
and we only get one chance to make a first
impression -- one chance to make a first impression.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.620
So do you look like a leader?
In fact, someone said to us, "Are you wearing

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.000
a tie?" Mark said to me, "You wearing a tie?
Do you think I should wear a tie?" I said,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.310
"No. No, no.
I don't think anyone in Google will be wearing

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:53.950
a tie."
I said, "However, it's just a part of my presenting

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:59.410
and my branding that I wear a tie."
I said, "But, from what I've read about you

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:05.540
guys, you are just so busy pushing scooters
around, and doing all the thinking while you're

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.660
playing ping-pong and all the other things
that, Wow, why would you sweat with a tie

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:18.480
on?" So, do you look like a leader?
1987 -- I want to finish with looking at purpose

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:29.330
 -- and 1987 was an important year in my life.
I was sitting on a hotel bed in a very nice

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:33.230
hotel.
And, as I'm sitting on this hotel bed, I'm

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.921
having a conversation that goes something
like this, "I have made it.

00:24:37.921 --> 00:24:45.240
I have achieved every goal that I wanted to
achieve by the time I was thirty, and here

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.850
I am, 26 years of age."
So what were my five main goals?

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:56.790
The first goal was, we had lots of money in
the bank for our first house, had my first

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:09.350
degree under my belt -- my business degree
 -- beautiful wife, even more beautiful car.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.550
Someone asked me what that car was actually
one time.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:21.240
And here I am in a high-flying job in a high-flying
career with a multinational oil company.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.220
Life could not be any better.
In fact, I'm eating an egg burger, because

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.330
I'm sick of the restaurant food downstairs
that I've had to eat for the last three days.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.700
And I'm at yet another leadership training
course.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:51.071
Just nine short months later, I'm unemployed,
I've had to sell the beautiful car, we have

00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:56.980
no money in the bank, and we are waiting for
friends who used to bring us food parcels.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:03.550
So how did I go from a high-flying job to
being unemployed?

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:10.490
From "sick of the best food this world has
to offer" to "waiting for food parcels"?

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:17.710
No money in the bank, unemployed, sitting,
learning the Maori language.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:23.120
I found myself in a setting very similar to
this where a speaker was talking, and he said,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:30.780
"You know, we find it very hard to find Maori
leaders who will help us with the street kids

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:36.300
in the city of Oakland." which is our biggest
city -- and he said, "This is why.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:43.540
Most of them get educated, end up in high-flying
jobs.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:50.160
They have flash houses, flash cars -- very
beautiful houses, very beautiful cars.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:56.070
And most of them end up marrying non-Maori
women."

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.270
This is a picture of my wife.
You can see the real thing which is a lot

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.330
better at the back later.
And it's a real privilege to be here with

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.260
my wife and family.
This is a picture of my wife, who obviously,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.410
is not Maori.
And as this gentleman was saying that, he

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:16.100
said, "My boys call them mellow paths," which
is a biscuit that we have back home that's

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.330
a chocolate biscuit on the outside and white
on the inside.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:30.350
And he said, "And all they do in the end is
they turn their backs on their own people."

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:33.770
And as he turned around, people started laughing.
I started crying.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:38.500
I was sitting in the front seat, and I started
crying.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:46.640
And I wept and wept and wept.
And I just could not stop weeping.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:53.300
And after what seemed ages, he carried on
talking and I just couldn't stop weeping.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.590
And I had to get up out of my seat and go
to another part of the whole, and my wife

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.302
followed me.
And she said, "Ngahi, are you all right?"

00:28:01.302 --> 00:28:07.720
And I said, "No, I'm not."
I said, "I don't know who I am.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:14.280
The goals that I had -- that I wanted to achieve
by the time I was thirty, have made me turn

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.260
my back on my people."
So what did that look like?

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:25.760
It meant going to university for a business
degree and passing papers in my language just

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.540
to pass papers, not actually to learn the
language.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.880
And six months later -- not even knowing my
own language.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:40.460
It meant my friend and my flatmate had a Maori
 -- a group of guys that used to come around

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:45.320
our house into our flat and visit us.
And I used to go into my bedroom and pretend

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.520
I was studying, because I didn't want to know
these guys.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:57.920
I'd become such an arrogant sod in the middle
of all of this career that, one day, a Maori

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.330
guy came up to me, and he said, [speaking
in Maori], [translating] "Have you got any

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:08.300
loose change?"
I said, "Man, I'm not your bro. I don't even

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:13.140
know who you are."
And he looked at me, and he goes, "Whatever."

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:20.040
He turned around and walked off.
It meant I didn't even know my own customs

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:27.960
and aspects of my own culture, and I had turned
my back on my culture.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:34.950
And so, I found myself in the situation when
my wife said to me, "What would you like to

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:38.090
do?"
I said, "It needs to start with learning my

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:43.460
own language.
I need to know what it means to be Maori,

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.970
and I'd like to take a year off to learn the
Maori language."

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:55.441
And so, we both voluntarily took a year of
being unemployed and learning the Maori language.

00:29:55.441 --> 00:30:02.020
And people have said, "Well, what's happened
since then?"

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:07.850
Let me share a couple of things about my beautiful
wife.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:14.930
We've been married 24 years -- 25 years this
year, December the first.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:19.600
After the one year of being unemployed, she
went to university and became the first person

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:28.030
in her family -- to our known knowledge -- to
receive a bachelors in arts, a degree from

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:32.320
a university.
She did her degree in Management Information

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.970
Systems and Maori Studies.
One day, she came back, and she said, "Ngahi,

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:42.180
when our children are born, I'd like us to
only speak Maori to them."

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:48.250
So, before our children were born, we made
a decision to only speak Maori.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:56.030
They now attend a school, as I said earlier,
where Maori is the first language of instruction

00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:07.230
and Google has helped them to search computers
in their official language -- a language that

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:16.790
one generation ago my parents were punished
for speaking in schools and were not allowed

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:22.350
to speak.
The term one generation, we've changed from

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:29.100
a people who were not allowed to speak our
own language to another generation who now

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:37.500
Google on a computer in their own language.
And I hope that emphasizes the importance

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:42.150
of what you have done for our language.
And I thank you again.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:48.240
People have said, "What about you, Ngahi?"
Oh, my wife is fluent in Maori, sorry.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.200
My wife is fluent in Maori, and she's been
adopted by my tribe.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.520
And one of the discussions that took place
was, what's someone from our tribe saying,

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:04.270
When are you going to receive your mark of
leadership?

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:10.080
And if my Pakeha wife -- 'Pakeha' is the word
that we use for non-Maori in New Zealand -- if

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:17.970
my Pakeha wife can take some of the principles
that I've shared with you today about proverbs,

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:26.020
people, and purpose, to walk in my world,
then I know that you are more than able to

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.750
walk in your world.
People have said, "What about you, Ngahi?"

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:36.470
Obviously, I've changed my goals to one day
receive my mark of leadership, my gift from

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:44.270
my ancestors, my Ta Moko.
And I've shifted from a hotel room bed to

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:51.330
a room full of unemployed people to standing
here with you today.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:58.190
And I've had the privilege of speaking in
many places around the planet about my message

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:03.780
of leadership.
And I'd like to emphasize the challenge to

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:19.940
you by saying and challenging you, Who might
you have turned your back on?

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:27.700
And what will you do different tomorrow as
a result of some of the things that I've been

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:37.440
able to share with you today?
Through proverbs and people, we establish

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:43.970
our purpose.
And I would now like to invite my son to join

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:50.390
me on the stage.
And we would like to issue you a challenge

00:33:50.390 --> 00:34:01.690
from our people in New Zealand, which is called
a 'haka'

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:08.790
to emphasize the things that I have challenged
you about your leadership today.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:14.540
Do you look like a leader? Do you think like
a leader?

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.399
What proverbs do you use?
It's not the size of the dog in the fight,

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:26.919
it's the size of the fight in the dog.
[speaking in Maori] Be strong. Be courageous.

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:33.700
Be steadfast.
And who might you have turned your back on?

00:34:33.700 --> 00:35:20.940
And what will you do different tomorrow?
[chanting in Maori loudly]

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.890
From New Zealand, we thank you once. [speaking
in Maori]

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:31.590
We are honored to be here at Google.
We thank you twice. [speaking in Maori]

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:39.660
We thank you three times [speaking in Maori]

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:45.650
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:51.640
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:35:51.640 --> 00:36:09.080
Ngahi Bidois: We -- just as the gentleman
is moving to the mic -- we unfortunately sold

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.310
out of books.
And it was a huge print run.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:19.190
And I think it was about three hundred.
And we -- during this trip -- are getting

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:23.090
more books printed.
And we're only able to bring the last ten

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:29.770
books to Google unfortunately.
But would like to gift those ten books to

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:34.520
your company and we thank you _____ for hosting
us here.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.410
And Erica [undecipherable]

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:49.140
Q First of all, thank you for speaking today.
And my question is, I love to travel, and

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.850
when I travel, I really enjoy seeing rituals
from indigenous people.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:57.180
And I've been to New Zealand twice and really
enjoyed it.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.660
When I was there, I went to -- and I'm probably
going to mispronounce this -- hongi?

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.800
Ngahi Bidois: Hongi, yes.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:14.760
Q And the Maoris who perform some dancing
and whatnot were different from many of the

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.020
other indigenous groups that I've seen in
other places in the world, because they meant

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:22.550
it.
When they did what they did, they weren't

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.500
standing there doing it for tourists, they
meant it.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.320
It was clear.
And my question for you is -- and it was beautiful.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:37.590
I was obviously, I mean, they stood out from
many other peoples that I've seen.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:45.630
My question is, Why do you think that the
Maori have been able to hold on to their culture

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.280
that strongly?
And what might other indigenous cultures learn

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.821
from you in that regard?

00:37:51.821 --> 00:37:58.000
Ngahi Bidois: Thank you, Phil. Good question.
We -- a part of our survival if you want,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.330
and a part of our business acumen has been
the expertise that we bring in the area of

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:10.180
tourism.
And I think there are two areas that contribute

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:15.090
to ascertaining our -- what we call 'performing
arts'.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:22.370
One is, the emphasis of a culture that was
never written down.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:29.580
It wasn't until we had people come from England
that our language, etcetera, was actually

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.430
written.
Our language was an old language that was

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:38.960
passed down through the generations.
And even the challenge, that my son and I

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:45.260
did then, is a challenge from our tribe that
has been passed down through many generations

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:51.590
and has retained a lot of our historical knowledge.
So that was the first thing.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:57.940
The retention of our knowledge through our
performing arts has always been a very important

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:02.520
part of our culture.
The second one, obviously, is around tourism.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:10.100
And we thought, "Well, you know, we are a
very unique culture from what we consider

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:17.150
a very unique and beautiful place."
And we were able to turn what had been historical

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:23.600
knowledge into tourism activity.
And so, we were not only able to perform our

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.880
challenges and our wiyat, our songs, but we
were also able to take that indigenous knowledge

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.790
and invite people to some of our very sacred
places.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:40.000
And so, tourism, as you said, has always been
a part of who we are.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.040
And an important part of our culture is hospitality.
An important part of our culture is being

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:53.990
able to look after the safety and look after
the well-being of our guests.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:59.400
And tourism fits in that as well.
Now you mentioned hongi, Phil.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:07.230
It's important that, when you are talking
about our language and use words like 'hongi',

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:12.560
that you don't get them confused with words
like 'hangi'.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:19.930
Now a hongi is where I will greet you and
I will press noses with you.

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:27.870
But do you remember doing that?
I would like to demonstrate the hongi.

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:38.230
The hongi is where we press noses twice.
Now, we press noses with you once to acknowledge

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:43.130
you.
And twice to acknowledge your ancestors.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:52.200
The pressing of the noses, known as the hongi,
allows us to both share a breath of life together

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:57.410
as we meet.
And it's a protocol that we use when we meet,

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:02.720
and also, when we leave someone.
So that's the hongi.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.641
So the 'hongi' is where we meet you or greet
you.

00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:13.210
And the 'hangi' is where we eat you and cook
you. [laughter]

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:24.740
You'll be pleased to know that we no longer
do that -- that there are other forms of meat

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.060
that have been provided that run around in
paddocks.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:34.970
And that's called the 'hangi', but it's actually
a method of cooking food where it's prepared

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.570
under the ground; the ground is covered up
with stones that are heating in rocks, heating

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:44.220
the food, and it takes about three or four
hours to cook before we eat it.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.840
It has a unique taste, doesn't it?
So does that answer your question?

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:55.620
So it's a retention of our knowledge -- our
indigenous knowledge -- and it's also the

00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:00.810
ability to be business people.
We have in New Zealand -- Maori people have

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:07.080
some of the biggest tourism attractions in
New Zealand, from wild watching all the way

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:13.030
through to entertaining like you've seen here
tonight where you will have a hongi in performances

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:17.820
as well.
And especially in ______ the city that I come

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:24.230
from where it's known as the Maori cultural
capital of New Zealand, we also have some

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.320
of the biggest education institutes in New
Zealand.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.470
And, for example, the biggest tertiary institute
is Maori.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:39.070
We have scholarships for our young people.
And a lot of our tribes are receiving millions

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:46.110
of dollars from the crown in order for us
to develop our capacity in many areas throughout

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.470
New Zealand as well.
Other questions?

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.690
So I promise not to answer questions so long.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:57.790
Q Thank you again for coming.
And it's very nice to meet you and listen.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:04.600
I was just reading through some of the introduction.
And you're talking about your last name Bidois

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:11.530
and ______ French ancestry and raised Catholic.
Not knowing much about the Maori tribe and

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:20.811
religion, was there a conflict there?
Is there a similarity between, you know, with

00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:27.030
other Maori tribes where there's Catholicism
or other types of religion blended in?

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:28.030
Just very curious.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:33.250
Ngahi Bidois: Sure. And so your question is
around what sort of religion we have?

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:45.750
Q Yeah, is there, you know, is there a correlation
to perhaps a different way of having faith

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:53.260
or having belief since you talk -- at least,
you just bring it up in the book, coming from

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.480
primarily Catholic in the beginning.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.520
Ngahi Bidois: Yes. As a people, we are very
spiritual.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:01.630
I put it as 'spiritual'. As a people, we are
very spiritual people.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:10.870
And we, for example, a part of the colonization
process if you want -- the people coming from

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:18.840
England -- was the first book that was ever
written in our language was the Bible.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:24.650
And the Bible was written by missionaries
who came and were, I guess, obviously a part

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:30.820
of the religious beliefs that were brought
to our country.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:37.100
As a people, we are very spiritual, and you
will find many of our Maori people distributed

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.220
amongst the many religions that are in New
Zealand.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:47.520
For example, we have Catholics, Presbyterians,
Anglicans, and we also have more of the newer

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.070
forms of Christianity -- born again Christians,
etc.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:45:00.730
And we also had our own prophets -- people
who had spiritual experiences and were healers.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:09.700
People like William Ratner, who had followers
and who's today known as the Ratner Church

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:14.050
because of the things he was able to do and
the people that he healed and the gifts that

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:23.990
he presented to people in a spiritual sense.
And so, today, you'll find quite a wide range

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:29.870
of Maori involved in the various religions
as such.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:38.830
However, we also have a very strong, spiritual
connection with our indigenous knowledge.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:48.210
And our indigenous knowledge has within it
our own beliefs and our own creation and our

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:54.750
own guardians, our own -- we would call him
'Supreme Being'.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:58.710
Our own supreme being.
And known as [speaking in Maori] [translating]

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:02.080
"The Fatherless One."
And many other names.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:08.930
We would also have guardians at a lower spiritual
plane who are guardians over areas.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:18.970
And, for example creation, which has helped
us hugely with our environmental protocols

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:25.790
and the way that we look after our environment.
So spirituality is a very strong part of who

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:32.530
we are as Maori.
And, like I said, there's a wide range of

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:39.790
people you'll find -- Maori people in different
beliefs.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:47.580
Other questions? [pause] Cool. Thank you.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:47.800
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
