00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.839
So now it's time for a quiz to

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.830
see if you understand how replacement grammars work and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.950
can follow the BNF grammar we have here.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.670
So the question is, which of these sentences can

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.763
be produced from the grammar here, starting from the non-terminal sentence?

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.670
So check all of the sentence that are in the grammar. The choices are Python

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.240
eat cookies, Python eat Python, and I like eat.
