need to worry about this so think a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
need to worry about this so think a
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.660
need to worry about this so think a
little bit about what it would take for

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
little bit about what it would take for
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.670
little bit about what it would take for
you to ship a few thousand managed

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

with latest security patches once you've
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.990
with latest security patches once you've
found those patches you have to build a
