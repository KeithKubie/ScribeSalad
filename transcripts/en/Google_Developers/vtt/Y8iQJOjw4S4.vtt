JAMES MCLURKIN: So the whole
point of the AIY Projects team

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:12.770
at Google is to build artificial
intelligence kits that

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.790
let makers take the cool
parts of Google intelligence

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.890
and put them into their builds.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.475
Last year, we released
the Voice Kit--

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:27.290
train, fast-- which was a kit
that lets you record your voice

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.630
and then analyze it and get the
text back from what you said.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.566
This year we're
releasing the Vision Kit.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.280
It does not need an
internet connection.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.710
It does not need the cloud.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.100
You program it with the
Neural Network model,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.860
and the kit then gives you
back data on what it sees.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.470
So if I give it a face,
the light will come on.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.000
And then as I get
happier, the light

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.020
will change from blue to yellow.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.570
So this is our mobile
nets neural network.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.550
This is an object classifier.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.090
And it's got 1,000 different
common objects in it.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.370
We have a banana.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.250
And let's see, a screwdriver.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.880
Yeah, it's got that pretty good.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.110
It's got an apple.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.220
Not just an apple--

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.140
it's got the type
of apple as well.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.820
And even a water
bottle, which is tricky

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.070
because there's a clear thing.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.710
So it's not really a thing.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.200
It's just reflecting
other things.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.760
So learning how to
use these things

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.070
and how to make it detect
what you want to detect

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.480
is going to be part of the fun.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.740
Our face detector
code told us not only

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.410
that there is a
face in the image,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.050
but it also tells us
where the face is.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.290
It gives us the
geometry of the face.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.030
So we can use that to
build a tracker that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.390
can follow me wherever I go.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.570
We've shown you face
detection, object recognition,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.500
and face tracking with
the Google AIY Vision Kit.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.910
But this is just beginning.

00:01:58.587 --> 00:02:00.170
We're really looking
forward to seeing

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.670
what you build with this kit.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.020
