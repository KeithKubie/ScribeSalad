00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.300
We're on problem 116.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:11.270
What is the value of
a plus b squared?

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.300
Statement 1.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.650
Statement 1 tells us that
a times b is equal to 0.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.285
That, to me, seems
fairly useless.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.660
Let me see, what if we
expand that out.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.920
That's equal to to a squared
plus 2ab plus b squared.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.000
This is the same thing.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.310
I just expanded out
a plus b squared.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.410
And so they're giving
us a piece.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.530
They're telling us that this
term right here is going to be

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.280
equal to 0.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.590
If ab is equal to 0, this term
right here is going to be

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.140
equal to 0.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.690
But we still don't know what a
squared and b squared are.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.630
So statement 1 by itself:
not so useful.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.200
Statement 2.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.790
a minus b squared
is equal to 36.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.030
This is interesting.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.860
So let's expand this
out a little bit.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.870
So this tells us-- so you might
want to say, oh that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.325
means that a minus b
is plus or minus 6.

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:13.900
But actually I don't
think that is going

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.210
to help you as much.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.870
Well actually, that could
help you as well.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.460
But the way I'm thinking about
it is, let's expand this out.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:36.800
We get a squared minus 2ab plus
b squared is equal to 36.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.890
So, by itself the statement
isn't that useful.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.010
I mean, even here the statement
says that if you

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.700
were to take the square root
of both sides, it tells us

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.240
that the difference between a
and b is either positive 6 or

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.746
negative 6.

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:49.070
If you took the square
root of both sides.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.700
So statement 2 by itself
is kind of useless.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.500
But if you use them together,
you expand out

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.150
statement 2 you get this.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.040
Now if we also take in statement
1 and say, oh, ab is

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.740
equal to 0.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.610
So then that is equal to 0.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.630
And we're left with a squared
plus b squared is equal to 36.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.280
And if a squared plus b squared
is equal to 36, then

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.920
we know that this a squared
plus b squared is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.950
also equal to 36.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.800
So that tells us that
a plus b squared is

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.850
equal to 36 as well.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.220
So both statements together
are sufficient.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.460
And this is interesting.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.350
Because if you think about it,
it makes a lot of sense.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.920
This statement tells us that the
difference between a and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.130
b-- and this is all a waste of
time, but I just want to give

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.320
you some intuition-- this tells
us that a minus b is

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.320
equal to plus or minus 6.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.500
So it tells you that the
difference between a and b is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.060
either positive 6 or minus 6.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.350
So one is 6 bigger than the
other but we don't know which

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.890
way it goes.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.020
This statement tells us that
one of them is equal to 0.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.720
Both of them aren't going to be
equal to 0 because there's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.340
a 6 difference.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.340
So if one of them is equal to
0, then the other one is

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.060
either going to be
plus or minus 6.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.900
If we look at this statement,
one of these numbers is 0.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.540
The other one is plus
or minus 6.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.340
But it doesn't matter.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.030
If one is 0 and one is plus 6,
and you square it, you get 36.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.920
If one is 0 and the other
is minus 6, you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.520
square it, you get 36.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.020
So anyway, just want to give
you that little intuition.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.600
But the correct answer is that
both statements together are

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.190
necessary to solve
this problem.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.740
117.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.050
The more connections you can
make while doing these math

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.540
problems, the better you'll
be, really the better off

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.180
you'll be in life, I think.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.190
It will all start
making sense.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.590
All right, they've
drawn this thing.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.450
And then they draw this
down like that.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.260
Let's see.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:09.170
This is L, M, N and K.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.060
In the figure above, what is
the ratio of KN to MN?

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.870
So they want to know the ratio
of this side, KM to MN.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.830
Fair enough.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.370
OK.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.770
Statement number 1 tells us
the perimeter of rectangle

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:42.790
KLMN is 30 meters.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.280
So this is a rectangle, right?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.200
So that tells us that-- let's
put it in terms of the things

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.350
that we care about-- that 2
times MN-- because MN and KL

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.320
are going to be the
same length,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.160
since it's a rectangle.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.720
So this tells us that 2 times
MN plus 2 times KN-- because

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.230
KN and LM are the same length.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.540
So let's just put it
in the terms of the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.770
things we care about.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:13.100
Plus 2 times KN is
equal to 30.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.920
That's the perimeter.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.520
Twice this plus twice this.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.430
That's the perimeter.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.790
You could say that plus that
plus that plus that.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.570
But this keeps it in
terms of that.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.910
So I think we can solve.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.000
Let's divide both sides by 2.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.590
You get MN plus KN
is equal to 30.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.540
And actually, yeah, you still
can't figure out the ratio

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.190
between the two.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.410
You just know that the sum of
the two are equal to 30.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.050
Let's look at statement 2.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.150
You can't figure out the
ratio from this.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.370
Statement 2 tells us the three
small rectangles have the same

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.620
dimensions.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.950
This is interesting.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.980
So that's telling us.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.760
Well that's interesting.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.790
Because that tells us that
this distance and this

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.280
distance have to be the same.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.060
That tells us that-- and if
this distance and this

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.580
distance are the same, then this
distance right there is

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.780
twice this distance.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.640
How did I get that?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.880
Well this distance is twice each
of this these distances.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.610
This longer side of
this horizontal

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.120
rectangle is twice this.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.620
And this is the same
thing as this.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.130
So for all of these rectangles,
their ratio of

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.170
their sides is 1:2.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.690
So let's create a unit
called the short

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.420
side of this rectangle.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.010
So how many units long is MN?

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.780
Well MN is going to be, this
side right here is going to be

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.170
two of those units long.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.360
So, 1, 2, and then 3.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.060
We figured that out because the
long side of this is twice

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.050
as long as the short side.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.120
So if we were measuring these in
terms of the short sides of

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.070
the rectangle, MN is 3 of them
and then KN is 2 of them.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.430
1, 2.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.720
So the ratio of KN to MN, it
doesn't matter what units you

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.020
measure in, you just want
to get the ratio.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.910
So the ratio is going to
be equal to 2 to 3.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.680
So statement 2 alone
is sufficient

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.270
to solve this problem.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.520
Next question.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.840
118.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:00.620
If n is a positive integer,
is 150 over n an integer?

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.330
So it's essentially asking us,
is n divisible into 150?

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.900
That's the only way
that 150 over n is

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.610
going to be an integer.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:14.270
Statement number 1 tells us
that n is less than 7.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.270
Now if every number less than 7
is divisible into 150, then

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.770
we're all set.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.840
Because we know it's
positive as well.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.310
And 1 works.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.960
2 works, 75.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.370
3 works, 50.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:37.440
4-- let's see 4 goes into 100
and then does it go into 50?

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.390
4 goes into 50-- no it
doesn't go into 50.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.490
So 4 does not work.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.900
So just by telling us that n is
less than 7 does not solve

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.280
the problem.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.915
Because if n was 4, 4 does
not go into 150 evenly.

00:08:49.915 --> 00:08:52.920
It goes into it-- no, I'm not
going to figure it out.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:00.840
4 goes into it-- it goes in 25,
25 plus 12, 37.5 times.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.430
So that doesn't do
us any good.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.780
Statement 1 by itself
isn't that useful.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.180
Statement 2.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.960
n is a prime number.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.490
n is prime.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.950
So this statement by itself
is not useful.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.970
Because, I mean n could be a
prime number larger than 150.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.670
So that by itself doesn't tell
us that we definitely can get

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.410
an integer.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.660
And n could easily be 3,
which would allow it.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.350
So n doesn't tell you
one way or another

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.870
whether this is an integer.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.810
But if you combine the two
statements, if you say that n

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.520
is a prime number that has to
be less than 7, then we can

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.360
take 4 out of the picture.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.150
Because 4 isn't prime.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.260
And then you put 5 there.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.910
5 definitely does go into 150.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.030
And then 6, 6 does
go into 150.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.640
It goes into 120.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.060
And then 30 leftover,
so 6 goes into 120.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.930
So all of the prime numbers
less than 7 are

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.490
divisible into 150.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.490
So both statements combined
are sufficient

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.010
to answer this question.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.860
See you in the next video.
