00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.200
 [Music] 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.200
 Gomez: Wallapop is a simple application. 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000
 It is a market for used goods 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.680
 On your mobile phone where each item is located 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.120
 Simulates the Wallapop application on your mobile device 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.280
 Shopping in neighborhoods 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.640
 Where you can browse the goods 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.160
 Sold by your neighbors. 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.520
 Purchase of goods on the application is similar to traditional purchases from stores. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.320
 It differs greatly from the purchase of the usual classified goods. 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.600
 I realized at a stage of my life 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.040
 The time is ripe for a new challenge. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.320
 I decided to start working on the Wallapop application in Barcelona. 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.280
 On the first day we were only two people 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.320
 And one month after the application was created 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.360
 We achieved first place 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.240
 In Spain on the Play Store. 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.480
 One of the main features of the Wallapop application is its simplicity. 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.840
 People aged 15 to 60 were selling goods 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 On the Wallapop website. 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 More than 70% of our application users 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.240
 From Android platform owners. 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.320
 Joey: My name is Marta and I work for Wallapop 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.240
 As Director of Growth and Marketing. 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.560
 We started a year ago using store data experiments 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.800
 After the testing phase, downloads improved without any incentives by 17%. 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.320
 We first started testing 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.880
 Many factors at the same time 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.560
 We have not reached the desired result 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.840
 We decided to test each element individually. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.680
 We decided to start testing the brief description. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.360
 As a result, downloads improved without any incentives of 6%. 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.480
 Then we ran another test with the Business Information Analysis team 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.920
 Who told us about best-selling applications. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520
 We conducted four different experiments 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.960
 With four distinct products 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.080
 To test the extent to which users are attracted to it 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.840
 During the tests, we found out 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.760
 There are two types of users 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.600
 Users who have already decided to download the app and experienced users. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.200
 So we created an easily recognizable envelope 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.120
 By users who have previously decided to download the application 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.880
 Using the main logo of the Wallapop application 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.480
 And what was displayed in the app's ad on your TV. 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.360
 We also tried changing the order of screens 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.920
 To see how this affects the app download rate 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.400
 We have achieved excellent results. 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.960
 When creating your Google Play store page 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.760
 Consider the first impression factor 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.920
 Because it may be the only opportunity available to you 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.400
 To convince the user to download your app. 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.560
 Gomez: Since the launch of the Wallapop application 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.520
 We expanded and became a big family. 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.480
 We have had a great success 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.120
 Happens once in a lifetime 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.520
 I am very grateful for my success at 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.640
 Lead this team. This was the most difficult experience 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.240
 And the greatest in my life.
