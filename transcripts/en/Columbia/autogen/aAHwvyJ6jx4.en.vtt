courses in the multiple languages so we

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
courses in the multiple languages so we
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.399
courses in the multiple languages so we
have those in Spanish and Portuguese we

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
have those in Spanish and Portuguese we
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620
have those in Spanish and Portuguese we
have those in Chinese and Japanese other

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
have those in Chinese and Japanese other
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.160
have those in Chinese and Japanese other
languages as well so it's not just the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
languages as well so it's not just the
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.219
languages as well so it's not just the
content but the translations um I was

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
content but the translations um I was
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.219

content providers here how does that
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.620
content providers here how does that
really fit in with OpenCourseWare well

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
really fit in with OpenCourseWare well
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.340

they build it on under fair use and so

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
they build it on under fair use and so
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.100
they build it on under fair use and so
they don't really have to think about

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
they don't really have to think about
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840
they don't really have to think about
whether the stuff that they're using in

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
whether the stuff that they're using in
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.179
whether the stuff that they're using in
their course violates intellectual

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
their course violates intellectual
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.300
their course violates intellectual
property also you could argue that maybe

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
property also you could argue that maybe
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.580
property also you could argue that maybe
some of those courses aren't as exciting

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
some of those courses aren't as exciting
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.100
some of those courses aren't as exciting
as dynamic as they could be and so if

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
as dynamic as they could be and so if
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.840
as dynamic as they could be and so if
you think about the various archives the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
you think about the various archives the
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.930
you think about the various archives the
various libraries the various digital

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940
various libraries the various digital

if we can sort of bring those professors

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
if we can sort of bring those professors

providing then they could incorporate

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580
providing then they could incorporate
 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.820
providing then they could incorporate
your materials into their courses and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
your materials into their courses and
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.619
your materials into their courses and
not only make their courses better have

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629
not only make their courses better have
 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.940
not only make their courses better have
the students learning experience is

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
the students learning experience is
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.860
the students learning experience is
better but also how do you feel like

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
better but also how do you feel like
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.080
better but also how do you feel like
your stuff is really making penetration

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
your stuff is really making penetration
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.000
your stuff is really making penetration
in important areas so I do think that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
in important areas so I do think that
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.369
in important areas so I do think that
there's synergy there if we have a

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379
there's synergy there if we have a
 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.940
there's synergy there if we have a
particular niche in the oer space it's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
particular niche in the oer space it's
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.720
particular niche in the oer space it's
that um we have a very targeted audience

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730
that um we have a very targeted audience
 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.000
that um we have a very targeted audience
you know we are structured courses in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
you know we are structured courses in
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.000
you know we are structured courses in
the university setting where the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010
the university setting where the
 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.860
the university setting where the
learning objects are in context and in
