00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.090
Anyone who’s read or watched the novels
or TV series of George R. R. Martin’s Game

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.320
of Thrones knows that there’s enough family
feuds, war, politics and intrigue for ten

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.910
franchises. But for all the shocking deaths,
betrayal, and strokes of luck that the series

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.920
has featured thus far, there’s one question
that fans debate more than any other, believing

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.341
that it may hold the secret to the entire
story. The mystery hinges on Jon Snow, the

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:38.289
illegitimate son of Ned Stark, the former
head of Winterfell - the identity of his mother,

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.520
to be exact. It’s one riddle that readers
and viewers are both hopeless to solve until

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.829
the end of the story, but one theory has risen
above the rest. And if it’s true, Jon Snow

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.470
may not just be an underdog hero, but the
savior of all mankind.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.700
Obviously there will be plenty of POTENTIAL
SPOILERS in our look at the theory and evidence

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:12.030
behind the Game of Thrones theory that reveals
Jon Snow’s shocking lineage. In short: R+L=J.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.009
The Prince That Was Promised

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.630
Before we get to the current timeline, there’s
one prophecy in Martin’s universe that most

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.409
fans should know about, which is claimed to
date back thousands of years. The prophecy

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.310
claims that one day, a noble prince will be
born between smoke and salt, with the power

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.719
to unite and save all of the kingdoms of man.
Known as “the prince who was promised,”

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:40.179
or Azor Ahai by the Red Priestess Melisandre,
this hero will arrive to stop a terrible winter

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.329
– most likely a reference to the cold and
monstrous creatures living North of The Wall.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.880
Plenty of people have claimed they were the
prophesied prince, but there’s one candidate

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.619
who actually seemed like a frontrunner.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.079
The Dragon Prince

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.600
Since the HBO series picks up long after the
story that this theory is based on, viewers

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.820
may not know of The Dragon Prince, but readers
definitely do. There are constant references

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.240
to the last Targaryen ruler, known as The
Mad King, and who Jamie Lannister stabbed

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.280
in the back when he refused to surrender.
But it’s the Mad King’s oldest son Rhaegar

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.590
who is far more important. Strong, beautiful,
and a born leader, those close to the royal

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.040
family claimed that the boy was the promised
prince since he was born amidst the smoke

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.380
and ash of a burning castle. Most of the nobility
and common folk seemed to agree that Rhaegar

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.200
was a great ruler in the making, and would
have made an incredible king. But he never

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.260
got the chance to take the throne, or fulfill
the prophecy. At least, not the prophecy that

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.200
people expected. But if you ask some people
in the North, Rhaegar was no savior king,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.120
but a monstrous criminal. All because of a
single woman…

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.120
Lyanna Stark

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.040
In the very first episode of the HBO series,
viewers hear exactly how Lyanna Stark, the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.900
sister of Ned Stark, kicked the entire story
into motion. You see, Lyanna was betrothed

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.090
to Robert Baratheon, the Starks’ family
friend, and ally. But engaged or not, Lyanna

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.690
was just as amazed by Rhaegar’s beauty as
any other woman in the kingdom. And when the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.380
heir to the Targaryen throne made a trip to
Winterfell, the two fell instantly in love,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.740
and escaped to be married. At least, that’s
how people from the south, or supporters of

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.690
Rhaegar tell the story. But when the prince
escaped from the North with Lyanna, Robert

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.260
called the royal heir a rapist and kidnapper
– and used the theft of his bride as the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.870
final straw in kicking off a Rebellion. His
friend Ned was only interested in getting

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.180
his sister back, but Robert was keen on removing
the Targaryens from King’s Landing once

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.100
and for all.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.090
Robert’s Rebellion

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.740
It’s worth pointing out that in the novels
and TV show, Ned holds back from actually

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.210
accusing Rhaegar of any crime, staying silent
when Robert or his friends claim he abused

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.980
or wrongfully kidnapped his sister. The novel
gives a detailed account of the rebellion,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.630
with Robert killing Rhaegar in combat, and
the prince dying with Lyanna’s name his

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.060
last words. As the wannabe king headed to
the capitol, Ned headed to a faraway tower

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.920
where Lyanna had been stashed, and guarded
by the best and most loyal of Rhaegar’s

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.379
guards. Why did he leave the woman he apparently
kidnapped so heavily guarded, instead of using

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.639
those men to fight beside him? We’ll get
to that in a minute. The important thing is

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.029
that while Robert took the crown of Westeros,
what Ned found wasn’t as much of a victory.

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:37.830
Lyanna’s Death

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.080
George R.R. Martin has kept extremely vague
about what Ned actually found in the tower,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.370
but considering the prophecy, Rhaegar’s
apparently heroic nature, and the details

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.029
we DO get, one theory starts to form. Ned
found his sister Lyanna, but found her dying

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:57.840
in a bed filled with blood. Her cause of death
is never given, but she does make one last

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.840
request of her brother, begging him to make
her a promise, and keep it, no matter what.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.491
With only Ned and his most trusted bannerman
actually knowing what the promise was, he

00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:12.720
began his trip back to the North, back to
his family, and back to his wife. And as fans

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.099
know, he happened to be bringing a baby back
with him.

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.689
The Secret King?

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:27.659
The baby would be named Jon Snow, and dismissed
as illegitimate, but the clues that Jon is

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.849
actually the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna – born
after they were married – don’t stop there.

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:39.009
In the books, Jon is described as looking
the most like a Stark out of all of Ned’s

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.360
children – which makes his wife, Catelyn
even angrier. But viewers could see that Ned

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.789
never seemed like the kind of man to cheat
on his wife, but remained silent about his

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.029
apparent mistress for the decades since.
It didn’t take long for readers to claim

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.539
that Jon, not Rhaegar, was the prince who
was promised, possessing the wisdom, strength,

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:06.039
and courage to save man from a terrible enemy.
As the child of the silver-haired Targaryen

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:11.300
and jet black Starks – the salt and smoke
– the fact that his pet direwolf, Ghost,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.240
is also white as snow seemed like the final
clue. And as the son of Prince Rhaegar and

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.379
his wife, Lyanna, that makes him the rightful
heir – the only rightful heir – to the

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:22.650
Iron Throne.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.779
Unfortunately, Ned Stark’s death means there’s
only one other person who knows of Lyanna’s

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:33.180
promise: Ned’s bannerman, Howland Reed.
He’s yet to appear in the books or TV show,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.350
but it’s his children who are watching over
the lost Stark boys (Brand and Ricken). So

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.509
all the theory needs, supporters claim, is
for Howland to arrive, confirm Jon’s true

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.229
parents, and step aside to let him take the
throne. But considering the monsters gathering

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:53.800
North of The Wall, Jon may have to save mankind
before he can even think about becoming king.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:02.650
That’s the 
basic story behind the leading theory that

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.530
R+L=J, which means you can now wait with readers,
viewers, and every other kind of fan to see

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.479
if it’s proven true. What do you think?
Would this potential ending seem like the

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.621
most satisfying, if it’s true? Or would
you prefer that the Mother of Dragons, or

00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:21.099
another contender win the throne? Let us know
