Alright, so to get started showing you soem of the performance

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.840
techniques in Chrome Dev Tools, I want you to load up

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.140
the Dev Tools bar, and also check out this great HTML-5

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.650
game called Biolab Disaster. Now, I love this game. It's made

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.540
with a fantastic framework called Impact JS. And, happens to be

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.980
a lot of the motivation on how we did the Grits

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.920
Code Base back in the other course. Now, let's take a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.860
look at what we have here. When we talk about performance,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.010
we always talk about three pillars of performance. Network, render,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.210
and compute. What we are going to talk today first

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.930
is the Network pillar. In order to get an understanding

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.010
of how your web application is loading, what resources are coming

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.610
down to the wire. And how long it's taking, but

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.690
first thing you need to do is open up the network

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.650
tab in Chrome Dev Tools. This is a fantastic GEM

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.430
and treasure trove of information.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.180
Because basically, this actually records every

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.575
request that your web application is making to the server

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:58.040
enlisted here with a lot of very valid information. For example,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.640
you can see what type it is, the status of

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.180
the request The content, how long it took to get it,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.650
and when it came in in the overall request structure

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.080
of your entire loading sequence. Now, we could spend an entire

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.160
Udacity course actually going into the nuances of this tool

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.200
and how to use it, but instead I want to focus

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.900
on a couple Key things. First off, when you're talking

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.640
about loading web applications on mobile devices, there's two things

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.580
you need to worry about. The first is how many

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.700
requests you're actually making. So for instance, if you scroll down

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.080
for playbiolab.com, you can actually see that there's a lot

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.560
of assets that are being loaded here. Right? Every time

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.130
your phone has to grab one of these assets off

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.140
the Internet, a lot of things occur, but most importantly is,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.530
it takes time away from loading your application. Mainly because the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.390
medium to retrieve the data is a little bit slower than just

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.010
loading it, say, off the memory or off of the disk.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.450
Now, the second thing you need to be concerned about is actually

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.490
the size of the content that you're trying to load. So

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.870
if you go over here to the size button, and you actually

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.710
click on it twice, it's actually going to sort all of the assets

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.330
that you requested by their size. Now, notice right here, this top

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.669
one actually has two megabytes. Now look at

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.480
That's a single OG file. Of course that's going to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.580
be music. But basically that's two megabytes that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.490
has to be downloaded before this web application could

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.370
be played. Now, did you know that according

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.105
to http archive, the average website size is only

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:28.290
1.1 megabytes? So already this single asset is

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.600
larger than most of the websites on the web.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.550
Listen, that's not going to help you load this on your mobile device

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.830
any faster. So by sorting it by size you can get a great

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.200
sense of what assets you have, what sizes they are and see the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.580
relative proportion on how long it takes those assets to actually be loaded.
