00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.401
Let's try graphing some more hyperbolas. I want you to graph this equation on

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:09.400
your own paper and then tell me what's the center and what's a and what's b.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.633
Just like before, we'll check to see if your graph matches this one and the

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:13.930
solution.
