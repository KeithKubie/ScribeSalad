Okay, so here's the quiz question then. What is

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.640
the big advantage of RCA and there is a

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.580
single word to describe it. So your job Michael

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.333
is to look into my brain and imagine what word

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:16.390
it is I'm thinking of and I gave you a hint by saying it jumps out at you,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.950
which means if you don't come up with it

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.930
you're going to feel really bad. [LAUGH] Okay, so you ready?

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.700
&gt;&gt; Ready.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.420
&gt;&gt; Okay. Go!
