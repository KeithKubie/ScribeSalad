MALE SPEAKER: I'm
pleased to introduce

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.560
Jenny Lawson, otherwise
known as The Bloggess.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.010
Jenny's former book, "Let's
Pretend This Never Happened,"

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.420
was a number one New
York Times Bestseller.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.310
And her current book,
"Furiously Happy,"

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.770
has already been named one of
the best humor books of 2015

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.870
by Amazon.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.710
I have to admit, being up
here in front of all of you

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.490
makes me a little bit anxious.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.034
But it will lessen shortly.

00:00:24.034 --> 00:00:25.700
However, there's
another type of anxiety

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.650
that only increases over time.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.630
It may be crippling or
lead to other dark places.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.890
Jenny's visited those
places, and she's

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.160
determined to live the
rest of her life a bit

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.120
more happy because of them.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.390
And she's written
that in her book.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.390
It's a journey full of fun,
unexpected, and sometimes

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.042
serious events.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.500
If you're like me
after reading it,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.540
you may want to tell
your friends about it.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.630
On the other hand,
as Jenny says,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.240
if you don't like the
book, then maybe you're

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.450
just not crazy
enough to enjoy it.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.700
Either way, you win.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.376
Please join me in giving a
warm welcome to Jenny Lawson.

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:04.154
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.020
JENNY LAWSON: So first
of all, I'm gonna curse.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.502
So I'm going to tell
you that right now.

00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:18.950
So just be prepared.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.630
Secondly, usually
I spend my lunch

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.732
having Google entertain me,
so this is fucking weird.

00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:26.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:28.580
JENNY LAWSON: This is
like weird opposite day

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.308
and it's freaking me out.

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:36.790
Also, when I told my husband
that I was going to be here,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.520
he said, oh, you should check
out the driverless cars.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.020
And I was like, I don't even
know what you're talking about.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.800
He was like, oh these
driverless cars.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.080
And I was just like,
that's a terrible idea.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.764
So I'm just telling
you right now.

00:01:48.764 --> 00:01:50.830
I think maybe y'all
aren't in control of that.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.510
So good job, because driverless
cars, I had one of those,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.775
and it hit people.

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:01.770
If you don't put it completely
in park, it's not good.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.220
You can get tickets.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.509
And also I thought it would
be really strange to have

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.425
a driverless car-- and
you have to forgive me,

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:12.200
because I absolutely know
nothing about them except

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.190
the word "driverless
car"-- words--

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.610
but I hate to drive because
it makes me very anxious,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.410
and so my husband
always drives me.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.820
And I think it would be really
uncomfortable driving in a car

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.395
where there wasn't a
driver constantly cursing

00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:31.770
at everyone else, because
that's how I know that I

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.160
someone's taking care of me.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.749
And also when he's
always driving,

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.040
and he's like, well, where
do you want to go eat lunch?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.873
And I'm like, oh, let's
go get Mexican food.

00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:42.740
And he's like, nope.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.775
So basically I would get a
driverless car that would say

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:46.025
like, where do you want to go?

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:47.626
And I'm not going
to take you there.

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.250
I'm going to make
you feel comfortable.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.547
So I would say, first
off-- actually it's

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.300
not first, because I've
already been talking.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.730
First off, I did not take
my ADD medicine today.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.154
Probably pretty obvious, but
I'm going to try and focus.

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:10.866
I did take my anxiety medicine,
but taking my anxiety medicine

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:14.275
without taking my ADD medicine
makes me a little bit sleepy.

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:16.400
And then it's rainy, which
makes me totally sleepy.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.020
I don't know how you
guys are awake ever.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.760
And also the entire time
I'm like, look, rain!

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.690
Rain!

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.195
Because in Texas
we don't get this.

00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:27.070
And everybody else is
like, ah, fucking rain.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.125
So first of all,
good job on the rain,

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.040
and also good job on
seasons, having seasons.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040
That's a great thing.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.540
We don't have that in Texas.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.210
I am going to do a reading,
and this is literally

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.490
a page and half.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.181
But that way you
can say, oh yeah,

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.870
I've been to a Jenny
Lawson reading.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.329
I'm stepping on a
lot of wires here

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.536
and I might get electrocuted.

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:56.675
I'm sure it will be fine.

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:57.610
It'll be OK.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.527
So I'm going to--
let's see-- I'm

00:04:08.527 --> 00:04:10.652
going to skip that one,
which is a little bit dark.

00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:16.190
Let's do this one, which
is-- and I will preface this

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.526
by saying, just in case
you have no idea who I am,

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:20.492
that's totally OK.

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:28.500
I am weird and slightly--
more than slightly-- off,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.050
and I write weird
things on the internet,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.950
and sometimes in books.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.775
And weirdly enough,
people actually like them.

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:41.370
And I actually just found
out that this strange book

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.790
is on the "New York Time"'s
list for the seventh week

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.956
in a row, which is very
weird because you look at it

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:50.845
and it's like, Mindy Kaling
and that asshole O'Reilly.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.071
And it's all these
people that you're

00:04:55.071 --> 00:04:56.279
like, oh, I know that person.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.080
I know that person.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.500
I hate that person.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.027
And then there's a dead
raccoon, so that's-- actually

00:05:02.027 --> 00:05:02.860
that's kind of nice.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.930
So "I Found a Kindred Soul, and
He Has a Very Healthy Coat."

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.589
A few weeks ago, I was at the
pharmacy picking up my meds,

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:13.505
and I'm starting into
the drive through window

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.800
and thinking about how awesome
it is to live in a world

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.150
where you can pick up
drugs in a drive through.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.641
And that's when I noticed
something strange next

00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:21.849
to the pharmacist's register.

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.723
And I don't know if you
can see this picture,

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:29.600
but this is an open box
of milk bone dog biscuits.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.460
And I thought, well that's odd.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.485
But maybe someone
returned them because they

00:05:34.485 --> 00:05:36.868
were stale or
something, and then I

00:05:36.868 --> 00:05:39.150
thought it was even odder
that someone would realize

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.120
the dog biscuits had gone
stale, because dogs usually

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.860
aren't very good at
not eating cookies

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.797
even if they're fairly shitty.

00:05:45.797 --> 00:05:47.785
I mean, dogs eat used
diapers if you let them,

00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:49.134
so I'm pretty sure
none of them are

00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:51.761
saying no to eating cookies, but
then the pharmacist came back.

00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:54.494
And while he was
ringing me up he

00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:57.740
reached over and picked up a
handful of broken dog biscuits

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.090
and ate them.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.832
I thought, wait.

00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:07.290
Am I high right now?

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.620
Is he high?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.760
Am I being tested?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.155
Should I say something?

00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:13.502
But I didn't, because I'm
pretty sure that you're not

00:06:13.502 --> 00:06:14.880
supposed to accuse
the man giving you

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.730
drugs of eating dog food.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.980
And then I signed for the
drugs and then I drove away.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.740
And I thought to
myself, is it possible

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.440
that he accidentally
ate the dog biscuits?

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.108
Or maybe someone is always
stealing his food at work

00:06:25.108 --> 00:06:28.242
so he decided to put his
tasty human cookies, maybe

00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:31.360
for humans, not out of
humans, into a [INAUDIBLE] box

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.710
to keep them safe.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.070
Or maybe he just likes
to entertain himself

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.970
by seeing if people will
stop him and say, dude,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.837
you're eating dog food.

00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:42.752
Those would be good
people probably.

00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:44.647
I'm not one of those people.

00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:47.230
But then I spent the whole day
thinking, why the dog biscuits?

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.688
So I went back today to ask,
but the dog biscuits were gone

00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:51.844
and the dog biscuit
eating guy was also gone.

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.510
And I thought, can I
ask this pharmacist

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.365
if the other pharmacist
who eats dog food

00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:57.490
is around because I really
need to know this story?

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.680
And the answer is no.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.990
No, I can't.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.676
But I still really want
to know because I suspect

00:07:02.676 --> 00:07:04.582
that I would be great
friends with this guy,

00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:07.484
because anyone who would hide
crackers in a dog food box

00:07:07.484 --> 00:07:09.890
seems like someone I'd
want to hang out with.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.906
Although someone who
eats dog food for fun

00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:14.100
seems slightly
more questionable.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.130
Except now I'm wondering if
maybe milk bones are really

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.300
delicious, and he's just
a genius who discovered

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.539
really cheap cookies.

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.663
Cookies you don't have to
tell your judgemental vet

00:07:22.663 --> 00:07:25.880
about when your dog gets in the
pantry and eats all of them.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.690
You did still have to
call the vet, though,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.825
when your cat has eaten a toy,
which consists of a tinkle bell

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.329
and feather and a poof ball,
all tied together with twine.

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:34.870
This is actually
happened to me once,

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.952
and it was the worst
because the vet told me

00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:38.660
I would have to ply
my cat with laxatives

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.730
in order to make the
toy pass through easily.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.356
And then inspect his
poop to make sure

00:07:43.356 --> 00:07:45.780
that the toy had passed,
because otherwise they would

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.120
have to do open cat surgery.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.090
And then it finally
did start to pass,

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.000
but just the first part
with the tinkle bell.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.291
And the cat's freaking out,
because he was running away

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:57.074
from the tinkle bell, which was
hanging out of his butthole.

00:07:57.074 --> 00:08:00.395
And I called the vet, and he
said to definitely not pull

00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:01.936
on the twine, because
it can pull out

00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:05.210
his intestines, which would
be the grossest pinata ever.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.277
And so instead, I just ran up
to the cat with some scissors

00:08:08.277 --> 00:08:10.610
to cut off the tinkle bell,
which impressively was still

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.502
tinkling after seeing the
things no tinkle should ever

00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:14.235
have to see.

00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:16.110
And I think probably
the cat was running away

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.780
both because of the
tinkle bell and also

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.540
because I was chasing
it with scissors,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.790
screaming let me help you.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.560
If I was good friends with that
dog food eating pharmacist,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.245
I would have called him to tell
him all about the tinkle bell

00:08:29.245 --> 00:08:31.420
issue, because I think he
would have appreciated it.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.154
But I never found
him again, because I

00:08:33.154 --> 00:08:35.612
was worried that if I ever
asked to see the dog food eating

00:08:35.612 --> 00:08:39.240
pharmacist, the other pharmacist
would stop giving me drugs.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.200
This all feels a
bit discriminatory,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.110
but I can't explain exactly why.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.112
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:52.130
Shortest reading ever.

00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:01.554
So I've heard that this is
the part where we do Q&amp;A.

00:09:01.554 --> 00:09:04.533
So if you have questions,
awesome, and if you don't, I'll

00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:05.840
just make shit up.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.582
So whatever.

00:09:06.582 --> 00:09:08.290
So raise your hand if
you have questions.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.581
Or just yell, or I don't know
what y'all do at Google--

00:09:10.581 --> 00:09:12.270
maybe you've
[INAUDIBLE] lights up.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.430
This is a really awesome
place, by the way.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.999
So I saw scooters
on the way here.

00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:20.790
Are those real or is
that just like a joke?

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.760
Do you really use the scooters?

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.085
Can I get a scooter
on the way out?

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:27.560
OK, and then I've also
heard that you have a boat

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.960
that people have meetings on?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.280
OK, do you have a tree house?

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.820
AUDIENCE: We have a nap room.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.695
JENNY LAWSON: Oh my god,
you have a nap room?

00:09:34.695 --> 00:09:36.805
OK, well that's sort of close.

00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:38.110
But here's what I would like.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:43.100
I would like for you guys to
build some sort of tree fort,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.572
and then up in a tree fort,
it's also a blanket fort.

00:09:45.572 --> 00:09:49.950
And it's filled with pillows
and cats, and lasagna.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.840
And I will be your
writer in residence,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.090
and I will just live up there.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.330
And if you're having a
bad day, you can come up.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.151
And we can put your
head on my lap,

00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:05.120
and I'll just pat your head and
go, poor bunny, it's all right.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.240
And then we all win.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.910
It's gonna be the
best, oh my gosh.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:14.040
So anyway, I know you guys are
really fast-- so, tomorrow, OK?

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.346
So yes, but that on your
list of things to do.

00:10:19.346 --> 00:10:20.220
But aside from that--

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.386
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:22.450
JENNY LAWSON: Sorry, yes.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.880
Yes.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.980
AUDIENCE: So in one of
your stories you reference

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.570
a fictional horse
named Pony Danza.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.320
JENNY LAWSON: Yes.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.725
Yes.

00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:31.350
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
how close you've

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.860
gotten to convincing
the rest of your family

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.416
to live with horses?

00:10:37.416 --> 00:10:40.294
It happens to be a
lifelong dream of my wife,

00:10:40.294 --> 00:10:43.600
and I'm also starting to
understand a little bit.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.610
JENNY LAWSON: Everyone
should own a Pony Danza.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:55.070
So if you haven't read-- so
I have a very severe anxiety

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.357
disorder-- depression,
avoidant personality disorder,

00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:59.482
and a host of other things.

00:10:59.482 --> 00:11:03.830
But anxiety disorder is the
one that really plagues me,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.160
the one that I've had to
take the most medicine,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.570
and therapy, all
that stuff for it.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:15.260
And so I looked into getting
an anxiety service companion,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.540
because I knew when I went on
book tours-- when I'm at home,

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.818
I stay home.

00:11:19.818 --> 00:11:21.090
I'm super hermitty.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.140
I do not leave.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.840
I don't even leave my desk.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.530
Like the mailman comes,
and I put my feet up

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.950
because I'm like, don't look
at me through the window.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.491
I'm not here.

00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:31.582
I don't exist.

00:11:31.582 --> 00:11:34.660
So I was like, I need
to get a service animal.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.850
And I have all my cats,
but one of my cats

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.200
has explosive
traveler's diarrhea.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.850
And I was like, that's
not going to be calming me

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.130
on an airplane.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.532
And so I was like, I'll
call around and find out,

00:11:51.532 --> 00:11:53.740
because I have a dog, Dorothy
Barker, and I was like,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.840
maybe I can teach
Dorothy Barker to be.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.152
And it turns out, by
the way, that my dog has

00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:58.860
anxiety disorder.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:01.790
Jesus.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.440
Like, ugh.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.060
I get it.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.420
Now I get why I was
attracted to this dog.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:13.000
But then I called the
place that certifies,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.880
and I called my shrink, and she
was like, this is who you call.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.650
And they will set you up and see
if this is a good fit for you.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.307
And they have to be
specially trained.

00:12:22.307 --> 00:12:24.390
And when I called there,
they said well, first you

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.960
can't use cats as
service animals,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.710
because they are not
good service animals,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.640
because they're assholes.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.899
And I get it.

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:32.690
It's probably true.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.240
But she was like,
the two animals that

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.510
have been actually approved
as actual service animals

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.440
are dogs and ponies.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.460
And I was like, ponies?

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.020
And she was like,
oh yeah, seriously.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.890
Ponies are very, very smart and
recognize when you are anxious,

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.749
and they respond in the same
way that any trained service

00:12:53.749 --> 00:12:55.050
animal would.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:00.870
And so I said, I think
I need to get a pony

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.630
and take him with me
when I go to work,

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.435
and he'll just
stand in the aisle.

00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:08.235
And I'll braid his mane, and
I'll name him Pony Danza.

00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:11.250
And he'll be my medicinal
pony, and they can not

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.460
throw you off the plane,
because I have a disability.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.040
This is my service horse.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.290
And I was so excited about it.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.255
And so I called, and I
called different places,

00:13:22.255 --> 00:13:24.588
and they were like, oh yeah,
we can set you up with one.

00:13:24.588 --> 00:13:27.234
And I was like, so what do I do?

00:13:27.234 --> 00:13:28.400
Do I put it in the backyard?

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.649
And they were like no, it
lives in the house with you.

00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:32.100
It's already potty trained.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.600
But it's like a large litter
box basically is what you have.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.279
And my husband was like,
OK, no, for several reasons.

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:41.320
First of all, I'm the one
who changes the litter,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.845
and I'm not changing
the litter of a horse.

00:13:44.845 --> 00:13:49.130
And secondly, I know you, and
you cannot stop with just one.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.310
You will become
crazy horse lady,

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.200
and we'll have 18
horses in bed with us

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.741
at night, like we're
all [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.310
So so far he still says no,
but I think it's gonna happen.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.248
I think it's eventually
going to happen,

00:14:06.248 --> 00:14:10.670
just I need to find
the right Pony Danza.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.302
But you don't run into
a lot of stray ponies.

00:14:15.302 --> 00:14:16.760
You find a stray
cat, they're like,

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.420
OK, I guess you can keep it.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.950
So what I need to do is I need
to find a pony and let it go.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.432
And then find it again,
and be like, but Victor,

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:27.390
nobody wants this pony.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.850
Oh my god, we should keep it.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.040
It'll totally work.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.820
Sorry, that was a really
long way to end a story.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.812
The answer is no.

00:14:36.812 --> 00:14:40.440
I don't have a horse.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.826
Next question, if there is one.

00:14:42.826 --> 00:14:45.580
Look, it's just an
empty microphone.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.540
It's the microphone that's
scary, that's what it is.

00:14:53.887 --> 00:14:55.762
AUDIENCE: I asked the
internet for questions,

00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:57.178
because I was too
anxious for one.

00:14:57.178 --> 00:14:59.056
But nobody's asked one yet.

00:14:59.056 --> 00:15:01.008
That's really shitty.

00:15:01.008 --> 00:15:02.716
When you're feeling
really shitty,

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:04.705
and you don't want
to do anything,

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:08.940
how do you stay motivated
to actually blog craziness,

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.826
like get up and do it?

00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:13.760
JENNY LAWSON: That is
a really good question.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.010
Honestly, and I wish I had
a better answer to that,

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.010
is the answer is I don't.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.270
When I'm having--
especially when I'm

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.644
in the middle of a depressive
episode-- and my depression

00:15:27.644 --> 00:15:29.630
comes and goes, it's
strictly chemical.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.600
It's a serotonin thing.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.720
But when it comes to
true depressive episodes,

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.020
I usually have a couple a
year, and when they hit,

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.810
I cannot do anything at all.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.590
My only goal is
just to stay alive,

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.830
and to remind myself
depression lies.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.730
I'm supposed to be here.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.620
Everything my head is
telling me about how

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.170
everybody would be better off
without me, that's not true.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.560
And it's going to be OK.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.560
And just keep breathing.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.472
And every day I wake up
like, is it gone yet?

00:16:02.472 --> 00:16:04.780
No, but maybe tomorrow.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.200
And I've given myself
permission to have

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.410
those weeks of
survival, and instead

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.920
of feeling like
I'm a failure, I'm

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.410
just laying here for two weeks
watching "Dr. Who" on repeat

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.100
instead of being like,
what a loser I am.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.680
Instead I think, I'm surviving.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.760
And there are so many people
who don't survive depression.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.910
It can be fatal in a lot
of cases, and the fact

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.720
that every single day I
wake up and I'm like, well,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.740
I'm still alive.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.827
And I'm still breathing, and I
might even take a shower today.

00:16:41.827 --> 00:16:43.910
And those are the victories
you have to celebrate.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.550
When I was writing
just my blog, I

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.783
was very afraid of
talking about the fact

00:16:55.783 --> 00:16:58.720
that I had depression
and anxiety.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.850
And I definitely think
the stigma's still there.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.380
It's not as bad as it was
seven years ago maybe,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.329
when I came out about it.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.123
And when I wrote
about it, in my family

00:17:12.123 --> 00:17:15.140
there's lots of mental
illness, and in my family

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.660
you do not talk about it.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.186
It's very, this is your
own personal secret,

00:17:20.186 --> 00:17:22.055
and nobody knows.

00:17:22.055 --> 00:17:24.180
And it's not until you grow
up and you're like, oh,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.096
that's the reason why
that person disappeared,

00:17:26.096 --> 00:17:28.580
because they were in
the mental institution!

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.842
I did think it was sort
of strange that they

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:32.550
just disappeared for
awhile and came back

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.880
and kept talking about
electroshock therapy.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.690
Whatever, that's fine.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.340
So I was the first person in
my family to come out about it,

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.940
and they were very supportive.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.510
And they were like, you
do what's right for you.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.171
Don't drag us into this.

00:17:50.171 --> 00:17:52.836
And also just be
careful, because you

00:17:52.836 --> 00:17:56.100
don't know how people are
going to react to this.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.930
But I felt like I did have the
choice because I was writing,

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.390
and I typically write funny,
weird, irreverent stuff.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.612
And during those
periods, when I knew

00:18:08.612 --> 00:18:10.195
that I was going to
have this downtime

00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:12.860
and never be able
to really focus,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.840
I would have this
backlog of drafts.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.830
And I would post those
instead, and say, there you go.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.012
And I would approve
comments, and the comments

00:18:23.012 --> 00:18:24.470
would be like, oh,
you're so funny.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.410
You have such a great life.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.120
And at the same
time, I'm just laying

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.670
there thinking like, I haven't
showered in three days.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.440
I cannot make myself eat
soup, because I feel unworthy

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:35.940
of soup.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.750
And I thought, I'm creating
this false history,

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.330
and so that's when I decided
I would be upfront about it,

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.590
and just say it.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.772
And instead of people
running from me,

00:18:47.772 --> 00:18:53.140
I had thousands of people who
came out and said, me too.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.900
I thought I was the only one.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.441
I thought I was the
only one who felt

00:18:56.441 --> 00:18:59.360
like an impostor or a
fraud, or worthless.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.850
And what's really
amazing about that

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:09.862
is that in the time since I
first came out with that post,

00:19:09.862 --> 00:19:14.510
I had some people who've come
up to me and who have said,

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.260
I was actively in the process
of planning my suicide,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.610
and I decided to
stop and to get help.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.990
Not because of what you
wrote, but because I

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:27.010
saw thousands of people
responding to you,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.830
and saying me too, me too.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.270
I feel the same way.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.336
And I realized if all
these people feel that way,

00:19:34.336 --> 00:19:36.595
then obviously depression
is lying to us,

00:19:36.595 --> 00:19:42.180
and that this is not something
that I am going through myself,

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.640
just completely alone.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.180
And so I decided to get
help, and now here I

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.295
am, and here are my kids,
or here are my parents.

00:19:49.295 --> 00:19:52.780
Here are all these
people who had no clue

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.660
that I was going through this.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.770
And I wish I could go back
and tell all the people who,

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.380
especially anonymously, who
just shouted out into the void

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.152
and said, me too, I
feel the same way.

00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:11.900
But that single act of just
shouting out into the darkness

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.395
may have saved someone's life.

00:20:13.395 --> 00:20:14.853
That may have been
that one comment

00:20:14.853 --> 00:20:18.510
that actually pushed someone
into saying, OK, all right.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.710
I'm going to do that.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.660
I'm going to get help.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.880
So it's amazing the
way that each of us

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.191
touches other people in ways
that we can not possibly

00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:29.690
imagine.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.763
And I think it's just really
good to stop every once

00:20:32.763 --> 00:20:34.650
in a while and just think.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.370
The world would be a
worse place without you.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.240
It would.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.180
You bring so much more
wonderful things into your life,

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.120
than you will ever, ever know.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.268
And you affect the world
in such great ways.

00:20:52.735 --> 00:20:54.110
AUDIENCE: So as
a newer fan-- you

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.690
may actually talk about this
on your blog and in your books,

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.390
but I'm very curious about
humor as a coping mechanism

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.490
for mental illness
and depression.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.010
I ask in particular because
I've noticed a lot of comedians

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.385
for instance--
and I think you're

00:21:06.385 --> 00:21:09.384
by far the funniest-- if you see
interviews with them where they

00:21:09.384 --> 00:21:11.550
talk about their home lives,
or their married lives,

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.110
or their [INAUDIBLE] lives,
or any number of things,

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.318
they're basically some of
the most unhappy people who

00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:18.132
I've ever, ever encountered.

00:21:18.132 --> 00:21:20.090
And I really started
thinking about this again,

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.580
because my best friend growing
up attempted suicide last year.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.335
Thankfully he's gotten
help, but he laughed

00:21:26.335 --> 00:21:27.980
the most, made the most jokes.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.695
We had the most
laughing sort of times.

00:21:30.695 --> 00:21:32.195
And at first I was
really surprised.

00:21:32.195 --> 00:21:33.070
But then I started
trying to think about it,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.240
and I thought, well
maybe that's why.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.430
That's why he was one of
the funnier people I knew,

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.779
is that was just how he was
dealing with a lot of issues.

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:43.070
So I was wondering if you
could talk about that little.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.550
JENNY LAWSON: That's a
really good question.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.830
I don't know who it
was that said it,

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.900
but comedy equals
tragedy plus time,

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.690
and it really is true,
except that for a lot of us,

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.710
we don't have time.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.580
I'd say we're like, just go
straight for the tragedy.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:08.830
I think there is something
so wonderful about taking

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.750
something frightening
and horrifying and awful

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.020
and laughing at it.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.880
It turns it from this enormous,
big monster into something

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.210
smaller, into something
that you can look at,

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:27.230
and suddenly you're not
as intimidated by it.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.450
I think there are lots of
different ways of coping,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:35.650
but for me, humor is absolutely
the way that I do it.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.640
And I actually do it
for-- I do it at funerals.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.860
I do it in completely
inappropriate places,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.170
and I do it anytime I'm
having to deal with something.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.340
I have rheumatoid arthritis,
and I had a miscarriage,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.790
and all sorts of stuff.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.488
And when it comes
right down to it,

00:22:54.488 --> 00:22:56.858
the moments that were
the most human to me

00:22:56.858 --> 00:22:59.702
were the moments when I
could look back and think

00:22:59.702 --> 00:23:02.465
of something funny
that came from that.

00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:08.020
And laugh, because laughter is
such a universally human thing.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.220
I don't know if you
follow me on Twitter.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.295
For the last week,
I wrote this tweet

00:23:15.295 --> 00:23:19.080
just as I was
leaving the airport.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.655
And I was getting on
the plane, and the lady

00:23:21.655 --> 00:23:23.946
handed me my ticket, and she
said, have a great flight.

00:23:23.946 --> 00:23:26.703
And I said, thanks, you too.

00:23:26.703 --> 00:23:29.161
And so I tweeted that, and I
was like I can never come back

00:23:29.161 --> 00:23:31.212
to this airport again.

00:23:31.212 --> 00:23:33.780
And it was just a throwaway
sort of thing, but what happened

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.600
was I landed, and
there were thousands

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.870
of people who were like,
oh, you think that's bad?

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.080
And they started sharing
their terrible things,

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.300
and they were-- I'm not
even kidding with you,

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.720
they were so funny.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.110
I am not a laugh out
loud kind of person.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.466
I was laughing so hard.

00:23:50.466 --> 00:23:53.100
First of all, I had tears
rolling down my face.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.240
Hotel security had to
be called, because they

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.990
thought that something
had happened to me.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.365
And they were like,
are you OK, ma'am?

00:23:58.365 --> 00:23:59.410
Has someone hurt you?

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.080
And I'm like puffy,
swollen-faced tears,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.450
and I'm like, no, this is
how I look when I'm happy.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.590
Are you alone?

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.820
Can you do a welfare check?

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.060
It's just me on in internet.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.420
But what's really
fantastic is, first of all,

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.470
I retweeted so
many of the people.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.220
Like some people had
to put me on mute,

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.885
because their notifications got
blown up and they were like,

00:24:23.885 --> 00:24:26.176
I'm not allowed to get anymore
notifications today now.

00:24:26.176 --> 00:24:27.660
Thanks very much.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:33.050
But so many people followed
it, and got into it,

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.740
and just loved
the universal idea

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.530
that once you laugh at the
most horrifyingly embarrassing,

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.530
terrible thing, that
it becomes something

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.545
that you are a part of
laughing at it instead

00:24:46.545 --> 00:24:49.636
of it possessing you.

00:24:49.636 --> 00:24:53.490
Plus, you would see so many
people responding to that one

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.552
person who would just
shout out and be like,

00:24:56.552 --> 00:25:01.854
one time I thought there
was a bug in my pants.

00:25:01.854 --> 00:25:03.270
And then I started
to shake it out

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.644
and it was
yesterday's underwear.

00:25:04.644 --> 00:25:08.360
And it was in front
of everyone I knew.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.810
And they would write
like, oh god, why?

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.220
Why did this happen?

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.223
And a thousand other people
would write and it'd be,

00:25:15.223 --> 00:25:16.348
oh I had that happen to me.

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:17.972
But I thought I was
the only person who

00:25:17.972 --> 00:25:19.170
would do it-- me too.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.400
And they would get it, and all
these people were saying, OK,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.490
so I just shared the most
mortifying moment of my life,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.380
and it just got
favorited 80,000 times.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:30.880
What?

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.620
That's what I'm going
to be known for?

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.470
I'll take it.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.300
I'll take that.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.410
And I think because there is
such a universal thing, shame,

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.930
and fear, and embarrassment,
and mortification,

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.810
and there's such a
wonderful healing

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.450
process of laughing at that.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.305
And actually, weirdly
enough, the "New York Times"

00:25:51.305 --> 00:25:52.680
picked it up, and
they were like,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.480
oh, let's do a story about this.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.570
And I was like, OK.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.880
And they were like, oh,
we want to talk to you.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.541
And I was like, I don't like
to talk to people on phones,

00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:01.290
because I'm weird.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.670
But you can send me an email.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.210
So I just wrote and was
like, yeah, this happened

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.170
and it was funny.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.350
And they were like, well,
let's bring in a psychiatrist.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:13.730
And so the bottom part
was a psychiatrist saying,

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.120
this is the reason
why this is funny.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.420
I was like, yeah, OK, whatever.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.610
But I thought it
was so great that it

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.510
was a story about tweets,
and they were like,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.850
let's bring in
the professionals,

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.480
because what the fuck
is going on here?

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480
But anyway, yeah.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.480
Sorry.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.200
Yes?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.366
AUDIENCE: So I thought that
it would be a great idea

00:26:36.366 --> 00:26:37.670
to ask you for advice.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.345
And I have impostor
syndrome, and I

00:26:39.345 --> 00:26:41.303
know a lot of other people
in this room do too,

00:26:41.303 --> 00:26:45.030
and so my question is, what
do I do when they find me?

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.237
JENNY LAWSON: Such
a good question.

00:26:50.237 --> 00:26:51.986
So first of all, I'll
answer your question

00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:53.736
and then I'll go back
to talking about it.

00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:56.432
So what do you do
when they find you?

00:26:56.432 --> 00:27:01.020
You say, I'm so glad to
be home, because everyone

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.150
feels like that.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.170
And the people who
are going to find you

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:08.640
are all of us, who are going
to say, oh, I have that too.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.310
I have that constant fear
that at any moment somebody

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:15.312
is going say, oh,
you're not that smart.

00:27:15.312 --> 00:27:16.680
Or you're not that funny.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.282
Or you're not-- you
have just weaseled

00:27:18.282 --> 00:27:22.560
your way into pretending that
you're a human and you are not.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.310
I know you.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:30.324
What I think is so interesting
about impostor syndrome

00:27:30.324 --> 00:27:31.990
is that when I started
writing about it,

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.606
so many people would respond
and say, oh I didn't even

00:27:34.606 --> 00:27:35.814
know there was a word for it.

00:27:35.814 --> 00:27:38.390
But yes, I have the same issue.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:43.198
What is really amazing is
how many people I absolutely

00:27:43.198 --> 00:27:48.208
adore and respect who emailed
me and said, I have this too.

00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:51.672
And I was like, what the fuck?

00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:52.380
How in the world?

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.674
When I did the book trailer
for this book, I was like,

00:27:59.674 --> 00:28:01.090
I don't want to
do a real trailer.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:04.222
Let's just do something
where people hold up signs

00:28:04.222 --> 00:28:05.680
and they say, "I'm
broken because,"

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.680
and the other side says "but
I'm furiously happy because."

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.308
Because you can't stop the
fact that we're all broken,

00:28:12.308 --> 00:28:16.826
but you can look
at the good things

00:28:16.826 --> 00:28:19.425
that can come from the
brokenness, or the things

00:28:19.425 --> 00:28:23.090
that we have inside of us.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.910
So I basically just went
out on Facebook and said,

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.880
do you feel comfortable
sharing this?

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.150
And one of the people who
said, I really want to share,

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.730
was Pat Rothfuss.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.860
And if you don't know him,
he's a fantastic writer,

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.524
and you should read
everything he's ever written.

00:28:37.524 --> 00:28:38.390
He's so, so good.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.840
He's one of my
absolute favorites.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.240
And he struggles with
impostor syndrome,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.640
I think even more than I do.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.379
And his that he held up--
and I think most people just

00:28:47.379 --> 00:28:49.170
looked at him and they
were like, oh, who's

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.050
this bushy-faced stranger,
instead of being like,

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:58.128
oh, this is this super
important, fantastic, science

00:28:58.128 --> 00:29:02.790
fantasy author who
people adore and love.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.860
And he held his up,
and it said, "I'm

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:09.200
broken because I feel
like a failure every day."

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.890
And then when he
turned around it said,

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.200
"But I'm furiously happy because
some days I can string together

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.060
five perfect words."

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.240
And I thought that was such
a wonderful thing, because it

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.760
was all about recognizing
the fact that we are slow,

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:32.120
and we are human, and we all
struggle in different ways,

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.800
and we compare
ourselves to people.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.990
I always compare myself to
Stephen King or Neil Gaiman.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.170
They get on a plane and then the
plane lands, and they're like,

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.170
I wrote a book while
I was on the plane.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:44.670
Here it is.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.170
It's a bestseller.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.140
And I'm like ugh,
how do you do this?

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:54.660
Because it took 14 years
to get my second book out.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.458
And I think really
what I've learned

00:29:56.458 --> 00:30:01.910
is the importance of realizing
we all work at our own speed,

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:06.420
and we all have different
ways of recognizing

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.701
what success looks like.

00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:12.140
And recognizing it.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.940
Actually, one of the things
I had to work with in therapy

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.840
was with my first book,
I was really afraid

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.410
that the book would
be successful.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.135
Because I was like, I don't
know what that would look like,

00:30:23.135 --> 00:30:25.010
and I don't know what
that would mean for me.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.960
And I don't think
I could handle it,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.255
I think I would be very
embarrassed and uncomfortable.

00:30:29.255 --> 00:30:32.156
And even today I have a hard
time when people are like,

00:30:32.156 --> 00:30:32.570
oh my god I love your book.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.694
And I'm like, no you don't.

00:30:33.694 --> 00:30:34.625
You really don't.

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:36.431
You should get out more.

00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:37.960
Or when they're
like, oh my gosh,

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.944
I'm so excited I
get to meet you.

00:30:38.944 --> 00:30:39.935
And I'm like, I'm going
to disappoint you.

00:30:39.935 --> 00:30:41.030
I'm sorry.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.350
I have nothing for you.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.150
And then I have to
just remind myself

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:49.651
that, just like everybody else,
we all feel like failures.

00:30:49.651 --> 00:30:51.192
And if you don't
feel like a failure,

00:30:51.192 --> 00:30:53.442
you're probably a sociopath.

00:30:53.442 --> 00:30:55.722
And not that that's
necessarily a bad thing.

00:30:55.722 --> 00:30:58.430
My husband has some super
sociopathic tendencies.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.312
He's very successful.

00:31:00.312 --> 00:31:04.536
In fact, most really successful
people are kind of sociopaths,

00:31:04.536 --> 00:31:06.410
and that's what makes
them good at their job.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.660
So if you're sitting here and
you're like, what the fuck

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.700
is she talking about? you're
probably really successful,

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.530
and a sociopath.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.880
But that's OK.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.520
You're probably
not a psychopath,

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.580
and those are the
ones that kill people.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.670
Don't do that.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.194
That's my advice.

00:31:20.194 --> 00:31:21.485
This is all really good advice.

00:31:21.485 --> 00:31:22.818
You should be writing that down.

00:31:22.818 --> 00:31:24.110
Don't kill people.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.600
Oh my gosh, it's brilliant.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.925
Sorry.

00:31:27.925 --> 00:31:28.860
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.330
First I wanted to say thank you.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.774
I never heard your name
before this talk was announced

00:31:32.774 --> 00:31:37.240
last week, but when I realized
you were The Bloggess I

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.490
put two and two together.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:43.540
Because between your blog
and Allie Brosh's "Hyperbole

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.090
and a Half," my best
friend back in Canada

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.300
found the courage
to similarly write

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.760
some of her awful experiences
of terrible clinical depression

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.150
and so on, and share that.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.490
And although there's
probably about ten of us

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.470
right now that read her blog
and comment and so on right now,

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:12.970
I wanted to preemptively ask
you that-- the internet comment

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.620
sections tend to be
full of vitriol and vile

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.749
from pseudo-anonymous
people-- and I was wondering

00:32:18.749 --> 00:32:20.040
what your experience was there.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.870
How you deal with that,
and maybe I can help

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.380
prepare Jess for that
first godawful experience.

00:32:29.752 --> 00:32:35.264
JENNY LAWSON: So I do
sometimes get nasty comments.

00:32:35.264 --> 00:32:37.652
I think we tend to
overuse the word "troll,"

00:32:37.652 --> 00:32:39.235
because a lot of
times we'll say troll

00:32:39.235 --> 00:32:40.670
and really it's just a critic.

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.625
And there is a difference.

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:44.000
I'll have people
who will just be

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.227
like, I don't think this is very
funny, or something like that.

00:32:47.227 --> 00:32:49.560
And some people will be like,
oh, what a terrible troll.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.894
And I'm like, not really.

00:32:50.894 --> 00:32:52.722
Like, it's probably my mom.

00:32:52.722 --> 00:32:56.480
Whatever, just giving me
feedback, that's fine.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.882
For me, though, there's a
couple different things.

00:33:00.882 --> 00:33:08.900
First of all, my
Kismet, or something?

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.688
Whatever my blog
software is, it catches

00:33:11.688 --> 00:33:13.438
the first time somebody
leaves a comment--

00:33:13.438 --> 00:33:14.520
it has to be approved.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.860
And then after I've
approved it once,

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.401
then you can leave
a comment forever.

00:33:17.401 --> 00:33:20.060
So if somebody
typically wants to leave

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.270
a really horrid comment,
and I do get them--

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.920
and for me a horrid
comment is, I

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.150
think you should
be raped to death.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:30.540
Which, weirdly, I get
that not uncommonly.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.721
Like, more than once.

00:33:31.721 --> 00:33:33.304
And I'm like, is
this the same person?

00:33:33.304 --> 00:33:34.510
I don't think so.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.447
A little confusing.

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:38.530
But what happens is, it
gets caught in moderation.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:42.160
And those people want to see
you cry, like that's their job.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.120
They really, really want that.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:51.202
And so what I do is I go in
and I approve their comment,

00:33:51.202 --> 00:33:53.535
and I leave their name and
all their information and all

00:33:53.535 --> 00:33:54.240
that stuff.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.640
But I change their
comment from "you whore,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.590
you should be stabbed" to "I
wish I could be just like you.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.556
You're my hero."

00:34:01.556 --> 00:34:03.656
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.030
JENNY LAWSON: And it's lovely,
because they're constantly

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.280
refreshing because they want
to see your response, right?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.719
And then they'll write
again, and they'll be like,

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:10.470
I never said that.

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:11.802
I never said anything like that.

00:34:11.802 --> 00:34:13.449
And I'll change
that comment to "I

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:17.959
wish I could wear your
skin like a jacket."

00:34:17.959 --> 00:34:22.630
I have never had anyone come
back more than three times.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:28.050
And I think it's really, really
wonderful, because your blog is

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.139
your house.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.149
And so I'm usually
entertained by it.

00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:33.081
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.081 --> 00:34:35.080
JENNY LAWSON: My other
one is, and this is one--

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.639
like that one, I have fun with.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:41.699
But this one, is one's a little
petty, but still I do it.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:45.389
Sometimes somebody will leave
a really, really long comment,

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.150
and it's almost
like a dissertation.

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.579
And it will be like, this sucks,
boring, puerile, blah blah

00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:53.370
is the reason of the
civilization crashing.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.599
And it'll be like, really
have to pull out a dictionary.

00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:58.182
I don't even know
some of these words.

00:34:58.182 --> 00:34:58.681
What?

00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:00.557
And you can tell
that what they want

00:35:00.557 --> 00:35:02.640
is they want it to be
approved so they can show it

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.181
to their friends,
and they'd be like,

00:35:04.181 --> 00:35:06.559
yeah that girl that
was on front page

00:35:06.559 --> 00:35:07.850
of [INAUDIBLE] for some reason.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.200
Also, why am I on the
front page of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.408
I love you Drew, stop putting
me on the front page of

00:35:12.408 --> 00:35:13.300
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.074
[INAUDIBLE] I get lots
of great comments too,

00:35:16.074 --> 00:35:18.240
but every time it's on
[INAUDIBLE], I'm always like,

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.190
it's not news.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.077
My blog is not news.

00:35:22.077 --> 00:35:23.660
But it will be this
long dissertation,

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.730
and you know that they
want it to be approved,

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.700
so they can show everybody
else and be like, see,

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.970
I took her down.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.470
And I'll approve
the comment, and it

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.442
will be exactly the right
way-- except I'll go in

00:35:35.442 --> 00:35:37.480
and I will misspell
several of their words.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.899
JENNY LAWSON: Thank you.

00:35:41.899 --> 00:35:43.940
And you know later they're
like, yeah, oh my god.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.536
Oh my god.

00:35:45.536 --> 00:35:47.889
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:49.430
JENNY LAWSON: And
then there's no way

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.750
they're going to be
like, yeah, check out

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.958
what-- they're going to be
like, no, just ignore that

00:35:52.958 --> 00:35:54.141
altogether.

00:35:54.141 --> 00:35:54.640
It's fine.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.973
Let's talk about something else.

00:35:58.886 --> 00:35:59.510
It's wonderful.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.400
When the book came out, because
I have avoidant personality

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.910
disorder-- it's like social
anxiety disorder on speed--

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:13.206
whenever somebody will say
something bad to me on the blog

00:36:13.206 --> 00:36:17.160
or something, usually
anything they've said,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.120
I've already said
about myself way worse.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.885
And so typically I'll
be like, actually

00:36:20.885 --> 00:36:23.343
let me come over here, because
I've already insulted myself

00:36:23.343 --> 00:36:28.960
in a much, much better way than
you did, and so let's do that.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.110
But when the book came
out, it was the first time

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:36.300
that I didn't have control over
what happens with the reviews

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.570
and stuff like that.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.200
And when the first book
out, before it actually

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:46.022
hit the stands, it got
reviewed from a trade review--

00:36:46.022 --> 00:36:47.980
which I didn't even know
that that was a thing.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.460
There's four houses that you
want to review your stuff,

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.030
and it's important or whatever.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.780
And I had no idea.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.480
I had no idea what anything was.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.370
But I got this review, and
it was a really bad review.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:03.725
Like so bad that I kind of
looked at it and was like,

00:37:03.725 --> 00:37:05.710
was this even the right book?

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:09.100
Like oh god, oh my
god, it was so, so bad.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.310
And I couldn't write for
about two weeks after that.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:14.840
I couldn't write anything,
because all I could think of

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.690
was that review.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.450
Even though my editor and
agent and everybody were like,

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:20.500
that's just one person.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.780
That's not the whole house.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.404
Just one person was
assigned that book.

00:37:23.404 --> 00:37:24.370
They don't know you.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:25.744
They may have just
glanced at it.

00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:27.500
They got paid $20 for it.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.510
It's OK.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:31.400
But it really affected me.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.258
And so I ended up getting other
people to read the reviews,

00:37:36.258 --> 00:37:37.882
and tell me, here is
something that you

00:37:37.882 --> 00:37:40.921
do need to be concerned
about for your next book.

00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:43.170
And there's some other stuff
that you can just ignore,

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.900
which is really helpful.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.335
What was also really helpful
is a couple months later,

00:37:47.335 --> 00:37:50.710
the exact same trade
publication reviewed

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:53.960
the audiobook of the same
book, of "Let's Pretend This

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.890
Never Happened," and they
were like, a tour de force!

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.563
And I was like, it's
the same fucking book.

00:38:00.563 --> 00:38:03.449
It is the same book, except
I read it out loud to you.

00:38:03.449 --> 00:38:07.297
That's the only difference.

00:38:07.297 --> 00:38:10.671
And that's when I realized
that it really does come down

00:38:10.671 --> 00:38:14.495
to each individual person.

00:38:14.495 --> 00:38:16.395
And some people will
come up and be like,

00:38:16.395 --> 00:38:18.986
oh, I really don't
like your work.

00:38:18.986 --> 00:38:19.704
First of all, that's weird,
because you don't have

00:38:19.704 --> 00:38:20.995
to tell me-- like, that's fine.

00:38:20.995 --> 00:38:25.480
But what I always
say is, it's OK.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.806
It's not for everyone,
because it's not.

00:38:29.806 --> 00:38:33.124
Because if you make
something that no one hates,

00:38:33.124 --> 00:38:34.546
how boring would that be?

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:38.016
It would be toothless and awful,
and you would just be like,

00:38:38.016 --> 00:38:40.000
oh yeah, I guess, whatever.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:47.060
You almost want at least a
couple people to say, mm.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:47.910
Mm.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.564
I cannot believe that you just
said that you think that Jesus

00:38:50.564 --> 00:38:52.980
should be classified as a
zombie because he came back from

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.700
the dead.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.360
You want a couple
people to say, no,

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.112
that's not OK-- so that
everyone else who comes in says,

00:38:59.112 --> 00:39:00.556
oh my god, I thought that too.

00:39:00.556 --> 00:39:01.056
Why is that?

00:39:01.056 --> 00:39:02.764
Why are we drinking
the blood of the god?

00:39:02.764 --> 00:39:03.520
Are we vampires?

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.520
What's happening?

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.000
And then suddenly you're
like, oh, I'm with my people.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.470
And you realize that maybe
those people, maybe it's

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.576
just like 0.01% of
the population who

00:39:13.576 --> 00:39:16.565
thinks the same weird
stuff that you do,

00:39:16.565 --> 00:39:19.800
but the wonder of the
internet is that-- instead

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.060
of when I grew up and I was
in this tiny little town

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.000
surrounded by tractors, and
I was like the one goth kid

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.480
in the middle of a cornfield.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.310
And now I go out and I'm
like, oh, I found my people.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:35.550
I'm not alone.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.360
I'm completely not alone.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.980
Even though it's
just that 0.01%,

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.206
we make such a difference.

00:39:43.206 --> 00:39:46.247
That 0.01% is loud when
you get us all together.

00:39:46.247 --> 00:39:48.580
Well not really loud, because
we're all kind of hermitty

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.700
and we're hiding
under our chairs.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.840
But we take up a lot of
chairs, and we will make

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.370
you feel very uncomfortable.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.170
And I think that is
extremely [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:01.158 --> 00:40:03.630
Yes?

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:08.530
AUDIENCE: So I was
trying to figure out

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.150
what to do about that.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:14.299
So I've been reading
the reblogs that you've

00:40:14.299 --> 00:40:16.382
done of the Twitters
comments you've been getting.

00:40:16.382 --> 00:40:18.990
It's like a perfect
minefield of amusement.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.630
So it's like, I'll read 10
of them, and I'm like, OK.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.131
They're OK.

00:40:23.131 --> 00:40:25.755
And then I'll get the one-- and
it's just like all of a sudden.

00:40:25.755 --> 00:40:27.746
I'm like, it's OK to
read this in public.

00:40:27.746 --> 00:40:29.000
And then I start laughing
really, really hard,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.430
and it's really embarrassing.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.410
So I wanted to know
if you had any--

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:41.881
what do you do when you hit
a dry spell, from a writing

00:40:41.881 --> 00:40:42.380
perspective?

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.772
Particularly when it's based
on that feeling of not being

00:40:46.772 --> 00:40:50.250
good enough, or not
being able to accomplish

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.238
what you want to do, like
how do you handle that?

00:40:53.238 --> 00:40:55.590
JENNY LAWSON: That actually
happens to me quite a lot.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:41:02.100
And whenever I have a dry
spell or writer's block,

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.974
if it happens for a day or
two, I'm like, oh, that's OK.

00:41:04.974 --> 00:41:06.490
It's gonna work.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:11.530
It's not uncommon for me to
have a week where I cannot write

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.030
anything.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.300
Nothing is funny.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.130
Nothing is interesting, and
at a certain point I think,

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.350
I will never write again.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:22.156
And I did that
before my first book,

00:41:22.156 --> 00:41:25.740
all through my first book,
through my second book.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:31.750
And you get to this point where
you start to realize, well,

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.270
it's always worked out before.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:37.598
Eventually I'll have
something to say again.

00:41:37.598 --> 00:41:39.406
One of the things
that I can say is

00:41:39.406 --> 00:41:41.405
I think so often we think
that that there needs

00:41:41.405 --> 00:41:43.998
to be a lot of material,
and if you're not constantly

00:41:43.998 --> 00:41:46.730
entertaining people, that
they're going to go away.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.980
And I don't think that
that's necessarily true.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.920
I think, in a lot of
cases-- like Allie Brosh

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.845
is the perfect example.

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:57.220
She'll go a year
without writing.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.159
And she's just like,
nope, I'm going in hiding.

00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:03.700
And then she'll write something,
and everyone on the internet

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.724
is like, ah!

00:42:04.724 --> 00:42:05.581
It's Allie!

00:42:05.581 --> 00:42:06.080
She's back!

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.579
She's back!

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:07.888
It's OK!

00:42:07.888 --> 00:42:10.310
And I think that
people understand that.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:14.680
They understand that you're
going to have those dry spells,

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.719
that everyone does.

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:17.510
And it's not just when
it comes to writing.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.942
It's when it comes
to creativity,

00:42:18.942 --> 00:42:21.150
or maybe it's about a project
that you're working on,

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:23.233
or maybe it's a painting,
or maybe it's everything

00:42:23.233 --> 00:42:26.449
that you do-- especially if
you do it and you're like,

00:42:26.449 --> 00:42:27.115
oh, I've got it.

00:42:27.115 --> 00:42:27.640
I nailed it.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.890
Oh, it's perfect.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.660
And then you'll have that
week where nothing works

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.670
and you just think,
well, I guess that was

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.166
as good as it ever gets.

00:42:37.166 --> 00:42:38.290
And then something happens.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:41.150
And for me, it will
be like a single word,

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.730
or it will be a
conversation that I'm

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.613
having, and I will
just be like, shut up!

00:42:44.613 --> 00:42:45.540
No one talk.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.270
And I'll run to my computer.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:52.150
And it really feels
like head constipation.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.790
And suddenly you're
like, oh my god, finally.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.530
I have not shit in weeks.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:00.850
But that's what it feels like.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.940
It's like oh my
god, I can do this.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.190
I can totally do this.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:08.390
And it's such a great thing.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.150
And I think giving
yourself permission

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:14.490
to-- I always call it
refill your creative cup,

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.700
and that looks like different
things for different people.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.680
And so, for me,
sometimes it means

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.700
I have to read all sorts of
funny blogs, and funny books.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.920
Sometimes I just have
to watch TV for a week.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.420
Sometimes I have to force
myself to get out of the house,

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.070
to do something.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:34.417
But I just have to know
that, eventually, something's

00:43:34.417 --> 00:43:36.000
going to happen, and
it's gonna click.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.390
And I'm gonna be
like, oh I got it.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:39.242
Oh, OK.

00:43:39.242 --> 00:43:39.950
It's still there.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:40.850
It's still there.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.230
But just reminding
yourself that that is still

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:50.250
there is a good
thing, because it is.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.750
MALE SPEAKER: I
just wanted to thank

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:53.208

joining us today,

00:43:53.208 --> 00:43:54.980
and we'll have signing
right over here.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.330
[APPLAUSE]
