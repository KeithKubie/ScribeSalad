00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.310
We now know how to find the
area of an equilateral triangle.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.726
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:04.726 --> 00:00:06.950
attempt to find the
area of a-- and I

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.460
know I'm mispronouncing it-- a
"kawch," or "coach" snowflake.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.960
And the way you
construct one is you

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.857
start with an
equilateral triangle.

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:16.190
And then on each of the sides
you split them into thirds

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.690
and in the middle third you
put another smaller equilateral

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.827
triangle.

00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:20.910
And that's after one pass.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.409
And on the next pass, you do
that for all of the sides here.

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.480
So a little one here, here,
here, here, here, here, here,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.505
here, here.

00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:28.880
I think you get
the general idea.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.790
That's the next pass.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.090
And on the next pass you do
it for all of these sides.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.230
And what's really
neat about this--

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.840
and we showed this
in a previous video--

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.330
is that you have a figure here
that has an infinite perimeter.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.329
But we're about to see
in this video it actually

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.080
has a finite area, which is kind
of interesting to think about.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.680
So let's start with a
clean equilateral triangle

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.510
right over here.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.140
We're going to assume that each
of the sides have length s.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.590
So it's going to be a
clean equilateral triangle.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.380
Each of the sides-- let me
draw that a little bit neater.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.154
Each of the sides have length s.

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:01.570
And so what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.986
going to keep track
of two things.

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:07.120
I'm going to keep track of the
sides on this triangle as it

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.152
turns into a snowflake .

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:10.110
I'm going to keep track
of the number of sides,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.734
and I'm going to keep
track of the area

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:15.410
after each pass of adding
more smaller triangles.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.572
So this is going to be
our count of the area.

00:01:18.572 --> 00:01:21.030
Actually, let me give myself
a little bit more real estate,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.238
just because I have a feeling
I might need to use it.

00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:24.846
So this is the sides.

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:25.970
I'm going to write up here.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.530
And then this is our running
count of the area down here.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.425
So right when we
start, we have 3 sides.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.622
And our area, we already
figured out in a previous video,

00:01:38.622 --> 00:01:40.580
is going to be-- if we
assume each of the sides

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.970
are length s-- is going to
be square root of 3s squared

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.970
over 4.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.670
Fair enough.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.140
That was just a simple
equilateral triangle.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.430
Now we're going to take
each of these sides,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.920
divide them into thirds, and
then in that middle third,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.285
we're going to add another
smaller equilateral triangle.

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:06.199
So it'll look like that on
that side right over there.

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:08.740
I want you to think about what
we're doing to each side right

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.239
here.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.584
So before I did this,
this was just one side.

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:12.750
Then I split it into thirds.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.320
And that middle
third, I essentially

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.660
put two sides in there.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.290
I put an equilateral triangle.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.210
So one side is now turned into
one, two, three, four sides.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.400
So every time we do a pass
of making the snowflake more

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.260
intricate, each side will
turn into four sides.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.670
So you could imagine if we
do this on all three sides,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.560
we have 4 times 3, which
is now twelve sides.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.100
So if you multiply
this times 4, this

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.706
gets us to twelve sides now.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.330
We can count them
out just to make sure

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.820
where our logic is correct.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.870
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12 sides.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.740
And now what is the area, now?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.430
Well it's going to be the
area of our original yellow

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.030
equilateral triangle, plus the
area of each of these smaller

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.530
ones.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.720
And what's the area of
each of these smaller ones?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.670
Well first of all, we
have three of them.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.830
There are three of each
of these smaller ones

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.750
and then we use the
formula for the area

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.660
of an equilateral
triangle again.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.950
So it's going to be square
root of 3 times s squared.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.380
But now the length of
each of the sides of each

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.450
of these smaller
equilateral triangles--

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.620
they aren't s anymore,
they are s over 3.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.380
Remember, this length right
over here is s over 3.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.840
So this is going to
be s over 3, as well.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.420
Every pass, the sides of
the equilateral triangle

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.060
become 1/3 of the previous pass.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.970
So it's not going to
be s squared anymore.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.420
It's going to be
s over 3 squared.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.570
And then all of that over 4.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.330
And then let's do another pass.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.620
So we're going to add these
triangles right over here.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.946
Going to add these
right over there.

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:58.820
And this is the last
pass where I'll actually

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.980
attempt to draw all of
the triangles over there.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.460
So how many sides
am I going to have,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.570
first of all, after
I do another pass?

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.690
Well, the previous
pass, I had 12 sides.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.560
Each of those 12 sides are now
going to turn to 4 new sides

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.640
when I add these little
orange bumps there.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.925
So I'm going to multiply
it times 4 again.

00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:17.300
I'm going to
multiply it times 4.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.170
So now I'm going
to have 48 sides.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.380
And how many new triangles?

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.980
So what's the area?

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.570
Well it's going to
be the yellow area

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.230
plus the blue area
plus the orange area.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.820
So how many new orange
triangles do I have.?

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.500
Well I'm adding a
new orange triangle

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.910
to each of the sides
for the previous pass.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.260
In the previous
pass I had 12 sides.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.075
So now I'm going to add
12 orange triangles.

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:44.160
And actually let me write that.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.420
I'll just write 12
orange triangles.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.420
But it's really I just
multiplied it times 4.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.980
And then I'm going to have
times the square root of 3.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.020
And now this isn't going
to be s over 3 any more.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.485
These are now going
to be s over 9.

00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:01.120
These have 1/3 of the dimensions
of these blue triangle.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.130
So this is going to be s over 9.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.979
s over 9 squared over 4.

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.020
And so I think you might
start to see the pattern

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.535
building if we do another
pass after this one.

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:15.100
Move to the right a little bit.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.450
What will that look like?

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.355
Let me do this in a different
color that I haven't used yet.

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.540
Let me see I haven't
used this pink, yet.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.270
So now I'm going to have the
previous number of sides,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.000
that's my number of
new triangles, 48

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.650
times the square root
of 3 times s over-- now

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.640
these are going to be even
1/3 of this-- s over 27

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.970
to the second power.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.720
All of that over 4.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.170
And I'm going to keep adding
an infinite number of terms

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.400
of this to get the area
of a true koch snowflake.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.510
So I'm just going to keep doing
this over, and over again.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.180
So the trick really is
finding this infinite sum

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.920
and seeing if we get a
finite number over here.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.460
So the first thing I want to
do, just to simplify, well,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.960
let me just rewrite it a little
bit differently over here.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.686
So the first thing
that might be obvious

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:09.310
is that we can factor
out a square root

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.310
of 3s squared over 4.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.400
So let me factor that out.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.750
So if we factor out
a square root of 3s

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.680
squared over 4 from
all of the terms.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.120
Then this term right over
here will become a 1.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.324
This term right over here
is going to become a 3.

00:06:26.324 --> 00:06:28.240
Let's see, we factored
out a square root of 3.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.790
We factor out a four.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.050
And we factored
out the s squared.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.150
We factor out only
the s squared.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:42.102
So now it's going to have
plus 3 times 1/3 squared.

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:43.310
That's all we have left here.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.280
We have the 1/3 squared.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.279
And then we have this 3.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.150
And I'm not simplifying
this on purpose,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.110
so that we see a pattern emerge.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.490
And then this next term, right
over here, plus-- so this 12

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.000
is still going to be there.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.970
But I'm going to write
that as 3 times 4.

00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:02.290
Let's see, we're factoring
out the square root of 3,

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.100
we're factoring out the 4, we're
factoring out the s squared.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.290
And so we're going to
be left with 3 squared.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.840
That's what this is
down here, squared.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.230
So this is 1/3 squared.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.360
And then that, squared.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.870
So that's what we're left
with, with that orange term.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.570
And then we go to the pink term.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.250
This pink term.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.620
48 is just 3 times 4 times 4.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.540
Three times 4.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.952
I'll write 4 squared here,
because each time we're

00:07:30.952 --> 00:07:32.410
going to multiply
it times 4 again.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.285
So the next one's going
to be 4 to the third,

00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:37.870
because we're really-- each
side turns into four sides.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.460
That's where that came from.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.120
4 squared, we're factoring
out the square root of 3,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.130
we're factoring
out the four, we're

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.750
factoring out the s squared.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.380
And all we're left is 1 over
3 to the third power, squared.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.200
So times 1 over 3 to the
third power, squared.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.560
And we're just going to keep
going like that forever.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.820
So on each step, we're
multiplying by 4,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.620
and we're also multiplying--
I guess we say,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.420
the power of this
4 is incrementing.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.310
So there's really 4 to
the 0-th power here.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.510
We have a 1 here you
can imagine, implicitly.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.600
The 4 to the first
power, 4 squared,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.770
then it'll go 4 to the third.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.240
This power is also
incrementing-- 3

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.220
to the first, 3 to the
second, 3 to the third.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.900
But we see that this power
is always one more than that.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.270
And it'll be much easier to
calculate this infinite--

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.840
what's going to turn into an
infinite-- geometric series,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.200
if those are actually
the same power.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.575
So what I want to do is I want
to increase the power of 4

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:36.490
in all of those.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.230
But I can't just willy-nilly
multiply everything by 4.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.270
If I'm going to multiply
everything by 4,

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.864
I also need to divide
everything by 4.

00:08:43.864 --> 00:08:46.030
So what I'm going to do in
this step right over here

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.300
is I'm going to multiply
and divide everything by 4.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.980
So if we divide by 4, I
can do that on the outside.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.290
So let me multiply 1/4
times this right over here.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.882
And so I'm dividing
by 4 out here.

00:08:57.882 --> 00:08:59.590
And then I'm going to
multiply this by 4.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.048
And so I'm not
going to be changing

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:04.490
the value of the actual thing.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:14.620
This is going to be 4 plus
3 times 4 plus 3 times 4

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.520
to the third.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.830
And so what was cool about
this is now that the power of 4

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.265
and the power of
this 3 down here

00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:21.635
are going to be the same power.

00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:23.010
But it still seems
a little weird

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.670
because we're taking
this 1 over 3 squared

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.795
and then we're squaring it.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.917
And here we just
have to realize--

00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:31.500
so this is always
going to be squared.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.350
And this is the thing
that's incrementing.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:38.760
But in general, if I
have 1 over 3 to the n,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.400
and I'm squaring it,
this is equal to 1 over 3

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.340
to the 2n power.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.192
So I'm just multiplying it by 2.

00:09:47.192 --> 00:09:48.900
If I'm raising something
to the exponent,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.300
then raising that
to an exponent,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.400
that's just raising it to
the n times 2 exponent.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.830
And this is the exact same thing
as 1 over 3 squared, raised

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.390
to the nth power.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.550
So we can actually switch
these two exponents

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.172
in a very legitimate way.

00:10:04.172 --> 00:10:05.630
And then let me
rewrite everything.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.130
Because I don't want to
do too much on this one

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.100
step right over here.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.010
So this part right
over here gives us

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:14.260
square root of 3s
squared over 16.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.940
And then that's
going to be times--

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.000
I'll open and close
the parentheses.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.070
So then we have 4 plus.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.890
Then in blue, I'll write 3
times 4 to the first power.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.720
And then I can rewrite
this as times 1/3.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.470
We could view this
is 1/3 squared.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.660
We could view this as 1 over
3 to the first power, squared,

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.300
or we could view this as 1 over
3 squared to the first power.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.758
And I'm going to
write it that way.

00:10:41.758 --> 00:10:45.550
So times 1/9 to the first power.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:50.550
And then plus 3 times 4 squared.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:56.850
And then this we can write as,
times 1/9 to the second power.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.620
And then this one
we could write,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:05.380
plus 3 times 4 to
the third times--

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.920
we could write this is 1
over 27 to the second power.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.780
But we could also write this
based on what we saw over here.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.330
We could write this as 1 over
3 squared to the third power,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.579
based on this right over here.

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:15.630
Let me make this clear.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.640
1 over 3 to the third,
to the second power.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.180
This is the same thing as 1 over
3 squared to the third power.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.050
That's what we showed
right over here.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:30.630
So this is the equivalent
to 1/9 to the third power.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.500
And now we start to
see the pattern is

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.090
starting to clean
up a little bit.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.550
And let me just
do one more step.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.250
And then we'll finish
this in the next video.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.610
So this is equal to square root
of 3s squared over 16 times

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:53.910
4 plus 3 times, this is
4/9, plus the next term is

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:59.010
three times 4/9 squared.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:06.759
And then we have plus 3 times
4 over 9 to the third power.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.550
And then we're just
going to keep going on,

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.460
and on, and on, and
on taking the 3 times

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.080
4/9 to the successively
larger, and larger powers.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.255
So this is what we have to find
the sum of to find our area.

00:12:17.255 --> 00:12:19.130
And we're going to do
that in the next video.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.046
And we're going to use
some of the tools we've

00:12:21.046 --> 00:12:23.180
used to find the sums of
infinite geometric series.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.236
But we're going to
re-do it in this video

00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:26.860
just so that you
don't have to remember

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.990
that formula or that proof.
