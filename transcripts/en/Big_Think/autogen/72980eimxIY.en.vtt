know how the 21st century is going to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
know how the 21st century is going to
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790
know how the 21st century is going to
shape up you know the 20th century was

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
shape up you know the 20th century was
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830
shape up you know the 20th century was
sort of a great and a terrible century

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
sort of a great and a terrible century
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810
sort of a great and a terrible century
at the same time and I think the 21st

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
at the same time and I think the 21st
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.319
at the same time and I think the 21st
has has every indication of being far

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
has has every indication of being far
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.890
has has every indication of being far
greater and far more terrible

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900
 
 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.910
 
well I think the alternative is just

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920
well I think the alternative is just
 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.880
well I think the alternative is just
very ugly and I think the alternative to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890
very ugly and I think the alternative to
 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.900
very ugly and I think the alternative to
it is is something where you know

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910
it is is something where you know
 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.810
it is is something where you know
people's you know in a in a lot of

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820
people's you know in a in a lot of
 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.020
people's you know in a in a lot of
context people's people's personalities

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030
context people's people's personalities
 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.750
context people's people's personalities
get distorted their views get stifled in

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760
get distorted their views get stifled in
 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.900
get distorted their views get stifled in
an economic context prosperity gets

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910
an economic context prosperity gets
 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.850
an economic context prosperity gets
destroyed which you know may not always

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860
destroyed which you know may not always
 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.530
destroyed which you know may not always
seem to be that important to people but

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540
seem to be that important to people but
 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.530
seem to be that important to people but
I think in the long run does matter a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540
I think in the long run does matter a
 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.740
I think in the long run does matter a
tremendous amount and and then I do

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750
tremendous amount and and then I do
 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.469
tremendous amount and and then I do
think that that you know it you sort of

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479
think that that you know it you sort of
 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.480
think that that you know it you sort of
you know these are the extreme opposite

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490
you know these are the extreme opposite
 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.719
you know these are the extreme opposite
to it is uh is just sort of this sort of

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729
to it is uh is just sort of this sort of
 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.620
to it is uh is just sort of this sort of
incredibly violent sort of

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630
incredibly violent sort of
 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.020
incredibly violent sort of
totalitarianism that we've seen you know

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030
totalitarianism that we've seen you know
 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.660
totalitarianism that we've seen you know
the 20th century both in sort of a in

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
the 20th century both in sort of a in
 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.190
the 20th century both in sort of a in
all sorts of different forms that it's

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200
all sorts of different forms that it's
 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.040
all sorts of different forms that it's
taken and that that seems to me is uh

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050
taken and that that seems to me is uh
 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.050
taken and that that seems to me is uh
it's just uh it's just very very

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060
it's just uh it's just very very
 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.870
it's just uh it's just very very
undesirable and I I you know it's and I

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880
undesirable and I I you know it's and I
 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.810
undesirable and I I you know it's and I
do see them as being um sort of

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820
do see them as being um sort of
 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.389
do see them as being um sort of
different ends of the spectrum on and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399
different ends of the spectrum on and
 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.820
different ends of the spectrum on and
that to some extent we always we always

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
that to some extent we always we always
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.310
that to some extent we always we always
need to preserve a fight for individual

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320
need to preserve a fight for individual
 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.070
need to preserve a fight for individual
freedom I think that there obviously the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080
freedom I think that there obviously the
 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.990
freedom I think that there obviously the
u.s. there's a lot of people have a lot

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
u.s. there's a lot of people have a lot
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.699
u.s. there's a lot of people have a lot
of freedom and at the same time there

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709
of freedom and at the same time there
 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.110
of freedom and at the same time there
are a lot of ways in which it's not

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120
are a lot of ways in which it's not
 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.229
are a lot of ways in which it's not
entirely free country and and people

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239
entirely free country and and people
 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.960
entirely free country and and people
tend not to be fully aware of the ways

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970
tend not to be fully aware of the ways
 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.570
tend not to be fully aware of the ways
in which it is both very special and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580
in which it is both very special and
 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.060
in which it is both very special and
very free as well as the ways in which

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
very free as well as the ways in which
 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.449
very free as well as the ways in which
it is not people tend to just be very

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459
it is not people tend to just be very
 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.000
it is not people tend to just be very
complacent and accept whatever the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010
complacent and accept whatever the
 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.090
complacent and accept whatever the
status quo is as more or less of what

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100
status quo is as more or less of what
 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.920
status quo is as more or less of what
the world is going to be like a plus or

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
the world is going to be like a plus or
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.410
the world is going to be like a plus or
minus 2% or whatever and I think that

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420
minus 2% or whatever and I think that
 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.240
minus 2% or whatever and I think that
the range of possibilities is just much

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250
the range of possibilities is just much
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.440
the range of possibilities is just much
greater

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
 
 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.380
 
certainly our many dimensions to it you

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390
certainly our many dimensions to it you
 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.869
certainly our many dimensions to it you
know the university setting is one where

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879
know the university setting is one where
 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.630
know the university setting is one where
I think a lot of important ideas are

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640
I think a lot of important ideas are
 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.000
I think a lot of important ideas are
never even discussed so it's not that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010
never even discussed so it's not that
 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.500
never even discussed so it's not that
you know once you have a discussion you

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510
you know once you have a discussion you
 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.660
you know once you have a discussion you
hear both sides is that you do not even

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670
hear both sides is that you do not even
 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.170
hear both sides is that you do not even
have a discussion so there are there are

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180
have a discussion so there are there are
 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.870
have a discussion so there are there are
topics questions debates that are that

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880
topics questions debates that are that
 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.940
topics questions debates that are that
are not being not being had you can

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950
are not being not being had you can
 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.440
are not being not being had you can
probably come up with an enormously long

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450
probably come up with an enormously long
 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.839
probably come up with an enormously long
list of those but but it but it's not

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849
list of those but but it but it's not
 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.610
list of those but but it but it's not
entirely obvious what it is it's not

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620
entirely obvious what it is it's not
 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.860
entirely obvious what it is it's not
being discussed that maybe maybe is very

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
being discussed that maybe maybe is very
 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.500
being discussed that maybe maybe is very
important you know I think certainly uh

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510
important you know I think certainly uh
 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.930
important you know I think certainly uh
in the sort of one of my one of my

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940
in the sort of one of my one of my
 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.390
in the sort of one of my one of my
standard complaints in the in the in the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400
standard complaints in the in the in the
 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.080
standard complaints in the in the in the
public policy sphere is that we you know

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090
public policy sphere is that we you know
 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.880
public policy sphere is that we you know
we have a semi socialist healthcare

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890
we have a semi socialist healthcare
 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.410
we have a semi socialist healthcare
system which i think is extraordinarily

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420
system which i think is extraordinarily
 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.990
system which i think is extraordinarily
broken and people people don't realize

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000
broken and people people don't realize
 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.600
broken and people people don't realize
just how bad it is and how you know

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610
just how bad it is and how you know
 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.559
just how bad it is and how you know
people get these sort of very

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569
people get these sort of very
 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.600
people get these sort of very
perfunctory checkups from doctors we're

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610
perfunctory checkups from doctors we're
 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.390
perfunctory checkups from doctors we're
not really getting paid anymore you know

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400
not really getting paid anymore you know
 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.860
not really getting paid anymore you know
the tort law system is further

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870
the tort law system is further
 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.020
the tort law system is further
constrained freedom up

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030
constrained freedom up
 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.390
constrained freedom up
we can't experiment with new drugs new

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400
we can't experiment with new drugs new
 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.420
we can't experiment with new drugs new
treatments for for for for ill patients

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430
treatments for for for for ill patients
 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.670
treatments for for for for ill patients
so I think the sort of the sort of is a

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680
so I think the sort of the sort of is a
 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.979
so I think the sort of the sort of is a
counterfactual world where things could

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989
counterfactual world where things could
 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.770
counterfactual world where things could
be vastly better and but it requires one
