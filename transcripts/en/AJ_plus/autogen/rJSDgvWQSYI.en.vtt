us feel good these chemicals are called
neurotransmitters and they're basically

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
neurotransmitters and they're basically
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.980

and scientists are still trying to
figure out why for all the research

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
figure out why for all the research
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.569
figure out why for all the research
that's been done much of the brain

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
that's been done much of the brain
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.050
that's been done much of the brain
remains a mystery

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
