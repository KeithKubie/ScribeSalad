00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:18.810
Violet Jessop, “Miss Unsinkable”, enjoyed
incredible “luck” from a 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.810
young age.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.449
Born in 1887 in Argentina to Irish immigrants,
she contracted tuberculosis as a young child

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.420
and was given just a few months to live.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.140
Somehow, she managed to fight the disease
and went on to live a long, healthy life.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.720
When her father passed away, her mother moved
the family to Britain, where she took a job

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.540
as a stewardess on a ship.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.730
While her mother was working, Violet attended
a convent school.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.649
Unfortunately, her mother became ill, and
to provide for her siblings Violet decided

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.530
to follow in her mother’s footsteps and
become a ship stewardess herself.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.880
The first in a long line of struggles for
Violet was finding a ship that would take

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.880
her.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.380
She was just 21 years old at the time and
most women working as stewardesses in the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.649
early 1900s were middle-aged.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.910
Employers believed that her youth and good
looks would be a disadvantage to her, “causing

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880
problems” with the crew and passengers.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.440
(Over the course of her career, she did get
at least three marriage proposals while working

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.180
on various ships, one from an incredibly wealthy
first-class passenger.)

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.910
Eventually, Violet solved the issue by making
herself look frumpy with old clothes and no

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.000
make-up, and experienced more successful interviews
after this.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.670
After a brief stint aboard the Orinoco, a
Royal Mail Line steamer, in 1908, she was

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.870
hired by the White Star Line.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.540
Violet started out on the line’s Magestic,
switching to the Olympic in 1910.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.930
Despite the long hours and minimal pay (£2.10
every month or about £200 today), she enjoyed

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.780
working aboard the massive ship.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.140
She had initially had some concerns about
the rough weather conditions while traveling

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.360
across the Atlantic, but she reportedly liked
that the Americans treated her more like a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.970
person while she served them.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.570
It was just one year later when the trouble
started.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.600
In 1911, the Olympic collided with the HMS
Hawke (a ship designed to sink ships by ramming

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600
them).

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.490
Both ships sustained considerable damage,
including the Olympic having its hull breached

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.980
below the water line, but miraculously didn’t
sink.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.780
They were able to make it back to port, and
Violet disembarked without being harmed.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.100
A couple of years later, the White Star Line
was looking for crew to cater to the VIPs

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.830
aboard the unsinkable ship, the Titanic.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.360
It took a while for her friends and family
to convince her that it would be a wonderful

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.640
experience, but Violet eventually decided
to take a job on board the ship.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.400
As you already know, the Titanic struck an
iceberg and sunk, killing more than 1500 people.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.750
Violet was able to escape the disaster on
lifeboat 16.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.170
In her memoir, she recalls,
“I was ordered up on deck.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.640
Calmly, passengers strolled about.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.820
I stood at the bulkhead with the other stewardesses,
watching the women cling to their husbands

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.930
before being put into the boats with their
children.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.250
Sometime after, a ship’s officer ordered
us into the boat first to show some women

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.500
it was safe.”

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.760
As she was jumping into the lifeboat, she
was handed a baby to care for.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.470
When they were rescued by the Carpathia, the
baby’s mother (or at least Jessop thought

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.380
it must be) found her and whisked the baby
away (literally grabbing the baby out of Jessop’s

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.050
arms and running off).

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.750
Once again, Violet lived to sail another day.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.120
Although, she did later state the first thing
she missed after the Titanic sank was her

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.930
toothbrush that she’d left on board.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.730
You’d think she’d stop getting on ships
at this point, or at least ships of the Olympic

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.260
class, but not Violet.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.920
In the lead-up to World War I, she decided
to serve as a nurse on board the Titanic’s

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.110
other sister ship, Britannic, which was operating
in the Aegean Sea.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.490
Given her track record, you can probably guess
what happened next.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.630
The Britannic ran into a mine that had been
planted by a German U-boat.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.980
The ship sustained substantial damage and
quickly started sinking.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.870
This time, Violet wasn’t lucky enough to
jump into a lifeboat as the ship was sinking

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.910
too fast.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.780
Instead, she jumped overboard.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.840
In her own words,
“I leapt into the water but was sucked under

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.760
the ship’s keel which struck my head.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.840
I escaped, but years later when I went to
my doctor because of a lot of headaches, he

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.690
discovered I had once sustained a fracture
of the skull!”

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.640
She joked that she only survived because of
her thick hair, which cushioned the blow.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.410
She also stated this time she remembered to
grab her toothbrush before evacuating, unlike

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.760
with the Titanic.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.500
Even this latest disaster was not enough to
deter Violet.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.670
After the war, ships were becoming a more
and more popular form of transport.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.030
Even cruise ships were starting to emerge.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.880
Violet left the White Star Line for the Red
Star Line and worked on a ship doing world

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.870
cruises for several years.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.860
Luckily for Violet and everyone traveling
on the ships she was aboard later, no such

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.550
vessel she worked on ever sustained significant
damage again.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.720
She did take a clerical job for a while after
World War II, but went back to working on

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.139
Royal Mail ships for a few years before she
retired at the age of 61.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.510
So after surviving the sinking of the sister
ships the Titanic and the Britannic, as well

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.680
as being aboard the third of the trio of Olympic
class vessels, the Olympic, when it had a

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.300
major accident, she ultimately died in 1971
of congestive heart failure at the ripe old

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:08.289
age 
of 84.

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.289
