00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Today, we're taking a look at
the difference between helium,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.400
regular air, and sulfur
hexafluoride in balloons.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.020
[Music]

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.000
On Twitter, user
Monkey Humor said,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.997
"Hey @theKingofRandom,
can you inhale helium

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.560
then blow up a balloon?"

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.000
As I interpret that question,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.300
the goal is to see
if we can inhale helium,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.200
sort of straight from the tank,
then blow it into a balloon,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
and still get
a balloon that floats,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.000
and I'm particularly
intrigued by this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.292
because I think I've seen this

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:32.800
in cartoons growing
up all the time.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.380
People would just
blow up a balloon,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.550
and then it would float away,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.700
and once I understood
anything about science

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.000
and buoyancy, I thought,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.100
"Hey, why is that happening?"

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.000
"What is in their lungs
that they can blow up a balloon

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.580
that floats away?"

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.500
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.400
We're going to try
breathing in helium,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.411
then breathing it
into a balloon to see

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:52.589
if we can blow up a balloon
with our breathe

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:53.900
that will float.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.390
Not only are we going
to try this with helium,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.703
but we're actually going to try
sort of the opposite as well.

00:00:57.703 --> 00:00:59.400
We're going to take
some sulfur hexafluoride,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.500
which you might remember
is the deep voice gas,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.800
and breathe it in,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.140
and our voice comes
out sounding like this.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.100
So we want to try
the same idea with that,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.650
breathe sulfur hexafluoride in,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.200
breathe that out
into a balloon.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
See what happens.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.945
We also might see what happens
if we mix the two.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:16.482
I feel like this is a race.

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:18.600
So you're saying we
each take a tank.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.048
We each take a balloon.

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:20.300
Yes.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.800
And we see who can breathe
into a balloon,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.500
&gt;&gt; and get it to float fastest.
&gt;&gt; Fastest.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.100
It's not incredibly safe
to breathe directly

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.500
from the tank into your lungs
and into a balloon.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.560
So I think that we need
to fill up a balloon,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.000
breathe from that balloon,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500
and then into
a second balloon.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.600
If we start
to feel light-headed,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.651
we have to tap out.

00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:39.350
No passing out in this contest.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.637
Guys, helium displaces
the air in your lungs.

00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:43.300
If you breathe
in too much of it,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.400
you will get lightheaded

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.400
because you are
technically asphyxiating.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.200
You do want to stop
if you get lightheaded.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.208
That's not good.

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:52.100
Fortunately, helium does rise,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.500
and so it does kind of try
and escape your lungs,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
and regular air tries
to fill it back in.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.824
But if you're just breathing
helium in over and over,

00:01:58.824 --> 00:01:59.785
there's a good chance

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.387
that the regular air won't have
enough time to get in there.

00:02:02.387 --> 00:02:04.424
So we'll definitely want
to take some breaths

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.600
in between moving
from one balloon to the other.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.300
Go.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:24.960
[Music]

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.500
Oh, there's light headedness.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.400
I feel it.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.620
&gt;&gt; Ha ha.
&gt;&gt; No!

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.840
It's floating.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.050
It's floating.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.800
Oh boy.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800
I'm not floating.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.599
Going down.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.400
Going down.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.800
See how I stopped
and took a breath.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.900
I'm fine.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.800
We breathe a balloon
that floats into the air,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.260
like something straight
out of a cartoon.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.840
So this is not 100% helium
that we've got in these,

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:50.013
because our tanks
don't have 100% helium.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.480
These are 80%,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.072
plus the fact that we
still had some oxygen,

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.472
carbon dioxide in our lungs.

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:55.156
And nitrogen.

00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:57.565
The tanks and our lungs
also had nitrogen.

00:02:57.565 --> 00:02:58.605
So helium, nitrogen,

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:01.100
oxygen, carbon, dioxide
and trace other elements.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.330
I'm going to blow up
another balloon with helium,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.180
and I'm going to try and match
it to the size of this one.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.860
3, 2, 1.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.540
Okay.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.200
Smoked it.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200
There's our difference
right there.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.300
So we've definitely got
more helium in this one.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.300
This is less dense,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.900
and you can definitely see
that they do not take off

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.400
of the same speed as a result.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.720
All right.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.900
I also want to test like
the lifting capacity of these.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.700
So what we're going to do

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.800
is we're going to tie strings
onto the bottom of them,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.447
and then slowly add weights,

00:03:29.447 --> 00:03:31.728
and see how much weight
each one can take.

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:33.610
Mine is already
slowed down with 3.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.400
Just a little.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.820
All right.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.700
Wait, what's yours at?

00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:38.761
Mine is currently
at 11 paper clips,

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:40.400
and it's just-- Look at this.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.548
It's like almost perfectly even.

00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:43.971
It's barely going down.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.900
That's awesome.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.660
And I took one off of mine,
so now, I'm at 10,

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:48.900
and mine's going up.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.600
So for me, 10 is the most,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.070
and for you,
4 is the most.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.680
It is,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.400
but mine is also being held up
by static electricity right now.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.773
We are able to blow up
a balloon with our breath

00:03:57.773 --> 00:03:58.632
that then floats.

00:03:58.632 --> 00:04:00.400
It doesn't float
in the air as much.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.600
We have about half
as much weight on it,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.462
and that's just pulling down.

00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:05.810
So yes, it does work.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.800
No, it does not work is filling
it directly from the tank.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.600
Now, we want to try sort
of the opposite direction.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.498
We want to see

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.000
if we can make heavier
than air balloons

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.940
even more than normal.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.420
This balloon is now full
of sulfur hexafluoride.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.500
If you haven't seen as using
sulfur hexafluoride before,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.147
there's a couple
of neat things about it.

00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:24.787
The first is

00:04:24.787 --> 00:04:27.500
that it's about 6
times more dense than air,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.700
which means that it's
heavy for a balloon.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.100
The other thing that it's known
for is having an opposite effect

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.300
on your voice as helium.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.657
Instead of making
your voice high,

00:04:36.657 --> 00:04:37.900
it makes your voice low.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.600
Pretty cool.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.930
We're gonna make a helium-sulfur
hexafluoride cocktail.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.380
[Music]

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.200
[inaudible.]

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200
[Music]

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.060
Okay, is it--

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.880
Oh, okay.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.210
Sulfut hexafloride's
definitely winning here.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.740
This one is sulfur hexafluoride.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.500
This one has just normal breath.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.680
[Music]

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.000
It's pulling down pretty hard.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Helium is lighter than air,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.500
but not nearly as
much lighter as

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.468
sulfur hexafluoride is heavier.

00:05:07.468 --> 00:05:09.500
So it overcomes
it pretty easily.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.360
I think we need to move on
to our next experiment.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.833
To start this experiment off,

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:16.201
we've got a balloon
filled with breath

00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:18.250
in a container full of just air.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.300
So this is a little bit heavier
than the air around it,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.671
just because it has a little bit

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.140
higher concentration
of carbon dioxide,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.560
and because it has
a balloon around it.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.100
The balloon in
itself adds weight.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.400
But now, what we're going to do
is introduce a gas into the box

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.149
that's way heavier than the air,

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:35.500
and even the carbon dioxide
in that balloon.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.000
Look at that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.540
So that is a balloon
that was sinking in regular air.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.800
From the box was full of just
the normal air around us,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.300
it's going straight
to the bottom.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.700
Now, it's floating.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.920
Helium balloon into
sulfur hexafluoride.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.200
That's going well.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.300
Wow, that has a lot
of resistance on it.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.700
Does it?

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.300
Yeah, it's kind of like trying
to push a ball down into water.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.315
This is the one

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.700
that had sulfur hexafluoride
and some helium in it.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.320
Right to the bottom.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.400
Makes sense.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.515
Sinks right through.

00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:13.300
Well, this one
is still floating.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.529
Can we fill a balloon

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.000
with our breath that will sink
into the sulfur hexafluoride?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.620
How do you gonna do that?

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.400
Same way, fill a balloon
with sulfur hexafluoride,

00:06:21.402 --> 00:06:24.018
breathe out of that balloon,
breathe in to the other balloon.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.220
Maybe take a couple gap breaths
to keep from passing out,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.000
and just do the same thing,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.400
blowing up a balloon,
see if we can get it to sink.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.900
I'm going to stand behind him
in case he blacks out.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.500
Thank you.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:43.900
[Music]

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.020
You're good.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.200
Taking a breather here.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.780
[Music]

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.452
Mostly better.

00:06:52.452 --> 00:06:53.330
Still in there.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Hang on.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.500
&gt;&gt; You survived.
&gt;&gt; Still a little bit lightheaded.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.160
Let me just fill the rest.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.900
All right.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.900
Let's see these two.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.650
This one, I'm gonna label as
sulfur hexafluoride breath.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.698
This one is oxygen,

00:07:05.698 --> 00:07:08.900
but if anyone was ever wondering
how bad my handwriting is.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.210
All right, hang on.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.210
I do want to refill this box.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.500
Toss that in,
see how it's doing.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.300
Lovely.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.300
Yes, perfect.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.110
Here is your breath balloon.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.000
Sulfur hexafluoride breath.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.820
Did it work?

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.314
Did it work?

00:07:23.314 --> 00:07:23.929
It worked.

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:25.920
Sinks right down through.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.500
Sulfur hexafluoride,
much heavier than air,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.382
but it's not the only gas
that's heavier than air.

00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:33.554
Carbon Dioxide is
also heavier than air,

00:07:33.554 --> 00:07:35.468
and while we breathe
out some of it,

00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:37.998
still what we breathe
out is mostly nitrogen

00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:40.700
with a fair amount
of oxygen still mixed in there.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.600
But we do have

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.600
a good way of getting
a concentrated carbon dioxide.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.500
We want to get this carbon
dioxide out of the dry ice,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.600
and into this balloon.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.930
So we're going to use a little
bit of hot water to do so.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:57.520
[Music]

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.680
That looks pretty good.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.600
Compare it with the SF6, is it--

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.340
Which is--

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.700
The sulfur hexafluoride is still

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.900
much heavier than
the carbon dioxide.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.680
Carbon dioxide
versus just breath.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.126
I would say the carbon dioxide
feels a little bit heavier.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:15.785
There you go.

00:08:15.785 --> 00:08:17.735
That's a good
demonstration right there.

00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:18.685
Definitely heavier.

00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:21.200
Let's see how it does
in our sulfur hexafluoride box.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.900
Yep, floats nicely.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.294
Carbon dioxide balloon.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.804
That's sinks right
down through it.

00:08:29.804 --> 00:08:30.520
Cool.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.400
Very clear demonstration

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.640
that the carbon
dioxide is heavier.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.247
You know what else
we could do though.

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:37.600
We might be able
to actually weigh these.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.200
To start out though,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.300
we're just going to take
an uninflated balloon,

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.400
and we're going to set
that right on the scale.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.080
That is showing up as 3.2 grams.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.130
2.85 for this one.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.900
2.9 for that one.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.100
I'm going back
to this yellow one.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.300
Was that really
that much heavier?

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.320
3.2.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.100
That's a heavier balloon.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.203
I'm going to take this,
and I'm going to press tear.

00:08:58.203 --> 00:08:59.400
That's going to level it out.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.368
That means that
with a balloon on it,

00:09:01.368 --> 00:09:03.500
that's what it's going
to register as 0.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.700
Now, if I take a balloon off,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.200
that should go down
to negative that much.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.900
Now, here we have a balloon
that is full of breath.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.180
Now, we were getting a result
of about 3.5 grams.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.760
This is a very sensitive scale.

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:21.200
However, if I just push
my hand down above this,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.600
it easily registers

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.700
on the scale, just the air
pushing down on the balloon.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.100
So about 3.5 grams.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.600
It was resting up
against the back of this.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.100
But let's try the CO2.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.900
I think that's going to be
the next closest result.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:38.380
That is showing up as
about 8.5 grams so...

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.300
Holy cow!

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.740
3.5 grams for just
breath up to...

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.400
Well, maybe even 9.5.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.000
That's kind of
where it's registering now.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.120
Sulfur hexafluoride.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.900
What is it?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.700
What is it?

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.100
Well, if I can get
it to stay on there,

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.900
it's up about 30 grams.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.066
Oh my gosh.

00:09:57.066 --> 00:09:58.010
Bounce.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.120
Come on balloon.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.800
Almost ten times as
heavy as breath.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.015
Yeah.

00:10:02.015 --> 00:10:04.600
Really significant difference
between the sulfur hexafluoride

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.100
and the breath balloon.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.840
[Music]

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.420
Apparently, there's something
very scratchy inside our box.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.440
3 balloons just
spontaneously exploded,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.100
all in a row,

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.900
and we don't know
what caused it.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.100
There is another thing
I do want to test,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.218
because I suspect a lot
of you will want to see it

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.440
and that is breathing
in sulfur hexafluoride,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.500
and then breathing in helium,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.300
and seeing what
the result is.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.300
Not mixing them.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.629
I suspect it's going to be
like your balloon.

00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:37.803
Now, lungs are actually
not like balloons.

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.500
They're often depicted that way.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.885
They're really more
like a sponge material

00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:42.700
on the inside.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.700
So it's not just
a bag full of air.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.600
I'm just going to try and like
hold my breath for a second,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.970
and then I'm going to breathe
helium on top of that,

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:50.900
and I'm going to see

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.577
if it's possible to get
like a layered voice effect,

00:10:53.577 --> 00:10:55.310
where I have like
helium up first,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.200
and then the voice
goes down to here.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:03.120
[Music]

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.250
Where's your voice at?

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.040
Right here.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.080
Wow.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.040
[Music]

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.900
Okay, what result am I getting?

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.600
That's actually kind of strange.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.900
I am getting almost a mix.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.350
Now, it's just
sulfur hexafluoride.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.700
And now, I need to breathe.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.200
But it worked for half a second.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.000
That was cool.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.700
This time, I'm going
to try it again,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.000
and have just a little bit

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.795
of sulfur hexafluoride, and then
like the rest of this helium.

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:29.400
Take some deep breaths
for a second.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.060
Your lips have gone glue again.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.660
[Music]

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.160
Is it--

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.840
Okay.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:44.460
[Music]

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.000
Now, starting out,
it's actually fairly normal.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.200
I heard a tiny bit
of squeak for a second.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.294
I'm just going to keep talking,

00:11:50.294 --> 00:11:51.800
and I don't know
what's going to happen,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.400
or if there was

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.700
enough sulfur hexafluoride
to make any difference at all.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.256
I am kind of running
out of breath though.

00:11:56.256 --> 00:11:57.700
So if there is
any sulfur hexafluoride,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.900
I'm going to hit it soon.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.100
I don't think it's gonna happen.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.480
There wasn't enough in there.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.680
The helium went out.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.400
So you can overpower
it with helium,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.600
but mostly it just
made my voice normal.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.242
Like to me,
it didn't sound that weird.

00:12:10.242 --> 00:12:11.592
It didn't change that much.

00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:12.638
So I think they did mix,

00:12:12.638 --> 00:12:14.250
but they mixed
in just the right ratio

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.200
that they're just like,
eh, call it a wash.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.500
Monkey Humor, thank you
for your suggestion.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.300
Editors, if we can find
a picture of Dr. Doofenshmirtz

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.660
with Mr. Balloony,

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.010
just flash that image up
on the screen at some point.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.300
Guys, that's not all.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.925
You know, we've always got more
for you to see.

00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:34.923
That box at the top is going
to take you to our last video,

00:12:34.923 --> 00:12:35.921
you should go check that out.

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.015
The other box
is going to show you

00:12:37.015 --> 00:12:38.618
what YouTube think you
should be watching next,

00:12:38.618 --> 00:12:39.813
and if you hit
this bomb the middle,

00:12:39.813 --> 00:12:40.900
you'll be subscribe
to our channel,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.262
so you never miss out on a video.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.322
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:12:43.322 --> 00:12:44.518
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.760
Talk to you then.
