00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to Applied Cryptography.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Cryptography is a branch of mathematics

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and computer science--that's a lot of fun--it's about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
using secrets to solve problems.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this class we're going to learn about

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
some of the foundations of cryptography

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we're also going to learn to use cryptography

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to solve problems in computing,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
like how to send messages securely,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
how to manage accounts on websites,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and how to do things like perform computation

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
where you can keep your data secret

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and still get the result of a function

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that depends on your data and some other data.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The name cryptography has two parts:

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
crypto comes from the Greek root for secret--to hide--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and cryptography's all about using secrets.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The second part comes from the root meaning writing--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
this is the same graphy that appears in telegraphy or photography.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What we do in this course, and what we do in cryptography

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
involves a lot more than just secret writing.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's really everything to do with secrets.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So a better name for the course would be cryptology.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Cryptography is used so frequently in practice, though,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that it makes more sense to use the name cryptography,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
even though our concern is with the much larger goal

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
of understanding how to use secrets in general.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And cryptology is the science of secrets

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which is really what this course is all about.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So that's enough to answer the first quiz,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the first quiz will check

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that you understand the definition of cryptology.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So the question is, which of these involve cryptology?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Check all of the answers that do.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Opening a door--and I mean a traditional door,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
using a traditional key.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Playing a game of poker.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Logging into your account at Udacity,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or doing a search using google.com,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and I should be a little more specific for this last one,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
this assumes you're doing the search today,

00:01:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and you're already logged in to one of your Google accounts.
