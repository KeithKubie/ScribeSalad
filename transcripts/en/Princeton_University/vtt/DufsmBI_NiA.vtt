LULU CHEN: My experience
was very heartwarming.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.930
SPEAKER 1: Empowering.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.390
CHRISTIAN LAWSON: Aesthetic.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.000
ANDREA AYALA: Story-telling.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.120
SPEAKER 2: Incredible.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.410
SPEAKER 3: International
experiences are indescribable.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.870
You just have to go.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:27.090
[MUSIC, PIANO PLAYING]

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.050
CHRISTIAN LAWSON: Just
international experience

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.790
is a wonderful thing to have.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.070
And the arts are really
what gets me about Germany,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.380
just the musical
traditions, starting

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.570
from the Baroque
period moving onward.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.350
I've been composing
for over a year now.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.830
And I felt that that
was one way in which I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.440
could express myself uniquely.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.820
ANASTASIA VRACHNOS:
Princeton now

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.950
is providing an incredible
array of possibilities

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.990
for students to have
international experiences.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.550
Learning Across Borders, or
LABs, as we've come to call it,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.380
brings them together to share
their insights and learnings,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.130
to glean a sense of what other
students' experiences have

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.740
been, but also to help students
who haven't yet gone abroad

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.160
get a sense of the possibilities
and what they might learn

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.580
and what the
challenges might be.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.610
LULU CHEN: I went to
the Indian Institute

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.350
of Cerebral Palsy, which is
located in Kolkata, India.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.120
People who read my blog get
a really real experience

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.000
of what it is to be there,
not just all the small

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.350
joys, but also parts that
might have been difficult

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.980
and that helped me grow.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.790
ANDREA AYALA: I decided
to go to Argentina.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.470
I wanted to work in
social entrepreneurship.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.160
And it's growing.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.120
So it was really exciting
to be there at a time

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.810
where people were thinking
more about social issues.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.430
I loved the idea of
networking and just

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.930
meeting all these
really cool people

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.440
and hearing their stories.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.810
CHRISTIAN LAWSON:
Munich was just

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.020
incredibly interesting to me.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.570
I happened to meet people there
who weren't from Princeton.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.990
I think that's really where
the interesting things started

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.490
to happen.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.540
I ended up just
going out with them.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.100
And there was so much beauty
around me at the time.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.440
And it was just one way I could
express it, through the piano.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.360
I plan on using it as a
way of reminding myself

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.480
that there's all this
international experience

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.070
to be had.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.900
And I don't want to
necessarily lock myself

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.050
into just this one country.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.920
LULU CHEN: I've been
having really good days,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.080
like able to
communicate with people

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.590
who spoke English or able to
say a couple phrases in Bengali.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.090
And then I had met someone
who was hearing impaired.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.470
And suddenly, I didn't know
how to communicate with them.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.710
Even though it's very simple
to be able to put together

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.750
signs, symbols,
pictures and words,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.670
it actually makes
a huge difference,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.610
because now she is
able to express herself

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.200
to a variety of
different people.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.160
ANDREA AYALA: What's so
amazing about traveling

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.790
is that you get to
see that there's not

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.070
one way of doing things.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.740
And speaking a foreign
language somehow

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.100
makes each interaction seem
more significant, because you're

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.220
really thinking about what
you're saying and really

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.060
listening to them.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.290
That really allows
you to connect to people.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.810
LUISA DUARTE: You will have
other obligations that will not

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.130
give you the opportunity to
experience the world the way

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.450
you can during college.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.470
So this is the time to try.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.120
And this is the time to
take on the adventure.
