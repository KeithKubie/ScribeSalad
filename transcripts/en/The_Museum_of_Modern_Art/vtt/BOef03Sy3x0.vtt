00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:07.446
The photograph offers
a kind of unexpected intimacy

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.093
and pushing a boundary.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.015
My hope is that you can empathize
and maybe even recognize something

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.226
in someone that you might
not pay very much attention to.

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:23.373
So will you tell a little bit about
how you get to a picture like this?

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:26.041
I wanted to meet people
that wanted to be photographed.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:31.240
I didn't want to be a fly on the wall
or photograph someone from afar,

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.535
and so it's always important to me
that I ask permission,

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.656
and if you're interested,
then great.

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:38.998
And then we walk around
and find a white wall,

00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:42.918
and my one direction is always
don't look at the camera

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:46.945
because I wanted them to appear
almost as though they were unaware,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.260
to reference a kind
of street photography.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:56.098
Eventually, they often relax
or they're bored or aggravated.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:58.810
Maybe a little bit of
“Okay, are we done yet?”

00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:02.238
And then something
interesting happens,

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:05.023
and those are almost
inevitably the best pictures.

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.865
When you make a picture
that's this reductive,

00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:11.906
you take so much away,
so much context,

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:13.950
so much potential narrative.

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:17.203
The entirety of all this detail

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.331
amounts to what makes
the strongest photograph.

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:22.250
Do you feel like that can be,
though, almost...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.943
too much information?

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:28.296
I mean, I hesitate to say cruel
except sort of on the spectrum

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.466
of cruel and tender,
it's like...

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.593
I think that we all look like that.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.348
If we were all to be photographed
with that kind of detail,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.305
this is what we look like
and this is who we are.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.946
I find the most cruel kinds
of pictures to be the covers

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.740
of fashion magazines.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:49.693
I mean, nobody looks like that.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:54.323
So in my mind,
not only is this much more honest,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.208
I find this woman
incredibly beautiful,

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.721
and I don't think
there's anything cruel

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.998
about the lines,

00:02:00.165 --> 00:02:04.125
and what the sun has done to her face
and what that reveals about her,

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.461
but also what is revealed by the fact
that she's put on eyeliner

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.533
and she's put on her lipstick
and her pink...

00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:11.321
Matching her outfit, yeah.

00:02:11.488 --> 00:02:13.008
Matching coat
and there's a heart button,

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:18.263
and that tells us so much about,
in a way, her optimism.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.888
Part of the criticism
of my work has always been,

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:23.476
“Oh, you're
photographing poor people,”

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:24.853
or “you're
photographing the homeless,”

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.940
although that's a broad assumption.

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:31.401
They're not celebrities,
they're not politicians.

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.531
I find that when people
have a lot of power,

00:02:35.698 --> 00:02:37.575
whether it's money,
whatever kind of power,

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:38.826
they have a lot more to lose,

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:41.161
and so they present themselves
in a very specific light.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:44.665
Whereas with people
who don't have as much to lose,

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.960
they are so much more
generous with themselves

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.746
and so much more at ease

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:53.591
with what some viewers
might perceive as imperfections.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.778
This is not here to make us
feel better about ourselves

00:02:57.928 --> 00:02:59.138
and the way that we see the world.

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:03.516
It's here to hopefully
have a kind of aesthetic seduction,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.438
but then to have to confront
maybe uncomfortable truths,

00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:09.898
and what are we bringing
to this photograph?

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.268
Why am I uncomfortable
confronting this person?

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:14.483
What is it about me?

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.990
And I think you have
to contend with a lot.

00:03:18.568 --> 00:03:22.415
And that to me
is a very worthwhile experience.
