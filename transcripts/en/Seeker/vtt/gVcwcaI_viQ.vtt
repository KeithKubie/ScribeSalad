00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.199
The elusive ‘theory of everything’.

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.431
A theory that could resolve the most fundamental
roadblock in our understanding of how the

00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.680
universe behaves... and tie everything neatly
up with string....

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.949
It’s been 50 years since string theory was
first proposed, and new work call into question

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.289
not only essential parts of the theory itself,
but also our working understanding of the

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.289
universe.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.520
Let’s start at the beginning.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.551
We have two primary ways to describe how all
the ‘stuff’ in our universe behaves: one

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.230
big and one small.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.660
The first is Einstein's theory of general
relativity, which tells us how gravity interacts

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.570
with space and time to form the world around
us.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.570
That’s the big.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.690
Then there’s the small: the Standard Model,
which works on the quantum level.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.500
This says that all matter is made up of building
blocks called elementary particles*.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.420
You can break us down into molecules, then
into atoms, then into the subatomic particles

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.000
like electrons, neutrons, and protons.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.289
Smaller still are those elementary particles,
divided into two broad categories, quarks

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.820
and leptons, of which there are different
kinds.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.820
Groovy.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.520
The standard model works mathematically in
most cases, but it only incorporates three

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.950
of the four fundamental forces of our universe.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.390
There’s the strong, the weak , and the electromagnetic
forces.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.810
And then...there’s gravity.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.799
Gravity is the odd one out, the ugly duckling
of the Standard Model, because it doesn’t

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:22.799
fit.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.659
Each of the other three forces has a carrier
particle--photons carry the electromagnetic

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.999
force, gluons carry the strong force, and
W and Z bosons carry the weak force.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.600
But we haven’t discovered a carrier particle
for gravity, which we would call the graviton...

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.600
if we could find it.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.219
This means the mathematical calculations of
the Standard Model and those that underpin

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.340
Einstein’s theory of general relativity
don’t match up with each other.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.319
If we could find some way that they could
work together, we’d have a theory of...everything.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:57.530
It’s this misalignment--and desire for unity--that
gave birth to string theory.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.990
So how does string theory tie our ideas of
the universe together?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.429
Instead of picturing elementary particles
as distinct points, string theory posits that

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.459
all elementary particles can be pictured more
like a vibrating string.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.650
Each particle is technically the same string,
it’s just vibrating in a different way,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.700
the way that a string on a musical instrument
can play different notes ...including that

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.650
elusive note, gravity.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.590
Ok that sounds pretty tempting.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.360
Of course, there are issues.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.489
The level on which we would be able to observe
strings vibrating is wayyyy outside our current

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.500
capabilities.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.489
Famous string theorist Brian Greene says we’d
need to build a particle collider the size

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.690
of the galaxy to be able to directly observe
strings in action.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.260
Since observation is off the table, how about
math?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.579
Well, the math tells us something pretty freaky.

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.730
The equations that make string theory work
require that the universe has at least ten

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.730
dimensions.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.049
We’re only able to observe four of these--the
three dimensions of space with time as a commonly

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.890
proposed 4th dimension.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.510
The extra dimensions required by string theory
is where parallel universes start to come

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.510
into play.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.299
Since strings are so small, the math tells
us that they would not just be vibrating in

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.749
the large dimensions we know of, but in other
tiny dimensions too.

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:16.510
If we know the shape of those tiny dimensions,
we might be able to predict and then observe

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.799
properties of elementary particles--like their
charge or spin--that would be attributed to

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.469
those extra dimensions.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.180
Which would mean we’re seeing evidence of
the other dimensions!!

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.109
But the problem with that is that once scientists
tried plugging in different potential shapes

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.170
for these extra dimensions, they found that
most of them worked.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.819
The more they tried, the more of them fit,
which meant that they had wayyyyy too many

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.790
possibilities to consider and they lost hope
that finding out the shape of the dimensions

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.849
could help us observe their existence.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.560
Until, someone proposed that perhaps there
wasn’t just one right shape for each of

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.329
the extra dimensions--but they’re all right
in each of their own universes.

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.860
Meaning there are OTHER UNIVERSES.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.209
Potentially over 10^500 others, each ever-so-slightly
different from our own.

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.069
And yeah, I’m still talking about theoretical
physics, not science fiction, although it’s

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.859
a pretty thin line if you asked me.

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.150
That’s where we all were up until a few
weeks ago, when controversial new mathematical

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.549
papers may have blown all of this apart.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.470
And this big upset involves dark energy.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.630
We think we’ve observed that our universe
is slowly expanding.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.540
Our explanation for this is...dark energy.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.630
And there are lots of theories about what
it is and how it behaves to make the universe

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.580
expand, but we don’t have anything nailed
down on that front yet.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.620
These recent papers provide new evidence that
the math of string theory may actually prohibit

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.620
the existence of alternate universes in which
dark energy is stable.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.460
Which means one of a couple of things: either
string theory is wrong.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.930
Or we’re wrong about our universe.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.430
Maybe it didn’t explode in a Big Bang, it’s
not expanding, and it will eventually contract

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.620
in what some physicists call a ‘Big Crunch’.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.130
Or maybe there’s an entirely new way of
fitting the existence of dark energy into

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.250
our string theory calculations that no one
has tried yet.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.289
String theorists are divided about these new
claims.

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.220
Many are not at all convinced of the papers’
claims and think the existing theories work

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.449
just fine.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.069
So while there are no hard answers, this latest
work has sparked a renewed urgency to understand

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.759
dark energy, how it behaves and how it might
inform our theories about the behavior of

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.060
our universe and the potential existence of
others.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.460
Still with us?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.389

questions than answers, but we want you to
