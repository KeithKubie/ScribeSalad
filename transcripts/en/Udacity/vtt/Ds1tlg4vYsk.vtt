00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.019
So Implicit memory is also called non-declarative memory because we can not

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.275
directly recall this type of memory. Implicit memory is a kind of memory that's

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:13.240
made up of knowledge based on previous experiences such as skills that we

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.126
preform automatically once you have mastered them. Implicit memory resides

00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:23.234
outside of our conscience awareness. So for implicit memory, we know how to do

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:26.946
something, for example ride a bike, but it's difficult to describe how we can

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:32.296
preform the skills we know how to do so well. For example, I know how to scuba

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:35.407
dive, and I love to dive, but it's difficult for me to describe how you swim

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:40.590
through the water. Make sure you're weighted right, have to inflate or deflate

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.800
your bcd, it's something you have to experience for yourself. On the other

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.714
hand, Susan knows how to knit and she can knit really pretty scarves, but if

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.487
you ask her how to explain it or give you step by step instructions like I

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:55.625
have, it's hard for her to do that. So for the example of Susan and knowing how

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:58.712
to knit, she needs to know where her fingers belong, where the needles go and

00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:03.924
how to move the yarn around. This is an example of procedural memory. So

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:08.212
procedural memory refers to the knowledge we hold for almost any behavior or

00:01:08.212 --> 00:01:13.650
physical skill we've learned. Again this could be things like driving a manual

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.058
transmission car, knitting, scuba diving, playing hockey or any sport. Priming

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:24.175
is another type of Implicit memory. Priming occurs when recall is improved by

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:29.645
prior exposure to the same or similar stimuli. In fact memory is better for

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:32.906
information that relates to prior knowledge.
