00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.300
&gt;&gt; Maria A. Palante: For those

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.960
of you just joining us we had an
incredibly stimulating morning

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.010
this morning and a
wonderful keynote,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.290
and this afternoon we're going
to begin to hear from creators

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.600
and before I say
that I just want

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.870
to also again thank the
Center for the Protection

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.080
of Intellectual Property.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.390
And over here you'll see very
intelligent energetic looking

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.200
students, and I think,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.630
if you don't mind I think
they're our future and I'd

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.510
like to recognize them for
helping us to put this on today.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.380
[ Applause ]

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.060
I also want to make a
point to thank John Conyers

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.590
who is the Ranking Member of
the House Judiciary Committee.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.040
When I testified before
the committee in favor

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.900
of comprehensive
review of copyright law,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.650
the Copyright Office
made the point that no

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.800
such review would be complete
without looking at moral rights.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.770
And John Conyers who, has been
a lifelong advocate of authors

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.840
and artists, asked us formally
to commence such a study.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.430
So as we said this morning,
this symposia cosponsored

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.480
with George Mason Law
School is the beginning

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.900
of that public dialogue.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.800
And with that I'd like to
turn it over to Kim Isbell

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.940
who is Senior Counsel in
our Department of Policy

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.670
and International Affairs.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.760
&gt;&gt; Kim Isbell: Thanks Maria.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.580
You know, as Maria just
alluded to one of the key things

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.970
about this panel that I think is
really interesting is it's the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.390
first opportunity to really hear
from the artists themselves.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.310
You know this morning, we heard
from a lot of lawyers talking

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.750
about what moral rights
the United States does

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.700
or doesn't recognize, how
you could assert more rights

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.610
under various provisions
of U.S. law

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.440
and then the very
interesting keynote

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.040
by Professor Ginsberg
talking about what she views

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.480
as a very important moral
right, the right of attribution

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.950
and how we could go
about codifying it.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.310
But this panel is
really focused on:

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.470
what do artists themselves
think?

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.480
How do moral rights impact
their day to day work?

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.660
How do they impact them both
professionally and personally?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.910
Which moral rights
do they care about?

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.340
Which moral rights make their
lives easier or more difficult?

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.320
And so for that reason,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.370
I'm going to take a slightly
different approach to this panel

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.530
than we have in the
prior panels.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.690
I'm not going to start off
asking our panelists a bunch

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.430
of questions.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.640
Instead I want to give each
of them about five minutes

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.710
to really talk to you
from their own perspective

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.840
as to what moral rights and
what this symposium mean to them

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.360
and what they think
should be the key takeaways

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.250
as the Copyright Office is
going into a larger study

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.120
of the issue of moral rights.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.730
Before I do that though
I am just quickly going

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.270
to introduce our panel,
and then I'm going

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.390
to turn the microphone
over to Melvin.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.210
Our first speaker
is Melvin Gibbs.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.260
He's a musician,
bassist, composer,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.730
general musician,
Renaissance man.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.250
He's also the president of the
Content Creators Coalition,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.910
who is really out there
advocating for artists

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.020
in the area of copyright
and in other areas.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.460
And so we are very
glad he could come

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.570
down from New York to join us.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.210
Next to him is David Lowery.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.650
He's a songwriter.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.930
He's a recording artist.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.880
You've probably heard
of some of his bands.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.900
He was in Cracker and
Camper Van Beethoven,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.830
and he also helped found
Pitch-A-Tent Records.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.300
He's been a frequent speaker
for artists rights in many

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.220
of these discussions that
most of us participate in.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.020
He's a very strong advocate
for the rights of composers

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.980
and the rights of recording
artists in the United States.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.680
Next to him is Yoko
Miyashita [laughter].

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.370
Sorry I apologize.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.770
She's Senior Vice President and
General Counsel at Getty Images.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.480
She came to us all the way
from Seattle to join us today,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.070
so we are very glad
she could be here.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.990
Next to her is Professor
Sean O'Connor.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.260
He is the Boeing International
Professor at the University

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.510
of Washington Law School.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.210
We actually have a number of
Seattleites on the panel today.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.790
And he's done extensive
research in the area

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.380
of moral rights and copyright.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.510
And finally last, but definitely
not least, is Scott Turow.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.640
He is an attorney and an author.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.500
He's written nine
best-selling books

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.490
and has also been very
active in these issues

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.620
and so I personally am really
looking forward to hearing

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.340
from all our panelists.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:28.410
And so with that I'm going
to turn it over to Melvin.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.400
&gt;&gt; Melvin Gibbs: Good afternoon.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.230
Howdy [laughter].

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.290
I was about to use
Kimberly but is it more --

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.400
, should I be saying Ms.
IsBell in this context?

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.940
&gt;&gt; Kimberely: Kimberly is fine.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.080
[launghter]

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.510
&gt;&gt; Melvin: All right so
I'm going to say Kimberly

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.140
so you know I'm trying to
get with the protocol here.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.350
Anyway as Kimberly said
earlier there was a lot of talk

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.410
about the law and
intricacies of the law.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.430
I'm a musician.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.640
We think about the law as part

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:05.360
of a more holistic way
we think about the world.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.160
For me personally, in addition
to thinking about the law

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.340
when I have to think
about it I think

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.120
about what my music
means philosophically

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.390
and what it means economically.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:22.680
And once I start thinking
about music, you know you have

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.870
to start thinking about
how you translate it,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.410
and then it becomes a question
of thinking about metaphors.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.720
And as musicians we're basically
stuck in two metaphors.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.690
We are stuck in a metaphor
where we are workers;

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.710
we are making a musical work.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.750
Or we are employees
creating a product.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.420
For me, neither one of
those things actually works.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.810
I actually think of myself
as part of a community

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.660
and creating for a community.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.070
And in the context of this
society, the goal seems

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.410
to be dissemination of
creativity, getting it out to

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.130
as many people as possible.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.620
And the question becomes,
for somebody like me

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.430
who is creative, is how am I
going to make that process work.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.480
Leaving aside the kind

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.400
of inherent you know
heteronormative male aspect

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.540
of the word dissemination you
have the question of [laughter],

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.370
you have the question
of what does that mean?

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.200
Dissemination is a process
that starts from an individual

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.120
to another individual.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.860
So inherently for the
dissemination process to work,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.180
the individual has
to be recognized.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.960
So how that works in the context
of a community is very simple.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.150
You know who the guy down
the street is who does X,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.500
Y or Z. For us as musicians,
there might be a guy--

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.020
for me there was literally
the man who lived next door

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.570
who started me off on music.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.450
The question becomes I needed
to know who this person was.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.900
In the context of a community,
of course you're going

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.610
to know that, but in
the context of 2016

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:19.370
when we have aggregated groups
of data it becomes difficult

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:25.400
to impossible to know who these
individuals are unless there is

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.900
some mechanism specifically
built to make that happen.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.130
So looking at the idea of
moral rights in the context

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:37.550
of this society today I would
say to have this balance

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.660
between community and individual
is actually more important

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.850
than ever.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:47.500
To have a really large
scale dissemination

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.040
of creativity the individual
creators have to be recognized.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.710
Alright? Somebody asked
why is the law necessary

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.530
in the earlier panel.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.050
To answer that I'll
give an experience.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.060
I've been consulting at a
startup for the past few months,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.680
almost a year now, and one
of the things I've learned is

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.690
that nothing gets built

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.470
at a startup unless it
is absolutely necessary

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.000
for it to exist.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.540
And the reasons that
it's necessary

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.590
to exist are basically only two.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.120
It has to be a business
reason or it has

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.110
to be a legal or
regulatory reason.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.400
It will not get built
because I want it to.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.090
There has to be some
affirmative reason

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.040
that the tech community
has to do this.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.510
So that's my short
answer to that.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.040
For us attribution
that is our currency.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.480
I don't exist if people don't
know who I am and I mean

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.560
that in the most literal
sense of I don't eat.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.030
So every time something goes
out that I've participated

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:59.400
in that I don't get attribution
for it affects my family.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.780
And how that affects
the community is

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.910
that the less I am able to
create the less I'm able

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.790
to help other people create.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.470
And the less the community of --

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.140
, it shrinks the
community of artists

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.240
which will eventually
shrink the creativity

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.000
of this country as a whole.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.770
I don't have a watch on, I
don't know how I'm going here.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.080
Kimberely:

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.900
&gt;&gt; One more minute.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.000
&gt;&gt; Melvin: Okay.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.480
There is a bit of an
overlap between economic use

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.330
and moral use, which I
guess we'll get into later.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.310
But I can speak as somebody
who was mentored by a lot

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.140
of the older jazz
musicians in New York City

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.460
that you cannot really
separate them.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.440
There are a lot of
things that --

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.720
, attribution and
integrity are both important.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.270
And for us as musicians, it's
a slightly different issue

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.830
because we are performers.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.150
It's not like in a book

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.700
where you have one
version of the book.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.670
We play a song today, we'll
play it again tomorrow.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.860
Each performance is unique

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.300
and each performance can
be disseminated on its own.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.130
So I think there's
a different --

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.800
, there's room for a different
way of thinking about this idea

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.340
that integrity will
somehow hinder the process

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.580
of remix culture.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.370
I think that this is
something we'll examine further

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:31.410
but I just wanted to
touch on that right now.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.710
&gt;&gt; Kimberely: Okay,
thank you Melvin.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.900
David Lowery.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.810
&gt;&gt; David Lowery:
Thank you Melvin.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:45.690
You know about 23 years
ago I had a song released,

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.590
and it started to
become popular on radio.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.800
One day I get a call from
the senior vice president

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.980
of promotions at the record
label, and he basically says

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.750
"that song, you know that song's
not about being stoned, right?"

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.700
[laughter] And I'm
like, "of course it's

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.210
about being stoned Michael,"
but he kept saying it to me

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.530
and then finally I was like,
"oh is there a problem?"

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.870
He goes "yeah, I got this letter
I want you to sign and I need

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.670
to fax it to a few
radio stations."

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.260
So despite the fact
that I signed a letter

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.110
that said the song "Low,"
which has a chorus "hey, hey,

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:36.160
hey like being stoned"
[laughter] is

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.220
about being stoned.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.350
Despite the fact that I
essentially signed a letter

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.320
that said that it didn't, it is.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.310
And I guess in the world
of alternative rock

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.610
and rock radio songs about
being stoned there are a couple

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:55.160
of other people who have a few
tracks that basically come out

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.230
and say that and one of
them of course is Tom Petty.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:06.940
So about the time that
we were first dealing

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:13.320
with digital distribution-- at
first involuntarily by the likes

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.040
of Napster and Kazaa and
Grokster and things like that--

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.550
somebody, probably because they
were stoned, mislabeled my song

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:28.110
"Low" as being a Tom Petty song
called "Like Being Stoned .MP3"

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.830
or "Tom Petty - Low -

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:35.370
106" I guess 108 must
have been an MP3 disc

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.810
that they ripped it from.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.080
And for the next six or seven
years I had this ongoing battle

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.510
to kind of correct
this misrepresentation

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:56.900
that that was actually a Tom
Petty song to the point where --

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:02.060
, what's the name
of this website?

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.750
And it's still out there.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.850
If you look it up on LastFM
it says it's a Tom Petty song.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.050
Picture of Tom Petty there.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.380
There's a Wikia called
misattributed

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:20.630
and the Wikia misattributed song
that's one of the first examples

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.510
of a song being misattributed
to artists.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.890
So you've got to
think about this.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.120
So my point, and I think
there's a lot of people here

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.770
that feel the same way,
is that attribution,

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.780
you can't really
separate attribution

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.670
from the economic rights.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.700
I mean it's the same thing.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.640
Now we can decide what we
are going to do about that,

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.420
because the last thing I want is
a DMCA loophole that can drive

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.550
like a truck or several
thousand trucks through.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:15:03.580
But it is definitely -- , to
look at attribution as separate

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.060
from an economic right is
ridiculous, because A) one,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.520
you know all those people are
freely downloading those songs,

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.810
well maybe, maybe they would
have come to the concert,

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:21.460
but they would have gone to a
Tom Petty concert [laughter].

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:27.890
Also the fact is is when you're
a performer you know you build

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.740
up a certain brand name on the
basis of your previous album

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.460
so even before your album comes

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.290
out it gets a value,
and economic value.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.840
Because it's going to be
based on the popularity

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.190
of the songs before that more
people are going to listen

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:50.730
to it, maybe buy it,
get licensed in films.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:57.370
I mean it's really, it's silly
that it's not an economic right

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:05.610
or that we would even think
that it's not an economic right.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:16.440
I guess the other thing is
that, I find there's a lot of --

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.170
, you have this problem built
into our system for songwriters.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.060
Like my example is
a funny example

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.900
as a performer, you know this.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:31.400
But when you look at songwriters
they are almost never attributed

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.770
in the digital world.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.060
I mean I guess you
could dig around.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:43.130
I was using a popular
streaming service

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.520
and they do have a lyrics
plug-in that you can load

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.870
into the program
and then you click

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.800
on lyrics for one of my songs.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.540
It was being performed
by another band

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.070
but this was the song I wrote
and I looked at the lyrics

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.360
and stuff and I was like
that's great, there's lyrics

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.630
and that's attributed to the
wrong people as a writer.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:09.580
So I guess that's my point.

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:15.930
It's an economic
issue, very strongly.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.070
&gt;&gt; Kimberely: Okay, thank you.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.150
Now to go to Yoko
to give us sort

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.350
of the business perspective
on this.

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.030
&gt;&gt; Yoko Miyashita:
You know it's great

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.320
to follow Melvin and David.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.650
Thank you for that context
because it definitely touches

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.320
on a number of things that
we see in my industry.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.460
So just a little
background on Getty Images.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.560
We represent close to 200,000
individual photographers as well

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.450
as having a staff of
150 staff photographers.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.840
So we are both stewards
and distributors

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.340
of third-party content as
well as owners and generators

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.200
of our own content.I
was thinking about this

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.470
as you were talking about these
issues, and I've been with Getty

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.340
for about 11 years and I would
split those years as sort

00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.180
of pre-viral, pre-social
to the current state.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.380
And I would look at sort of
our activities particularly

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.420
on the enforcement side as
seeing instances of uses

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.740
and policing them, and
realizing with online platforms

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.750
with the DMCA loopholes

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.580
that that just simply
became untenable.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.820
So Getty took -- , really looked
at this as a business issue

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.940
because when the genie
is out of the bottle

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.040
on social media it's out.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.060
There is no stuffing it back in.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.240
And the big issue we encounter
here, particularly on images,

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.250
is what I call the
right-click-copy-upload

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.410
paradigm.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.540
When that happens, the metadata
that we have hired people

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.170
to apply all of the
author's information,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.200
the copyright information,
all of those attributes

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.550
that would ordinarily travel
with an image get stripped.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.540
So what happens?

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.960
That image gets orphaned.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.470
That information
you would have had

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.280
about that author not only
has that been infringed,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.710
not only has your economic
right there been messed with,

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.370
it's now been disconnected
from the key information

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.480
that tells you who
actually created that image,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.290
who is the author behind that.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.850
So it's an issue
that we have looked

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.550
at from a business
perspective and said,

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.970
"all right this is happening."

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:18.020
You can send all the
takedown notices in the world,

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.570
and you will never
solve this issue.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.560
So what have we done as a
company is really looked at ways

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.530
of distributing content to
actually bring attribution back.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:34.380
How do you leverage this innate
human need to share images?

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.910
Well you do that
by offering embed.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.260
In May 2014, we launched an
offering through our website

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.580
for free embed use for
noncommercial purposes.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.820
We hai spent years pursuing
these small nonprofit

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.210
organization school
projects and really

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.510
that is a terrible PR campaign.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.490
Really whacking the
schoolteachers over the head

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.170
with a C&amp;D and a
lawsuit or demand

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:06.480
for payment really not great for
company PR, not great for us.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.220
So what did we say?

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.400
We opened up 90 plus
percent of our collections,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.100
and said if you want
to use our content

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.510
for noncommercial use great.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.090
Here's our embed and
what does it too?

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:19.330
It includes a small watermark
as well as attribution.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.810
Give the creators credit
for what they've done.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.590
And it also links
back to our site,

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:27.340
so if someone actually likes
that picture they can go

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.150
through then, make their way
back to the Getty Images site,

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:35.260
explore more images by a
particular photographer.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.370
Soon after embed we've
launched social sharing.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.660
So if you now go to the
Getty Images website

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.310
and see a picture you like
we encourage you to share it

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.540
but it will be shared
with attribution,

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.840
a link back wherever
those platforms allow us.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.870
So you do again --

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.600
, can correlate that back to
the person who created it.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.020
I'm not saying this
is the ideal solution

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.430
but this is the solution that
we currently have in the context

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.880
of where the legal
framework stands.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.420
If it's going to be shared
we want it to be shared

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.260
with attribution, with a
possible potential for people

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.000
to find more images
from these creators.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.410
The other, you know the
other thing that one

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:32.650
of our affiliates, Getty Images
acquired a technology in 2011.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.010
It was the frontrunner in
image recognition software.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.040
They do digital fingerprinting

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.150
and essentially help you
identify images on the internet.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.840
You can see the obvious
use cases

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.940
for pursuing infringements.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.040
But what we've done is
really collected one

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.360
of the largest indices
of online imagery.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.470
So a fantastic solution
for orphan works,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.510
but also just an open API.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.660
So the technology is out
there to help platforms,

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.910
to help companies, to help
anyone who is looking figure

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.010
out who actually
created an image,

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.070
who actually owns the copyright,

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.130
where it's available
for licensing.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.630
This technology exists.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:07.610
It's out there.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:08.900
We offer it.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:14.110
But there needs to be an impetus
to drive uptake of these kinds

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.810
of available technologies.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.210
We know they exist.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.610
They are underutilized across
the industry but again,

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.010
that is a process to
reattach this attribution,

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.510
to reattach the metadata,
to reattach all

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.700
of these key attributes
that go directly

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.750
into the economic
viability of creative works.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:38.180
I wanted to touch on a point you
made, David, about to have --

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.200
, it's not just knowing who the
author is so you can search.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.650
This is all driven in the
platform space by algorithms.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.330
If your name is not
showing up with that song

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.230
and is not being
attributed to you,

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.530
everything else that's
driving the algorithms

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.780
that will drive traffic
back to you or discovery

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.260
of your content, those
connections are being cut off.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.440
So I do see these as
absolutely interrelated

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.470
and you cannot separate the two.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:08.340
I think that's really it for me.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.630
Thank you.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.210
&gt;&gt; Sean O'Connor: Thanks,
okay, I'm actually going

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.950
to use a timer because I'll
just ramble on too long.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.560
First I want to clarify
that I'm not really a moral

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.340
rights expert.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.480
I know that's shocking and I
probably shouldn't be up here.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.350
I always joke that I'm a jack
of all trades, master of none.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.170
I was a singer/songwriter
for a long time but not

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.500
as good as these gentlemen.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.700
I recorded some stuff, did get
some airplay, but I was one

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.140
of those guys was better as a
bar band performer and would go

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.360
to the studio, and
it was pretty good

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.300
in the studio the stuff I
wrote but not good enough

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.990
to quite get me there.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.840
So after that I went and
got a masters in philosophy.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.070
I was a bartender, parked cars,

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.510
you know did every stupid
job you could imagine

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.850
and then ultimately ended up in
law school for various reasons.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.860
And through the magic of
academic tenure I've held a job

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.920
for like 13 years now which
is really quite good for me.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.020
But -- , thank you, I know,
my parents are still shocked

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:58.990
that that's happening.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.510
But, so, I think the only
reason I'm here is kind

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.060
of perhaps a synthesizer,
looking at both the creator side

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.160
because I have experience-- that
I know what it takes not only

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.800
to write songs but also to
get them into the studio.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.810
Again I wasn't good at it

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.040
but I understood the
production process.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.740
What I liked about what Melvin
was saying was distinguishing

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.080
between musicians in
their performance capacity

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.910
and in their recording capacity.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.120
And so I think with moral
rights, and what I just want

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.930
to address for a
couple of minutes here,

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.470
is that the key thing is when
we're focused on musicians

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.820
and other creators when they are
creating what I call artifacts,

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.800
a particular finished
work, a recorded song,

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.620
a book that's going
to be published,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.760
an artwork that's
going to be released.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.490
And then the key is-- and it's
related to a project I'm working

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.930
on right now funded
by CPIP actuall--

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.410
looking at arguing

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:54.130
that copyright should perhaps be
viewed is as much an incentive

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.880
for publication for
making a public commitment

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.060
to that particular
vision of a creative work,

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.220
as it is an incentive
for creativity

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.310
and the other things
we normally say.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.570
Why? Well because if you
talk to a bunch of creators,

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.420
and now Melvin and David will
correct me quickly on this,

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.900
but I don't think, you
guys don't write songs just

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.480
because there's copyright,
you don't create --

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.810
, well maybe you
do, I don't know.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.250
So in other words if you say
oh my gosh I am not going

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.060
to become a songwriter if
there were not copyright?

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.680
&gt;&gt; David: Yeah but I don't think
you do album eight or nine.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.210
&gt;&gt; Sean: True, right [laughter],

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.380
so there's a role
for it, exactly.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.670
And then the question becomes
how do you get it all financed?

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.280
But the point here
is that I think a lot

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.490
of people now realize that is
copyright as only an incentive

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.720
to create probably doesn't
tell the whole story.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.750
It's a big part of the story
but it's not the complete story.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.080
And so if you look
at the history

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.450
of the term publication
going back to Roman period

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.340
"publicari," it was
making a public commitment.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.050
And so what I think has
become invisible to us

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.290
in the social media age
where people blur the line

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:00.510
between public and private.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.900
We tweet everything out.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.020
We Instagram everything out.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.500
Snapchat everything out.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.690
But think about if you are
a creator, and this is true

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.010
for a creative artists and
even for us wonky academics,

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.790
when you finally say, and I'm
looking at the journal students

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.900
over there, okay you guys, and
I have stuff I've published

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.390
with them, they always
send me, "is it final?

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.890
Are you going to
give us the sign off?

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:21.700
Can we release, can
we publish this now?"

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.740
That's a fraught moment
because if I say something wrong

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.720
in there, I didn't catch a
typo, it comes back to haunt me.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.010
And so now on the performance
side, on the improv side,

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:34.170
sometimes the rough edges around
it can be exactly what you want.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.850
But in the finished artifact
side it's often not what

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:39.150
you want.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.090
You're trying to get a
very particular thing.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.660
So what does this
mean for moral rights?

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.510
Well, first moral rights is
important because we angst a lot

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.910
about is it good
enough to be published,

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.470
to be publicly released?

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.630
And second, without
getting too maudlin,

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.490
but in the world we live
in today you have a lot

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.740
of potential risk and liability
for things you publicly put

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.450
out there as creators.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.070
We don't have to give specific
examples, but just think

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.540
about that in the world today.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.260
And so the notion of integrity.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.630
What if somebody takes
my carefully constructed

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.990
"here's what I really
meant to put out there"

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.210
and they change it and
my name is still on it?

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.500
And now suddenly that could get
me just professional problems,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.370
or it could get me physical
harm kind of problems.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.010
Can't I then get my
name taken off it?

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.120
Or can't I just withdraw
the work entirely

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.050
if I realize that's
not what I want

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.170
to publicly commit to anymore?

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.410
Okay, so that's my main point.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.940
Second point is that I think,

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.310
and I like that Professor
Ginsberg was starting to open

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.750
up that door and talk
about work-made-for-hire,

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.030
because that's going
to be I think one

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.850
of the biggest problems
for meshing in or bringing

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.990
in a full moral right system
into the U.S. copyright system.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.220
Our work made for hire is
based on the economic basis

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.780
of our copyright system,

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.180
so it means the economic
employer can be the author

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.800
for purposes of copyright
statute.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.180
But there's another sense
of work-made-for-hire

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.650
where you have -- ,
and this goes back

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.500
to actually continental
precedents going back

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.300
into the Renaissance period
where you have the great artiste

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.710
who directs people
and usually then his,

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.690
but it could be her studio,
and they actually implement.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.790
They execute on things.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.500
So you know we know the
case is about how you decide

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.640
who is an author and who
is not but that's going

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.280
to become I think incredibly
important as you think

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.440
about then bringing in a
fuller moral right system

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.140
if that's something
you want to do.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.720
With that I'll turn
it over to Scott.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:30.840
&gt;&gt; Scott Turow: Great.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.520
Well thank you all.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.830
My acquaintance with moral
rights began what is now a long

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:48.020
time ago when I was thrilled to
get a draft of a movie contract

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:52.150
for the rights to "Presumed
Innocent" and my life had gone

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.660
through an extraordinary
transformation.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.950
I had written "Presumed
Innocent"

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.100
on the morning commuter train
and finished it in my basement

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:07.290
and all of a sudden, literally,
I was that proverbial person

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.650
in the creative world who
gets struck by lightning.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.380
And in the process
the movie rights

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.730
to the book were purchased.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.450
A draft contract arrives
and of course it says

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:25.440
that among the rights I
am selling are my right

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.830
to make a claim based
on droit morale,

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.040
and I'm sure people are
fainting all over the room

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:37.110
of my French accent
[laughter], or moral rights.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.180
So I called my lawyer
and I said,

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.690
"well what are moral rights?"

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.340
And he said, "well it
has got nothing to do

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.510
with you, you're an American."

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:50.050
[ Laughter ]

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.510
But I've always been
conscious of the concept just

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.570
because I've been
through law school.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:30:00.680
I never took a copyright
class, but the notion just

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.020
because of the term
appeal to me.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:09.410
And there is -- , we recognize
creative work as standing

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:14.810
on some kind of different
platform than other products

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.360
in the marketplace,
because of the intimacy

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.010
of the creative act.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:25.970
And for lack of any other term,

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.970
artists traditionally
are believed

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.640
to have put a little
bit of their soul

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.620
into whatever they create,
whether it's what they paint

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.410
or the songs they compose,
the sculptures they make

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:49.060
or for artists and authors the
productions that come from them.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:54.240
And I think we do have the right
to assert that there is a kind

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.790
of specialness in creative
work and that is recognized

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:03.670
in terms of moral rights.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.900
Everybody here has
talked generally

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.490
about the right of attribution.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:13.760
I sit here on what is a sad
day for the Authors Guild

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.390
of which I was once president.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.820
Our long-running
fight with Google

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:25.490
over the Google Books project
is officially over today.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:29.540
The Supreme Court refused
to grant cert in the case.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.320
And I doubt there are
any people in the room

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.480
who need a long-winded
explanation of what was involved

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.690
in the Google Books case.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:45.650
And it's certainly true
that our opposition was

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.220
fundamentally economic.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.890
The notion that a large
corporate entity could decide

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:55.280
on its own to take and
copy an authors work,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.680
not change a single word of
it, offer no new expression

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.990
and still make the
entire work available

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.570
through selective display

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:13.640
of so-called snippets
seemed fundamentally wrong.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.840
But we've lost that fight.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:25.140
But the moral rights issues
still remain in that discussion.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.540
And just by way of example,

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.960
at one point we had reached
a settlement with Google

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.360
which was one of
those situations

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.020
where the Justice
Department came in

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.500
and disagreed with both sides.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.330
And I still, of course, disagree

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.010
with the Justice
Department about this.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:49.650
But we found in our own
membership substantial

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.230
opposition to the settlement.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:57.580
Not overriding, and what
were they objecting to?

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:03.300
They believed, they didn't like
the idea of Google coming in

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.240
and just taking their work.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.460
They didn't want it
displayed on Google.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.840
And even though we
argued that the settlement

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.890
in fact would give them
the right to opt out

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.630
and withdraw their work,

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.330
they found it fundamentally
offensive.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:23.350
Now songwriters don't
exist in that world.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.250
They have a compulsory
licensing system.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:31.960
Other people of course,
objected to Google books

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.490
because of the right
of integrity.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.860
They didn't like the idea

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:42.640
that there was this robot
being created that would deal

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.190
with their books selectively

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:50.330
and choose snippets
based on certain words.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:53.610
And certainly the right
to control publication

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:57.250
of your work is implicated
in this kind

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.020
of wholesale use and display.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:05.870
Rights of attribution of course
are important to authors too.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:08.760
It's rare to steal
an entire novel

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.660
and have somebody put
his or her name on it.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:19.520
But poets and essayists are in
this world of rampant plagiarism

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.390
of course, often
exposed to that.

00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:27.270
But all of these
concepts seem to me

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:32.080
to remain very much
relevant to the discussion

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.560
of the author's place
in the world, too.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.800
&gt;&gt;Kimberley: Okay, thank you.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.640
So I think I'm hearing a couple

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.030
of different themes
throughout this panel.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:46.400
One is that it's very hard
to separate the concept

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.210
of moral rights from the
concept of economic rights,

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:54.150
especially in situations where
your reputation has a lot to do

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:58.090
with the economic value
of what you're producing.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:01.040
And I'm also hearing that
there seems to be a lot

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.400
of consensus here

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.780
that attribution is a
relatively important moral right

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.240
for creators and for authors.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.530
But what I thought
was interesting

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.310
and we first started getting
into with Sean's discussion,

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:21.390
is sort of the more
reputational and other sort

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:26.040
of personal importance
of moral rights.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.130
And so I would like to hear
a little bit more from some

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.380
of the panelists, if
they'd like to speak on it,

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.670
about putting aside economic
rights-- not that you can,

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.590
you have to eat obviously
economic rights are important--

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:46.440
but how do things like, for
example Tom Petty being listed

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.260
as the author of your
song, sort of impact you

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:53.290
on a more reputational
or personal level?

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:57.480
Anyone want to take that on?

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.750
&gt;&gt; David: Well I'll say
that a lot of people thought

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.250
that we were playing
a cover after that,

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:06.350
which lowered our sort of
status in some weird way.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.420
So I mean that was
one of the things.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.200
But a lot of people object
to the uses of their songs

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.110
in certain kinds of commercials
and things like that,

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.930
and I know this is like
rights of publicity

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.240
and they crossed
into other realms.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.100
I'm pretty relaxed
about all of that.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.650
I mean if the San Francisco
Giants started using one

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.550
of my songs I'd have
a problem with that.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.620
[laughter] -

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.320
&gt;&gt; Kimberely: What
about politicians?

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.880
&gt;&gt; David: Well generally if
they stay away from homophobia,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.730
racism, certain key
things, I actually,

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.440
we have very diverse political
views in both of our bands

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:54.920
so we kind of let more use of
that happened than most bands.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.190
Am I being neutral enough?

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.940
&gt;&gt; Kimberley: Very
middle of the road -

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:09.160
&gt;&gt; David: Yes, so but that's an
issue -- , I don't know maybe -

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.580
&gt;&gt; Melvin: Well I mean
I think it's an odd-

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.370
&gt;&gt; David: I'm a collective
for musicians so -

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.190
&gt;&gt; Melvin: I'm more speaking for
friends of mine, I mean as far

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:23.160
as going back to thinking,
I hate to bring it back

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.350
to attribution even
though you're trying

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:25.340
to take it somewhere else.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.650
[laughter] But a
bunch of friends

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:31.080
of mine have been
sampled multiple times,

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.840
and it would be very
nice for people to know

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.350
that they are the actual people
that are playing on that record,

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:40.790
on the original songs.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.210
It would be nice for people
to know who the people

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.990
who did the original songs were

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:48.730
in a more comprehensive
way simply because,

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:50.980
thinking particularly of a
friend of mine who played

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.680
on an Edwin Birdsong song
that Daft Punk sample,

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.380
those guys are all still around.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.960
They could have just as
easily hired those guys

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.530
to come play the song again

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.570
and it would've been
better for everybody.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.740
So it bleeds into the whole

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.310
"what is creative
and what isn't."

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:13.100
Because to me in 2016 a lot of
these things that people default

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.030
to as creativity
tactics, they default

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:18.630
to because a certain
legal mechanism was set

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:24.520
up that drove things down a road
that was the road that it went

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.900
down because that was the
one that was the clear one.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.950
I think if some other
paths are cleared up,

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.490
we'll see different
kinds of creativity

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:37.480
and we'll see different
kinds of income generation.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:46.760
As far as effect on
reputation, yes it's interesting

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:53.890
because now I'm thinking
of some other people I know

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.240
who actually are in
a position to be able

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.130
to control their catalogs.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:03.920
And they've been pretty
adamant about policing use

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.800
and making sure that
people, hip-hop songs

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.520
that they don't approve of,
their music doesn't get on them.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.530
And I can also think
of quite a few people

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.510
as David alluded it goes into --
, it starts to bleed into right

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:22.960
of publicity, but I know
many people who have refused

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.150
to let their songs be used
in commercials for example.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.290
And I know that that's an issue
now for quite a few friends

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.850
of mine because of YouTube
and because of the fact

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:37.160
that now they spent their whole
career saying no to commercials,

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.000
and now whenever a commercial
pops up they have no control

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.620
over it, which is off-topic
to this conversation.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:48.800
But it's the basic idea
of yes you do spend --

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.220
, if your career was built on
"okay you have a certain level

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.340
of integrity" and
now everybody--

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.710
that's being assaulted--
then your reason,

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:01.990
the reason that people respected
you as an artist starts

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.960
to go away and it makes you
less valuable to your people

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.950
and less valuable to yourself.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.240
&gt;&gt; Sean: So I would add-- and
again maybe I'm just off base

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.770
because again I'm not as
talented as these guys

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.610
so my perspective, it might
be why I never became a famous

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:21.530
musician-- but so first, one as
a small side note about knowing

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.770
where the samples
come from and just

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:27.420
to plug hometown radio stations
KEXP did a deconstruction

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.280
of Paul's Boutique
where they went through,

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.480
they took an entire programming
day and went through the songs

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.980
and pulled out and played
the original entire song

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.830
that was sampled and
then gave the credit,

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:41.070
maybe not to every musician on
the array, but they got as close

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.400
as you could get so that's
incredibly important.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.470
That was cool to happen.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.180
What I think I was trying to
get at though with this kind

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.610
of final release of the
artifact and not is a lot

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:50.970
of what I think you
both are talking

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:54.560
about with integrity is
thinking about using your song

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.940
for political reasons,
things like that,

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.930
but what I'm really
trying to get at is,

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:01.200
you're still I think perhaps
thinking about the final release

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.970
that you authorize and then
what happens with it after that.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.730
So let me give a
hypothetical: You've signed

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.030
over all your rights to a label,

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.630
not to make the label
the bad guy or anything

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.530
but you've signed over -- , no,
no really I'm really not trying

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.030
to do that I'm just saying
for the hypothetical--

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.390
you gave all your rights away.

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:15.500
You had a bunch of
stuff that you're

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.360
in the studio wasn't quite up to
par that you would have released

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.270
and now they say the contract,
you're doing something else,

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.270
and they say okay "we're going
to release from the archives,"

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:25.180
and it's a bunch of
stuff you're like,

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.360
"I never would have
released that," so that's

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.510
in some ways what
I'm trying to get at.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.850
What you think about that?

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:30.900
&gt;&gt; Melvin: Well I mean just

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:37.190
on the never released I mean I
was known for back in the day

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:39.400
for being the guy who
would derail a contract

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.720
over those kinds of things
so for me I mean I think

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.710
in my whole career I've
definitely done less

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:51.230
than five works for hire and I
think it's two or three maximum.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.020
I just don't do it,
that's me personally.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.690
But it's interesting because
I kind of wanted to leave

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:58.800
that alone but since
we're coming back

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.580
to it it's the copyright
versus moral rights thing.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:07.310
Copyright is for everybody else
but moral rights is for us.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:11.310
When I make something it's
mine until you know about it.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.200
&gt;&gt; Sean: We would hope.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.520
&gt;&gt; Melvin: From the standpoint
of an artist it is a piece of --

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.050
, it's literally a
piece of property,

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:21.090
I mean it becomes virtual
property once it's printed

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.740
but when I'm thinking
about it it's mine.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.930
So it's kind of two
different conversations.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.750
I mean to me when we're talking
about copyright were talking

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:31.340
about okay what happens

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.460
when everybody else
starts to know about it.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:37.910
But the real basic thing
that is called moral rights,

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:43.680
to me that's -- , we get,
that's kind of intrinsic

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.140
and we make an agreement
with the rest of you all

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.180
that we are going to
give some of those

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.760
up so you all can hear it.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.260
But at the end of the day,
we try to figure out ways

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.480
to put it back in the
contract, some guys like me

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.030
who just won't do work-for-hire.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.070
Everybody's not as
militant about it as I am

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:03.460
and that's one reason I don't
work in LA, blah blah blah.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.880
[laughter] I don't so.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.330
But-- it's something,

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:13.030
it definitely impacts the
creativity of this country.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.960
I've just got to
leave it at that.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.640
&gt;&gt; Sean: So one last thing
to close the loop on that.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.040
So that for me is
Statute of Anne

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.370
and our earlier copyright act

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.970
where there was the stronger
public/private divide.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.220
The idea was you
create something,

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.860
you can control it
completely until it is ready

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.640
to be released because,
thank you Melvin,

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.080
and perhaps David agrees too,
it's very personal and until

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:40.120
that thing is ready you do
not want it getting out there.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.510
&gt;&gt; Kimberely: So I actually
have a question for Yoko.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:45.530
Are these types of issues
ones that are important

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.760
to the photographers that
Getty Images works with?

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:55.420
Do you help them enforce rights
of attribution in addition to,

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.960
obviously, the initiatives that
Getty has come up with to try

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.370
to embed and provide for social
sharing, but are these types

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:07.520
of concerns like "I really don't
want my photograph appearing

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.680
on this type of website or
in this type of concept."?

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.730
&gt;&gt; Yoko: The integrity
issues are really interesting

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.650
particularly because we really
sit and broker the relationship

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:18.950
between the artists and
essentially the people licensing

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.500
or purchasing content.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.570
And we handle it contractually,
as you would imagine,

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.970
but the stock photography
industry is built

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.950
on "somebody takes your
picture and customizes it

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:31.180
and modifies it and
uses it in a way

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.180
that suits their particular
need" eliminating the need

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.120
to shoot custom content.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:42.020
But what comes with that is
obviously these absolutely human

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:46.840
personal decisions and opinions
and thoughts about what is

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.940
and is not acceptable.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.930
We're pretty clear about
those conversations

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:52.600
with our contributing
photographers

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.670
around you know we asked
you really aren't able

00:44:55.670 --> 00:45:00.150
to exercise your moral rights
with respect to particular uses.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.320
Yes, we have mechanisms
to say okay no use

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.820
in tobacco, no use in alcohol.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.070
We have the ability and the
means to honor those types

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.300
of restrictions but
once you really put it

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.090
out into the distribution sort

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:17.890
of ecosystem there is
this understood exchange,

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:22.110
a contractual exchange around
what you can or can't control.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.870
And notwithstanding sort of an
open dialogue and transparency

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.820
about that you just never know
what's really going to hit you

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.770
and what's quite personal.

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:31.860
And we've seen some really
interesting issues come up,

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.670
and we do have to deal with
those on a one-off basis and try

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:35.660
to find that middle ground.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:36.550
And sometimes that means

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:38.750
that photographer
wants to pull content.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:41.600
But if a campaign is
run, a campaign is run.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.030
So you do see those
and we do sort of stand

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.040
in the middle again trying

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.030
to broker what is the best
solution for each side here.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.850
And I think it's really --

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:55.670
, people are so creative you
just can never know what they're

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:59.370
going to come out with, and
it may be absolutely offensive

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:00.910
to some, it may not be.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:04.760
I mean it is sort of what
makes it interesting.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.080
But again to that
private/public, we just sort

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.880
of wait in the middle
and see what happens.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.510
But what I'll go back

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.650
to is really I do think
technology has solutions

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:19.880
to offer in the space that have
yet to be really fully explored.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.550
And when we talk about
control and when I think

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.030
about online it really
truly is the reflection

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:32.800
of those control mechanisms
within the 1s and 0s.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.340
So I'm not sure that
answers that question, Kim.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:41.180
&gt;&gt; Kimberley: So does anyone
else on the panel have thoughts

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:48.710
about sort of ways to manage
these issues about solutions,

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:53.880
or is it just a problem that
is inherent in the nature

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.700
of internet distribution?

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.690
&gt;&gt; David: Well I mean I feel

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:06.990
like sometimes we frame
the whole question wrong.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:10.990
Like we are sort of worrying
about the rights of like a group

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:18.710
of consumers or an industry
or a preferred technology.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:23.570
But rights only vest
in the individual.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:29.830
And I don't think me asserting
my rights if it breaks

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:32.240
or wrecks a certain technology,

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.390
then it wasn't a good enough
technology in the first place

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:36.140
and it should die [laughter].

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.860
I mean think about what we lose?

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:46.480
How did we get this turned
around so backwards that we have

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.570
to pick winners and losers
in the technology world?

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:56.240
If the internet is the most
wonderful thing ever it should

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.580
be able to withstand me
asserting my moral rights.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.920
Right?

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:07.820
&gt;&gt;Melvin: Well I mean the thing
I always say is that this idea

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:12.830
that information should be
free theoretically also applies

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.980
to your bank information.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.070
But nobody has any problem

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:19.610
with having their bank
information locked down.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:23.400
So it becomes a question
of what --

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.420
, going back to what I said
earlier what people want

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:31.020
to build and what
people need to build.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:36.950
It's not theoretically
as Yoko said earlier,

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:40.620
I mean her pictures go
up with the metadata on

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:45.150
and then magically the
metadata disappears so the fact

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:51.240
that that happens is because
there was nothing built -

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.360
&gt;&gt; Yoko: We allowed
it to happen -

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.740
&gt;&gt; Melvin: To allow
it to remain.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.260
Or you know I don't want
to put it the other way

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.640
but you know the
implication is there.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.700
So I think as I said earlier
there are going to have

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.570
to be some affirmative
forcing of people's hands

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:09.460
to enforce community,
unfortunately.

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.280
Because people are just
going to build according

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.570
to what they can get
away with building.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.070
&gt;&gt; Kimberely: So Scott
you've been kind of quiet.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.990
Do you have any concluding
thoughts before we go

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:19.830
to audience questions?

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:23.200
&gt;&gt; Scott: Again I'm sitting
here thinking about all

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.200
of these issues as they apply
to authors, and of course,

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:36.470
you know our problems have
to do with theft, piracy,

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.430
which is I'm sure a
problem across the board.

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:45.860
And I'm also thinking
about the fact

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:50.910
that it would probably
behoove us, those who try

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:57.260
to be author's representatives
as well as authors,

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:01.520
to explain this in
the personal terms,

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.660
which I think moral
rights implicate

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.880
and the way Melvin's
been talking about it,

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:11.640
that you know yes it's property.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:15.660
You're stealing property
but it's property plus.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:20.770
Creative work always has been
and moral rights recognizes

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:27.360
that plus aspect
to creative work.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.580
And I think it's important

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:35.520
because it's not
just being ripped off

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:42.140
by the pirate it's the personal
insult that goes with it.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.220
Because look my books
are in the library.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.440
People can go read them
for free, and I love that.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:52.540
But that's because I chose
to participate in that system

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.300
and I didn't choose to
participate in a system

00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:02.330
where somebody else is going
to take control of my work.

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.760
&gt;&gt; Kimberely: Okay so
we have about 10 minutes

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.990
for audience questions.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.700
&gt;&gt; Audience: I have
a question for Scott.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.490
How do you feel about
fan fiction?

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:23.710
&gt;&gt; Scott: You know I think it's
pretty interesting, personally,

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:29.860
and you know you can't
deal with this globally.

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:34.350
It depends on exactly
what is being done

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:39.600
and what exactly is being
appropriated and then what kind

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.820
of use gets made of it.

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:50.100
But what I like about the
moral rights discussion is

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.770
that it involves us

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:59.010
in discussing the spiritual
element of creative work.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.640
I know when I write
something that it's going

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:07.090
to be meaningful, I hope, to an
audience and that they are going

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:10.650
to take it in and make use

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:14.580
of that imaginative
experience in their own way.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:20.610
So fan fiction is
part of that process.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:27.750
Again, it's complicated and it
becomes particularly complicated

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:34.330
if somebody is trying to make
economic use of something

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:36.460
that I want to control.

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:47.420
But you know the notion of it
it actually does appeal to me.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:49.920
&gt;&gt; Melvin: I want
to just kind of tag

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.530
onto Scott's comments
a little bit.

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:54.750
I mean it seems people
have to remember

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:58.240
that we all started
off learning,

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.300
and we all started off
copying other people.

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:06.720
Creative people in general
are not against emulation.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.800
We're not against remix.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.820
We're not against any of that.

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:14.180
What we are against is this
distance that's been put

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.090
in between us and the
community of people

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:19.280
who would want to emulate us.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.860
You know it's like the person
who told me how to play bass,

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.820
I learned, I was copying
him but then I was going

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.310
to his house every week.

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:31.340
The people that I was
listening to their records,

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.400
there was a relationship beyond
just okay there's a website

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.000
and the website is
scraping my data.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.540
And I think that
to solve that is--

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.990
we kind of have to go backwards.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:46.060
And that's why I think the moral
rights conversation is actually

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:50.240
applicable in this era.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.480
&gt;&gt; Audience: Question
for David and Melvin,

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.910
as I'm sure you know Section 115
of the Copyright Act provides

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.840
for a compulsory license that
once you've written a song

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.970
that anyone else without
your permission can go ahead

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:04.170
and record a cover version.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:05.680
Do you like that?

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.230
Does it bother you?

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.690
Do you think it bothers
most songwriters, composers?

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:10.490
&gt;&gt; Melvin: We are about to
go all Worldwide Wrestling

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:14.620
Federation with me
and [laughter].

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:23.080
It's two things that
don't go together.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.070
I mean I am of two
minds over this.

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:30.880
I mean our organization
is pro-compulsory license.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.210
The reason we are
pro-compulsory license--

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:36.520
but there is a very
strong caveat with that,

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:41.140
which is from our and the
issue is that there has

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:46.350
to be fair market
rate paid when a piece

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:50.470
of our creativity is used.

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:55.200
The reason I can support that is

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:00.630
because as I was saying earlier
we all start off learning

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.270
from other people.

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:07.060
And for me, balanced in the
context of American culture,

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.720
I hate to bring that
up, I hate to separate,

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:18.170
I feel that it allows
for creativity.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:23.130
Having said that,
I 100% understand.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:26.270
I'm 100% for autonomy.

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:30.890
And in a perfect universe,

00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:34.100
I think that I would
probably go a different way,

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.940
but with the laws
that we have now

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.630
and the way this
country is structured,

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:40.920
our organization feels

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.500
that compulsory is
what we would support.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:52.510
&gt;&gt; David: What was the
section of that act [laughter]?

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:56.450
I mean I feel pretty much
the same way Melvin does.

00:55:56.450 --> 00:56:02.210
I mean I think people forget
though you can cover a song

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:05.460
in a venue and it's covered by
a blanket license and in theory

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:12.360
that whole process was--
until the DOJ stepped in--

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:16.210
it largely took place
in the private market.

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:18.960
I see that there
are other countries

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.690
that don't have compulsory
licenses,

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:24.590
but that have private market
solutions or free market more

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:29.850
or less solutions to trying
to license compulsories

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:31.320
for covers and stuff like that.

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:37.730
The problem with the
compulsory licenses is the

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.280
economic problem.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.770
I think most people don't mind
having their songs covered.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:48.720
So I'm against the
compulsory license

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.600
because it's essentially
a subsidy for --

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.480
, mostly because it
ends up being a subsidy

00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:01.980
for winners the government
has picked in advance,

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:07.570
technology companies, even large
media companies previously.

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:12.000
So I would rather not have it.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.130
&gt;&gt; Kimberely: Okay I
think this is going

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:15.370
to be our last question.

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:17.830
&gt;&gt; Jane Ginsburg: Thanks, I'd
like to ask you the question

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:22.410
that I was asked at the end of
my talk before lunch, which is,

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:27.970
you've spoken eloquently about
what moral rights mean for you

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:32.000
but how is that in
the public interest?

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.010
&gt;&gt; David: I don't know if --

00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:42.180
, moral rights how is it
in the public interest?

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.670
&gt;&gt; Jane: So the question
that I was asked at the end

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.940
of my talk this is very nice
all the good things to say

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:50.780
about attribution rights but
what's in it for the public?

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.390
The implication of
the question being

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:57.140
that there is an opposition
between the interest

00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:00.120
of the author in
being recognized

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.030
and the economic benefits that
might flow from that as well

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:07.010
as the psychological
benefits, but to the extent

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:11.100
that attribution rights
might make the dissemination

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.540
of the work more difficult
because you get bogged

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.150
down in trying to find
out who is the author

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:20.480
and identify the author so
we have less dissemination

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:23.440
of the work to the public.

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:28.600
What's the argument from
the author, as an author?

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.560
I gave the law professor
answer [laughter] -

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.000
&gt;&gt; [Name]: Okay,
pretty good answer.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.400
&gt;&gt; Jane: What as authors can you
say about why recognizing you

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.670
as the creators of your
work, why is that good

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:45.230
for the public in general?

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:50.300
&gt;&gt; Can I take a quick
swipe at that one?

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:58.850
I believe that all of the rules
and laws we have are aimed

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:02.120
at stimulating creative
activity.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:09.610
And if your work can be taken
without attribution, it,

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:15.510
to some, is going to be a
disincentive to doing it.

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:21.100
And again you know as
somebody who's privileged

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:27.720
to have wide readership,
and who doesn't pass a day

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:34.150
without getting fan mail, you
know I feel blessed by that,

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:35.960
by the relationship
that I've entered

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.880
into with all of those people.

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:46.130
And if you told me-- leaving
aside the incredible good

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:48.990
fortune financially
that I've also enjoyed--

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:52.810
that that could be
taken away from me

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:58.590
because attribution would
no longer be required,

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.120
that would be a huge loss.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.230
It would change the meaning
of authorship and I'm sure

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:08.180
for many authors
and other creators

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.950
that it's a disincentive.

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:14.670
If you're saying that
there are certain mishaps

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:17.910
in the internet world
that we all know

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:22.030
about where attribution
gets lost that's one thing,

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:24.440
but if you're saying
that attribution

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.160
in general is no longer
going to be a right

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.490
that we value I truly believe

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:38.190
that you have diminished
the glory of authorship.

01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:40.480
&gt;&gt; Sean: I'll take a slightly
different crack if I could

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.880
at that which is I agree
with that, but I also think

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.560
that what it gets you is it
gets you that public sphere,

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.480
that public discourse.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.600
And that's what I was trying
to really hone in on today,

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.040
is that we had at
times in the past,

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.960
as Professor Ginsburg
knows, that with a lot

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.770
of scientific societies
going back

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:57.180
into the early scientific
revolution,

01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.530
and yes copyright was important

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:01.510
on the science side not just
creative arts, it was a lot

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:05.310
of manuscript culture of things
being circulated privately

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:07.840
and partly because people
weren't ready to take that stand

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.130
and they needed some
other incentives to do it.

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.080
So what does moral rights
and attribution gets you?

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.420
Well it's what copyright
gets you as well.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.970
It gets people putting
their stuff

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.920
out there publicly releasing
it not necessarily free

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.930
economically, but
putting it out there

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:22.750
so it could be a
robust public discourse.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:26.620
&gt;&gt; Melvin: I would tag onto
that I mean going somewhere

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:28.630
that I wouldn't rarely
go in public,

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:30.150
going a little Darwinian.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:36.280
I think that in attribution you
might actually have a situation

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.020
where the best people win.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.480
I mean I talked to a
couple of friends of mine

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.190
who were professional
ghostwriters.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:47.150
Nobody really wanted to share a
song so I'm just going to have

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.970
to riff one of my own on this

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:52.830
but ghostwriting is not a
new thing but who knows,

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:55.070
who knows if the person
who actually was painting

01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:56.890
for Rembrandt maybe
that's the person

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.320
who should have been famous.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.100
Because we don't have
attribution we'll never

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.600
really know.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.660
I think, and in the context
of the music business,

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:08.410
the way the music business
is in 2016, I know that a lot

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:13.370
of people go uncredited
that are propping up a lot

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:20.080
of other people's careers and
I think that it would be better

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.790
for the people of
the world if some

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:23.890
of these talented people
actually got to get out from

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:26.540
under these other people and got
known for what they were doing.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.120
It would make the
music world better.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:28.610
It just would.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:34.240
&gt;&gt; David: You mean change
a word, earn a third?

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.170
&gt;&gt; Kim: Okay, well I think
that's all the time we have.

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:42.510
Thank you so much to
all of our panelists.
