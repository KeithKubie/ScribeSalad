vertical edge detector in this video you
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.160
vertical edge detector in this video you
learn the difference between positive

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
learn the difference between positive
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.020
learn the difference between positive
and negative edges that is the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
and negative edges that is the
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.240
and negative edges that is the
difference between light to dark versus

you saw from a previous video we have

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
you saw from a previous video we have
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.920
you saw from a previous video we have
this image six by six test light on the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
this image six by six test light on the
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.450
this image six by six test light on the

darker on the left and brighter on the
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.840
darker on the left and brighter on the
right so the tins are now on the right

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
right so the tins are now on the right
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.790
right so the tins are now on the right
half of the image and the zeros on the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
half of the image and the zeros on the
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.580
half of the image and the zeros on the
Left if you convolve it with the same

edge detection filter you end up with

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
edge detection filter you end up with
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.370
edge detection filter you end up with
negative thirties instead of thirty down

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
negative thirties instead of thirty down
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.440
negative thirties instead of thirty down
the middle and you can plot that as a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
the middle and you can plot that as a
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.920

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
shows that this is a dok2 light rather
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.050
shows that this is a dok2 light rather
than the light to dark transition and if

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
than the light to dark transition and if

you don't care which of these two cases

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
you don't care which of these two cases
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310
you don't care which of these two cases
it is you could take absolute values of

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
it is you could take absolute values of
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.120
it is you could take absolute values of
this hump output matrix but this

particular filter does make a difference

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
particular filter does make a difference
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.350
particular filter does make a difference
between the light to dark versus the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
between the light to dark versus the
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.069
between the light to dark versus the
dolphin light edges let's see some more

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
dolphin light edges let's see some more
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.039

examples of edge detection this 3x3

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
examples of edge detection this 3x3
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.139
examples of edge detection this 3x3
filter we've seen allows you to take

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
filter we've seen allows you to take
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.380
filter we've seen allows you to take
vertical edges so maybe it should not

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
vertical edges so maybe it should not
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.990
vertical edges so maybe it should not
surprise you too much that this 3x3

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
surprise you too much that this 3x3
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580
surprise you too much that this 3x3
filter will allow you to detect

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
filter will allow you to detect
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.240
filter will allow you to detect
horizontal edges so as a reminder a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
horizontal edges so as a reminder a
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.399
horizontal edges so as a reminder a
vertical edge according to this filter

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
vertical edge according to this filter
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.350
vertical edge according to this filter
is a three by three region where the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
is a three by three region where the
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450
is a three by three region where the
pixels are relatively bright on the left

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
pixels are relatively bright on the left
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.789
pixels are relatively bright on the left
part and relatively dark on the right

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
part and relatively dark on the right
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.040
part and relatively dark on the right
part so similarly a horizontal edge

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
part so similarly a horizontal edge
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.320
part so similarly a horizontal edge
would be if the event the region where

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
would be if the event the region where
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.700
would be if the event the region where
the pixels are relative

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
the pixels are relative
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.270
the pixels are relative
great on top and relatively dark in the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
great on top and relatively dark in the
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.850
great on top and relatively dark in the
bottom row so here's one example this is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
bottom row so here's one example this is
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.670
bottom row so here's one example this is
a more complex one where you have here

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
a more complex one where you have here
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.200
a more complex one where you have here
tins in the upper left and lower right

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210
tins in the upper left and lower right
 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.390
tins in the upper left and lower right
hand corner so we draw this as an image

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
hand corner so we draw this as an image
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.660
hand corner so we draw this as an image
this be an image which is going to be

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670
this be an image which is going to be
 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.550
this be an image which is going to be
darker you know where they're zeros

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
darker you know where they're zeros
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830
darker you know where they're zeros
someone's shaded in the darker regions

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
someone's shaded in the darker regions
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.800
someone's shaded in the darker regions
and then lighter India upper left and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
and then lighter India upper left and
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.170
and then lighter India upper left and
lower right hand corners and if you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
lower right hand corners and if you
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.630
lower right hand corners and if you
convolve this with a horizontal edge

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
convolve this with a horizontal edge
 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.800
convolve this with a horizontal edge
detector you end up with this and so

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
detector you end up with this and so
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.650
detector you end up with this and so
just to take a couple of examples this

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
just to take a couple of examples this
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.180
just to take a couple of examples this
30 here corresponds to this 3x3 region

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190
30 here corresponds to this 3x3 region
 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.060
30 here corresponds to this 3x3 region
where indeed there are bright pixels on

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070
where indeed there are bright pixels on
 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.670
where indeed there are bright pixels on
top and darker pixels on the bottom it's

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680
top and darker pixels on the bottom it's
 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.910
top and darker pixels on the bottom it's
kind of over here and so it finds a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920
kind of over here and so it finds a
 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.600
kind of over here and so it finds a
strong positive edge there and this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
strong positive edge there and this
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.990
strong positive edge there and this
negative 30 here corresponds to this

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000
negative 30 here corresponds to this
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.780
negative 30 here corresponds to this
region which is actually brighter on the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
region which is actually brighter on the
 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.050
region which is actually brighter on the
bottom and darker on top so that is a

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060
bottom and darker on top so that is a
 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.920
bottom and darker on top so that is a
negative edge in this example and again

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930
negative edge in this example and again
 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.500
negative edge in this example and again
as a this is kind of an artifact of the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510
as a this is kind of an artifact of the
 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.360
as a this is kind of an artifact of the
fact that we're working with relatively

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
fact that we're working with relatively
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.660
fact that we're working with relatively
small images you know that this is just

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670
small images you know that this is just
 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.050
small images you know that this is just
a 6x6 image but decent immediate values

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
a 6x6 image but decent immediate values
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.240
a 6x6 image but decent immediate values
like this minus 10 for example just

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250
like this minus 10 for example just
 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.700
like this minus 10 for example just
reflects the fact that that filter here

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710
reflects the fact that that filter here
 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.160
reflects the fact that that filter here
it captures part of the positive edge on

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170
it captures part of the positive edge on
 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.310
it captures part of the positive edge on
the left and part of the negative edge

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320
the left and part of the negative edge
 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.660
the left and part of the negative edge
on the right and so blending those

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670
on the right and so blending those
 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.280
on the right and so blending those
together gives you something to mediate

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290
together gives you something to mediate
 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.220
together gives you something to mediate
value but if this is a very large say a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230
value but if this is a very large say a
 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.920
value but if this is a very large say a
thousand by thousand image with this

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
thousand by thousand image with this
 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.660
thousand by thousand image with this
type of you know checkerboard pattern

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670
type of you know checkerboard pattern
 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.880
type of you know checkerboard pattern
then you won't see these these

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890
then you won't see these these
 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.220
then you won't see these these
transition regions of the tens the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230
transition regions of the tens the
 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.290
transition regions of the tens the
intermediate values would be quite small

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300
intermediate values would be quite small
 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.440
intermediate values would be quite small
relative to the size of the image so in

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450
relative to the size of the image so in
 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.470
relative to the size of the image so in
summary different filters allow you to

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480
summary different filters allow you to
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.310
summary different filters allow you to
find vertical and horizontal edges it

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320
find vertical and horizontal edges it
 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.790
find vertical and horizontal edges it
turns out that the 3 by 3 vertical edge

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800
turns out that the 3 by 3 vertical edge
 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.580
turns out that the 3 by 3 vertical edge
detection filter reviews is just one

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590

possible choice and historically in the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870
possible choice and historically in the
 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.780
possible choice and historically in the
computer vision literature there was a

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790
computer vision literature there was a
 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.670
computer vision literature there was a
fair amount of debate about what is the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680
fair amount of debate about what is the
 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.070
fair amount of debate about what is the
best set of numbers to use so here's

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080
best set of numbers to use so here's
 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.450
best set of numbers to use so here's
something else you could use which is

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
something else you could use which is
 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.670
something else you could use which is
maybe 1 2 1 0 0 0 minus 1 minus 2 minus

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.150
1 this is called a sobel filter and the
advantage of this is it you know puts a

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160
advantage of this is it you know puts a
 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.950
advantage of this is it you know puts a
little bit more weight to the central

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
little bit more weight to the central
 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.999
little bit more weight to the central
role the central pixel and this makes it

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009
role the central pixel and this makes it
 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.670
role the central pixel and this makes it
maybe a little bit more robust but

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680
maybe a little bit more robust but
 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.529
maybe a little bit more robust but

different properties and this is just

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849
different properties and this is just
 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.790
