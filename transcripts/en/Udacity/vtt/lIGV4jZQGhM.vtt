00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] The next question checks that you understand one-time pads.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Alice and Bob have agreed on a perfectly random key

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that Alice will send Bob the answer to the question, "Are you taking CS 387?"

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
As either the single character Y or the single character N.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This will be encoded using the string to bits procedure,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which takes in a string and gives you a list of bits,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the results of string to bits Y is 1011001,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the route for N is 1001110.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mallory knows nothing about the key or the message,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but she intercepts the transmission between Alice and Bob,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and intercepts this sequence of bits,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and Mallory wants to cause trouble between Alice and Bob.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
She wants to make Bob hear the opposite of what Alice sent

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so if Alice sent a Y, Mallory wants Bob to hear an N.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If Alice sent an N, Mallory wants Bob to hear a Y.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What should Mallory send instead of the original message that she intercepted,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and your answer should be in the form of 7 bits, each of which is a 0 or a 1.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Once you understand the answer to this,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I want to encourage you to join an open discussion question, which is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is there a way to solve this problem without using anything other than a one-time pad?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Is there a way for Alice and Bob to communicate correctly the answer to this question

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and know that it can't be altered in transmission and still preserve all the privacy properties of a one-time pad?
