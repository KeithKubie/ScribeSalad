00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:03.133
[applause]

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.567
Gibbs: Great.
Thanks, Andrew.

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:05.834
You know, that was
a pretty cool demo.

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.701
But actually, I'd like
to take that up a notch

00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.234
and show you something that I
think is even more impressive.

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:12.033
So what I'm gonna do now

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.400
is I'd like to call up
Jay and Animesh from IBM.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.834
And what they're gonna do

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:17.834
is they're gonna take
the same App

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:19.300
that you just saw Andrew
write,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.033
the same Guest Book App,

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.968
and without modifying
a line of code,

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:25.667
they're gonna deploy that App
on premise

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.033
to the IBM WebSphere
application server

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.367
that's right on this box here.

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:32.667
So, guys, have at it.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.634
Subrahmonia: Thanks, Kevin.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.467
Hi. I'm Jay Subrahmonia,

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:39.234
and I'm the Director
for IBM Cloud Labs team

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:41.934
in our software group
strategy organization.

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:44.067
And as Kevin mentioned,

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:45.901
many of our Enterprise customers

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.767
typically want to run
the Java code

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:49.567
within the corporate firewall.

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:50.901
But they all want
the flexibility

00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:53.734
of actually being able
to move their applications

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.467
between different environments

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.868
so that they get ready
for change

00:00:57.868 --> 00:00:59.267
if they decide to make a change

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.300
for technical
or business reasons.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.400
So today, Animesh and I
are going to demonstrate

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.868
how following standard Java 
APIs and libraries

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:11.234
allows our Enterprise customers
to do precisely that.

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:13.734
Now, most of our
Enterprise customers

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:16.501
typically use WebSphere
as their application server,

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.267
DB2 as a database,

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:20.968
and Tivoli LDAP
to store user information

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:25.234
Now, WebSphere actually
is a full J2EE container.

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:26.868
But today in our demonstration,

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:29.734
we are going to be using it
in its most basic form,

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.934
which is as a servlet container.

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:35.167
And there are many servlet
containers in the market today.

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:38.133
You see App Engine, which
is an example of another one,

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.334
and there are others
in the marketplace.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.400
But what we're going
to show you today

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.000
is how following Java standards

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.501
allows our users to
deploy code in one environment

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:52.434
and seamlessly move it to others

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:54.601
with making
very minimal changes.

00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:57.701
So I'm going to invite Animesh,
my colleague here,

00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.467
to show you this in action.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.067
And we're going to demonstrate
in the context

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:02.667
of the same
Guest Book application

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.167
that Andrew showed you

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:06.734
and using WebSphere
and App Engine

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:08.701
as the two servlet containers

00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.167
to do the migration
from one to the other.

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:12.534
Thanks.
Singh: Thanks, Jay.

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:14.501
Hello, everybody,
my name is Animesh Singh,

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.901
And I'm the Lead Architect
and Developer at IBM Cloud Labs.

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:19.367
So as Jay mentioned,

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:20.968
when you are building
a web application,

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:22.834
certain technical features
of business tools

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:25.467
may require you to move
between different environments.

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.067
But since all these containers
and databases

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:30.801
can work with standard Java APIs
and libraries,

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:33.200
redeploying from Google App
Engine to WebSphere

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.000
requires no code changes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.534
Let me show you.

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:39.734
So here I have
the exact same code

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:42.701
which Andrew used to run
his Guest Book Application.

00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:46.601
What I am going to do is just
make a few config changes,

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:49.801
so this is the JDO config
or XML file.

00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.767
So this information
which you have here

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:56.300
is specific to Google App
Engine, and it's commented out.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.334
It just needs to be replaced
with this information

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:00.534
which is specific to DB2.

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:02.000
And if you see,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.801
the information which we are
giving to this config file

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:07.100
is that this is a connection URL
for the DB2.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.667
This is the connection
driver name,

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.367
DB2 user name,
and DB2 password.

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:14.300
And that's pretty much
what you need to change

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.033
in the config settings,

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:19.968
and then you need to add
a few extra Java files...

00:03:19.968 --> 00:03:22.234
which are basically DB2
driver files.

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:24.033
So DB2 JASC Java file

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:26.367
and the corresponding
license file.

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:27.734
And that's it.

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:30.367
With that done, I have
the exact same application

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:32.200
running on this over here

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.834
which is running IBM WebSphere
and DB2.

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:38.100
Let me go to the
verticle URL.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.734
So you will see
the exact same code,

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:43.267
same application
which Andrew showed you.

00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:47.200
And I show you that you can do
the exact same things.

00:04:08.901 --> 00:04:10.701
And that's it.

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:13.100
With that done, what I have
just shown you is

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.334
that thanks to standard
Java APIs and libraries,

00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:16.701
writing an application

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:19.000
which can be moved from Google
App engine to WebSphere

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.501
is very easy.

00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:23.000
Finally, my team wanted
to make it even easier

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.834
for App Engine developers

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:26.400
to deploy their code
to WebSphere.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.100
So we have implemented
a number of lower level

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.834
App Engine specific APIs
and tools.

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:32.534
In fact, starting tomorrow,

00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:34.601
developers can utilize
App Engines, users,

00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.133
and data store APIs

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:38.701
to interface with Tivoli LDAP
and IBM DB2.

00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:41.067
And it will be available
at the following URL.

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:42.567
Thanks.

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:44.567
