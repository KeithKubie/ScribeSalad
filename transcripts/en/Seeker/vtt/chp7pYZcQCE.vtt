00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.470
"This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the all-new two thousand fourteen Toyota Highlander."

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.639
There are 7 BILLION people on the planet.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.269
Which means there's probably someone out there
who looks JUST.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.669
LIKE.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.080
YOU.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.130
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.580
2 strangers who are completely unrelated and
look exactly like.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.880
Doppelgangers are a trip and are found all
over the world allllll the time.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.839
Our understanding of doppelgangers has taken
on a more casual understanding this day in

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.010
age, but the concept has been a part of paranormal
folklore for hundreds of years.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.470
The term itself originated in Germany and
means "double-goer".

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.030
It described the phenomenon of seeing someone
who looks exactly like another person, or

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.010
perhaps seeing someone who looks exactly like
yourself.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.510
Mostly commonly, the visions of oneself are
reported as happening in your peripheral vision.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.960
Creepeh.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.250
In German folklore, it was thought that seeing
a doppelganger was a bad sign - some kind

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.870
of omen that predicted your near death.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.120
And strangely, Abraham Lincoln, Catherine
the Great, and Queen Elizabeth the First were

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.729
all reported to have seen their doppelganger
before their death.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.680
One night while relaxing at home, Lincoln
glanced sideways into a mirror and saw another

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.829
person, nearly nose to nose with himself in
bed!

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.590
The figure looked exactly like him - with
a few exceptions.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.979
He said the figure was slightly shorter and
a little paler than himself.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.810
When he examined the mirror, it went away,
but as he laid back down, the doppelganger

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.810
reappeared.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.149
He reported a pang of pain in his head while
he was experiencing this.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.499
Of course, experiences like these have inspired
hundreds of fictional offshoots in film and

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:33.759
television.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.399
How might one explain such spooky strokes
with....yourself?

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.460
Some possible answers were accidentally stumbled
upon by doctors who were doing a pre-surgery

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.289
evaluation on a patient with epilepsy.

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.460
They found that when they applied electrical
stimulation to the patient's temporoparietal

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.659
junction, the patient experienced a figure
with a shadow identical to her own in her

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.659
presence.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.350
When she was laying down, she felt the figure
was almost nose-to-nose with her.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.600
Sound familiar?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.360
It's almost exactly what Lincoln had described.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.670
The findings were published in the journal
Nature in 2006, where the scientists concluded

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.390
that this kind of disturbance in the temporal
lobes may account for some paranormal events.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.380
The case study happened shortly after the
explosion of the infamous "God Helmet", concocted

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.440
by neuroscientist Michael Persinger.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.470
Using a similar electrical current on the
temporal lobes, Persinger induced participants

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.570
to have a "religious experience".

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.890
The experience included the feeling that someone
else was with them -- perhaps watching over

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.890
them.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.530
So far, other scientists have failed to replicate
his study.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.470
Thanks for joining me for DNews friends!
