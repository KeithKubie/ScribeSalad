00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To solve this, let's look at the steps that we counted for n = 4.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
These first two always happen regardless of n.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have 4 range calls, which corresponds to this range call.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This one is going to happen n times.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If n = 10, we would get 10 range calls.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Then we have 0, 1, here's 2, and here's 3 print statements that correspond to this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In general, we're going to have 1 print statement plus 2 print statements

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
plus 3 print statements plus etc, etc, all the way up to n - 1 print statements,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which equals n( n - 1)/2.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Adding up these three parts we get 2 + n + n(n - 1)/2.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We can quickly check.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In the case of n = 4, we get 2 + 4 + (4 * 3)/2, which equals 12.
