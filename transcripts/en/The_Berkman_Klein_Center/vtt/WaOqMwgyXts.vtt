My name is Luke Stark, I'm a Berkman Fellow
this year, I'm also a post-doc in sociology

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.479
at Dartmouth College.

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.030
And one research question I'm really interested
in this year is how we think about expanding

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.059
the ethical horizons of science and technology,
especially around STEM education, computer

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.059
science, and engineering.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:24.090
I think it's important because these technologies
that get designed and built by computer scientists

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.109
and engineers have a huge impact on our world.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.720
And they have a lot of say in how social life
gets organized these days.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.470
So I think it's important for all of us to
understand the social and ethical implications

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.550
of those technologies.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.260
I remember when I was in my early 20s, I had
a job working for the government of Ontario

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.980
in communication.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.840
And I sort of realized that the politicians
were really interested in how newspapers got

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.840
laid out.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.720
They cared about where the headline was on
the page, how many column inches they got.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.730
And it just underscored to me the truth of
Marshall MacLuhan's axiom about the medium

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729
being the message.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.250
That the newspaper, which is also kind of
a technology was important to the way these

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.929
politicians' values and messages got out.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.080
That really helped spark my interest.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.310
I think in the last year or so there have
been so many stories in the news about why

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.609
the ethics of technology are important.

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:30.439
Debates about "fake news," about persuasion,
about the way that social media shaped electoral

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.369
politics and that kind of thing.

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.790
I think a lot of people realized the importance
of these questions in their every day digital

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.590
media use before 2017.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.479
But I think it's really hard to ignore those
things now.
