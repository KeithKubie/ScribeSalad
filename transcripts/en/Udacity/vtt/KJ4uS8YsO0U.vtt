00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We'll talk about that a little more later,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
before I go on, I want to mention one very important principle in cryptography,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is known as Kerckhoff's Principle,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and it goes back to a book that Kerckhoff wrote back in 1883,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the way Kerckhoff stated it was this--this was in a book he wrote in 1883

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
about military cryptography [speaking French],

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I apologize for my French, but this loosely translates as,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
"The cipher must not depend on secrecy of the mechanism.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It must not matter if it falls in the hands of the enemy."

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So, the reason for that--and it's important--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
what he's focusing on is the mechanism here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So, if you think about these two functions we need--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we need encryption and decryption.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Coming up with new functions--or new mechanisms--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in Kerckhoff's day these were mostly mechanical devices

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that you needed as part of the encryption process--

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
well, that's a lot of work.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You don't want to have to keep inventing new encryption and decryption functions,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and deciding they're secure and distributing them.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What you want is some way that,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
even if your encryption and decryption functions are known,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
your cipher can still be secure,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and the way to achieve that is to use a key.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So instead of just having the message as input to the encryption function,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the other input to the encryption is a key,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and if it's a symmetric cryptosystem, that same key

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is the key that is needed in the decryption function as well.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If the security relies only on keeping the key secret,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
well, then, we can make our encryption and decryption functions public,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we can analyze them, we can put a lot of work

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
into developing good encryption and decryption functions,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and then the security depends only on keeping the key secret.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If we think our key has been exposed,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
well, then we just need to come up with a new key,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
but we can keep using the same functions.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
If the function turns out to have a weakness in it,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
well, that's a much more serious problem.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Then we need to develop a new encryption function

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and argue that that function is secure.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So, this quiz is to check that you understand

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Kerckhoff's Principle and understand the terms that we've defined.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So the question is: which parts of a cryptosystem must be kept secret?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The choices are: Alice, the algorithm used for encryption,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the algorithm used for decryption, the keys, and the ciphertext.

00:02:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all the parts that must be kept secret.
