The Joe Rogan experience.
So your pursuit for excellence.
When you're saying,

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.950
I've got to get better at Bjj or archery or hunting or whatever,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.970
that isn't coupled with a sort of sense because you're not fucking good enough.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.800
So that's that.
That's the deal to I've cause wonderment.
I love it.
Julie.

5
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.690
Cool

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.060
<v 1>boy in it.
And there's enthusiasm.
I mean,</v>

7
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.930
in everything archery in particular,
it's very,
you know,

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.020
there's that book Zen and the art of archery,
which is a,

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.500
it's an interesting book.
Uh,
it's,
you know,

10
00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:32.300
I mean I think there's some real great points to it,

11
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:37.280
but that state of mind that you get when you release an arrow and that arrow

12
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:40.910
perfectly fines,
it's mark really is and it's you,

13
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:44.960
it requires so much concentration and focus and technique that you really don't

14
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.450
think about other things.
Beautiful.

15
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.160
And it's cleansing and a lot of ways it's mind cleansing.

16
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.660
I find Jujitsu to be very similar in that way too,
that it's so all encompassing.

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.700
It's so,
there's so much on the line,

18
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.320
it's so difficult to do that while it's happening.
You're freeing your mind up.

19
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.090
I mean,
I think of video games in the same way.

20
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.240
<v 0>All of these things,
so that's bizarre.</v>

21
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.500
All of those things suggest a transmission between the inner and outer worlds in

22
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:12.550
it.
You're looking at the bull's eye and then,
oh my God,

23
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.450
I've made this thing traverse time and space or Bjj.

24
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.570
I've been shown again and again how to execute is triangle and I've just

25
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.550
actually done it against resistance is amazing to feel that.

26
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.610
It's amazing to feel that the,

27
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:29.230
that your inner life can express itself in the material world,
whatever.

28
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.600
We'll wherever you are looking to explore that,

29
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.860
<v 1>to test yourself and when you test yourself and you have to figure your way</v>

30
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:41.510
through something or change the path because the path that you were on was

31
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:45.950
unsuccessful.
When you're doing that,
it's really good for the mind and for the,

32
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.570
I hesitate to say the spirit because I think that word spirituality is so beaten

33
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:54.110
down and abused.
You know what you mean?
It become commodified.
Yeah.
It's like,

34
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.200
yeah.
It's like when people call themselves a healer,
like,
all right,

35
00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:59.750
you're really,
yeah,
I've just done some on the way.

36
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.860
We're all healing.
Um,
I mean we're,
we really are all healing each other,
but,

37
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:07.550
um,

38
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.380
I think there's something to doing difficult tasks that it makes life easier.

39
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.320
I really believe that.
I think it makes life more enjoyable.

40
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.770
I think it makes the bright colors brighter and it makes the,

41
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:23.630
the dull colors,
even them,
even the,
the bad moments.

42
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.530
If you have real positive experiences with difficult things that you choose to

43
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:31.340
do on your own,
I think it mitigates most of the hassle of life.

44
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.930
<v 0>Yes,
I agree with that.
That is,
again,</v>

45
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.690
and I'm not particularly promoting this book because I'd like,
uh,

46
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.850
I'm all right with however things do,

47
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:42.720
but the point of this mentorship is the idea that someone will exhibit qualities

48
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.380
that you recognize you that haven't fully realized in yourself and that you can

49
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:50.520
sort of model them and realize them because later you have those qualities.

50
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.960
Oh my Kevin Hart,
we were talking about how horrible I find his positivity.

51
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.680
Me Think so real.

52
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.930
It's unbelievable on a practical level why he's building his standup.

53
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.870
That guy's fucking diligent and the Amandla,
when he talks through his,

54
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.260
when he taught through his work schedule,
you quite,

55
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:06.960
you fetishize hardworking men.

56
00:03:06.961 --> 00:03:10.490
I think I've heard you talk about Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.
Yeah.

57
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.880
The will that you like.
The idea of men are mad at those people by muscle too.

58
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.990
I'm in the Cryo Chamber.
I don't do that though.
I sleep in,
I call them.

59
00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:21.910
You get to hear what you can do.
A lot of things that they don't do like I,

60
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.340
but I also,
you know,
unlike,
uh,
the Rock,
at least I do stand up,
man.

61
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.910
Kevin does stand up to obviously.
