Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.570
&gt;&gt; MARY ANN BROWN: Good
evening I'm Mary Ann Brown.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.220
Welcome to Hill Center and to
our series, The Life of a Poet,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.260 position:56%
which is sponsored by the Library of
Congress and "The Washington Post."

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.150
And funded by the National
Capital Bank.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.620
This is our fourth year of
presenting this program.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.230
Our collaborators are, the
extraordinary moderator,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.560
Ron Charles, editor of "The
Washington Post" Book World.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.100
But, more importantly star of the
totally hit video, "Book Review."

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.710
If you haven't caught these online.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.020
You absolutely must.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.430
We've all been, they're hilarious.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.280
And Ron has a new one out
reviewing Ian McEwan new book.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.840
Our guest this evening
is poet, Terrance Hayes.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.910
I'm going to go ahead and turn the
proceedings over to Rob Casper,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.850
head of the Poetry and Literature
Center at the Library of Congress.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.840
And before I hand the
mic over to Rob,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.090
will you all please turn
off your mobile devices?

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.390
Thank you.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.190
Please welcome Rob Casper.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.070
[ Applause ]

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.370
&gt;&gt; ROBERT CASPER: Thank
you everybody.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.670
Good to see you.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.500
Thanks for coming out on
this rainy, yucky fall night.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.300
The night that will be the first
of many nights like this, I'm sure.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.110
Thanks to Marry Ann Brown for
helping inaugurate this series.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.330
And thanks to Ben and everyone
here at the Hill Center

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.420
for letting us continue to bring
poets to chat with Ron Charles

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.370
and have the Ron Charles
poetry experience.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.050
We're also really delighted to be
working with "The Washington Post"

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.120
and "The Washington
Post's Book World."

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.150
And most of all I'm always eager
to see what Ron's going to do.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.470 position:56%
I've gone to all 13 of these, right?

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.020
Thirteen of these events
and they're always a thrill

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.530
and it's always a fascinating
experience to see how Ron enters

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.420
into the work of these poets.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.700
And has them read poems that they
probably haven't read in years.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.120
Before I talk a little bit
about tonight's feature poet,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.420
I just want to say a little bit

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.760
about the Poetry and
Literature Center.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.700 position:56%
Raise your hand how many people have
been to the Library of Congress.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.550
Okay almost everybody.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.890
Good, good, good.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.460
The Poetry and Literary Center is
housed at the Library of Congress.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.990
We've been there for
almost 80 years.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.450
We host all sorts of poetry events.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.750
We have an event on October 12th.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.240
Our Asian American Literature Today
series with poets from Kundiman,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.540
which is a great organization
out of New York.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.510
Talk more about that and the
events that we have back in our.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.540
[ Squeaking Sound ]

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.150
Is it this one?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.330
Here. To find out more about those
events, you can visit our website,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.480
it's www.loc.gov/potetry.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.960
Now, I have the opportunity again
to introduce Terrance Hayes,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.500
who's kicking off our fall season.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.190
Terrance is the author of
five poetry collections,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.480
most recently "How
to be Drawn" finalist

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.020 position:56%
for both the National Book Award and
the National Critics Circle Award

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.250
and winner of the 2016 NAACP
Image Award for Poetry.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.900
His other collections
include "Lighthead"

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.430
which received the National Book
Award that year, as well as "Wind

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.610
in the Box," "Hip Logic"
and "Muscular Music,"

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.230
winner of the Kate
Tufts Discovery Award.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.080
Terrance's other honors
include a Whiting Writers Award,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.880
a National Poetry Series
Selection and Fellowship

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.880
from the National Endowment
for the Arts and [inaudible].

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.400
In 2014 he was named the
recipient of a McArthur Fellowship.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.940
And this year he was elected

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.100
to the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.110
I first met Terrance
in Pittsburg, in 1994,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.030
which was almost half my life ago.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.070
I have seen him grow and mature
as a poet, editor and teacher

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.320
in those years, but I've also
seen how constant he has been

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.150
in his dedication to
poems and poets.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.920
How generous he is as a friend.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.260
And his poems have always seemed
super charged by a signature mix

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.490
of invention and immediacy.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.110
Myth making and memory
contended; playful, riffing,

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.240 position:56%
and exploding personas; arguments of
the subline and a whole [inaudible].

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.280
He is as a lyricism of
life in [inaudible] though,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.000
and takes a maximal approach in
contrast to, or even bolstered

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.540
by the rigor of its music.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.030
For Terrance poetry
is as philosophically

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.180
and spiritually messy as
our spirits can allow for.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.510
But from that is where it
offers us a sense of sureness.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.230 position:56%
A kind of a claim toward a space it
creates in the moment it creates it.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.550 position:56%
Be ready for all of the above in the
next 75 minutes and please join me

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.510
in welcoming Terrance
Hayes and Ron Charles.

&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Happy to be here.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.820
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Really delighted.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.610
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I'm not
going to read any poems.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.190
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Not
going to read any poems?

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.630 position:56%
Okay we can talk about other things.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.930 position:56%
You know when you're a book
reviewer you become gradually inured

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:12.490
to the ritual humiliation
of standing next to giants,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.570
or sitting next to giants.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:26.190
And when they're certified
geniuses and they've been chosen

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:40.090
by "People Magazine" as one of
the sexiest men of the year.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.070
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: That's
not on my website [laughter].

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.370
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That kind

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.690
of just seems almost
gratuitous and cruel [laughter].

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.680
Sorry about my voice, I hurt it

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.110
at the National Book
Festival screaming too much.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:03.330
I want to start by
talking about your family.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.730
What kind of family raised you?

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:12.760
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Well, my mother
had me when she was about 16.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.500
So, that meant we pretty
much grew up together.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.920
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Just you?

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.220
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
well I have a brother.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.100
She met my stepdad
when I was about 4.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.580
So, he's been there and has
been there for a long time.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.760
And he was a pretty creative dude.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.150
He was in the military.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.140
So, for many years we moved
and then eventually we sort

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.920
of stopped and he kept going.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.970
But, he's retired now
and he's actually

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.960
in a new job working
as a prison guard.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.260
Which is what my mother did.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:53.050
She talked him into becoming a
prison guard after he retired

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.420
from the military,
and then she retired.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.950
But yeah so they're you
know good, regular people.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:08.500
When people ask me about their
influence what I say is they just

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.250
never discouraged me
which was great.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.430
So, that they were curious and
they thought I was curious.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.640
But no one ever said, don't
go to your room and write.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.350
They did say, you know, why are
you always reading those books,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.650
you know?

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.880
But there was never
anyone that made me feel

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.620
like it was something
I shouldn't be doing.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:39.240
They also never made me feel
like I could make a living at it.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.540
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Not many do though.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.450
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, so there
was a kind of freedom in that too,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:51.490
that I just thought oh well
this seems like something to do.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.810
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: There's a
painful poem about your mother,

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.740
I wonder if you'd read,
called "Late."

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.400
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Okay, okay, yeah
I haven't read that one in a while.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.960
"Late" from "Muscular Music."

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.430
This late no one is clean.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.360
Not the bus's worn blue seats,
which keep themselves company.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.510
Or the nurse in her
drowsy yellow uniform.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.270
It's February and I
haven't spoken to my mother

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.420
since she told me to
take my shit and go.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.980 position:56%
Her face bare and serious as a wall.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.140
The driver waves a gloved
hand at a passing bus;

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.860
slow and half empty like us.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.710
Heads of the riders turned so
that I cannot say how they appear.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.010
I was not born in this place.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.310
But it is where I will try to live.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.610
The miles between my mother and
here, stretching me into more

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.910
of a man than my father,
who'd drive from his

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.210
out of state job each weekend
to let her break his skin.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.510
I'm glad I've left her sitting

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.810
in that house waiting
for her nails to grow.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.110
Once she pulled a gun on me

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.410
because as she told the police
I was too big for a belt.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.710
I called them, but they
did not take her away.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.010
Later my father drove home and
said never put our business

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.310
in the street.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.610
So, I shouldn't be telling you
this, how we sat in that house

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.910
like a family while a small
light beat the blinds.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.210
My mother stubborn as a girl
who will not comb her hair.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.510
There is no light beyond
the windows of this bus.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.810
I am given my face, transparent
and bare on the glass.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.110
After my father left that
night, the two of us sat apart

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.410 position:56%
in the living room as the TV lit the
walls, the old white gown trembling

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.710
on her shoulders like
the sings of a moth.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.010
I will say I did not
know she began to cry.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.310
I was 18, trying to be a man.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.610
It has taken me too
long to say this.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.910
I am the same thing
I've always been.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.210
A son. I do not know my mother.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.510
But I want to touch her
now, as I did not then.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.810
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Lovely.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.110
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Thanks.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.410
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I shouldn't
be telling you this.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.710
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: You
want me to talk about that?

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.010
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah, what's
it like to write that sort

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.310
of intimate confessing of poetry.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.180
What are the costs of
exposing your own feelings

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.420 position:56%
and other people's feelings to that?

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.060
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Well the
great thing about my mom,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.870
because she does have a pretty
wild imagination, and you know,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.180
in a different time, maybe like
20 years from now she would,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.480
you know she would be me.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.550
But she essentially said, you
know it's all your imagination,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.700
you got such a good imagination.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.900
So, that was like license
to say whatever.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.370
So, I don't think she ever thinks
of my work as purely confessional,

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.430
she thinks that I'm
just making stuff up.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.310
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Do you think
you're ever confessional?

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.440
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, yeah, but
I think an advantage of poetry is

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.510
that you can kind of come
in and out of metaphor

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.680
and in and out of shadow.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.940
So, I can sort of be confessional

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.000
when people think I'm
not being confessional,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.250
and you know dress things

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.240
when I don't want them
to be so confessional.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.950
I mean what she said
about that poem is that,

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.250
well I never pointed it at you.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.550
She was like [laughter].

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.850
I showed you the gun.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.690
And said, I can see how that
would be good for drama.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.400
But you know she actually
did have it out, so.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.700
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In
another poem, you said,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.530
I knew later I'd be writing
these lines caught in that space

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.390
between personal and public.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.340
What is that space between
personal and public?

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.640
How do you negotiate that?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.210
How do you preserve that as a poet,

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.810
who wants to write
about his own life?

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.660
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, yeah, well
I mean even the word that shows

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.740
up in that poem, transparency
that shows

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.140
up in the last poem is really
what I'm trying to achieve,

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.180
a certain kind of clarity, both
in the language and in feeling.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:46.360 position:56%
So, my sense is that if you can get
it right, if you can get the rhythm,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.120
and the language, and
the sensibility right,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.980
you can say whatever
you want to say.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.610
Anything can be said if you
can say it right and sometimes

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.850
that means beautifully,
sometimes that means rawly.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.210 position:56%
Sometimes that means metaphorically.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.220
So, whatever you think of as
right is what I'm always sort

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.520
of going for.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.530
And when there's a failure
there, if someone says, you know,

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.710
if my mother, and they haven't
said it yet, nor my father,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:15.110 position:56%
if they are put off by it, that just
means that I haven't done it right.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You mean you haven't
transformed the experience enough

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.460
into art?

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.760
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.060
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's just?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.360
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: A cousin of
mine, who also probably of all

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.660
of my family, my first cousin,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.960
Pervis [assumed spelling] is
a person who's most interested

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.260
in my work.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.810
He also is a prison guard.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:33.130
But he said about het "Late"
poem, because he remembered it

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.920
because I went and
stayed with his mother.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.220
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: After this ordeal.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.520
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: His
mother is my mother's sister.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.000
Yeah, and he was like come on man.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.970
You did not say, oh I'm a son.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.920
You were so mad you wanted to
have her arrested [laugther].

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.180
And to him I said, yeah,
but that's not interesting

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.480
for the poem though, you know.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.440
So, he had a better sense of
both the real-time response to it

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.730
and the sense of like
calling me on it in fact.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.760
But I was like yeah, but you
know there has to be a turn.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.210
So, and I said but that was better.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.980
And I guess to say
that, when I wrote it,

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.640
this is me saying it
to him over beers.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.130
Like when I wrote it, it was true.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.730 position:56%
It wasn't true until I said, I'm the
same thing I've always been, a son.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.210
You know son before man.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.190
I was a son before I was a man.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.700
But for him, he wanted me to go
back to that, you know, that day

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.140
and me saying somebody call the
cops this woman, you can't do that,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.340
which is what I was
saying, you can't do that.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.010
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I love
that poem the way it turns

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.090 position:56%
after that terrible argument where
you feel your desperate love for her

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.820
as you sit there and
look back at that.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.350
Even the boy with no father carries

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.940
in him the image of
his father you write.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.590
Would you read the poem
called "The Same City?"

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.890
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.190
This is a, yeah.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.520
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The poem
about watching your father,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.440
you call him your father, your
stepfather, trying to fix the car.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.230
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: That's right.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.190
"Same City."

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.320
The rain falling on a
night in mid-December,

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.160
I pull to my father's engine
wondering how long I'll

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.640
remember this.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.660
His car is dead.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.240
He connects jumper
cables to his battery,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.480
then to mine without looking
in at me and the child.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:17.200
Water beads on the windshields,
the road sign, his thin blue coat.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.250
I get out now, prove I can
stand with him in the cold,

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.360
but he told me to stay
with the infant.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.510
I wrap her in the blanket, staring
for what seems like a long time

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:33.330
into her open, toothless
mouth, and I wish she was mine.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.640
I feed her an orange
softened first in my mouth,

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.700
chewed gently until the
juice runs down my fingers

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.970
as I squeeze it into hers.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.140
What could any of this matter to
another man passing on his way

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.410
to his family, his radio
deafening the sound of water

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.340
and breathing along all
the roads bound to his?

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:59.510
But to rescue a soul is as
close as anyone comes to God.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.760
Think of Noah lifting a small
black bird from its nest.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.160
Think of Joseph, raising
a son that wasn't his.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.620
Let me begin again.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.400
I want to be holy.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.450
In rain, I pull to my father's
car with my girlfriend's infant.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.470
She was pregnant when we met.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.110
But we'd make love.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.840
We'd take love below stars

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.090
and shingles while her
baby kicked between us.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.460
Perhaps a man whose young child
bears his face, whose wife waits

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.030
as he drives home through
rain and darkness,

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.230
perhaps that man would
call me a fool.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.260
So, what. There is one thing
I will remember all my life.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.850
It is as small and holy
as the mouth of an infant.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.870
It is speechless.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.550
When his car would not stir,
my father climbed in beside us,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:57.420
took the orange from my hand,
took the baby in his arms.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:04.680
In 1974, this man met my mother for
the first time as I cried or slept

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.710
in the same city that
holds us tonight.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:13.030
If you ever tell my story, say
that's the year I was born.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.890
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That's got to
be the best poem ever written

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.190
about stepfathers.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.490
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: You know

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.970
when I read it I would usually
begin by saying stepfathers.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.370
I mean the poems are
always chaining,

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.460
so I was like I knew you
saw it, so I can't edit it,

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.360
but usually I'll start in the
first half and say my stepfather

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.430
and then say father, but.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.730
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You
are the stepfather

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.050
in that poem, or about to be.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.160
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: No, it was
just a girl who had a kid.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.420
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Well you
could be you're in that role.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.720
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, sure.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.020
No, that right.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.320
That's right I'm taking
care of somebody else's kid.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And then you mention
these other historically famous

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.360
stepfathers, Joseph.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.720
You say in that poem,
to rescue a sole is

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.080
as close as anyone comes to God.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.030
Did James Hayes save you?

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.330
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, yeah,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:03.780
you know he was artistic,
and tender, and tough.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.650
Yeah, I mean we were fine
until I decided to look

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.800
for my own dad in my thirties.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.510
Because he was just like, you know
his mom had him when she was 14

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:17.270
in Florida, so he certainly
saw a relationship.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.370
But you know he was,
again, very cool.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:24.160
He was like a great soldier, which
I'm always still thinking about.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.890
Like that's not my personality.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.010
I'm much more like
transparent and talkative.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.130
He's tender, but not a
big talker, you know.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.990
Sort of classic dad I guess.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.580
But certainly, I learned
a lot from him, man,

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.000
you know he was there from four.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.930
I mean that's sort of the idea
of the poem, like if he shows

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.650
up at four years old I mean
he's pretty much my dad.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.740
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And the contrast
between the working on the car

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.790
and squeezing an orange
into an infant's mouth.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.620
So, so brilliant.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.420
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: So, you know,
sometimes the poems just come

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.520
to you, but you know if I
only waited for those kinds

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.900
of moments I would write
a poem every five years.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.320
But that poem is, I mean the thing

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.270
that I think I must have
adjusted was something

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.430
about the main scene
is totally accurate.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.420
I'm trying, you know
I can't remember now

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.250
because it was just one of a girl.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.550
But she did have the kid and
somehow we were still dating.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:19.070
And so, I was essentially
babysitting for her.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.790
You know, and she had tried
to convince me at some point,

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.090
this is the stuff that
doesn't make it

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.150
into the poem, that
it might be my kid.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.760
And I kind of knew it
wasn't, but I had been

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.640
with her before she got pregnant
and so I was like you know what,

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.230
I'll just you know ride it
out and see what happens.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.320
But essentially his car
did breakdown one night

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.300
when I was watching the baby so
you know I went and I felt it then,

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.230
which happens, but I mean the
writers in the room you know

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.400
if you live every day, there's
probably five days of the course

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.730
of your life where you say, oh that
was a poem, like that whole day.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.110
Like somebody just sent me.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.410
And I do think you know a lot

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.060
of being a poet is
listening for those moments.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.890
So, if you listen with your
heart they're always there.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.480
But at that time, it
was like, oh wow,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.890
look a poem just dropped in my lap.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.960
My dad just called me to, you know.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.430
So, I just pretty much.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.970
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And you
wrote it into the poem.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.770
In the poem, you say
you'll remember this.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.520 position:56%
So, and then the second half of like
trying to get at the meaning of it,

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.180
let me begin again, is again
where the imagination or empathy,

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.700
or metaphor starts
to kind of set in.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.560
But and I guess I say that because
I could just as easily make it

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.860
up is what I would tell you.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.640
Sometimes I make up
everything in a poem and people,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.110
because I've read something like
that, they think it's all true.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.640
Which I'm like sure you
can think it's all true.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.940
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah, right.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.690
You say in another poem, papa
why can't I be a rascal too?

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.650
Were you rascally or not really?

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.530
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: No,
no I was pretty square.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.080
I liked to draw and read.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.320
And my brother, my dad's full son,
my brother was also pretty good.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.620
We were pretty good kids.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.920
You know.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.220
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Did poetry seem
like a likely career for you?

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.520
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: No, no.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.820
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Did
you know any poets?

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.120
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: No,
but I was a visual artist.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.310
So, and that was strange
enough for them.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.160
So, no definitely nobody
was thinking about.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.100
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What did they
think of your interest in poetry?

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.400
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: They
were fine once I started

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.700
like making a living at it.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.760
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah, but that
was you know, relatively late.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.070
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.550
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Not
when you were in?

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.070
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: As I said,
I mean the best thing they did

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.430
and this is really a
testament to my father.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.790
Because my mother is
maybe more like I am.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.760
Like you usually know
exactly what she's thinking,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.060
you know what I mean?

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.490
She's a terrible, as I
am, terrible poker player.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.390
But my dad is pretty, so if my
dad had an opinion about it,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.690
he wouldn't have said it.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.080
But had he said something
I would have listened.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.330
You know. So, they just were
like, well that's what he's doing.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.780
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You said, when
I was getting ready to graduate,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.530
I wondered if I would go
play basketball overseas

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.730
or get an MFA in painting.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.030
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Right.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.080
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Those
doesn't seem like the usual,

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.350 position:56%
you know binary choices a guy makes.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.720
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I wish I had
gone over for a little while now.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.300
But now I'm too old to do it.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.470
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In your first
collection, "Muscular Music,"

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.090
you've got a poem called
"What I Am."

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.390
Would you read that.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.690
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.990
Sure. That's like the opening poem.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.940
That's right there,
it's "Muscular Music?"

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.270
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Oh,
we're in the wrong book.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.760
Number three.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.060
In my lap.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.630
Sorry. Always in your other purse.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.980
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I'm
going to say upfront,

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.580
because Rob will know
what I'm talking about.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:19.300
This poem was, I had read
some James Tate poetry.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.250
It changed it enough that I don't
have like after James Tate in it.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.140
But I always think of this as a
poem that would not have happened

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.240
without the poet James Tate,
who passed away recently.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.070
He wouldn't know it even if
he'd look at it, he wouldn't be

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.630
like oh he's writing like me,
but that's where it comes from.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.790
"What I am."

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.790
Fred Sanford's on at
12 and I'm standing

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.680
in the express lane cash
only about to buy Head

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.170
and Shoulders the white people
shampoo, no one knows what I am.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.920
My name could be Lamont.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.330
George Clinton wears colors like
Toucan Sam, the Froot Loop pelican.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.250
Follow your nose, he says.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.790
But I have no nose, no mouth,
so you tell me what's good,

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.840
what's god, what's funky.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.270
When I stop by McDonalds
for a cheeseburger,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.930
no one suspects what I am.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.810
I smile at Ronald's poster,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:10.160 position:56%
perpetual grin behind the
pissed-off, fly-girl cashier I love.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.340
Where are my goddamn fries?

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.740
Ain't I American?

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.800
I never say, niggaz in my poems.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.940
My ancestors didn't emigrate.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.280
Why would anyone leave
their native land?

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.430
I'm thinking about
shooting some hoop later on.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.230
I'll dunk on every
one of those niggaz.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.960
They have no idea what I am.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.120
I might be the next Jordan god.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.150
They don't know if Toni
Morrison is a woman or a man.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.210
Michael Jackson is the
biggest name in showbiz.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:38.070
Mamma se Mamma sa mamma ku sa,
sang the Bushmen in Africa.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.860
I'll buy a dime bag after
the game, me and Jody.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.140
He says, Fuck them white
people at work, man.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.960
He was an All-American
in high school.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.620
He's cool, but he don't
know what I am, and so what.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.410 position:56%
Fred Sanford's on in a few and I got
the dandruff-free Head and Shoulders

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:58.140
of white people and a cheeseburger
belly and a "Thriller" CD

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.420
and Nike high tops and slavery's
dead and the TV's my daddy.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.810
You big Dummy!

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.110
Fred tells Lamont [laughter].

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.560
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That
is a crazy poem.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.610
I love them, what I think it's

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.400
about is the way these
different forces are trying

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.700
to define you and none of them are.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.000
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.300
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: None of them works.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.600
The white culture is
trying to define you

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.250
in very you know classic
racists ways.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.200
And black culture's trying
to define you too in ways

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.500
that you fine uncomfortable.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.800
Is that close?

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.100
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
That's right, the speaker.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.400
That's right.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.700
The speaker.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.190
So, I mean you can tell the
poems that are all like all here,

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.490
and then the poems that are here.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.530
So, that, I mean there's
heart in it, but that's just

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.960
like a meditation almost.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.350
You know, so the truest things
is that I did have a friend

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.550
who was an all-American
guard, named Jody, you know

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.560
but he would have never said that
to me, but whenever I see it,

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.640
I think oh yeah, old
Jody, Jody Patten.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.860
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In another
poem, you confess, I'm not cool.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.270
I keep the real me
tucked beneath a wig.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.090
I'm a small American frog.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.230
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: And the other
part, which is the truest part

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.070
of that poem, I'm sweating
even as I tell you this,

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.330
where's my handkerchief, yeah.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.720
I was already going to pat
my brow before you read it.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.010
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: But that
little frog kind of remind me

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.210
of Emily Dickinson's
modest talk about herself.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.260
The frog and the admiring
bog, I'm nobody.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.380
You've got another frog too, in
a poem called, "The Segregate."

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.860
Remember that little frog?

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.460
I do.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.760
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's a
relatively brief poem.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.760
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Okay.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.700
"Segregate."

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.730
On the first morning of school
there is a young tree frog waiting

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.140
patiently at the front gate.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.410
Since this means there will be no
classes for the rest of the day,

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.230
the children dump their
school gear in their lockers

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.900
and hustle to the windows to stare.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.160
The girls are eager to transform
him with a kiss, the boys eager

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.550
to see him on the basketball court.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.600
But their principal greets him
with a get the hell out of here.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.450
A security guard fetches
the teargas.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.440
Some of the old teachers crowd in
the doorway like befuddled geese.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.140
You belong in our swamps,
not our schools they rage.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:15.070
But clearly the cool blooded
amphibian American does not agree.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.540
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Where did
you come up with that?

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.120
This metaphor of African-American
as amphibian American?

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.300
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Well, you know
that's the kind of formal thing

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.930
that interests me, so that
poem is playing with the form,

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:28.790
I mead up a bunch of anagram poems.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.840
And so, the in lines come
from words in side segregate.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.500
So, gate, and rage, and
tear and tear and so,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.320
some who once I started
kind of working

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.930
on the poem, that's what emerged.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.670 position:56%
So, and I do think of, I mean I used

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.060
to have a little Kermit
the Frog doll.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.100
So, have I told y'all
that story before.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.740
There's another sad story.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.940
My mom, actually I don't tell it
because it's such a terrible story,

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.820
but so I'm always thinking
about Kermit the Frog,

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.920
but my Avatar would probably
be a turtle, but the frog comes

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.810
up because it's a family thing.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.110
Now I got to tell you.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.520
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I don't know
where to go with any of that.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.820
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I know.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.120
I did, I had a Kermit the Frog.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.610
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Turtle might
be the last animal we think

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.910
of in relation to you.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.210
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.860
Well it's got a little shell so it
can always go in when it needs to.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.760
And then inside his shell he's
got music and posters and.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.270
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: But
you're this giant.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.570
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: A
piano in the corner.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.870
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You're
this dramatic guy

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.920
that commands the whole room what
do you have to do with a turtle?

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.900
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: That's why a
shell is good to have [laughter].

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.120
So. I had a little frog.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.060
And, see, this, I actually have
never told this story even if,

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.360
I know if Rob doesn't know it.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.620
But I'm going to tell you the full
because it's like the late story,

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.190
the full arc of it, I
am more sympathetic.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:44.550
But when I was young I had a
little frog from like you know 4

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.610
to let's say 6 or 7
and it went with me.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:50.320
I put it in the tub and all
of my family knew about it.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.530
But one day I broke
my mother's vase.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.560
She had like a little flower vase

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.290
and I guess I was playing
and I broke it.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.410
And in her rage, she took
the frog and she cut it up.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.260
And I think that's when I
became a poet [laughter].

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.530
So, of course she's
always regretted it.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:12.980
And in my family; my brother and
my father it's what we always.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.310
As I said, she's you know talkative
and energetic and anytime we want

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.120
to win an argument we
say, but you know you cut

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.560
up Terrance's frog [laughter].

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.860
And then we're done.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.720
So, clearly I was wounded.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.890
And you know she regretted
it later, but the turn on it,

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.260
if I were to ever write
about it in a poem is,

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.850
and I just realized this I want
to say like in the last year.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.430
I was just doing math and I
was like I think I was like 6

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:38.270
or 7 which means my
mom was like 22 or 23.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.970
And now that I'm older I
totally could believe that a 22

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.670
or 23-year-old could cut
up the frog of a kid.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.060
But at the time, I just for
a long time I just saw it

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.360
as my mother, you know.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.820
You know mothers don't quite age.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.460
They're just always mothers.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.390
But, when I look back on it I
thought, well it doesn't excuse it,

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:59.160 position:56%
but it does to me change it a little
bit to think about how young she was

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.500
when she did such a reckless thing.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.260
So, but I don't, you know that's
why I haven't written about it.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.990
I mean to go into my process
like I could never write about it

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.790
without having some
shape to it, some.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.120
So, because to just
be mad is a flat line.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.500
But to think about like
coming around the bend.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.010
So, I still don't know if that's
enough to make we write about it.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:25.250
But it's a big story in my family
because it was a pretty huge thing.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.730
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: This
is a longer poem,

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.400
called "Self Portrait Vision" based
on the, it involves a painting.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.700
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Right, I haven't
read this one in a long time.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.000
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Is that
the right painting?

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.390
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
that's right, that's Winslow.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.180
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You have a few
clues here, of course my black

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.480
and white drawing means
nothing to you,

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.460
you can describe the painting
maybe before you start.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.760
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.180
Well you know, it's just I
mean you probably know this.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.880
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: These people
will know the painting.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.510
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: And guy's
sort of on his back on the boat.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.280
And the boat is tilted and
there's a storm around him.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.230
I mean there's not that many
images, certainly of like solitary,

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:59.000
black figures in the history
of American paintings.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.490
So, I think that was one of
the things that drew me to it.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.400
It was just such an
unusual thing to see.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.830
Do you want me to, oh you want
me to read this part of it, okay?

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.110
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You can
read the whole poem.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.410
Too long?

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:10.710
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
it's a little long.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.160
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Oh, yeah I
mean this part of the, sorry.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.100
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: So,
is this the last part?

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.440
This part is called, yeah,
"Self Portrait/Vision."

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.300
The man tells nothing.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.090
He carries nothing.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:28.790
He is covered by almost
nothing but strokes of light.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.810
He knows what I would like to know.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:36.240
How a white man came to paint
beauty into a black man's face.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:42.070
And why he left sharks slashing
the water beneath his feet?

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:49.190
But he does say, what is that, but
he does not say, I am not his kin.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.860
I, who was born of a people
who never learned to swim.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.360
People who had no word for the
blur line that divides each day.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.490 position:56%
This is why he does not look my way.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:07.390
So, we pine for his never-minding
scowl, Homer at his easel in 1899

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.200
as the harbor filled with
saltwater and lightning.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.900 position:56%
And me, these last months I've spent
staring at the painting as rain

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.060
and wind walk hand and
hand into the city.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.520 position:56%
Did he know it would storm that day?

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.750
This mariner or fishmonger?

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.310
This refugee backtracking
through the middle passage,

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.310
kingdom of the un-salvaged,

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.490
the hushed fathoms
fleeing home to find home?

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:38.170
I can pretend, but I
do not know enough.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.200
Or I know as much as
Homer could have known

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.500
of what a drowned man feels.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.870
The flood of last wishes
and the hours beginning

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.790
to darken and drift off course.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.490
As a child, I'd sneak to
watch teenagers' roughneck

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.490
in the neighborhood pool.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:59.140
One night as I knelt at the
deep end stroking the water,

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.110
a white boy shoved me in.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.530
Can you remember the womb?

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:08.740
How, in the moments before birth,
the lines were washed from the map

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.270
that told the route you'd come?

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.430
Perhaps downing feels that way.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.600
The one who saved me had dark skin.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.960
He left me on my side gasping
for air like a startled fish.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.790 position:56%
After my father removed my soaked
shirt and sneakers, he got his belt.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.080
He beat me until welts rose.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.950
Like new muscles along
my arms and legs.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.610
Like brushstrokes along my back.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:41.340
I learned living requires
a kind of discipline;

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.850
a reverence for the law of gravity.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.690
But I have wanted,
as I want when I look

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:51.160
at the paining, to unhouse my body.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:56.400
I have wanted the kind of grace
God gives only to the drowned;

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.100
the boundlessness of a man
conjured out of gossip and time.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.920
Out of theories of demise; of a man

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.320
who will not be the
painter's handsome one.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:13.020
Who does not ask for help
but awaits the tide's eulogy.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.320
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Okay.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.830
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, it's been
a while since I looked at that one.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.130
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's
a brilliant poem.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.430
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Thank you.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:19.730
Thank you.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.800
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The way it
moves, from that painting

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.980
to your own much more
harmless experience.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.300
Because you could have
drowned I assume.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.730
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.030
Yeah, that's right.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.330
And that was true.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.630
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And the way
the speaker could have drowned.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.240
And the way it involves
the middle passage

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.450
and then your own experience
with racism.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.740
It's just a lot of things
going on in a poem like that.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.290
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
you know Ta-Nehisi,

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.560
I don't think Ta-Nehisi Coates
who you all should know,

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.010
I think it's in a beautiful
struggle.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.920
And I feel like, I don't know
if we've ever actually talked

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:58.050
about this, but there's a scene
in that book where he goes out

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.020 position:56%
and is almost hurt, or almost
injured and I think it has something

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.480
to do with cops and
then he comes home,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.940
he's reprimanded by his father.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.050
So, the thing that I remember

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.340
from that experience is
that I almost drowned.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.510
That it's actually a
Nigerian guy saved me

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.560 position:56%
and when I went home I was punished.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.120
You know my father did beat me.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.420
And sort of making the parallel

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.240
between like I'm beating
you because you almost died.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.090
I'm beating you because you didn't
take care enough in the world.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.390
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And
it strengthens you,

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.960
as you say those welts
rise like muscles.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.260
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
Right, right, yeah.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.970
I mean and you know I
don't think I would,

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:34.160
I wouldn't necessarily
reprimand my son that way.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.930
I know Ta-Nehisi wouldn't
reprimand his son that way.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.390
But certainly, I think for
the time, it made a kind

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.760
of sense, but I still was shocked.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.760
I mean I was shocked enough as
I think I said earlier to have

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.440
to work it out in a poem,
to find some shape to it.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.920
I mean if I was only again angry
at you know how he treated me

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.800
after a life and death experience,
I wouldn't have written it

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.990
so I think I understood
it enough to write it.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:03.420
But I don't know if I was going
there before the painting.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.480
I think maybe thinking about the
painting helped me get there.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.060
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right you
write a lot of about paintings.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.360
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.660
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You paint yourself.

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.960
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
That's right, yeah.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.260
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It was one
of your career choices.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.560
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
I still mess around.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.210
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You painted some
of the covers of your books.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.510
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
Yeah, all of them.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:17.810
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: They're lovely.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.110
One's been replaced with
a photograph of you.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.000
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
that's right, it was initially.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.590
I didn't want them to, I asked
can I put a drawing on it, but.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.970
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: How do
you decide when you want

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:27.050
to express something should
it be a painting or a poem?

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.640
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I just express.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.920
I just, it can be both I
think is sort of what I think.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.000
I try not to differentiate.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.410
I mean, you know again, this
sounds like a boast but it's not,

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.870
because I can't play the piano.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.810
But I would say just as, it
would be like anybody picking

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.110
up an instrument they can't play,

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.630
but just saying let's see
what kind of sounds come out.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:53.330
So, that is probably the best way
to understand writing versus art.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:58.960
I do, at this hour have more
control, or more facility as a poet

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.290
than I do as a painter, I think.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:02.590
I don't think that was always true.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.890
But it's true now.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:08.520
Certainly, more as you know a
piano player or prose writer even.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.030
But the idea is just you know

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.640
to not get too caught
up in what you're doing.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.940
But just to do it.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.890
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You say here, he
knows what I would like to know,

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:22.830
how a white man came to pain
beauty into a black man's face.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.130
That goes right to the heart

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.430
of the discussion we've
been having this week

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:26.730
about cultural appropriations.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.910
Who can write about black people,
who can write bout Mexican people.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.590
Can people of different
races write about,

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.900
you've heard the argument,
it's been going around.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.400
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Only
well is what I would say.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.960
You can write whatever you want,
you just have to write it well.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.260
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Flush
that out of it.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.560
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: That's why
when you write about a tree,

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.050
you don't have to write
it that well.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.260
Because people know what trees
are, and they're not political.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.740
So, you just, when I think about
this you know dig to people

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.260
who only write landscape poems, but
I do think when you start getting

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.640
into kind of cultural
questions there are more risks.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.100
And it just depends
on your sensibility.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.400
I mean I like risk for
myself and I admire risk

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.700
when other people are doing it.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.520
And you know it does require
a little bit of generosity,

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.210 position:56%
especially when people are not doing
it well and if you're a teacher,

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:15.560
you know you encounter poorly
written risky things all the time.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.110
So, I think you still, you know,

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.870
you still encourage
them to take that risk.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.170
So, I would never say no.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.850
In fact, there's a side note.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.930
I did a reading, the last
reading I did before this one was,

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.230
I'll make this quick.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:30.010
I read for a bunch
of students at NYU

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:31.930 position:56%
and I decided to only read new work.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:35.280
So, one of the poems
I read was an eraser

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.100
of the first 20 minutes
of "Delirious."

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.120 position:56%
So, I don't know if you all remember
the first 20 minutes of "Delirious"

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.420
where Eddy Murphy comes out.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.250
He talks for a good little
bit about gay people,

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:46.550
but he ain't saying gay people.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.910
So, an eraser means I'm just
highlighting all of that.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:54.370
So, there's a moment where I said
you know pussy like seven times,

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.670
because that's what he did.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.740
So, I'm saying that and then you
know faggot and there's others,

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.950
I mean I selected other
stuff to give it shape,

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.170
but I'm really highlighting
what he's doing

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.850
and after 20 minutes he talks
about his family so we're done.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:11.040
So, I read that and there
was I guess a transgender guy

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.690
in the audience and so he
raised his hand then and he was

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.990
like why did you read that?

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.590
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: He was
offended, you got the impression.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.070
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Well, he
told me later that he was,

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.600
but at the time he just raised
his hand and then I said,

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.100
well you know I want to know
if people heard what I heard,

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.500
because my sense of Eddie Murphy
in that segment, and actually most

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.920
of Eddie Murphy is like
it's a kind of homophobia

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.100
that becomes homoerotic and so
I was like I want to isolate

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.670
that so we can see
it and it's just him.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.950
So, everybody else in the
audience was like yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.240
And then he didn't say anything,
but then I saw him on the street

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.740
about three days later and
he came up to me and said,

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.200
I just didn't think
it was a good poem.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.170
I think you were really
highlighting what was problematic

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:49.470
in Eddie Murphy.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:50.770
And I was like yeah.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.040
But at the end after that whole
conversation what I said to him is

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.920
that but can a writer ever
really come up to another writer

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.430
and say don't write that?

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.090
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: People do say that.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.540
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I just don't
think; I think that's a really.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.840
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What do you know?

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.830 position:56%
People say to write writers what do
you know about the black experience.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.130
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Right, right.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.820
Again, I say well so
as I said to him,

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.980
I was like well you might be right,
because I only read new stuff.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.370
It was an experiment.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.370
I did want to hear it and I hear
you but what I'm saying to you

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.130
as a young writer, talking
to me is that don't you know

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:22.270
that that's a really slippery slope
to like police what creativity is.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.620
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Then we're
all stuck in our own.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.050
We're all stuck writing
our own biography.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.720
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, but again,
I didn't say that he was wrong

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.700
and I thought about it and he was
like well you should write more.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.630
I was like I might,
I might keep going.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.460
But I just, at the end
of the day if you go

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.000
to the point that you're making.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.610
You can actually write
whatever you want to write.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.010
It could be bad or good.

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:40.770 position:56%
But I just don't, I'm certainly not.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:44.240
I wouldn't be that as a teacher,
and just in general in the world,

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.980
I've never looked a person
and said you can't write that.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.610 position:56%
I could say you can write it better.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:51.820
But I would never say that's
not your place to write it.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.080
So, that's generally I mean
at the other end of that,

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.690
you know teaching a workshop
in West Palm Beach and it was

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:03.590
like retired old white people
and the conversation became,

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.000
and I covered this space.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.190
I tried to create a space where
people would say what they want

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.660
to say and they're like well
what are we going to write

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.220
about we just old white
people [laughter].

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.770
But if you were a white person
who live in a white town

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.920
with white cars, and white
fences, and white house.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.610
That's an interesting poem though.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:20.760
Like, a poem about just
all whiteness I think

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.060
that's interesting.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.360
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right, and
you can use your imagination.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.820
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Imagine
that, yeah, if you imagine it.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.490
So, I'm saying like you know
that's sort of your work.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.030
Like if it was easy, that'd
be like writing about trees.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:34.330
Like, there's your challenge to do
the thing you're not supposed to do

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.240
and do it in a way
that's transformative.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.980
So, that's what I think.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.280
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Okay.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.860
I agree, totally agree.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.210
Lionel Shriver kicked us off with
a series of essays and a speech

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.790
after she her own recent
novel was criticized

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.380
for cultural appropriation.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.680
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure yeah.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.820
I mean those things exist,
but they are most problematic

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.620
when the work, the results are bad.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.040
But I think the results can be.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.350
Again, I mean that's Homer,

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.170
like I think that that's
it is a good painting.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.500
And I'm free to think
about like wow,

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.800
I can't believe he painted this.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.550
He did paint it you
know what I mean, so.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.880
You know, yeah I would
never say across the board

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.490
that there's things you should
not be able to do as a writer.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:12.790
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Because
it's not you.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.090
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:15.390
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:16.690
Let's talk about race.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:17.990
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: That's
what we were [laugther].

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.410
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: So
fantastically sharp critiques

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.060
of racism in America.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.570
And yeah, I also sense some
discomfort with the liberal clichés

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.560
and tropes of race in America too.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.740
I wonder if you'd read a
poem called "Woofer" is

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.310
that how you pronounce it?

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.960
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah it's
like a speaker, or a barker too

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.340
but it's like a sub-woofer.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.640
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Oh, okay,
yeah I know that word.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.330
Yeah.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.670
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: "Woofer" what
I consider the African-American.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.970
So, there are things.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.270 position:56%
I guess this is the place to say it.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:47.570
So, buried in this poem is howl.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:50.250
That's also like I'm
not howling I'm woofing.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.220
So, you hear in the
beginning if you know howl.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:56.330 position:56%
But again, it's not in the notes and
it's just me, like burying stuff.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:57.630
It's like the frog.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.610
Like, no one would ever
know but when I see it,

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:02.630
I'm seeing something else
maybe than what you're hearing.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.310
But now you might hear it.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:09.320
When I consider the much-discussed
dilemma of the African America,

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:14.090
I think not of the diasporic middle
passing, unchained, juke, jock,

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:17.990
and jiving sons and daughters
of what sleek dashikied poets

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:22.130
and tether fisted Nationalists
commonly call Mother Africa,

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:26.270
but of the African
girl, who was the child

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:30.260
of a black-skinned Ghanaian
beauty and Jewish-American,

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.630
globetrotting ethnomusicologist.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:37.850
I forgot all my father's warnings
about meeting women at bus stops

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.100
which is the way he met my mother.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.420
When I met her waiting for
the rush hour bus in October

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.960
because I have always been a sucker
for deep blue denim and Afros

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.780
and because she spoke so
slowly when she asked the time.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.150
I wrote my number in the back
of the book of poems I had

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:59.770
and said something like "You can
return it when I see you again"

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.140
which has to be one of my top two
or three best pickup lines ever.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.320
If you have ever gotten lucky

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.070
on a first date you can
guess what followed.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.350
Her smile twizzling above a
tight black V-neck sweater,

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.900
chatter on my velvet
couch and then the two

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.650
of us wearing nothing but shoes.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.850
When I think of African-American
rituals of love,

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:26.740
I think not of young, made-up unwed
mothers who seek warmth in the arms

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.440
of any brother with arms because
they never knew their fathers,

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.230
though that could describe
my mother.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.090
But of that girl and
me in the basement

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:40.260 position:56%
of her father's four story Victorian
making love among the fresh blood

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.730
and axe and chicken feathers left
after the Thanksgiving slaughter,

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:48.310
executed by a 3-D witchdoctor
houseguest.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:51.450
His face was starred
by tribal markings

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:56.340
and her ruddy American poppa
while drums drummed upstairs

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.380
from his hi-fi woofers because
that's the closest I've ever come

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:05.180
to anything remotely ritualistic
or African, for that matter.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.930
We were quiet enough to hear
their chatter between the drums

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:13.080 position:56%
and the scraping of their chairs at
the table above us and the footsteps

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.800
of anyone approaching
the basement door

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.940
and it made our business sweeter,
though I'll admit I wondered

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.960
if I'd be cursed for making
love under her father's nose

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.780
or if the witchdoctor would
sense us and then cast a spell.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:33.220
I have been cursed, broken hearted,
stunned, frightened and bewildered,

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.730
but when I consider the
African-American I think not

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.030
of the tek nines.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.330
This is the howl.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:43.660
I think not of the tek nines of
my generation deployed by madness,

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:48.310
or that we were assigned some lousy
fate when God prescribed job titles

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.720
at the beginning of time.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.670
Or that we were too dumb
to run the other way

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.680
when we saw the wide
white sails of the ships

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.290
since given the absurd
history of the world,

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.870
everyone is a descendant of slaves.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:05.070 position:56%
Which makes me wonder if outrunning
your captors is not the real meaning

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.370
of Race.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:10.700
I think of the girl's bark
colored, bi-continental nipples

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.380
when I consider the
African-American.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.290
I think of a string of people
connected one to another

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:20.800
and including the two of us
there in the basement linked

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.770
by a hyphen filled with blood;
linked by a blood-filled baton

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:29.100
in one great historical
relay [laugther].

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.400
That's great.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.240
I keep feeling I need to
give it to you every time.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.700
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I'll take it.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.550
I'll take it.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:42.060
Again, and again in that
poem, you reject the sort

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.050
of generalized statements about
African Americans in favor

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.700
of your own person experience.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.000
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure [laughter].

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.160
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Is it a poem
about being the subject of a sort

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.950
of sociological description
that's not comfortable,

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:59.440
it doesn't really describe you.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.570
Doesn't describe your
own experience, is that?

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:06.650
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I will
say what I try to say

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:10.150
to like my students especially
at the beginning of the year

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:13.600
in a workshop which is,
I mean identity is fine,

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.350
but personality is just
so much more interesting.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.280
So, I think of poems
trying to get at something

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.370
like personality not identity.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:25.190
Because if I just do identity, I am
playing into like received notions.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:26.490
But personality can include that.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.790
I mean I am black.

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:30.840
I am from the south, I am tall,
like all of that stuff is true.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.960
But there's also other things, like
my mamma cut my Kermit the Frog up.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.300
Like is that identity
or is that personality?

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.720
So, like in all those
gestures before.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.430
I mean this is something that
I'm, you know I an articulate now,

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:45.850
I couldn't have articulated
it when I wrote that poem.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:51.230
But I do think mostly I'm
trying to do something with a,

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.610
particularize I guess what
we think of as identity.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:54.910
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:56.320
Yes. And in a poem called

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.060
"Roots" you write my parents
would have had me believe

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.090
that there was no such thing as
race there in the wild backyard.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:08.070
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, I
mean they just didn't really.

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:09.430
I mean this was the eighties.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:14.270
This was like after integration so
I think they thought we didn't need

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:15.580
to have that conversation.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.040
Maybe they still kind of.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.340
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You
were just who you were.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.640
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.750
Yeah. And again, that's
like am I a poet or not.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.130
Not speaking about it
had some advantages,

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.240
and there were obviously
disadvantages too.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.660
Which is to say if I'm
linking things together,

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.790
like not quite understanding why my
father would like you know beat me

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.410
because a white boy
pushed me in the water.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.590
Not quite understanding
until I'm older.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.250
And so, I mean my problem is that I
would try to talk to my kid at six

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.260
and seven about what
the implications were

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.070
and probably not be right.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:50.100 position:56%
So, I can't say that he was wrong to
day, you know you'll figure it out.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.480
But that certainly was how
they dealt generally with race.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:56.680
It just wasn't, maybe it looked too
abstract and too complicated except

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.410
for in you know life and death
situations to really talk about.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:02.960
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Then, "The New
Yorker" comes along they say this

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.260
about you.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.770
"Racial trauma is everywhere
in Hayes' work.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.150 position:56%
Instantiated by his personal ghosts.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.620
An absent father, a mother
who worked as a prison guard,

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.210
an array of family
troubles and damage."

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.660
It sounds like you just
barely escaped with your life.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.660
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Like everybody
is what I think when I see that.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.550
Again, this is my personality.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:22.850
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Spends
their life like running

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:24.150
through a ghetto being shot at.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:25.450
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
but this is a thing

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:28.920
about you know an 88-year-old
woman who lived in a white house

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.490
with a white dog and a white car.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.110
Like yeah, that sounds terrible.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.630
But I bet you could
make a poem out of that.

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:35.930
You know what I mean.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:40.100
So, I hear that, I've never
thought of it as good or bad.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.070
I mean in a way we don't think
of our lives as good or bad.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.430 position:56%
We think of it as you know a series
of peaks and valleys, ups and downs.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.150
So, I see that.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:51.430
And I think it's true, but it's
not, it wouldn't be the way

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:53.630
that I would I think about my life,
it would be a little too simple.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.490
But certainly, there's drama.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:58.540
I mean I like drama, so.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.860
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Your
life was not a series

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.930
of horrible racial
heartaches, though.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.230
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: No, no, no.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:06.080
Or if they were nobody told me, so.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.220
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I want you
to read a poem called "Pine."

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.520
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Okay.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:15.000
So, it sounds like you
gravitate towards the real kind

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.840
of confessional autobiographical
stuff, or maybe that's all I write.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.140
I have been told that.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You know one of the
issues with this series is that some

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.730
of your more excremental
poems have to be seen.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:27.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure, sure.

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:28.330
This is true.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:29.630
This is true.

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:30.930
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Like
you've got some great.

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:32.550
Like the poem that's
arranged like a crime report.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:33.850
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
Right, right, right.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:35.150
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It doesn't
play when you read it.

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:36.450
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
I've maybe read it out once.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:37.750
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You have to
show it to them to see it.

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:39.670
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: But these
are I just keep picking up poems

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:40.970
and saying, yeah that happened.

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:42.450
Because this poem sounds
unbelievable.

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.900
But this too is fairly accurate.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.420
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And this
is based on an experience

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.010
with you and one of your buddies.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.310
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: That's right.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.610
That's right.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:56.010
So, the epigraph is, is
this one long sentence?

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:57.310
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I didn't
notice that.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.610
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
it might be I have to see.

00:48:58.610 --> 00:48:59.920
I do like a long sentence.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's very narrative.

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.490
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Right, right.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.720
So, the epigraph is Larry
Levis I still had two friends,

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.020
but they were trees.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:13.140
We were just talking about
trees, you got me reading "Pine."

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.720
Okay. "Pine."

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.940
In the dark we loved
someone's far-fetched bounty

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:22.760
from a truck's black cab
and it was a bad idea.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.960
In the bedevilment, better
than the rocks we'd thrown

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.730
at the dogs behind each low fence.

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:31.990
The branches we'd torn from
samplings barley rooted

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.640
to the fields, Boomie and I, our
heads in a swivel of trouble.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.690
Our two tongues sweeping
distractions, a few hours' worth

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:45.550
of wrong turns behind us, we were
restless and miles from home.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.480
Dark boys roaming in the dark.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.300
Okay, there's a period.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:54.580
We found a pick-up truck
unlocked outside a small hotel

00:49:54.580 --> 00:50:00.390
and in its cab trash bags fat with
clothing and housewares, a toaster

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:05.550 position:56%
and vacuum waiting to be used again
by someone checked in for the night.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:08.860
Maybe a runaway wife,
reversing her dreams.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.860
A streak of red wine
sleeping on her tongue,

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.710
while elsewhere her
husband was in the dark,

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.220
because he didn't know
yet she was gone.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.550
She was gone.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:22.290
For no good reason, we took
the bags from the truck

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:25.770
and plopped them below the pine
trees, which like very thing

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.500
in the dark belonged to us.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.930
And to anyone approaching our
laughter must have sounded

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.310
like the laughter of crows.

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:37.250
Those birds that leave
everything beneath them,

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.350
trampled and broken open.

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:43.910
Those birds dark enough to
bury themselves in the dark.

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:48.860
But we were not crows and we were
not quiet until it was too late.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:53.170
I was thrown against the tree as
if I weighed less than a shadow.

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:57.480
A hand clutched the back of my
neck as if it wasn't a neck.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.960
Cuffed later inside
the breakproof glass,

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.590
I watched the policeman
nuzzling everything we touched.

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:09.870
Slithering, their faces calculating
absolutes while the trash bags

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:13.340
shimmered in a fiasco of light.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:18.270
When I looked up, I saw Boomie
nearly twenty feet high in the arms

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.150
of a pine almost nothing visible,

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:24.120
but his white shirt
and white shorts.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:29.420
I could feel him feeling as
sorry for me as I felt for him.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.140
And I said nothing.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:34.960
Think of what the tree might
have said If it could speak.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.470
Hold me for a moment
then, let me go.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.860
Something an unhappy housewife
might say to her husband

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.430 position:56%
on the last night of their marriage.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:50.130
Or a boy to policemen when
he's locked in a squad car.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:54.210
I heard a voice between
their voices issuing numbers,

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:56.840
codes and uninterpretable verses.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.610
Addresses in a bewildered city.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:04.220
I was to be taken somewhere
and given a name more bona fide

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:08.390
and afflicted, I was to be shot
through the knee and then shot

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:11.650
through the jaw, Boomie
must have thought.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:13.640
Even when the scene was clear.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.640
He must have remained.

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:20.250
It must have been like clinging
to the massive leg of God.

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:23.480
If the leg of God is
covered in bark.

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:27.650
If prayer is like waiting for the
darkness beneath you to change

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:30.340
into something else,
if it's like waiting

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.760
in the darkness to be changed.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.500
Yeah, that's true [laughter].

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.050
The wildest day.

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:39.390
Yeah he was up there man.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:42.290
He was like, you know pine trees
don't have branches on them.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:44.810
So, yeah I barely read these
poems so it's sort of like I'm

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:47.390
in a bar remembering an
antidote or something, but.

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:48.690
How did he climb?

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:50.160
That was like climbing
like a telephone pole.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.690
And he just held on to it.

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.120
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: But the first
time you mention him up there

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:57.630
in a tree, I mean, right?

00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:59.980
I mean you think the worst.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.280
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
So, you know because.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.890
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: White police.

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:04.870
A black guy up in a tree.

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:06.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Right yeah, yeah.

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:07.610
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's a shock.

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:09.330
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: And one
locked in the car, locked in it.

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:13.260
But you know because it's
new I can still see the lines

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.300
that have alike a little bit more
heat on it or, so that's kind

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.720
of nice about reading it.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.980
Of all the things that I said, like
I could feel him feeling as sorry

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.280
for me as I felt for him.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.580
That was what I remembered, that's
really what I took from the night,

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.570
looking up at, I could see him,
I didn't know where he had gone.

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:32.610
But because I was bent
over and handcuffed.

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:35.060
But when I looked up I saw him.

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:39.400 position:56%
And then the question was am I
going to say anything, should I say?

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.250
Because I was so tall they
figured we were grownups.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.980
But had they seen him they
would have figured we were kids,

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.530 position:56%
you know because they didn't believe
me when I was like I've 15, I'm 15.

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.410
So, anyway, but I just
thought I'm not.

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:53.420
But then I just thought about as
hard as it would be, I mean as long

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.940
as it took them to kind of take in
the scene he held onto the tree.

00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:02.510
So, I didn't say anything and
then they took me to the place

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:07.330
that we were staying and
when his mom came out she was

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.230
like where is he and
of course her mind went

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:10.630
to the most terrible things.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:12.900
What did you do to my son,
these two guys were together

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.200
and he's not here.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.500
And they were like
what are you talking

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.720
about this was the only kid
there and he wasn't back yet.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.770
It had been a minute and so they
were confused and then I was

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:24.160
like he's up the tree,
y'all, he was up the tree.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.730
And then the cops were
looking at me like what,

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:27.030
what are you talking about.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.920
So, they let me out, you
know, a lot of fanfare.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.640
And then he did really hold
on for as long as he could

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.990
and eventually he did come home.

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:37.420
And he was scraped up and you
know he had been wearing shorts.

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.850
He looked like he had you
know been hit by a tree.

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:45.570
So, when I think about that like
what was better to be clinging

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:49.420 position:56%
onto that tree above the scene or to
be down beneath it experiencing it.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:53.840 position:56%
So anyway, so that's the line I hear
when I see it because that was my,

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.200
I felt bad for him and I
know he felt bad for me,

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.500
like who has it worse here?

00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.800
Like that.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.100
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Definitely you.

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.990
I mean it's hard not to read a
poem like that in the context

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.400
of the year we just
described, right.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.640
And seeing so many people
shot down by police,

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.610
sometimes without any
apparent provocation.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:10.910
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure.

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:12.210
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:13.510
But a dead man can still have pity.

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.620
I mean I think we know
that form the outside.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.210
So, I didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:20.280
I didn't know if I was going to
be, I talked them into taking me

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.100
to this place, back to the
house, but I just kept thinking

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:28.640 position:56%
about in the horror of like are they
going to see me, am I going to fall.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.580
So, I still think about how
frightened he must have been,

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.460
how still thinking more
about what that would look

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.830
like for him than it was for me.

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:38.630
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You
weren't that afraid?

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:41.740
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Well
he was a good distraction.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.810
I might have been afraid
until I saw him up the tree,

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:45.850
you know like what's
happening, what the?

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:50.780
You know so that is, that always
comes back to me more than my fear.

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:55.510
So, I did tell the cops my mom was
a prison guard and I was trying

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:56.810
to sweet talk my way out of it.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:59.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Okay let's take a
little break just a few minutes just

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:03.360
to stand up and shake our legs out

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.900
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
Y'all are so patient.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.430
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: These
are great poems.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:14.310 position:56%
I want to look a little further back
in the issue of race and history.

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:18.150
You do a lot of deconstructing
of American history,

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:19.470
it reminded me a little bit

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:22.790
about the way Natasha
Trethewey does it looking back

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:24.090
at myths and figures.

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:26.530
I think yours are a little funnier
maybe, a little [inaudible].

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:27.830
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sometimes.

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:29.130
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Sometimes.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.430
A little playful.

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:31.730
You've got a poem called the
"Black Confederate Ghost."

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:33.030
This is just fantastic.

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:35.280
If you'd read that poem for us.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.580
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure.

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.940
Sure.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.810
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's
in your latest book.

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:43.110
Where am I.

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:45.270
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: It's
in there somewhere.

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:51.630
Yes. "The Black Confederate
Ghost Story."

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:55.690
Attention African-American
apparitions hung,

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.740
burned or drowned before
anyone alive was born,

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:04.130
please make a mortifying midnight
appearance before the handyman

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:07.200
standing on my porch
this morning with a beard

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.560
as wild as Walt Whitman's.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.490
Except he is the anti-Whitman,
this white man

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:16.830
with confederate pins littering
his denim cap and jacket.

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:21.970
And by "mortify" dear ghosts, I
mean scare the snot out of him.

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:25.340
I wish I were as tolerant
as Walt Whitman waltzing

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:30.330
across the battlefield like a
song covering a cry of distress,

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:34.780
but I want to be a storm
covering a confederate parade.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.610
The handyman's insistence
that there were brigades

00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:41.710
of black confederates is
as oxymoronic as terms like

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:44.390
"civil war," "free slave."

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:46.510
It is the opposite of history.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.540
Goodbye plantations
doused in Sherman's fire

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.120
and homely lonesome women
weeping over blue and gray bodies.

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.950
Goodbye colored ghosts.

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:59.100
You could have headed north
if there was a south to flee.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:04.310
In Louisiana north still begins
with Mississippi, as far as I know.

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:07.180
East is Alabama, west is Texas,

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.710
and here is this fool
telling me there were blacks

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:11.980
who fought to preserve slavery.

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.500
Goodbye slavery.

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:16.450
Hello black accomplices
and accomplished blacks.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.750 position:56%
Hello Robert E. Lee bobble head doll

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:21.670
on the handyman's dashboard
whistling Dixie

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:24.660
across our post racial country.

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:29.270
Last night I watched several hours
of television and saw no blacks.

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:31.440
NASDAQ. NASCAR.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.020
Nadda Black.

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:35.060 position:56%
I wish there were more ghost stories

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:39.270
about lynched negroes haunting
the mobs that lynched them.

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:45.040
Do I believe no one among us
was alive between 1861 and 1865?

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.850
I do and I don't.

00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:51.330
We all have to go somewhere and
we are probably already there.

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:54.660
I know only one ghost story
featuring a brother in Carrolton,

00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:58.130
Alabama, dragged to the
center of town in a storm

00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:00.490
for some crime he didn't commit.

00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:03.060
As he was hung lightning
struck a window

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.430
on the courthouse he's
been haunting ever since.

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:10.310
Attention apparitions, this
is a solicitation very much

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:11.610
like a prayer.

00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:13.700
Your presence is requested tonight

00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:17.350
when this man is polishing his
civil war relics and singing

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:19.810 position:56%
"Good Ol' Rebel Soldier" to himself.

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:21.550
Hello sliding chairs.

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:24.070
Hello vicious whispering shadows.

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:27.800
I'm a reasonable man, but I
want to be as inexplicable

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.860
as something hanging a
dozen feet in the air.

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:35.050
So, the last time I
read this poem, I think,

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:37.500
or I think it must have been the
last time, maybe I've read it once

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:41.840
since then, was in like Phoenix,
Arizona and then we had like Q&amp;A

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:45.700 position:56%
and a brother came to the mic and he
said, well you know blacks did fight

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.540
for the confederacy and I was like,

00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:50.800
yeah but that's neither here
nor there, did they fight

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.100
to preserve slavery, you know.

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.540
So, but it is a similar thing to
what I was saying to the student

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.810
which is to say, but it's you
know, it's so much more nuance.

00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:01.420
Like if you work in those extremes,
like you can't write that poem

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.040
because there were blacks who
fought for the confederate.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.920
And I would say you just missed
the whole point, you miss the point

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.050
of what I'm trying to
you know to communicate.

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:09.350
But you know that happens

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:13.050
where people are doing
weird fact checking,

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:15.940
and I was like do truth checking
don't do fact checking so.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:17.720
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That is a
really rye poem though isn't it.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.870
I mean to call up all the
lynched ghosts of the past

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:22.640
to come haunt this Confederate.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.940
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:26.660
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: As he polishes
his old metals and gets ready

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.590 position:56%
for his next civil war re-enactment.

01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:30.430
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Well,
you know this is one

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:32.310
that is pretty much imagine.

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:35.940
Because a dude, and I have seen
them, but it was actually my wife.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.520
He came over to do something, to
fix something when I wasn't there

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.160
and then when I came
back, she told me.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.770
And I was like you know
I've got to write that poem.

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:45.170
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The little
bobble head in the car.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:46.470
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Right.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:48.530
So, I made, I just made
myself interact with him.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.110
Because otherwise I would
have had to found him

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.760
and like do something to him, so.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.790
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It is amazing
to me that we still have

01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:59.180
to have this argument about the
confederate flag, about history.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.480
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.900
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It
just takes so long.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Right yeah, yeah.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.660
I mean I don't know if I'm, I find
it interesting is what I would say.

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.900
I don't know if I think that
there's a corner to turn.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.960
So, obviously, he gets a
poem because he's interesting

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.630
and I mean everything in the poem.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:18.410
But I also think, well you know
this is whatever his reality is,

01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:21.300
let me see if I can
engage this a little bit.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.320
However, crazy and backward it is.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.010
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And subjective
of a certain amount of satire.

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:27.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, yeah, yeah.

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:28.610
That's how I'm getting my revenge.

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:31.040
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right, yeah.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.730
It seems like a very
political poem to me.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:34.030
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, yeah.

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:35.540
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Does poetry, I
mean should poetry be political.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.840
Can it be political.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.140
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sometimes.

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.440
I don't think a poem
is ever one thing.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.800
Like a metaphor is never one thing.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.630
But I think of myself as an
engaged citizen in the world.

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:49.070
I think of myself with a
deep interest of politics.

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:52.970
You know. Yeah, I mean I can't
get enough of CNN you know.

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:54.770
But it's also I mean, if I talk

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:56.420
about myself part of
it is spectacle.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.780
Like there is something
inherently spectacular

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:02.250
about how people become politicians

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.310
and how people themselves
are political in a way

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.030
that you know he's a spectacle.

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:08.380
He's got confederate
flag, and he really did.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.960
You know his truck is all of that.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.570
So, like that is political,
but it's political because it's

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:15.870
like wow you know like
what is that all about.

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:19.330
So if you think of politics in
that way, like something to do

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:22.500
with the way people sort of what
people believe their belief system,

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.790
it's very difficult
to not be political.

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:28.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In one of your poems
you refer to our hysterical country.

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:29.640
You mean funny there.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.940
You mean.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:33.180
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Hysteria, and
how else are you going to deal

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.240
with the sab I mean it
has to be hysterical.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.450
So, it has to be satire, because
otherwise it's too tragic.

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.110
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: There's
another, I didn't notice it,

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:43.350
but it also has a Halloween
effect with the

01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:45.580
"Elegies with Zombies for Life."

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.370
That's a very political poem.

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:51.740
Read that for us.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.790
It has to do with a political
issue that cuts both ways.

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.090
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure.

01:02:56.090 --> 01:02:57.390
Sure.

01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:58.690
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Where is that?

01:02:58.690 --> 01:02:59.990
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
It's in the same book.

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:01.290
It's in "How to be Drawn."

01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:04.210
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:06.070
Yeah, I wouldn't know,
as again writing

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:07.650
about trees, people up trees.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:11.820 position:56%
I wouldn't know how to not really be
political because I just think it's,

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:17.450
I mean a person can chose to deny
their sense of the political,

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:19.890
but can one not be political,
I don't think that that's true.

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:21.190
I think that you can decide not to.

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:23.670
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: But a poem that
has a strong political thing

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:26.430
that we all got would be
a bad poem, wouldn't it?

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:28.270
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, generally.

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:29.570
Again.

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:30.870
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Argument.

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:32.170
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Generally.

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:33.520
You know but those kinds of things
make me feel like, oh I should try

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.150
to do that you know what I
mean, like is see as a kind

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.780
of a challenge more
than as an absolute

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.180
when we think about like what.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.670
So, there are poems and
usually persona poems like the

01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:46.920
"Blue Baraka" is somewhere here
and that was me trying to be

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.400
like well Baraka, is like
you know he wants you

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.660 position:56%
to know exactly how political he is.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.380
And so, I was like well I'll just
take on, anyway that's separate.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:00.580
So, this is "Elegies
with Zombies for life."

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.430
The trouble with living

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:05.730
like thinking is feeling
is it's not really living.

01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:07.060
So to me that's a political
statement.

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:11.160
That is me thinking about
since politics is so rooted

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.940
in really thinking, you know
kind of like a sense of morality.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.240
Like is morality feeling

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.640
or is morality thinking
you know what I mean,

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.480
like but if that's how you're
living, are you really living.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.780
Anyway. Sorry.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:24.150
The trouble with living
like thinking is feeling,

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:26.110
is it's not really living.

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:30.800
I think, for example, these are
good times save the mornings I want

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.710
to say "Shame on you motherfuckers"

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:37.830
to the motherfuckers trafficking
homemade posters of death

01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:41.100
on the corner between
my home and the cemetery

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.540
that holds among its dead the bones

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:48.330
of the great pianist Mary Lou
Williams, the mother of jazz.

01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:52.190
Music was her child
Because she had no child.

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:55.660
For Mother's Day my
children and I took my wife

01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:03.740
to visit Mary Lou's headstone
May 8, 1910-May 28th, 1981.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:10.360
We found it unmoored and
untended, Unattended on a hillside.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:14.380
People who say don't live in
the past Don't have a real sense

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.240
of the past, would
you agree with that?

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.640
Life is not about what you learn,
really, but what you remember.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.420
I was in a diner once when
I saw a young mother passed

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.190
out with her face in her plate.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:31.370
I have been thinking about
the horrified Expression

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:35.240
of her little boy as a
waiter approached the booth.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.710
Near me a lady in a business suit
sighed, "For that kind of woman,

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:42.150
abortion should be free."

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:46.040
Think about the theory That crime
rates have declined since Roe

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.610
vs wade versus the theory

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:52.470
that sexually transmitted
diseases have increased.

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:57.580
Think about identity versus
ideology versus idiocy,

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:02.410
the Center for Bio-Ethical
Reform versus the Centers

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:05.450
for the Bio-Unethically Formed.

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:11.530
The Center for Life and Hope versus
the Center for Death and Despair.

01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:16.390
Because thinking is feeling, I
think about death All the time.

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:20.750
The food under my nails,
the nails underfoot,

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:24.410
the skullish sockets
packed with dirt.

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:29.300
Maybe the soul is tethered to
the body like an embryo even

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.340
when the body is no longer alive.

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.590
Maybe zombies have taken over.

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:40.500 position:56%
Are you for the humans for life, the
families for life, the armed forces

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.880
for life, or are you
for something else.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.790
Because thinking is feeling there
are thousands of compartments

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:50.280
and pigeon holes in my braid.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.510
There are polemics and porn
flicks and utopian blueprints,

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:59.010
court briefs, sketches, graphs,
philosophical theories like

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:05.160 position:56%
"Cruelty is a form of laziness," but
there is only one version of death.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.650 position:56%
It takes work to imagine the
ineffable, which I think is the word

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:12.790
for something that
can't be eff'd up.

01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:17.660
I think the sanctimonious are
worse than people who hate music.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.550
Would you agree with that?

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:22.830
At this very moment, they
are fighting about the order

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:25.300
of things you should value.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.500
God, family, country, no.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.580
Love, justice, money.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:35.500
I can no longer grasp
the logic of conflicts.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:39.110
In the prolife versus
prochoice debate for instance,

01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:42.490
it's the versus that's
of interest to me.

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:46.350
Remember Fred Williamson saying
to the friend who became his enemy

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:49.770
at the end of "Bucktown," I don't
want to kill you I just want

01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:51.650
to beat the hell out of you.

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:55.240 position:56%
I love the lovely restraint in that.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.110
Cruelty is pretty damn
lazy, actually.

01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:02.580
It takes more effort to earn
someone's love than it does

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.200
to punch someone in the face.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.800
May you be punched in the face,
may you weep until your nose is fat

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.980
and crumpled as the hood
of a child's raincoat.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.740
That's my curse for
the self-righteous.

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:23.020
That's the "Thug Life for Life"
in me, a former self versus a self

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:29.110
who wants to change, Cassius Clay
Versus Muhammad Ali, who said,

01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:33.200
"A man who views the world
The same at fifty as he did

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.950
at twenty has wasted
thirty years of his life."

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:42.010
The trouble with thinking thinking
is feeling is sometimes There is

01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:43.720
no feeling.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.770 position:56%
Twenty years ago, I would not have
believed my unborn child would still

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:53.360
be here pushing a cry out of me.

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.710
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Now that seems
like a great political poem.

01:08:57.710 --> 01:08:59.010
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.830
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Because
it's an attack on this sort

01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:04.660
of reductive political arguments
that dominate our lives.

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.270
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure.

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:08.570
Well, again as I'm reading,

01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:11.410
of course I don't read al the time
there's all these moments where I'm

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:12.930
like well I know exactly
what that's about.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:16.200
You know so Bucktown, there's this
movie, that has Pam Grier in it

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.020
that nobody knows,
and Fred Williamson.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:22.380
There is a scene where the
guy, they go into the town

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.070
and the town has been taken

01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:27.520
over by some white racist
mobsters they had cops actually

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.100
and this dude has a bar I think
but he was like in Vietnam

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.220
and he had some old Black Panther
friends so he calls all them in.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.000
this is Fred Williamson he
calls all these guys he's

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.300
like I'm going to get you guys.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.460
Call my boys in we're going
to fix this right away.

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.360
So, he calls them, they come.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.290
But once they beat up the white
guys, this is what's so great.

01:09:44.290 --> 01:09:46.650
They decide they want
to stay in power.

01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:49.550
So, his friend have suddenly
just taken the place.

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:52.000
So, after all of this, they come
into a moment and now they're

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.930
about to the final scene and Fred
Williamson says to this friend,

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.320
I don't want to kill you.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.400
Which is what you'd
do in the normal kind

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.230
of like black [inaudible] thing
you come and you kill everybody.

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:04.460
But since they're friends he
says, 'I don't want to kill you,

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.410
I just want to beat
the hell out of you.'

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:07.710
And I think like yeah,

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:10.040
that's actually a pretty
ripe political sentiment.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.000
Like you have empathy
for your enemies even

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.410
when they weren't your
former best friend.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:17.100
But you know you confront these
people who have done things.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.020
That have hurt you or hurt
others who are really fucked up

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.400
and essentially, you're
like, you know I just need

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.700
to beat the hell out of you.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.000
I'm not going to kill you though.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.290
So, anyway I thought oh
that's never put in movies.

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:28.560
So, that, I was already
working on the poem

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.220
and there's things around it.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:33.950
But when I'm reading it and I see
that I suddenly had a whole flash

01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:37.140
of Pam Grier in the movie
and loving that moment.

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:40.430
You know it's a terrible movie,
but I don't want to kill you,

01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:42.650
I just want to beat
the hell out of you.

01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:45.740
That just seems so
right for a T-shirt.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:50.600
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You
have an avocado poem.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.900
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yes.

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:57.040
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: With
my tabs right there.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.590
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: It's in
"Lighthead" wherever that is.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.740
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Here.

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.040
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I just.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.340
I don't. You know I think
about the difference

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.810
between poems and poets and poetry.

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:17.270
I don't even think, I'll say people
first, I don't actually think I

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:19.610
like people, but I like
persons you know what I mean.

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:21.330
Like people always a problem.

01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:22.630
People do really dumb things.

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:24.210
And that same thing about poetry.

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:31.320
Like I think I try to focus on
poems and not too much on poetry.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.920
Which is to say it is always
the very particular things

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.450
that excite me in poems.

01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:40.350
I don't even know what made me say
that, I think it's just something

01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:41.950
about his poem that
made me say that.

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:43.260
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The poem
you're about to read?

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.380
So, I mean I think that's, yeah,
that's a comment on the political.

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.870 position:56%
The particular inside the political.

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:54.140
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You talk about
form in one of your poems

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.480
about how you, you know that line?

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.900
Can I just pull it up here?

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.940
I care less and less about
the shapes of shapes.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.840
Because forms change and nothing
is more durable than feeling.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.740
That seems to be reflective
of all the different kinds

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.050
of forms you're experimenting with.

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:11.350
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure.

01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:16.980
Sure. Shapes are good, but
they are not as permanent.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.740
You can think about
translation that way too,

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.330
like when you're a translator,
you're trying to think of a sense

01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:24.190
of feeling more than even
a sense of like precision,

01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:27.630
or a sense of form, I think often.

01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:29.920
Sometime you could
get both, but yeah,

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.180
that would be generally
how I think of the world.

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.740
You know the most enduring
thing would be feeling even more

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.750
than thinking.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:40.050
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: "Avocado."

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:41.350
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Okay.

01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:43.730
"Avocado."

01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:49.780
In 1971, drunk on the sweet,
sweet juice of revolution,

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:53.390
a crew of us marched into the
president's office with a list

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:57.530
of demands, the black man tells
us at the February luncheon,

01:12:57.530 --> 01:13:00.060
and I'm pretending I
haven't heard this one before

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:04.920
as I eye black tortillas on a
red plate beside a big green bowl

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.930
of guacamole made from the
whipped, battered remains

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:11.780 position:56%
of several harmless former avocados.

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:16.850
If abolitionists had a flag it
would no doubt feature the avocado,

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:20.330
also known as the alligator
pear, for obvious reasons.

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:24.810 position:56%
Number one, reparations, enough gold
to fill each of our women's wombs.

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:27.220
Gold to nurse our warriors waiting

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.050
to enter this world
with bright fists.

01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:32.470
That's what we told them, the
man says, and I'm thinking

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:37.390
if the money colored flesh of the
avocado, high in monosaturates.

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:40.740
Its oil content is
second only to olives.

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:45.840
I am looking at Yoyo's caterpillar
locks dangle over her ear.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.470
I dare you to find a lovelier
black woman from Cincinnati,

01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:51.610
where the North touches the South.

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:54.100
Three, we wanted more
boulevards named

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.920
for the Reverend Dr.
Martin Luther King,

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.860
Jr. An airport Named
for Sojourner Truth.

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.700
The roots of the avocado
tree can raise pavement,

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:06.630
so it's not too crazy to imagine
the fruit as a symbol of revolt

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:08.460
on the abolitionist flag.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:12.200
We are all one kind of
abolitionist or another, no doubt.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:17.090
And we are like the avocado too
with its inedible ruby colored seed

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:21.270 position:56%
that can actually sprout from inside
when the fruit is over mature,

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.840
causing internal molds
and breakdown.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.770
Demand number twenty-one, a
Harriet Tubman statue on the mall.

01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:32.460
Brother man is weeping now and
walking wet tissue to the trash can

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:36.070
and saying, Harriet Tubman
was a walking shadow,

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:41.050
or he is saying Harriet Tubman
walked in shadows, or, to many,

01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:42.850
Harriet Tubman was a shadow.

01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:44.430
To walk in.

01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:46.360
And the meaning is pureed flesh

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.650
with lime juice minced
garlic, and chili powder.

01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:53.810
It is salt, and pepper Harriet
Tubman tossed over her shoulder

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:56.150
to trouble the bloodhounds.

01:14:56.150 --> 01:15:02.270
Many isolated avocado trees fail
to fruit from lack of pollination.

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:03.570
Goddam, ain't you hungry?

01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:08.660
I whisper to Yoyo, and she puts a
finger to my lips to distract me.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.360
Say, baby, wasn't that you
waking me up last night

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.830 position:56%
to say you'd had a dream where I
was a big luscious man Size avocado?

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.140
Someone's belly is growling.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.910
We weren't going to be colored.

01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:23.750
We weren't going to
be negro the man says.

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.330
And I'm thinking every
time I hear this story,

01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:29.190
it's the one telling the
story that's the hero.

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:33.630
Hush now, Harriet Tubman probably
said near down, pointing a finger,

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.660
black enough to be her pistol
barrel toward the future,

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:39.890
or pointing a pistol barrel
black enough to be her finger,

01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:43.240
at the mouth of some
starved stammering slave

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:46.040
and then lifting her head
to listen for something

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.210
that no one but her could hear.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:51.730
She did have that dream too.

01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:54.330
I think that's what
started that one.

01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:58.020
An actual dream where
I was an avocado.

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.480
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Now, they did
not read this poem at the opening

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.140
of the African American
Museum last week, why?

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.320
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES:
It's too complicated,

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.170
it's too personal maybe.

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:11.550
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah,
it's more than that.

01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:12.850
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, why?

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:17.060
There's a few things in it
I mean the question like,

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.380
who's getting made fun of
in it I think is part of it.

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:21.120
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I mean someone
like John Lewis is standing

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.180
up there telling about the
great stories the great heroes

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.250
and you're like, you know.

01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:29.180
Basically, coming on to this
woman and thinking about avocados.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.530
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: But
you know that line is,

01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:33.090
I was just thinking
about inflecting.

01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:35.030
Like every time I hear this story.

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:36.640
You know every time
I hear this story,

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.150
it's the one telling the
story that's the hero.

01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:43.630 position:56%
Or every time I hear that story is
the one telling the story that's the

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:44.930
hero [laughter].

01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:46.230
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:47.530
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: You know so,

01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:48.830
and both those things
are true, you know.

01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:52.350
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: But this poem
does sort of undercut, doesn't it?

01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:53.650
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Well when she's.

01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:56.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The sanctity of what
he's describing with a little humor.

01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.440
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, I
would say that's the thing

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.080
about like the either or dynamic.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.450
Versus like that, what I just
did with that inflection,

01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:03.860
like I'm trying to do both.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.720
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Maybe the young
man is the one being made fun of.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.280
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
the star stammering slave.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.620 position:56%
Like the young man who keeps talking
about the avocado, is where she's

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.220
like shut up man let's
get out of here.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:17.510
So, that's the sort of parallel
that's happening at the end

01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:21.840
of the poem without saying it like
overtly, but like who is the fool

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.120
in the room is really one
of the questions to kind of,

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.510
the question with soft
answers around it I guess.

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:31.390
Like, maybe it's this person,
maybe it's that person.

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:35.530 position:56%
Yeah, but that I think again, that's
interesting to me around politics,

01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:38.100
as opposed to like the hard, and
maybe that's what I was thinking

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.800
about when I was bringing
up like the particular

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.330
versus a general sense of
politics, which is like politics

01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:46.920
in that moment where no matter
what, it could have been MLK,

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.140
but if you're hungry, you're hungry
you know, like okay how am I going

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.950
to talk about both these things.

01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:55.580
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah, it's
brilliant it really is.

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.580
It really is brilliant.

01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:02.130
Let's end with "How to Draw
an Invisible Man," shall we.

01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:03.430
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Okay.

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:04.730
Sure, sure.

01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:07.720
That's one sentence.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:11.060
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: We're playing
off of one of the great.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.360
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: It's in
your lap, the "How to Draw."

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.090
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The great
American writers and one

01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:20.630
of the great American images,
metaphors in American literature.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:23.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure, sure.

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:24.900
"How to Be Drawn."

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.600
Yeah, I mean I don't know.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.310
I mean you know what I would
say is that like, certainly I,

01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:32.780
I'm still just on the politics.

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.080
So, attitude is everything.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.530
Race, masculinity gender
marriage, southerners.

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:42.060
I just sort of feel like that is
like what I eat, it's what I live.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:46.600
So, I never feel like I'm working
super hard to be that in poems.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.350
I say that because so
certainly when I see poems,

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.040
something that I keep saying,
and I'm looking at this

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.520
because like what am
I most excited about?

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.480
I just said it that
it's one sentence.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.430
So, all the other stuff I just
know that I try to be conscious,

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:04.410
I try to be transparent, I try to
be honest, I try to be empathetic

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:06.620
and then I say if I'm
trying to be that,

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:08.550
sometimes the poems clarify that.

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:13.180 position:56%
But I don't write the poems as a way
to like necessarily even advocate

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:15.380
for it, because I feel like
that's what the real life is for.

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:16.680
You know what I mean.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.980
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: If you were
advocating the poem would be dead,

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.280
right?

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.580
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Right, right.

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.880
So, instead I say, can I
write one long sentence.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.900
I mean there's other stuff going
on, but essentially like a kind

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.400
of technical question
because I think,

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:31.410 position:56%
you know everything I've done before
I sat down, will come to bear.

01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:32.710
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah,

01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:34.780
but a dramatically technical
poem would not be of interest

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.210
to us if that's all it was.

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:37.510
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: I know it.

01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:40.490
But I'm sort of talking about
like, my, what excites me

01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:41.790
or my concerns around the poem.

01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:46.000
They're always the same as others,
even if the poem is advocating

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.270
for you know a better world and
a better life, I would say well

01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:50.540
that starts first in the poet.

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.420
Like if the poet is
trying to like chase

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.130
that where you hope the
poem will show that.

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:57.140
What that means then as
a poet, and I mean again,

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:58.690
I'm sort of talking as a teacher.

01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:00.350
So, what you're saying to
the student is like well,

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:01.650
think about something else.

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:04.410
Like, say that you are trying
to be transparent regardless

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:06.420
of what your political
affiliation is.

01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.520
And instead work on a
long sentence and hope

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.990
that that process will reveal what
you really think about the world.

01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:16.400
And then trust that even
if it's a slanted view,

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.660
or a wrong view, trust that.

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.580
Focus on something else
will illuminate that.

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.440
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I can see all
that, but what makes your poetry

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.080
so spectacular seems to me,

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.410
are those sudden shifts
of theme and image.

01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:28.710
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Sure, sure.

01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:30.590
I mean it's true, I mean
I'm not unaware of it.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:33.850
I guess I'm just sort of
saying, like what comes first,

01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:36.280
or where my pleasure is in it.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:40.830
And so, it's not that I like have
made a large political statements

01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:43.100
so much as like wow I got
that all in one sentence.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:49.010
All right anyway, "How to
Draw and Invisible Man."

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:53.640
And then when Ralph
Ellison's corpse burst open,

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.230
I discovered his body had been
hoarding all these years a luscious

01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:03.380
slush, a sludge of arterial
words, the raw and unsaid pages

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:07.450
with their plots and propositions,
with their arcs of intention

01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:11.130
and babbling, with their
mumbling streams and false starts

01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:16.060 position:56%
and their love and misanthropic
thrusts, tendons of syntax unraveled

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:20.430
from his bones and intestinal
cavities, the froth of singing,

01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:25.640
stinging, stinking ink, reams of
script fraught with the demons,

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.590
demagogues and demigods
of democracy,

01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:31.090
demographics of vague landscapes,

01:21:31.090 --> 01:21:33.670
passages describing
muddy river bottoms

01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:37.680 position:56%
and elaborate protagonists crawling
through a foliage greener than money

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.710
in America before America thought
to release anyone from its dream,

01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:46.620
the water-logged monologues one
who is unseen speaks burst suddenly

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.320
from Ralph Ellison's
body and because I mean

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.710
to live transparently,
I am here, bear with me,

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:57.150
describing the contents the
fictions envisioned by Emerson

01:21:57.150 --> 01:22:00.840
and immigrants, the
dogmas, aboriginal progeny,

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:06.350 position:56%
scholastic recriminations, dementia,
jubilee, hubris in Ralph Ellison,

01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:10.210 position:56%
Duke Ellington's shadow, a
paragraph on the feathered headdress

01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:14.390
of Marcus Garvey, some of it was
pornography, some of it alluded

01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:18.240
to Negros who believe educating
black kids means teaching them

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.970
to help white people
feel comfortable,

01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:24.570
some of it outlined the perks of
invisibility, how we are obliged

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:28.300
to eschew the zoo, the farm
animals, it had something to do

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:32.100
with captivity, flayed in the
clinical light the notes printed

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:36.460
on the underside of his flesh were
reversed but readable mirrored

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:39.350
in the metal of the
medical table and I wanted

01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:43.500
to print it all properly in
a posthumous book in the name

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.370
of prosperity and proof the genius
we believed he'd wasted had been

01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:53.280 position:56%
waiting all these years for a
simple death sentence to break free.

01:22:58.790 --> 01:23:00.730
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Do you
feel yourself writing

01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:03.180
in the shadow of Ralph Ellison?

01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:10.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: So, here's like,
the dream would be to write Baldwin,

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:12.040
but I sort of go at Baldwin

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.850
with so much reverence he becomes
a harder figure to personify.

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:20.680
But like Baraka, and so when I
say like misanthropic thrust,

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.350
because you know, I don't know
how many people know this,

01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:24.520
but you know Ralph Ellison
was quite an asshole.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.820
Did you know that about
Ralph Ellison?

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.120
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I actually
met him once.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.420
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:29.720
yeah I don't know what he
was like when you met him.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.020
Was he an asshole?

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.320
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Very old.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.620
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Oh, okay.

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.920
Maybe he was nicer at that point.

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.220
But I never met him,
but that's the word,

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.300
even Tony Morrison
said it so [laughter].

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.780
And so that became
interesting to me.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:44.010
In addition to the great dilemma
which is in the poem which is

01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:45.350
like where is the rest of the work?

01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:46.650
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right.

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:47.950
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: You know?

01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:49.250
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Old decade, after
decade waiting for that next book.

01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:50.550
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: So, I do,

01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:51.850
I mean I love "The Invisible
Man" it's still a favorite book

01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:54.580
of mine, but he becomes subject.

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:57.000
Again, I'm still just talking
about walking about because

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.800
of those tensions, the
tension between like an artist

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:05.110 position:56%
who doesn't necessarily, I don't
want to say live up to his potential

01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:07.030
because he only had to
write "The Invisible Man."

01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:08.330
His essays are good too.

01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:09.720
But does it?

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.370
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Grow,
progress, move.

01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:13.220
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah,
doesn't make you know

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.520
as much as he might have made.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:18.910
And an artist who, is, you know a
misanthrope for whatever reason.

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:20.740
I mean I think we wall
have that in us.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:24.120
But those things kind
of come together

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.230
around like imagine what it
would be like if you know

01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:27.730
if you were like the coroner.

01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:30.470
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: To open up his
body and get at those words.

01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:33.400
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Yeah, so I'm
saying yes he is deeply interesting

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.580
to me, even if I would put in my

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:39.240
like you know universe
of writers, Baldwin.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.640
But the sad thing is that
because Baldwin is above him,

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.350
Baldwin might not necessarily
get a poem.

01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:47.920
You know what I mean, because
like he's unimpeachable.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.870
You know what I mean until
something, one day I wake up

01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:54.330
and I be like what was up with that
and then maybe he'll get something.

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:59.150
But, so yeah he's interesting
but if he was only reference,

01:24:59.150 --> 01:25:00.650
you know it might not be the same.

01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:01.950
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right, yeah.

01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:03.490
This is the most fascinating
evening thank you so much.

01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:05.290
&gt;&gt; TERRANCE HAYES: Thanks, man.

01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:16.520
[ Applause ]

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.870
&gt;&gt; ROBERT CASPER: There,
there we go.

01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:22.990

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:33.700
&gt;&gt; ROBERT CASPER: Grab them
as in pay money for them.

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:38.520
Also, next year we have in
February Brenda Shaughnessy coming.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:40.370
And in April I believe Dana Levin.

01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:42.160
We hope you come back
to Life of a Poet.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.800
And check out all the wonderful
programs here at the Hill Center.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.930
If you need to learn
how to use a knife,

01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:51.250
you can learn how to use a knife.

01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:55.110 position:56%
You need to learn how to write poems
you can learn how to write a poem.
