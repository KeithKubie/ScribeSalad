00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.600
How do con artists manage to scam millions?

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.299
Why do people choose to follow great leaders,
or horrible ones?

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.760
How do CEOs get better deals in the boardroom?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.760
Influence.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.370
It goes by a lot of names.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.800
Emotional intelligence.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.230
Manipulation.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.220
Social skills.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.300
Influence is an important tool that drives
business decisions and social interactions.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.460
But, like all those Spider-Man reboots have
taught us, with great power comes great responsibility.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.170
...Uncle Ben...

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.400
Influence has a dark side too, and can be
used to pressure people into making some pretty

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.410
bad decisions.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.550
So this is basically our defense against the
dark arts episode.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.330
Except instead of Avada Kedavra, we’re going
to fend off some “Influencias Malus” and

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.150
teach you how to use influence for good.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.690
I’m Evelyn from the Internets.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.220
And this is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.740
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.250
Last time, we talked about the rational reasons
for trusting other people.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.740
But you also trust people because of emotional
reasons, like your gut instinct when you first

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.880
meet them.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.690
Sometimes, emotional cues can match up with
cognitive trust.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.510
Maybe someone’s giving you really bad vibes,
and when you scroll down their Twitter feed,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.360
your suspicions are confirmed! I'm not about to get dragged on Black Twitter with you!

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.250
Or your gut might be trying to get you out
of a situation that feels dangerous.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.850
In the words of My Favorite Murder, if you’re
freaked: Pepper spray first.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.850
Apologize later.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.659
Then, there’s the flip side.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.700
You might feel good about someone who turns
out not to be trustworthy.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.040
That smooth-talking ex, for example.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.970
Or a quirky professor who was actually hiding
Voldemort on the back of his head the whole

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.970
time.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270
Influence relies heavily on charisma.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.080
If someone’s more likeable, they tend to
be trusted more easily and can influence others.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.100
As we’ve seen from the #MeToo movement,
or really anytime a popular person does a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.440
horrible thing, having charisma does not
mean someone has good character or is good

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.680
at their job.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.500
Charisma isn’t always nefarious, though.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.299
It can be used as a force of good -- to help
you make a great first impression or give

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.950
a persuasive public speech.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.090
And it’s not some magical gift that’s
bestowed upon you.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.019
Charisma is a skill you can build over time
with the personality traits you’ve got.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.120
Tons of factors play a role.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.230
But to keep it simple, here are three things
that leading organizational psychologists

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.420
say can make you more likeable: confidence,
praise, and optimism.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.659
[That’s it.

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:34.659
Three things.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.659
You got this.]

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.939
Plus, they can also help you think about why
you’re trusting a charismatic person, and

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.319
whether or not you should.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.890
Confidence is the number one way to build
charisma and emotional influence.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.430
It makes you seem more relaxed and capable
in high-pressure situations.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.500
Capable people aren’t always as confident
as they could be.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.340
Maybe you’re shy, or have impostor syndrome
and you’re afraid you don’t belong at

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.340
your job.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.790
Well, we’ve got your back!

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.709
You deserve to be recognized for your achievements,
and there are ways to make yourself shine.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.760
Black Girl Magic.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.390
For example, you can avoid uncertain language,
like ‘maybe,’ ‘in my opinion,’ ‘I

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.219
think’ or ‘I could be wrong.’

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.709
Sure, if you’re a journalist trying to separate
your opinion and a citation, these phrases

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.019
can be helpful.

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.680
But in business writing, they can make it
seem like you doubt yourself.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.159
And if you know it, show it!

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.709
Simple things like using good posture, projecting
your voice, and making direct eye contact

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.189
can signal confidence.

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.749
Some people use power posing.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.989
And hey, if striking a pose in the bathroom
mirror pumps you up, keep at it.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.819
But there’s no solid proof that this actually
builds confidence.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.709
In general, faking it ‘till you make it
is pretty solid advice.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.889
But if you aren’t sure what you’re talking
about, you can leave things to experts instead

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.480
of risking your credibility.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.040
All of these tips can also help you analyze
why someone else might seem confident, so

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.620
you don’t misplace your trust.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.739
Leslie Knope was confident.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.819
But she also really knew her stuff and had
the policy proposals, experience, and binders

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:06.819
to prove it.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.199
On the other hand, Bobby Newport had a ton
of rich, white man confidence, but he was

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.199
full of air.

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.709
So, avoid being influenced just because someone
acts like they know what they’re doing.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.560
Look for cognitive cues like competence, intent,
and integrity too.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.970
But charisma isn’t just about confidence.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.280
It’s also about how you interact with
other people, which involves way more than

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.699
just being polite.

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.490
Praise is a powerful motivator.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.910
It’s why seeing a gold star on a report
card feels so good.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.889
Sometimes people underestimate the importance
of intrinsic motivators like recognition.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.780
And they overestimate extrinsic motivators,
like money or time off.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.949
Don’t get me wrong.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.949
Equitable pay is a real thing that needs to
happen.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.400
None of this “working for exposure or Instagram followers” stuff.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.659
You need to put food on the table, and bonus
checks are valuable.

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:00.490
But on top of having the time and money to
live comfortably, positive feedback can make

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.620
sure people feel that their work is valued
throughout the year.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.490
Too much praise can make you come across as
fake, though.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.229
And watch out for people who only say nice
things when they want a favor -- they might

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.810
seem trustworthy at first glance, but it’s
manipulative.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.020
Positive feedback makes others feel good.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.689
Optimism can make you feel good, which shows.

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:25.379
While no one can be Chris Traeger, trying
to adopt a positive attitude will literally

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:26.610
make you more charismatic.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.310
This can work wonders for your vibe, your
motivation, and your career.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.819
Malcolm Forbes, you know, the guy that published
the fancy business magazine in waiting rooms

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:40.150
everywhere, once said “The key to success
is not through achievement, but through enthusiasm.”

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.250
There are things beyond our control that can
drastically affect optimism, from tough events

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.480
like the death of a loved one, to mental health
conditions that may require professional treatment.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.710
Generally, though, you can become more optimistic
by learning from mistakes in the past, finding

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.689
things to appreciate in the present, and looking
forward to future opportunities.

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.650
You know those inspirational posters from
the 90’s?

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.539
“Yesterday is history.

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.280
Tomorrow is a mystery.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.639
Today is a gift.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.490
That's why it is called the present.”

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.240
Really, optimism involves having a balanced
outlook.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.879
And sometimes, it’s better to look before
you leap.

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:21.080
If someone’s blindly optimistic about a
situation, but you’re not 100%, don’t

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.919
be afraid to do your own research.

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.569
Now, charisma is a powerful form of influence
that works even when people don’t know

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:28.569
each other very well.

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.979
But the best way to genuinely build emotional
influence is to form strong relationships

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.120
based on mutual honesty and respect.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.190
So treat your coworkers like humans!

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.500
Try using people’s names, and pronounce
them correctly.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.700
It’s an easy thing to do, and makes a big
impact.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.180
And find some common ground with them.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.690
Maybe you’re in the same department, in
the same screenwriting class, or share the

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.020
same fandom.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.370
Beyhive, anyone?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.750
Mutual pettiness can bring people together,
too.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.340
Remember when people were all about Twilight
and whether Bella should end up with Jacob

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.340
or Edward?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.340
There were t-shirts.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.860
It was a whole thing.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.439
But as we all know from Thanksgiving dinner,
some topics can be touchy, like religion or

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.439
politics.

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:14.720
So be thoughtful about what conversations
you bring into the workplace.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.710
So you know how we keep bringing up the light
and dark sides of influence?

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.590
Well, another huge part of that is how humans
frequently judge things based on looks.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.759
Like, you’d probably trust a car from a
fancy dealership more than a vacant lot with

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:32.000
a cardboard sign saying “carz 4 sale heer.”

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.080
So appearances matter.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.969
It might seem superficial, but your look contributes
to professionalism, which impacts promotions,

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:42.550
job interviews, and acceptance in the workplace.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.740
The good news is that you can control big
pieces of your appearance.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.870
Do your hair.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.040
Brush your teeth.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.819
Don’t show up to work in pajamas with pizza
stains from your Stranger Things binge

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:53.819
last night.

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:58.620
It shows you take your job seriously if you
wear clothing that fits your office and profession.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.389
Some businesses have dress codes, uniforms,
or frown upon people wearing something drastically

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:05.560
different.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.389
So find ways to express yourself that fit
your workplace, like wearing that vintage

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.539
dress you love, or trying to pull off a polka
dot bow tie.

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:19.620
But remember that not all aspects of appearance
are within your control -- we have messy biases

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.319
based on gender, race, or even arbitrary things
like attractiveness.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:27.560
And yeah… a lot of the time, it sucks.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.010
You can’t help it if you look eerily similar
to someone’s manipulative ex, or if your

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.340
resting face is… angry.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.580
And sometimes what’s deemed professional
isn’t necessarily fair, like dress code

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.370
policies on natural hair.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.230
So it’s important to recognize what drives
your reasoning for trust.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.600
Like, have you put too much trust in the
demure old lady in pink, when really she has

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.980
a horrible track record and may be entirely
unhinged?

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.620
To see how all these elements tie together,
let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.700
Bernie Madoff was an incredibly charismatic
and well-liked businessman.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.920
He treated his employees like family.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.470
He appeared to value loyalty and honesty.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.990
Now, he’s known as the ‘Wizard of Lies’.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.390
Madoff swindled customers and employees out
of almost 65 billion dollars through one of

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.310
the most costly and destructive Ponzi schemes
of all time.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.390
Ponzi schemes are large-scale investment frauds,
where initial investors contribute money into

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.420
a fake business.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.030
They get quick returns, which lures more investors,
who are all paid out of the same pot.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.410
It works for a while, until the pot runs out
and everything crumbles.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.810
Madoff’s entire persona was crafted to inspire
confidence.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.750
He had a well-manicured look, tailored suits,
and high-end watches.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.700
And he seemed likeable, competent, and dependable.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.960
So some very knowledgeable investors trusted
Madoff, despite seemingly impossible returns.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.960
Which just goes to show that anyone can
be susceptible to emotional influence.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.100
That’s why it’s so important in business
-- and everywhere else -- to think about why

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.510
you’re trusting someone.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.940
Just because someone has the latest ferrari
and a custom suit, it doesn’t mean they’re

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.060
not a snake oil salesman.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.810
Pause for a second when a confident and optimistic
person seems like they’re selling you something

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.420
that’s way too good be true.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.521
If it feels like they’re glossing over key
parts of their business model, trust your

00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:20.980
gut and ask questions.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.581
And if they start using flattery to distract
you while you’re questioning them, maybe

00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:27.710
reconsider who you’re dealing with.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.380
Remember cognitive trust?

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.190
Check their qualifications.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.560
See if they have good intent and a history
of delivering on their promises.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.650
That way, you can put the puzzle pieces together
to make a more complete picture of their character,

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.660
and protect yourself from influential but
shady people.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.420
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.701
Together, your actions, attitude, and appearance
can affect how others see you and the influence

00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:51.880
you have in the workplace and beyond.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.430
So take time to think about the way you’re
being perceived by others, and always use

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.910
your influence wisely.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.330
Don’t make anyone do something they’ll
regret later.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.780
Of everything we talked about, remember these
key takeaways:

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.581
Influence should be used responsibly, and
you can use cognitive trust and emotional

00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:13.640
cues to protect yourself from people who abuse
it.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:20.170
You can up your charisma by acting confident,
praising others, and being optimistic.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:27.330
Finding common ground is the foundation of
relationships and can increase your trustworthiness.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.330
Appearances do matter.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.470
Now that we’ve covered the foundations of
building trust and influence, we can tackle

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.300
the power of communication.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.450
Next time, we’ll look at written work and
making sure you’re sending the right message.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.260
Crash Course Business is sponsored by Google,
and it’s made with the help of all these

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.870
nice people and Thought Cafe is our amazing
animation team.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.770
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.520
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.720
channels like Nature League, with host Brit
Garner as she explores life on Earth and asks

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.050
questions that inspire us to marvel at all
things wild.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.580

free for everybody, forever, you can support
