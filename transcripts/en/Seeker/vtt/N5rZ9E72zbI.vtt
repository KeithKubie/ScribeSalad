00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.470
There are so many incredible images of space
floating around out there.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.490
But is this what space really looks like?

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.490
Well, kinda…

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.030
Let’s start with these big, sweeping images
of nebulas and star-forming regions.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.859
We can’t talk about these space images without
taking a quick look at the electromagnetic

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.859
spectrum.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.260
We can only see this narrow band of visible
light.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.860
But on the shorter end tending towards x-rays
and the longer end tending towards microwaves,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.910
there is still a lot of information for scientists
to glean, so they use telescopes that can

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.160
see in these wavelengths that are invisible
to our eye.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.960
Astronomers take that data and shift the colour
information to frequencies that we can see

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.359
while keeping relative colours constant.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.350
This doesn’t mean they’re not real…
it’s sort of like changing the key of a

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.139
song — it sounds different but still the
same.

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:46.149
Let’s take Hubble as an example.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.100
Hubble can see in visible light like we can,
but using specialize instruments it can also

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.739
see in ultraviolet and infrared light.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.799
Light information hits the digital camera
sensor as a greyscale image -- yep, those

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.499
amazing hubble images have no color.

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.369
Then astronomers add colour data and adjust
for known wavelengths, adding corresponding

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.760
colours and patching different shots together
to give a complete picture.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.970
A great example is these two images of the
Pillars of Creation… three columns of cold

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.820
gas in a star-forming region of the Eagle
Nebula.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.470
The one on the left is seen in visible light
and the one on the right is seen in infrared

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.470
light.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.740
Looking in the infrared, Hubble could see
through the gas and dust -- that blocks our

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.090
vision -- to show stars forming inside the
pillars.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.530
So space sort of looks like both of these
images, but it also doesn’t… it takes

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.410
processing and adding colour data to get this
kind of rich detail.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.700
But there’s another type of space image:
the artist’s rendering.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.150
These are some of the most exciting images,
and also the ones that demand the most guesswork.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.890
Let’s take this image of Trappist-1f as
an example.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.290
Trappist-1f is part of the Trappist-1 system,
we have a video on it.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.530
So, how do we know what the surface looks
like?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.790
Well, we don’t.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.500
Because this is what the data looks like.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.970
But artists consulted with scientists to make
this image.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.570
First, astronomers used the Spitzer telescope
to estimate of the mass of the planet, and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.670
its density; from this information, the scientists
figured out that 1f is likely a rocky planet.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.969
Then, from transit measurements astronomers
know the planet orbits close to its star,

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:16.700
way closer than Mercury does our Sun, so the
star would look big in the sky.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.310
But that star is an ultra-cool dwarf, so it’s
possible for liquid water to exist on the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.790
surface of the planet!

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.659
So they put that in the image too.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.840
And, finally, because the other planets in
the system orbit close to 1f, the scientists

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.299
think you might be able to see them in the
sky.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.299
Et voila!

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.709
An artist’s rendering of Trappist-1f.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.049
Look’s nice.

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.029
So, even if these images aren’t exactly
what we’d see if we were to visit the Pillars

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.029
of Creation (which are gone now, by the way)
or Trappist-1f…

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:47.529
These images not only give us vital information,
they kind of remind us how exciting it is

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.639
to find new things in space.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.000
