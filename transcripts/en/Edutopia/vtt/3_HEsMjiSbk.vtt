00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:09.186
&gt;&gt;Erick: Well, my name is Erick
Gonzalez, and I'm a Junior.

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:10.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Like a self
portrait, you might be able

00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:11.806
to submit a self portrait.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.356
&gt;&gt;Erick: If you want a
brief overview, you know,

00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:17.066
sixth to the tenth grade, I
was pretty much the example

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.996
of what not to do at YES.

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:22.406
&gt;&gt;Chad: It started off,
it was pretty rough.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.456
&gt;&gt;Erick: Coming to this
school, I didn't want to come.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:29.706
I had friends going to other schools,
I had friends that make fun of me

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:34.256
for coming here, and I did a lot
to try to get out of this school.

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:35.616
I was on the final contract.

00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:41.166
If I did anything else, I would get
kicked out, so I had a detention

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:45.936
to serve, and I was goofing around,
and got caught, and I got kicked out.

00:00:45.936 --> 00:00:50.186
My parents kind of freaked out.

00:00:50.186 --> 00:00:55.896
My dad-- my dad's really
strict on my grades, and yeah,

00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:57.436
they found a school in Louisiana.

00:00:57.726 --> 00:00:59.456
I always thought YES was strict,

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:01.566
but it was nothing
compared to that school.

00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:04.026
I mean, I'm not going to--
the first two nights there,

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:07.496
I cried myself to sleep.

00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:12.146
So I realized I really screwed up,
so I wrote them a letter, you know,

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:14.896
apologizing and I went in to
see if I can come back to YES.

00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:16.886
And it was amazing.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:20.366
It was-- Like, I felt
like I was right at home.

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:23.926
I don't think I've ever had a
teacher that just gave up on me.

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:25.636
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So where are
your targets and goals?

00:01:25.696 --> 00:01:28.086
&gt;&gt;Chad: He's really worked hard
to turn things around for himself,

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:31.666
both academically as well as
just his behavior on campus,

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.956
and the way he carries himself, and
the way he interacts with others.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.506
So he's gone from what some might
consider a really challenging student

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:40.646
to one who's really become a
pleasure to have on campus.

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:42.516
&gt;&gt;Student: All right, so basically,

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:45.316
this thing is a spud
gun, potato launcher.

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:47.616
&gt;&gt;Erick: In here we
put the hairspray.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:49.836
As you press the igniter,
there's a spark in there.

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:53.476
So this goes in here, like, it's just
a piece of cloth wrapped in tape,

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:54.706
and usually you use potatoes.

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:55.926
And the pressure launches this out.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.436
So when you plug in all the numbers,
for example, the average time,

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.846
the average distance, which
gives you the initial velocity.

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:03.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Hairspray?

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:06.986
&gt;&gt;Erick: All right, go.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:07.996
&gt;&gt;All: [aplause, cheers]

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:08.896
&gt;&gt;Erick: That's close.

00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:12.896
That's close to the point.

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:17.206
&gt;&gt;I've been painting for five
years now, and being able

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:22.916
to express myself that
way is amazing.

00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:26.926
&gt;&gt;So what this picture depicts is two
soldiers, and one of them is painting

00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:30.246
on the wall, "Union by Force,"
which kind of goes back to the fact

00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:33.986
that I believe that, like, we're
in the Middle East trying to put,

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:35.736
you know, two different
groups of people together,

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:38.286
but we're really forcing them.

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:40.806
Like, I feel like it won't
necessarily work out,

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:41.736
once we pull out.

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:44.296
And you have the soldier
watching his back,

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:47.736
kind of representing the fact
that, you know, if you try to speak

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:50.446
out like that, you have to have
somebody watching your back.

00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:54.816
&gt;&gt;A lot of my friends were
getting into gangs and so on,

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:57.156
and I had a friend who drew.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:03:00.586
He drew a lot of, like,
tattoo art, and graffiti art.

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:06.086
So I slowly started getting into
that, and trying to avoid the whole,

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:10.416
you know, gang issues and all that,
but I started moving out of that,

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:16.036
and started using what I learned, and
what I know, to create these murals.

00:03:16.036 --> 00:03:17.316
I did one for the school.

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:21.196
In the background, it says,
E Pluribus Unum, One for all,

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:25.286
so you know, it just gives that
sense of community, that, you know,

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.856
you're not at the school alone,
you're family with everybody here,

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:31.566
and including the teachers.

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:34.656
I'm working on another
mural right now,

00:03:34.656 --> 00:03:36.566
and that's getting
a lot of attention.

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:40.346
It's pretty gorgeous, representing
the music scene in Houston.

00:03:40.346 --> 00:03:42.476
That's from the '30s to today.

00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:44.616
So, like, they're in panels,
so those panels are going

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:45.966
to be auctioned off, hopefully.

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:50.036
And then that money is going to--
well, at first, it was going to go

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:53.666
to me, but I decided, I want to make
it a scholarship fund for the school.

00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:56.856
So I mean, that's another thing I
want to leave behind, is, you know,

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:59.256
money for students to be
able to go to college.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.246
