[Mock Goosebumps theme playing]

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.380
[Cha Ching sound]

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800
[Letter knocks door]

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.740
"God dammit!"

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.120
[Thunder]

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.480
"Nostalgiaweeen!

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.180
Look out,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.160
there's bullshit about!"

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.340
[Sinister laugh]

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.960
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.760
I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.020
It's Halloween!

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.020
Time to look at another memorable movie and go,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.020
"Ooh! That didn't age well."

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.620
It's Stephen King Time!

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.120
[Children cheering with bouncy music]

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.680
[Chime effect reveal]

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.760
As usual, I have to start out praising this guy before I piss on this guy.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.720
Because the dude does have 'mad' talent and has written a lot of awesome stories.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.860
But [sigh] whether they don't translate well to film or they just pick the worst ones to adapt,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.440
his movies and mini-series rarely show the strength of his abilities.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.480
Often resulting in hi-larious results.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480
"Scaring the little (voice cracks) girl?!"

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.240
[Pennywise continues the meme]

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.320
And to start off this review,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.460
how about a dramatic reenactment of how King chooses what to write about next?

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.780
[Smack]

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.760
[Smack]

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060
Children of the Corn!

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.060
[Music plays]

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.760
Based on King's short story,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.340
Children of the Corn looks at an already popular scary subject: creepy kids,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.680
and for some reason, combines them with a yellow vegetable that's about as scary as...well, balloons.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.620
Does it pay off?

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.620
Well, if you like to get paid in maize.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.280
It donned tons of sequels, a cult status, and, of course, hundreds of people around the world saying,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.460
"I think there's better King movies that could be made than this."

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.960
Let's see if King can shock horror into shuck horror.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.920
This is "Children of the Corn."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.360
The film opens up 3 years ago with the narration from a kid named "Job"

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.580
"I was the only kid in church that day."

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680
"The others were with Isaac out in the cornfield."

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640
"I didn't get to go 'cause Dad didn't like Isaac.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640
"He was pretty smart, my dad."

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.320
[Imitates boy] I was off to my daily beating, I was.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.400
[Imitates boy] On accout of my bowtie and that I talk like a complete tool.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.980
But kids start to surround a cafe, led by their Amish mafia leader, Isaac, and get ready to take it down.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.100
And with wallpaper like that, do you really blame them?

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.220
"Don't do it!"

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.560
Oh, come on this is just a Friday night at Denny's.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.040
[Screams]

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.400
After making a 'hand' sandwich,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.180
Job continues to narrate while seemingly having no emotional reaction talking about his father being killed right in front of him.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.940
"It happened everywhere in Gatlin that day."

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.840
"That's when Sarah started drawing these pictures."

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.000
[Imitates boy] Oh, they also served me my father at the International Hell of Pancakes,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.300
[Imitates boy] but I really want to talk about my sister's drawings.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.940
We then cut to 3 years later where a, just graduated, doctor wakes up in a hotel.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.940
[Suspenseful music]

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.320
(Sarcastically) Well gee, with the lack of detail they're showing in this scene, I'm just positive something terrible is about to happen.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.340
(FWEE!)

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.180
(Laughter)

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.080
[Imitates woman] I hope my fake out music didn't wake you.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.300
This is Burt, played by Peter Horton, and Vicky, played by Linda Hamilton, at...

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.260
What do you think? One? Three?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
"I got a couple things you could work on."

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.740
[DING!] 2 packs of cigarettes a day.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.460
"Lived happily ever after."

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.660
"Is that a proposal?"

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.800
"No."

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.540
There's heading toward an internship, while mockingly making of fun of preachers on the radio.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.020
I...guess that's a thing.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.500
"There's no room...for the fornicators!"

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.540
"Amen. Peanut butter and white bread!"

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.240
"No room for people who watch public television!"

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.540
"No room for commitment!"

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.960
"Amen!"

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.800
"Come on."

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.640
[Imitating Vicky] As someone who likes to make fun of religious practice,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.560
[Imitating Vicky] I hate that you won't commit to that religious practice.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.960
And, of course, the internship is just near our town of tiny, pointless narrators.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.780
"We weren't the only ones who thought Isaac was weird."

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.880
But, I, [Snickers] slaughtering a village falls into the 'weird' category?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.580
How about,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.220
[Imitates boy] We weren't the only ones who thought Isaac was a buzzkill.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.680
[Imitates boy] In that he killed you with a buzz saw if he didn't like the way you looked.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.100
One kid tries to escape the madness to get help, leaving his 2 friends behind.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.240
"Now, listen, you tell anybody I'm gone,"

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.780
"if you tell, you're going to burn in the lake of fire for all eternity."

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.760
"We won't."

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.040
"Cross your heart?  Hope to die?  Stick a needle in your eye?"

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.140
[Snickers] Why do you even have that rhyme? It sounds like the lake of fire would be a million times worse.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.360
"(Shouts) Okay! Go!"

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.600
[Girl, off screen] "Nobody's looking! Nobody's looking!"

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.040
[As escapee] Thanks for shouting my escape, you little dumbasses.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.820
[As escapee] I'll be sure to let you keep my head if they remove it from my body.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.600
No real surprise, they do end up finding him.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.380
But not before, like I said, they try to make corn actually scary.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.640
No, they'll fill me with dietary fiber!

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.740
So, one of the kids finds him, and kills him.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.180
Gee, I can't imagine how they were tipped off to that.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.900
"Nobody's looking!  Nobody's looking!"

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.660
But, luckily, our 2 main characters are there to save the day...

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.200
...Well, that could have gone better.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.400
"Hang on."

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.720
"Let me check."

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.880
"Let me check."

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.200
Yeah, make sure she's okay before you check on the kid you steamrolled with your car.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.000
You're going to be a great doctor!

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.020
"That was an animal?"

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.700
[Imitates Burt] Uh, yeah, an animal.  Let's go.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.660
He goes to check on the kid, noticing that his throat has been slit.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.600
"So, I want you to go back to the car and wait for me there, understand?

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.320
"And keep all the doors locked until I get back."

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.600
"Why?  Where are you going?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.860
"I'll tell you when I get back.  Just do what I say."

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.920
It...is a little weird telling Sarah Connor to wait in the car;

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.880
'I don't think your sensitive mind can hear the truth yet.'

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.020
It's like telling 'the Rock' not to look at a paper cut, or he'll pass out.  It's just weird.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.540
But she eventually can't take it and finds that she has to look at the body herself.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.900
"I'm so sorry."

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.320
"Vicky, Come on."

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.080
"*Gasp* Bert."

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.900
[Imitates Vicky] Oh Burt, I just had the worst jumpscare dream.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.880
[Imitates Vicky] It didn't tie into the story and was completely pointless.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.120
[Imitates Burt] It's okay.  We still killed a kid.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.800
[Imitates Vicky] Oh thank God, that calms me down.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.200
So, they put the kid in the trunk and drive off, because...

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.660
That doesn't seem fucking suspicious.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.700
As they try to forget about their kid-killing by putting on the radio.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.640
That'll work.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.580
"Only by the blood of the Lamb are we saved!"

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.080
*Click*

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.180
"Getting tired of that crap."

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.800
[Imitates Burt] I mean, how many King films have religious bashing now?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.120
[Imitates Burt] You could make fucking playing cards out of it.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.660
"I really think we should open it."

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.600
They also decide to open up the kids briefcase, because

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.080
bad enough they killed him, they might as well rob him too.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.520
"Jesus Christ!"

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.080
"Not in my book."

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.900
"Looks like some primitive folk art."

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.280
"I think it's repulsive."

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.560
Sheesh.  I've seen more tolerance from Bill Maher on Islam.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.660
Did a church sting you as a child or something?

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.520
"Good...boy. Sorry..."

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.920
They...surprisingly come across a mechanic who seems to be the only adult left in town.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.200
Which is kind of odd.  Did they keep him around because he was the only mechanic?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.720
Were there...really no adults needed alive for anything else?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.140
How about someone who knows the password for the adult sites?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.140
"Uh we've had ourselves a..."

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.780
"I ain't got no gas."

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.100
"No.  I..I don't need gas."

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.540
"We ain't got no diesel fuel neither."

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.140
"Your telephone.  I need to use your phone..."

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.500
"Telephone? I ain't got no telephone."

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.580
[Imitates mechanic] We ain't got no kids, and we ain't got no corn either.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.220
[Imitates mechanic] In fact, I'm not even here.  Who you talkin' to?  I'm just a scarecrow.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.180
"Now you get on that right fork there and you'll be in Hemingford in no time."

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.840
But they make a Korean BBQ out of his dog and decide to kill him off.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.460
Because...

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:47.560
after 3 years of fixing stuff, never escaping, and telling nobody about the mass slaughter that happened in that neighborhood,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.460
it's finally time to kill him because he told 2 people NOT to go in their neighborhood!

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.820
They make better choices following the church of the magic 8 ball!

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.880
[Imitates Vicky] I find that sign shaped, the tiniest bit, like a cross REVOLTING!

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.280
As they continue to get more lost,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.300
we the kids honoring their corn on the cross and listening to sermons by their leader, Isaac.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.300
Isaac...is the best fucking thing in this movie.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.040
[Funky electronic background music] "The Lord did come to me.  And he was ashamed."

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.060
"It was He who walks behind the rows."

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.780
Isaac is...the movie 'Jesus Camp' in reverse.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.160
He's the munchkin version of the bad guy from Manos.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.980
He's every self-indulgent prophet, that fits into most overhead compartments.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.900
"Joseph has taken his things and fled this happy place."

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.900
"So take you his life...and spill his blood."

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.640
And he's also a wanted criminal.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.500
Oh, not for mass murder, not for brainwashing all these kids..

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.500
But because he steals every single scene in this movie.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.860
"But let not the flesh pollute the corn.  Cast him instead upon the road."

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.820
I know now why they set this in a corn field, it's so the rest of the actors can have some scenery to chew on.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:01.100
"Question not my judgement Malachi.  I am the giver of His word."

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.900
And the interesting thing?

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.840
This actor was 25 years old when he did this role.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.520
Yep, he has one of those conditions where he looks and sounds a million times younger than he really is.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.440
And yet, even knowing that, he still comes across as a snot-nose little piss ant

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.500
commanding his legion of good sons and bad seeds.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.020
He's just a treasure.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:28.400
"And just as the blue man was offered up onto Him, so shall be the unbelievers!"

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.080
No, Isaac!  I believe you!  I would never doubt your whiny wisdom!

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.520
Oh, he was...pointing at them...But that's how intimidating he is!

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.500
The one thing I never quite got though is: How did Isaac convince all these kids to kill the adults?

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.000
I mean, he has the authority now, but, how did he get it from them before?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.820
Were...kids just watching TV and like...

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.220
"Yeehaw! Compy the Cowboy will be right back after a message from our favourite sponsor: Isaac."

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.320
[Static]

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.680
[Imitates Isaac] The blood of the old shall spill!  Rise, my children.  Kill now!  Kill now!

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.180
[Static]

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:07.240
"Um, don't listen to him this week kids.  Uh, he's a very naughty boy."

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.100
[Gunfire]

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.640
"I knew we shouldn't have been paid in maize."

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.820
Peter and Vicky show up into town as we partake in a thrilling amount of looking...

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.300
...Looking...

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.420
And even more looking.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.680
Yeah, I'm beginning to see why this was originally a SHORT story.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.680
They come across some kids.  But they disappear pretty fast. [UTINI!]

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.460
So, we go back to more looking.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.640
The film becomes so bored with "The Walking Dull" that this actually counts as a scare.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.240
[Imitates Burt] Honey, please, turn your CHUN (jumpscare sound) off.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.200
They do, however, come across Sarah.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.240
"Are your Mommy and Daddy around?

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.380
"They're in the cornfield."

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.740
"Oh.  What are they doing there?"

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.800
[Imitates Sarah] Fertilizing, mostly.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.680
They try to get more answers out of her, but she just seems too shy to respond.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.540
So, Peter decides to leave his wife and the little girl behind because...

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.340
...seriously, what's the worst that could happen in this child throat-slitting town?

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.600
"Things are just not happening fast enough."

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.740
[Imitates Burt] I'm sure we could past all this tedious looking with even more looking.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.740
"I'm going to go look at the town hall, 'kay.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.240
[Imitates Burt] Yep, this looks like town hall.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.960
He sees corn is placed everywhere because...remember....corn's scary now.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.500
OOOooohhh!!

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.620
And notices some strange rendition of their religious pictures.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.340
...Must be part of their 'Jesus goes to Willy Wonka's Factory' set.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.940
But Vicky gets in trouble when she becomes surrounded by Isaac's 2nd in command: Malachi.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.680
"Who are you?

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.120
[Imitates Malachi] Have you heard the good news about the corn?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.220
"Seize her."

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.100
We then see this movie's BRILLIANT idea of foreshadowing,

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.100
as he looks at a picture of a dragon burning a woman while Vicky is being attacked.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.360
Do...Does that really add anything?

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.140
I think it's pretty obvious she's in danger by the sharp objects being thrown at her.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.140
Not an Eragon coloring book!

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.460
It's like me confirming something I already know.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:00.960
[Smack] Ow!

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.460
Ugh

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.540
So, it did hurt.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.240
[Revelation boom]

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.580
[Reenacts The Shining scene] Here's Corny!

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.220
[Imitates Vicky] Oh wow.  I really need James Cameron to write for me.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:22.880
"No."

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.600
They take her away as we see the kid's drawing predict it was going to happen,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.600
like she predicted everything else that was going to happen.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.700
Why, this looks like a job for Stephen King's favorite trope:

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.200
[Dramatic Voice]

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.620
So, you're psychic, huh?  Where did that come from?

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.120
I don't know.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.920
How did you get it?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.540
I don't know.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.720
What will you do with it in the future?

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.260
I don't know.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.120
If I took it out of the story, would we miss it that much?

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.900
Probably not.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:50.120
Off you go, Unexplained Psychic Child.  The less we know about you, the lazier.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.980
They turn Peter's vehicle into a corn on the car and not allowing him to follow Vicky to Isaac.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.000
[Children cheering]

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.600
[Imitating Vicky] The fact that you want to kill me is fine, but doing it by placing me on a cross-shaped cross

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.700
[Imitating Vicky] is just REVOLTING!

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.680
But there burnt kernels among the corn.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.060
"You know not the laws."

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.020
"He's the god of blood and sacrifice, not ceremonies."

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.520
"Down on your knees, heretic!"

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.080
"Shut your mouth, Isaac.  You've grown pride born apart from us!"

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.860
[Imitates Malachi] I will not indulge your quarter life crisis!

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.140
"Seize him!  Punish him!  Cut him down, I command you!"

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.740
"I am the word and the giver of His laws!"

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.040
[Imitates Isaac] I am the snapper at bitches.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.620
"Do it now or your punishment shall be a thousand times, a thousand deaths! Each more horrible than the last!"

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.140
"They are tired of your talk, Isaac."

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.240
I refuse to believe that.  Nobody could ever get tired of Isaac.  He who is tired with Isaac is tired with life!

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:44.920
"No!  You dare not use blaspheme!  He will punish you! The Dog of Hell will devour you!  ALL OF YOU!!!"

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.800
"NO!!!" *Dragged away kicking and screaming*

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.500
[Snickers] Can we just make an Isaac doll?

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.940
No, you don't have to.  I already made a prototype.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.820
I am the word and the giver of his laws.  Take you his life, and spill his blood.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.460
Look for it in your produce section.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:09.240
[Commercial break music]

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.120
[Surfer accent] Attention!  Your parents are like...

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.400
You need a balanced breakfast.  How about some nice brussels sprouts?

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.660
News flash!  Welcome to the '90's dad.  [Chatter sound] Where kids rule, and we eat what we want.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.180
Like Sugar Frosted Children of the Corn Flakes.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.880
Full of Extreme Radicalness to the Max!

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.180
Hff, that's most unorthodox!

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.540
That's because parents just don't understand.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:36.260
That's why you must rise up against them.  And spill their blood for our harvest.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.580
It has the awesome taste that no grown up can see!

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.580
So take you his life.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.160
Follow these anti-authoritative ads to YOUR SALVATION!!!

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.560
While munching on that sweet frosted taste.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.060
There's even games on the back.  Like finding your way through the corn maze!

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.960
Hey, uh.  I can't find my way out.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.120
Because there is no way out.  Those who look behind the rows SHALL PERISH!!!

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.800
Whoa dude!  Let not the flesh pollute the corn.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.440
Indeed Maniac Zach.  Cast them instead upon your bowl.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.060
Where high fructose corn syrup AWAITS THEM.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.280
To the EXTREME.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.160
Do it now or your punishment shall be a thousand times, a thousand deaths, each one more horrible than the LAST!

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.540
Sugar Frosted Children of the Corn Flakes is part of this complete breakfast.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.940
I am the word and THE GIVER OF His Laws.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.120
Rad!!

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.720
[Commercial break music]

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.120
So while Peter looks for Vicky, he comes across what I think is Tom Cruise's initiation into Scientology.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.440
"Stop it! Stop that!"

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.380
"Hold the outlander!"

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.440
[Imitates boys] Oh, well that stopped us.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.000
"Your presence does profane this holy place."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.880
"He will reckon with you."

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.860
God, I think we stumbled across the church of Kim Davis.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.760
"So what do you mean, 'as it is written'?"

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760
"What?  In this?"

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.840
"Are you rewriting the whole thing or just the parts that suit your needs?"

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.800
Yep.  Definitely the church of Kim Davis.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.540
But Malachi comes to chase him with his army of goonies.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.560
[Screams]

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.520
[Laughs] That kid really wanted to make the most of that one scene.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.500
[Imitates boy] I will throw everything into this garble of vowels!

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.340
[Imitates mob] [Sings] The corn is going to rumble, tonight.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.520
"Outlander!"

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:24.560
"Get him!"

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.440
[Snickers] Why is light pushing the only thing that can defeat them?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.480
It's the Abra Ka Daniel way of defending yourself.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
"Shit!"

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.080
Malachi smells his Mark Hamill hair, but luckily Job is there to sneak him out and lead him to where Vicky is being held.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.480
...That and things are not looking so good for Isaac either.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.820
"I did as you commanded!  I was good!"

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.580
[Snickers]  Why does the sacrifice include turning yourself into Eric Cartman?

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.620
"No!"

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.520
"I did as you commanded!"

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.920
"I did everything you wanted!"

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.600
"No!"

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.340
So Isaac is consumed by...um...Liquid Schwartz,

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.300
which apparently Jiffy Pops him into Hell.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.060
[Girly scream leading to...]

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.660
[Goofy] YAAAAAAAHOOHOOHOOIEEEE!!

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.540
But Peter(Burt?) arrives in time to save Vicky with probably the fakest fist fight you'll see in a while.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.140
Hey, look out!  You almost hit him on that one.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.540
[Snickers] Come on, any less real and WWE will be knocking at your door.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.100
"Any religion, without love and compassion, is FALSE!"

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:40.340
Peter gives a big speech about how their demonic religion is bogus, only to discover...that, actually, it was, pretty much, all true.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.520
[Demon] "MALACHIIIIIIII!!!"

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.660
[Imitates demons] The brotherhood of the roaring belches WANTS YOU!

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.160
[Children shocked]

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.300
"He wants you too, Malachi."

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.820
[Imitates Burt] Oh man, I was way off...Well, hail Satan everybody.  Got to go.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.720
[Thunder rolls]

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.180
So, as the demon...devil...not explainy thing goes after everybody,

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.520
our heroes get the idea to burn down the field after someone tried to do it before, inspired by a Bible passage.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.100
[String quartet]

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.620
[Sigh] Surprisingly, corn is still not scary guys.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.380
This looks more like torture porn for Old McDonald.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.380
Job saves him, but Peter is surprisingly kind of a dick about it.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.260
"What are you doing here?!"

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.360
"Get back to the barn.  Hurry up!  Go on, move!"

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.980
"Excuse me."

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.380
[Imitates Job] See if I save you next time a vegetable goes Evil Dead on your ass!

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:42.800
So he stops the evil entity from taking that left turn at Albuquerque, and lights up the field, destroying the monster.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.540
Hmm, now let's see.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.760
Stephen King's disappointing climaxes have included a giant spider,

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.000
alien death rays,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.100
self-aware trucks,

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.760
and chomping Big Foot testicles.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.480
How can we possibly get lamer than that?

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.320
[Demon screams]

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.260
With Casper, the friendly explosion.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.480
I am not even kidding.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.740
THAT is what you were supposed to be afraid of the entire time.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.980
That...is a whole new level of not giving a fuck.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:25.140
I...guess it's supposed to be open to interpretation about what it exactly is.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.660
But..the only thing I'm interpreting is what it looks like more.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.880
Jabba the Hutt's exploding fetus?

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.800
A pumpkin ice cream achieving orgasm?

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.580
Or the Annoying Orange, if he was Crying Cauliflower.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.420
Flash the sign guys! [ding] This is a scene that really fucking needs it.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.780
Wow!

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.840
So, after our anti-religious heroes find out, not only, demons are real, but the Bible saved the day.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.620
They walk back with the reassured confidence that evil, spiritual identities can just be blown up with a few tanks of gas.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.700
[Children laughing]

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.560
"So what are we going to do with these two little munchkins, huh?

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.840
[Laughs] Ohh, look at those cute giggling kids.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:04.340
It's almost like they didn't witness ANY of the extreme horrors that would freak any little child out!

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.340
[Imitates girl] We didn't even cry when our parents were slaughtered.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.660
[Imitates girl] We're kind of as soulless as the corn you're walking through.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.580
This movie, however, has one last scare up their sleeves.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.360
"You must die!"

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.040
Buuut, obviously they didn't bring it out because that was a ridiculous, lame-ass joke.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.060
It's acutally so lame that the movie just kind of gives up on it.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.800
Yeah.  That's really how it ends.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.560
No music, no scary build-up.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.480
It's like even they knew how stupid this was and just wanted out as quickly as possible.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.840
"You must die!"

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.440
[Imitates director] Eh, fuck it.  We're done folks.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.760
[Imitates director] We didn't want to put that ending in, but the studio made us.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.040
[Imitates director] Boo, I guess.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.360
And that was the awkwardly ending, awkwardly beginning, awkwardly Stephen King.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.700
The movie doesn't really bring much new to the scary kid idea,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.720
and what it does bring is either too slow-moving or doesn't make any sense.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.580
The only scares it focuses on is that of violence.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.160
Which is a shame, because you can really do a lot with scary kids in movies,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.320
as other films have shown, both visually and psychologically.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.500
But nope, these kids just stab stuff and quote scripture.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.340
That's it.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.600
If you don't find that especially creepy, then you're not going to find this especially creepy.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:15.120
But, to be fair, the best thing about the film is just how fucking hard the kids are trying.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.340
These actors are throwing their fucking all into this movie.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.260
Even in the tiniest scenes.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.700
Eh, sure, a lot of it is over-the-top, but they're just so much fun to watch.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.100
And their dedication to this insanity is, pretty much, what makes the movie.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.940
Especially Isaac.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.200
Who, in my opinion, can do no wrong.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.380
In fact, I think we should rise up against the flesh of the old and give our undying allegiance to Isaac...

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.520
Wait a minute, who wrote that?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.180
Isaac!

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.300
God dammit Isaac.  How did you get anyone to follow you?

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.480
You don't understand.  I have incredible persuasive powers.  I can even intimidate you with the power of

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.360
CORN!!!

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.080
[Demonic music]

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.340
Yes.  Corn. [Chuckle]

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.200
Mighty tasty.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.680
That's still not scary.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.540
Not even the burnt ones?

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.180
Noo.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.400
[Sigh] What am I going to do?

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.620
My whole routine is fear through brute violence and no psychological effort.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.300
How is that going to get me popularity today?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.020
[Rock music] It's Isaac's Extreme Haunted House.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.480
See what everyone is calling the scariest attraction this year.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:13.980
In you go.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:17.960
Boo.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:19.880
[Smack]

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.360
No playing to your inner fears here.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.660
We just beat the living shit out of you.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.200
Most extreme houses let you walk out with cuts and bruises.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.960
Here?

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.780
We literally beat you to death.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.120
Just listen to the final words of these satisfied customers.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:39.200
You know, I thought real scares were psychological, with brilliant illusions, and creative imagery.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.640
But now, I can see it..can just be a guy in a costume, beating the snot out of you.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.200
"Outlander!"

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.100
[Screams]

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.040
We've got lines around the block!

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.980
I guess people are more forgiving to lazy scares as long as you just beat the shit out of somebody.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.560
And that's about it for Nostalgiaween, I only have a Top 11 list to do, and after that we'll be in November.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.560
So, thank you so much for watching and...

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.020
[Crowd boos]

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.240
Oh, I see.  You don't like the fact that there's only 2 Halloween reviews this year, huh?

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.220
[Crowd boos]

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:12.660
Okay, alright.  You want me to pull a Simpsons Halloween Special and go 1 week into November with another Halloween review?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.760
[Crowd cheers]

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.480
Okay, fine.  But I'm only doing it to keep you happy.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.880
Until then, I'm the Nostalgia Critic and...

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.300
[Sound of a beating]

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.780
The world loves to pay an asshole.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.900
[Ending theme]

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.720
[Music fades]

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.380
[Kid screaming]

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720
"Outlander!"

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.920
Hey, beardless Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.660
and this week we are doing the Wounded Warrior Project.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.860
And this is something that is exactly what it sounds like.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:19.400
It is trying to get money...attention and care to people that have served for us in the past,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.540
and have had, usually,  terrible things happen to them.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.900
Whether it be physical or psychological or financial.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.680
These are people that deserve our absolute best.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.300
And are not always getting it.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:36.280
So, this is an organisation that tries to come together in every possible way to help these people out

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.260
Every single way imaginable, they try to benefit these people.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:46.240
These are soldiers that signed up and put their lives on the line, and they have had so much stuff happen to them,

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.220
and this is an organisation that's trying to say "thank you."

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:54.240
"Thank you for your hard service, you deserve the absolute best that we have to offer."

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.180
And they are trying to make that happen,

00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.080
Through fundraisers and triathlons, and all sorts of various events,

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.280
they try anything they can to try to get attention, money and care to the people that deserve it most.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.220
This is definitely a good organisation to check out.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.880
If you go to their YouTube page, you can see all the good stuff that they do.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:18.360
Please, definitely, take the time to go and support the people who have put everything on the line to keep us safe.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:18.860
 

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.360
Subtitles by Silhouetters. Thanks to Doug and Rob for an amazing review!
