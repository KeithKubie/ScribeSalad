[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:06.720
YASMIN GREEN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.770
Thanks for joining this
"Authors" at this lunch time.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.390
I am Yasmin Green.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.219
I run research and
development for a group

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.245
called Jigsaw, which is
Alphabet's technology incubator

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:21.000
looking at geopolitics.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.820
And I am delighted
to welcome Wendy

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.690
Sachs to talk to us today.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.810
We're related.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.374
We've got to figure out the
exact way to describe it,

00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:37.310
but Wendy's the sister of
my husband's cousin's wife.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.210
There should be a short
term, shorthand for that.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.810
And so, if you guys
are anything like me,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.970
you feel some anxiety when you
think about the evolving nature

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.150
of work.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.380
And automation and
globalization seem

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.860
like they're trends
that are making

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.310
more bleak the prospects of us
all being gainfully employed

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.510
in the future.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.269
And job security seems like
a kind of romantic notion

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.140
from a past era.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.330
And yet we still all
want, yearn for work

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.630
that's nourishing and
stimulating and flexible

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.170
and that brings us joy as
well as pays the bills.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.864
And then sometimes we fantasize
about charting a new path.

00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:26.280
But we're not even
sure where we'd

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.780
start when it comes to that.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.050
So wouldn't we love
the advice of somebody

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.120
who has experience with every
possible permutation of work,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.560
life, family and has reinvented
themselves and captured

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.350
their insights in a book
that will help empower us

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.570
and help us all thrive?

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.115
And that is Wendy Sachs.

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:51.670
That's the brilliance of Wendy.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.320
And Wendy has a very diverse and
accomplished career as an Emmy

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.030
award-winning producer of TV
news on "Dateline," BBC, CNN,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.210
Fox, and NBC, is a
critically acclaimed author

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.310
and journalist, and has an
eclectic career in politics

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.987
and PR, including
holding the title of--

00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:19.820
I'm not going to get
this right-- now, wait,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.184
she can correct me,
Capitol Hill chief--

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.420
WENDY SACHS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.836
YASMIN GREEN: Oh,
press secretary,

00:02:25.836 --> 00:02:28.940
Capital Hill press
secretary, editor in chief,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.590
and also which I didn't
get the 411 from her about,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.940
but also representative of
Barney the purple dinosaur.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.840
So anyway, without
further ado, it's

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.681
a great joy to welcome Wendy
to share her insights with us

00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:44.180
today.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.255
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:50.880
That's for you.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.680
WENDY SACHS: Thanks so much.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.010
Thank you for that
warm introduction.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.220
I am honored to be
related to Yas, even

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.100
by some sort of cousin
marriage relationship.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.880
Talking about
fearless, I think I

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.700
don't know anyone who is
more fearless and bad ass

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.875
than this woman who's doing
incredible work here at Google.

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.430
So I'd say that I've
pivoted so much in my career

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.670
that I'm practically
pirouetting.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.220
And not all of my pivots
have been intentional.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.610
I've been fired.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.910
I've lost my job
a couple of times.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.580
And you know, because
everything today has an origin

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.150
story, every brand, everything.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.210
My origin story of
"Fearless and Free"

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.610
begins when I lost my
job in August of 2014.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.670
And I was working at
a advertising agency

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.200
and it's sort of a
minitragedy to lose

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.340
your job in advertising.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.402
It happens all the time.

00:03:45.402 --> 00:03:46.860
And they gave me
some notice, and I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.670
knew I was going to be let go,
because they couldn't afford me

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.980
anymore apparently.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.369
And I started interviewing
all around New York City.

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.410
I started going to all of
these what I would call

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.701
the bright and shiny start ups.

00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:59.600
I'm sure you work with many
of them here in New York.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.000
And I was going around
looking for a job.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.710
My industry, media, had
been completely disrupted

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.870
by digital.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.850
And I started really panicking
because at this point,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.460
I'm over 40.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.800
And I'm in an industry
that is overrun by people,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.870
now, about 20 years
younger than me.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.152
And I thought if I
don't get a job soon,

00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:20.360
I'm not going to be relevant.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.020
And of course, as we all
know, relevance is everything.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.410
So I was interviewing at
one shop, and I went in,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.320
and of course it was a bearded
millennial in that flannel,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.710
like the total cliche,
sitting across from me.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.030
And I take out, start
taking out my resume, which

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.300
is sort of lengthy at
this point, and my bio.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.190
And I hand it to him.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.070
Right away I knew that
there was trouble.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.170
He said we don't take
paper resumes around here.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.870
We only want digital copies.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.240
And I was like, feeling
embarrassed and shamed,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.610
and that clearly I was way
too old for this company.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.280
I shoved my paper
back in my bag.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.700
And he opens up his MacBook and
he's looking over my resume.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.490
And he sees that I had
worked on Capitol Hill.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.240
I was a press
secretary a while ago.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.920
But I still kept
it on my resume,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.420
because it was a position that
I always felt very proud of.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.250
Up until this point, it
had given me some gravitas

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.610
and some credibility.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.580
And what I like to say is that
Capitol Hill was the Google

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.470
of the Gen X generation.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.750
It opened doors for us.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.780
It opened big careers
for many people.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.670
We all-- many people
I know started

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.930
there went on to big careers.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.310
But here, the man looking at
me sort of scoffed and said,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.820
around here we have good
relationships with the media.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.380
I wouldn't want you hanging up
on any reporters or anything.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.896
And completely startled
by this, I said,

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:45.270
you know, jokingly,
well, I'm not

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.430
a character in "Veep"
or "The House of Cards."

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.270
I wasn't screaming at reporters.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.820
I was begging them to cover
my member of Congress.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.920
He was a freshman member
from a crowded district

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.170
in South Florida.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.240
He didn't even laugh
at any of this.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.800
So after I started walking
through the office,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.360
holding on to my paper resume,
and grabbing my coconut water

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.540
and kale chips as I walked
out, feeling sort of depressed.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.720
I was walking down Fifth
Avenue, and I thought to myself.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.830
Something's gotta change.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.490
Obviously, I have
done what I think

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.370
has been very interesting
jobs in my career.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.050
I'm clearly qualified
for these positions.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.240
What am I doing wrong?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.590
And I had this sort of epiphany.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.730
And I started looking
towards Silicon Valley.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.840
I was sort of always
obsessed with the tech world,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.570
the way that so many of us are.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.410
And because that whole start
up spirit in tech world,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.940
in Silicon Valley's basically
directing everything

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.440
we do today, as you know
better than anyone--

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.133
from how we shop, to
how we get our news

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:46.540
and out entertainment,
how we target ISIS--

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.250
everything we do is
coming from the start

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.770
up space, Silicon
Valley, the tech world.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.530
So one of the themes and one
of the sort of characteristics

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.450
that sort of struck
me at this time,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.530
it was because I'd seen
this "New York Magazine"

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.170
article about that whole
failure fetish coming out

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.810
of Silicon Valley.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.970
And I thought, well,
I understand failure.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.370
I've failed a few times.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.680
But what is it about
that whole failure

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.440
idea, that embracing of
failure that's so part

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.450
of the DNA of the tech world?

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.130
And why is it a badge
of honor for these boys

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.150
in the hoodies who launch
companies that blow up--

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.094
they're not going and climbing
into a hole and disappearing.

00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:28.510
No, I mean, from
what I'm reading,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.100
they're getting rehired.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.930
Or they're just pivoting
on their business, right?

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.890
That the venture
capitalists are investing

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.840
in the people and the talent
behind the business, not

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.660
necessarily the business idea.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.810
And of course, there's dozens
of examples to point to.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.160
So I just loved that idea.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.540
And I thought, what if women
did that in their own careers?

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.700
What if women sort
of owned that concept

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.320
that we don't need to feel
ashamed if we lose a job,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.020
as so many people do today?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.270
What if we really
invested in ourselves

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.270
and leaned into our own
skills, and realized

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.370
we just need to pivot?

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.870
We need to iterate.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.455
And what if we were OK
with that idea of failure?

00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:10.380
So as I started digging into
this concept of failure,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.820
of course, a cousin, the happy
cousin to failure is success.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.600
And as Albert Einstein-- so many
people have these great quotes

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.570
around failure--

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.467
he says, failure is
the pathway to success,

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:22.300
something like that.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.490
I'm paraphrasing that.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.490
But that's that idea.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.600
So I started looking
at confidence, right?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.120
So confidence is the foundation
to building anything,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.460
to taking risks.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.434
And it's all about
the risk taking.

00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:36.850
And of course, I'm
sure you're all

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.659
familiar with all the
studies that show men are

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.630
more willing to take
risks than women.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.169
We know men start more
companies, more start

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:44.872
ups than women.

00:08:44.872 --> 00:08:47.080
They certainly get the
financing, the venture capital

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.860
backing that women don't get.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.065
So why is that?

00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:52.440
So as I started
looking into some

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.520
of the research
around confidence,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.377
I was looking at Claire
Shipman and Katty Kay.

00:08:57.377 --> 00:08:59.710
I don't know if anyone here
is familiar with their book,

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.501
"The Confidence Code,"
which sort of became

00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:04.860
my Bible as I was doing my
own research on confidence.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.430
And they found that there's
this genetic connection

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.650
with confidence.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.700
That there's actually--
there's a genetic component,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.760
sort of like who gets
blue eyes or curly hair.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.750
And they did their
own DNA testing

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.430
and they found very
disappointingly

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.020
that neither one of them
carried that genetic trait

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.360
to actually create confidence.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.318
And of course this was
incredibly disheartening

00:09:24.318 --> 00:09:28.250
to them, because you want to
think that you are genetically

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.980
enabled to be confident.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.740
But what they also found, which
of course is very empowering,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.640
is that we can build confidence.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.090
Confidence is a muscle,
like resilience is a muscle

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.550
that Sheryl Sandberg, of course,
is recently talking about.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.190
Confidence is also a muscle.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.400
And the fastest way to become
confident is to take risks.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.220
And women just generally
are more risk averse.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.440
And we're taught
this at an early age.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.210
We don't like to fail.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.230
We don't like to
get things wrong.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.110
We don't like to
take as many chances.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.140
And it starts really early on.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.590
So the more studies that I
was uncovering, and looking

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.840
at the writings of Carol Dweck,
who's a well known professor,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.720
and she wrote a book
called "Mindset,"

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.280
she writes about that this
starts at a very early age.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.840
With that whole idea
of a growth mindset

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.250
versus a fixed mindset--

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.690
the idea that we sort of
only know what we know

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.260
is that fixed mindset.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.070
That you are good at math
and that is what you know,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.630
but you would not be
good at, perhaps, art.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.640
Versus that whole idea
of a growth mindset

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.360
that you can develop your
skills, and you can turn into--

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.890
you can sort of evolve and
you can iterate as you go.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.200
Well, this is really
important, not just

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.200
in the parenting space, as
it became recently adopted.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.640
Because there's
that whole concept

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.450
that we're not supposed
to tell our daughters that

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.707
they're good at math.

00:10:50.707 --> 00:10:52.790
Because maybe in fifth
grade they're good at math,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.545
but by ninth grade
when math gets hard,

00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:56.170
and they're not doing
so well, they now

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.940
take it personally
and think, I guess

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.260
I'm just not so good at math.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.820
We're supposed to
praise the journey.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.850
But this is also very
true to ourselves.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.030
If we can't accept
the idea that we

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.470
can continue to evolve and grow,
well, we're going to get stuck.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.390
So these things were
very interesting to me.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.250
This whole the
risk taking versus

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.450
growth mindset
versus fixed mindset

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.720
and how we think about
ourselves and how--

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.320
our ability and our willingness
to really take risks.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.250
But along with this whole
confidence and internalization

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.540
of how we're feeling,
it's also about how

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.320
we present to the world.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.480
And so as I was
writing this book--

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.770
the book is not a
memoir, but very much

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.720
a personal journey for
me as I was exploring

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.890
my own sort of what
was happening out there

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.700
in the workforce and
what I needed to change.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.440
And it was also the election.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.870
And so, during the
election, of course,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.150
we saw how women are perceived.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.930
Of course, the person carrying
the mantle for all of us

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.490
was Hillary Clinton.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.420
And we saw that the way that
she was perceived to the voters,

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.690
to the population, to the
media was that she came across

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.510
as either too shrill,
too inauthentic,

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.930
she wasn't warm enough.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.360
She was judged to a
different standard.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.780
And there was this famous
Jimmy Kimmel sketch

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.280
that I don't know
if any of you saw,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.820
but I read about in the book.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.550
And in this one sketch,
he sort of-- this

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.080
is like, what they call
the mansplaining sketch.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.320
And so Hillary's
standing behind a podium.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.990
And she's pretending that
she's giving her stump speech.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.050
And she starts out
a little bit loud.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.329
And he's, oh, keep it down.

00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:31.870
Keep it down.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.870
The voice-- the voice,
it's a little too shrill,

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.060
a little too loud.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.716
She drops it down.

00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:37.840
You gotta raise your voice.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.710
You're sounding like
a mouse up there.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.180
And she begins again.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.020
And he's like, you
don't look right.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.160
You gotta smile more.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.990
You gotta smile.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.270
So she starts smiling.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.860
You look like a Lakers girl.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.720
What's with the smile?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.360
You know, whatever she did.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.110
It went on and on.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.526
And then he's like, you know,
I can't put my finger on it.

00:12:54.526 --> 00:12:55.700
I'm not sure what is it?

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.730
What is it about you
that's just not right?

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.540
I know.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.990
You're not a man.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.260
You're not a man.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.530
And that, of course, was
the ultimate poking fun

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.410
at exactly what was
happening and exactly how she

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.820
was being perceived.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.540
And that, of course,
is the double bind.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.090
And I'm sure-- is everyone
here familiar with that?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.020
Double bind-- and the
women in leadership?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.270
So that double bind is
the ultimate conundrum

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.990
for women in leadership.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.280
And that is, that
when women present

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.950
with more masculine
characteristics--

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.590
that they are direct or
they have a loud voice

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.270
or they come off very strong,
they're not well liked.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.910
People see them as abrasive,
or they're bitches.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.880
They're not well liked.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.390
But when women present with
their more feminine qualities,

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.020
that they are nurturing and
seem to be warm, engaging,

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.120
maybe their voice
isn't so loud, they're

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.900
not thought to be
strong leaders.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.020
So that's the conundrum, right?

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.270
That is the double bind.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.757
And of course, we saw that
play out during the campaign,

00:13:58.757 --> 00:14:00.340
not to say that
Hillary Clinton didn't

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.520
have other issues going on,
but that was a big part of it.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.077
So all of this is
happening as I'm

00:14:06.077 --> 00:14:08.660
writing the book, the campaign,
I'm watching what's happening.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.330
And by the way, just a compare
and contrast, when you saw--

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.560
and this was not just a
Democrat-Republican thing.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.750
You see Bernie Sanders,
who's pounding the podium,

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.130
and finger thrusting, and he's
messy, and he's disheveled,

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.180
and he's loud, and he's angry.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.580
People love that.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.080
Right?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.270
People love that about Bernie.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.700
There was no you're too loud.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.720
You're too obnoxious.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.750
Your hair's a mess.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.980
Fix your tie.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.430
You know, stop with the finger.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.300
No!

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.085
That was manly.

00:14:35.085 --> 00:14:36.680
It was alpha.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.580
It was legitimate.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.580
It was authentic.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.070
And people loved it.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.610
Women loved it.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.190
So that's really, really-- that
was very fascinating to me.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.440
And I think, at
some level, I also

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.520
had this sort of personal
association with all of this.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.360
Not that I'm anywhere near
Hillary Clinton's level,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.990
or will be.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.040
But I had been viewed
in the workforce,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.700
at one particular job,
as being too abrasive.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.670
I was told this in
one of my job reviews,

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.000
that I came across as a little
bit too abrasive, too tough.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.920
What I thought was being
direct, other people

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.190
viewed and perceived as being--

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.510
and the word that's commonly
associated with women--

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.860
is abrasive.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.930
And I was horrified.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.674
I felt so--

00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:29.590
I don't want to say ashamed,
but I felt so hurt, actually.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.630
I mean, I didn't want
people not to like me,

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.070
because everyone
wants to be liked.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.300
And by the way, likability
in the work force

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.370
goes a really long way.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.480
And so I didn't know what
to do about all of this.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.240
And so, at the same time
that this was all happening

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.410
and I was feeling very
sad about not being liked,

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.020
I wound up actually
getting a new job.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.080
And I went to the advertising
agency I'd mentioned before.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.060
And I started
saying sorry a lot.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.950
I was just dropping in
sorry, sorry, sorry,

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.610
where do I hang this report?

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:06.070
Sorry, opening the door when
I go into a room, sorry.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.990
And I was adopting this
sorry because there

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.747
was another colleague
of mine, who, granted--

00:16:10.747 --> 00:16:12.580
she was like, blonde
and petite and dimpled,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.080
and very sweet-- she
would always say sorry.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.160
And no one ever thought
that she was a bitch

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.910
or that she was too
direct, or that she

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.560
came across as abrasive.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.710
So I thought, I'm going to
use this whole sorry thing.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.850
And it worked like a charm.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.920
I'm telling you, I was with
the toughest creative guys

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.070
who are feeling all bold
and all that going on.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.570
But no one thought I was being
too direct, because I wasn't.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.600
I had dialed it back.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.390
And so interestingly,
at this time

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.930
at the agency where
I was working,

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.446
there was a Pantene
commercial that came out.

00:16:47.446 --> 00:16:48.820
And I don't know
if you remember,

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.778
it was a few years ago.

00:16:49.778 --> 00:16:51.540
And it got a lot of recognition.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.850
And it was a campaign
where they were showing--

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.360
it was for Pantene--

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.240
and they were showing all
these different circumstances

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.160
of women apologizing.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.850
So in one scene, you
see a woman on a subway.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.310
And a man sits next to her,
his legs are spread open.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.970
And she's doing this,
like, and she says, sorry.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.550
And in another scene,
you see a kitchen.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.091
And the woman is
handing over a child,

00:17:13.091 --> 00:17:15.340
which looks like it's either
to her husband or partner

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.119
or whoever.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.030
As she hands the baby
over, she says, sorry.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.040
Another instance, a woman in
an office is opening up a door.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.160
There's men sitting at the
table, and she says, sorry.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.020
And so it was a whole
slew of sorries.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.370
And basically, they were
making fun of the fact

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.690
that women are
apologizing all the time.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.130
So now I'm feeling
sorry for saying sorry.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.290
And I quickly dropped my sorry.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.790
And it was at the
ad agency where

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.070
I was working that they
actually produced the ad.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.200
So it was this like,
total sort of awakening

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.217
of what's going on.

00:17:46.217 --> 00:17:48.050
And during this time
also, I'm sure you also

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.002
heard of all of the
other shrinker words

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:50.960
that people talk about.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.010
The justs and the actuallys,
and the am I making sense,

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.920
and all the language that
really diminishes our power.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.330
And does anyone know
Tammy Reese in this room?

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.940
So Tammy Reese actually
created a gmail plug

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.750
in that was going to be like
the spell check for sorry.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.320
And it got a lot of attention.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.200
I see some heads saying yes.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.340
It got a lot of attention.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.140
And I interviewed
her for the book.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.550
And she talks about the
fact that it wasn't supposed

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.840
to change the way that
we communicate entirely,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.680
like saying, you know, like,
shame on you for saying just.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.730
Because we think
that's sort of breezy.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.280
Sometimes you want to
say just in a sentence.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.050
But her feeling was she
wanted to make women

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.060
aware of the language
that they were using

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.370
and how we are
presenting to the world.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.742
Because it is so incredibly
important how we present.

00:18:38.742 --> 00:18:40.450
And so some of the
suggestions that, when

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.150
I started asking
some experts, like,

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.310
OK, we use these justs
and the actuallys

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.780
because we don't want to be
seen as abrasive and too direct,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.280
so we try to come across
as a little softer.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.300
The suggestions are
opening your email warm,

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.900
ending your email warm.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.710
In the middle, scrub any justs,
actuallys, am I making sense.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.410
And that's the smartest
approach to do.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.960
And you can do that
in person, too,

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.500
when you walk into a meeting.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.070
You can start with some
small talk about the weather

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.740
or whatever.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:14.060
But then be direct, smile,
end warm, you're done.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.000
But there are no apologizing.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.690
And so I thought that was really
also very, very interesting.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.450
What is it that women are
doing that is inadvertently

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.000
affecting our power, diminishing
our strength to the world?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
So another thing that
I also looked at when,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.660
again, looking toward Silicon
Valley for all of my answers,

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.210
I looked at the concept of
engineering serendipity.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.650
Do you all know what that is?

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.940
I feel like this is a
group that-- engineering

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.270
serendipity-- so many of
us think of serendipity

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.840
as a happy accident.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.410
Or it's just good
fortune, somehow

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.740
like, great things
just happened.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.020
But actually, there is
strategy behind serendipity.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.740
We can make that magic happen.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.900
And a few years ago
at South by Southwest,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.370
it actually became sort of
a theme of the conference.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.450
There was a bunch of sessions
with creative agencies and tech

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.380
companies all talking
about this concept

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.060
of engineering serendipity.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.650
We can create these
amazing collisions

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.090
of creativity and
innovation, which to me was

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.140
like incredibly eye opening.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.260
Oh, we can actually make
these things happen for us.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.530
So the one man in my
book is a guy named Mike,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.650
and he's the only
dude in the book.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.560
And I call him the
King of Serendipity.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.870
Because while we have worked
together several times,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.260
so I benefited from his
own kingdom of serendipity

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.080
because he's hired
me a few times,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.907
he was always able to sort of
maneuver between a whole bunch

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:42.740
of different things.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.580
He was working for Larry Ellison
and running some sort of start

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.000
up company.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.990
He also was writing screenplays.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.470
He's also producing
digital series.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.550
He started out as a
TV news journalist.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.930
So he, somehow, was able to
zigzag between industries,

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.252
make money, have three
children, and to me,

00:21:03.252 --> 00:21:04.460
like, sort of live the dream.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.710
And I looked at him thinking,
how is he doing that?

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:12.080
Well, part of it, I realized,
is that he is a guy.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.671
So when he would invite me to go
to networking events, he'd say,

00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:17.170
hey, you should
come out for drinks.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.870
I'm meeting with
this movie producer.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.260
He's in from LFA and we're
talking about this script

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.010
that I just wrote.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.070
I would say I gotta
catch the train.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.690
I gotta get home.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.970
But somehow, he was able to
keep building his network,

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.190
keep expanding his
boundaries, and keep creating

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.770
this magic for himself.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.270
So when I was looking into this
whole concept of engineering

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.692
serendipity, I interviewed Mike.

00:21:40.692 --> 00:21:41.650
And I said, what is it?

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.483
How did you do this?

00:21:42.483 --> 00:21:45.054
He actually had a
formula for serendipity.

00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:45.970
I couldn't believe it.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.205
He had a mathematical
equation that I'm not

00:21:48.205 --> 00:21:49.830
going to be able to
remember right now.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.800
It's in my book.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.230
But it's about visibility,
sort of dividing

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:58.620
by what you've done in the
past, and where you're located.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.230
And it was like a whole formula
to creating this perfect magic

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.342
for himself.

00:22:03.342 --> 00:22:04.800
But what he was
doing was something

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.860
that's actually been studied
for many, many years.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.280
And it's about this idea that
you're opening boundaries.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.450
And as you're
expanding your network,

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.840
you're creating
opportunities for yourself.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.130
But you're also being seen.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.846
You're also being visible.

00:22:18.846 --> 00:22:19.970
You're putting in the work.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.400
So it's not just magically
appearing for you.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.020
You've actually
done your homework.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.170
You've started a project.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.270
You've done some research.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.497
You've created your side gig.

00:22:28.497 --> 00:22:30.080
So you're doing
something on the side.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.500
So now you're actually
sort of getting there.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.070
You're making, you're taking
the steps to get there.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.240
And now you're putting
yourself in a place

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.510
whether it's a networking
event or a conference

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.110
or some sort of
meet up where you're

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.520
meeting with the right people.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.690
And then, the key
to all of it, is

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.880
that you're seizing
on the opportunity,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.290
that you're ready for it.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.480
You now have your
eyes wide open,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.820
and you can see the opportunity,
and you seize the moment.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.580
You're not held back by fear.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.820
You're not held back by
feeling not confident.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.050
So I thought that was
really, really fascinating.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.600
And by the way, as I was
exploring serendipity,

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.560
I saw that it happens
here at Google,

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.880
which you all must know about.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.320
I mean this whole innovation
time off, the 20%?

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.010
I don't know.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.710
Does anyone actually do that?

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.210
They do?

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.860
OK, that is brilliant
and revolutionary.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.580
And that's another time where
your company is saying to you,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.600
go explore.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.560
Go innovate.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.940
Go be creative.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.040
Go have the headspace
to go work on something.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.150
Because we know that
when you have the time

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.300
and that sort of
mental space to do it,

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.874
great things are
going to happen.

00:23:34.874 --> 00:23:36.290
And that is really,
really similar

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.560
to this whole notion
of serendipity.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.570
And what has held a
lot of women back,

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.450
and I was actually
interviewing a guy who's

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.880
writing an entire
book on serendipity,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.250
is that he said that
women don't generally

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.970
have the time to noodle.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.650
We don't have the time to be
creative when we're working

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.810
a full-time job and
we have a family,

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.300
and you're rushing to get
home, pick up your child from

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.290
daycare, or make a train--

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.530
you just don't have
that time built in.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.610
Whereas men just sort of
either create the time,

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.250
aren't racing to
get to the train

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.290
or relieve the
babysitter from daycare

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.740
or their nanny in the same way.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.109
And they have more time.

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:14.650
So I do think that
there's definitely

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.010
sort of a gender divide, a bit
of a gender gap in this area.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.570
Because we tend to
not have the time,

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.860
or we're not taking
it upon ourselves

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.520
to be able to engineer
this moment for ourselves,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.990
this serendipity.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.060
The other issue that, of
course, I kept exploring,

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.840
which is part and parcel to
everything in the tech world

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.460
today, is networking.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.490
Right, so it's all
about networking.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.200
Everything we do
today is networking.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.050
That is the sort of
foundation of how we connect,

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.890
and it's all about the networks.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.000
But one of the things
that women haven't really

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.920
had until very recently are
really strong female networks.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.080
And I will tell
you, and I'm older

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.280
than maybe a lot of you
sitting here in the room,

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.480
but when I was coming
up through the ranks

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.520
and I worked in media, I
had a lot of female bosses.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.044
But I never felt as if--

00:25:06.044 --> 00:25:08.210
I didn't feel like it was
an all out catfight, where

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.950
we were like crawling
over each other,

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.720
trying to get to the top.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.830
But I didn't feel like any of
my bosses or any of the women

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.154
who I worked with were
trying to lift me with them.

00:25:17.154 --> 00:25:18.820
I didn't feel like
they were raising me.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.278
I did feel like
there was a smaller

00:25:20.278 --> 00:25:22.290
piece of the pie at the top.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.910
They wanted to hold onto it.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.060
So they didn't pull me
along in the process.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.400
But I have really seen a huge
change in the past few years--

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.340
are the amount of
female networks

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.862
out there in all
different industries.

00:25:35.862 --> 00:25:38.070
Of course, you probably know
about the tech industry.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.330
And there's so many
here in New York,

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.770
and there's so
many in different--

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.790
from Nashville to
Austin to San Francisco.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.430
But I'm talking about a whole
bunch of different industries.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.150
I have a friend
who is actually--

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.560
she's an interior designer.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.070
She was out in, I think Sun
Valley a few weekends ago,

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.480
with her female
network of designers.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.450
And of course, they're
using technology.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:01.170
They're using the WhatsApp
chats and Facebook

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.700
and different groups to connect
and to support each other.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.350
This just didn't
exist in the same way.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:11.590
So as I was really digging into
female networks, of course,

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.570
I found one that maybe some of
you know about, Tech LadyMafia?

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:16.440
Tech LadyMafia?

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.930
So Aminatou Sow created Tech
LadyMafia with a friend.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.470
And the whole idea
around this network,

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.790
not just let's connect
and support each other,

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.000
but they actually have
done something really,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.110
really, I think, unique
and really empowering

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.380
for women in that
they've codified

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.900
this whole concept of asking
for something and offering.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:42.520
So when you show up to a
meet up for Tech LadyMafia,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.810
it's implied that you might
need something from someone,

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.780
and you're also willing to give.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.160
Because here's the thing.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.030
We women do not like
to ask for help.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.360
We don't like to say, hey, can
you hook me up with someone?

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.029
Hey, can you help me.

00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:58.320
I'm trying to design a website.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.778
I really don't know
what I'm doing.

00:26:59.778 --> 00:27:01.510
We don't really like
to ask for help.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.800
We tend to sort of take
it out on ourselves.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.310
But they have actually
codified this whole concept

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.820
of asking and offering, which
is really amazing to me.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.290
So that was one of the
networks that I found.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.600
But, again, it's just sort
of this whole sisterhood

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.780
that I feel like we're really
feeling across the country

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.600
right now, particularly,
even, after the election.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.440
As a side note, I'm working
on a project following

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.240
women who are running for
office for the first time.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.870
And some of these
candidates have

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.860
created their own political
networks of other women.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.540
Which again, completely
new and revolutionary,

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.460
which is really going to change
the whole landscape for women

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.370
out there.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.781
So to create our
serendipity, we also

00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:44.030
have to have a strong network.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.160
We need to be able
to lean into women.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.432
We also need to be able
to grow our networks,

00:27:48.432 --> 00:27:50.890
because, of course, there's
all these studies that show you

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.680
only know who you know, right?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.630
So you're not going to
really get jobs or find

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.290
other opportunities only by
the network of people you know.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.740
You need to keep
expanding your boundaries.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.670
So I thought this was
pretty fascinating, too.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.740
And today, as you all
know, in the tech space,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.810
it's art meets technology.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.210
Retail meets technology.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.870
Entertainment meets technology.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.310
There's all these
intersections today.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.550
And the more that we
push out and meet people

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.590
who we don't yet know
and experience industries

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.060
we aren't familiar with,
the more opportunity

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.990
we have for ourselves.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.330
And the last theme that I
was really sort of into,

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.730
because it's so obvious,
is branding, right?

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:33.970
How do we talk about ourselves?

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.410
How do we share who we are?

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.360
Again, this is a concept
that a lot of women

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.590
can be very squeamish about.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.680
We don't like to
brag about ourselves.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.260
We don't like to boast
about what we've done.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.830
And this really
came to light when

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:51.670
I was speaking in Washington,
DC a few weeks ago to a group

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.280
of 50 female attorneys.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.760
All of them unemployed--
because they'd all either

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.690
worked at the White
House for Obama

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.960
or for the Justice
Department under Obama.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.870
So we had 50 Democratic
women, female attorneys,

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.590
all looking for a job.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.520
And they said, you
know, it was in November

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.324
when Hillary lost the election.

00:29:11.324 --> 00:29:13.490
They knew they were going
to need to find a new job.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.120
And they started
rewriting their resumes.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.300
And they said, we work
with all of these men.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.190
And you would have thought, by
looking at these guys' resumes,

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.860
that they were running
the Justice Department.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:28.326
They basically-- everything that
happened, they owned, they did.

00:29:28.326 --> 00:29:30.200
Where the women really
thought, yeah, well, I

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.980
was at that meeting.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.830
I was on that team.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.920
You know, I can't
really say I did that.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.880
But the guys, they were like,
running the West Wing, also.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.300
So you know, it's such an
interesting gender divide

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.320
in how we own what
it is that we do

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.122
and how we share with the
world what it is that we do.

00:29:49.122 --> 00:29:50.580
But the only way
for people to know

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.230
is that visibility again, right?

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.540
Everything is online.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.510
Everything is
through social media.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.220
Everything is about networking.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.180
If we don't tell people
what it is that we do well,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.110
they're not going to
know what we do well.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.390
And so particularly, when
you're looking for a job,

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.810
or you're looking to pivot,
or you're looking to explore,

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.520
you're keeping your eyes open--

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.460
people need to know what
it is that you do well.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.620
As the kids call it today,
what's your super power?

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.150
But surely you need to sort
of own your own narrative,

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.700
and what it is
that you do, and be

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.075
able to share that
with the world

00:30:21.075 --> 00:30:22.940
and not feel so
squeamish about it.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.980
You know, it has been sort of
thought to be impolite to brag,

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.500
but I would like to
change that whole notion.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.090
That branding yourself is
not necessarily bragging,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.630
it's about letting people
know what it is in the world

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.960
that we do.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.180
So I would love to open
this up to questions,

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.880
if anyone has questions.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.295
It's always more fun
to take questions.

00:30:46.295 --> 00:30:47.500
Question?

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.660
Yep.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You've obviously

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.740
experienced being a working
woman, being single,

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.270
and married, having kids.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:04.340
And some of your preferences
now are to life with a family.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.800
And I, having a
kid, look back at--

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.220
I especially think I'm more--

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.719
I feel bolder and more confident
and more willing to take risks,

00:31:11.719 --> 00:31:13.510
more willing to do
everything [INAUDIBLE],,

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:14.650
everything actually,
after having a child.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.875
Because that was
positive, even though it

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.090
presented its own strain.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.980
But I also look back
at my three year self,

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.980
and I'm like, wow, what
a squandered opportunity

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.544
to do more.

00:31:24.544 --> 00:31:25.960
WENDY SACHS: That's
a great point.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.070
AUDIENCE: So I guess some
of the people in this room

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.950
don't-- haven't yet gotten
to the point of having

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.450
your family.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.892
And I'm wondering what
you'd urge those of us who

00:31:31.892 --> 00:31:34.100
do and don't yet have some
of those other [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.240
and other commitments.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.990
WENDY SACHS: I think
that's a great point.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:40.000
And I would say use that free
time before you have children

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.070
to your fullest.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.030
Explore everything that you can.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.690
This is the time to create--

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.020
seize those opportunities,
and do everything

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.160
that it is that you want
to do, from also, even,

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.420
just traveling, seeing the
world and having experiences.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.420
Because certainly in the early
years, when Zeba is young,

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.231
it's hard.

00:32:00.231 --> 00:32:00.730
It's hard.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.570
My kids are teenagers now.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.640
And it's easier to have
that, also, mental space.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.480
So I would not have
been able to write

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.340
this book a few years ago.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.405
I think that we
also need that head

00:32:11.405 --> 00:32:17.490
space to be able to explore and
to noodle and to get creative.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.140
I also think that it's really
important for all of us

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.100
at any stage in your life
to really get comfortable

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.410
in the uncomfortable.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.380
You know, that's a Navy SEALs
expression for obvious reasons.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.920
And I am sure it's
been adopted by others.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.820
But I really buy that belief.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.586
Because that gives us all
the opportunity to get

00:32:37.586 --> 00:32:39.210
used to feeling a
little uncomfortable.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.214
And that's where the greatest--

00:32:41.214 --> 00:32:43.630
that's where all the amazing
things that we're going to do

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.030
are going to come from.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.230
That's where we're going to
be able to grow the most--

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.936
in taking jobs that
make us nervous, right?

00:32:50.936 --> 00:32:52.310
Like, when we get
too complacent,

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.970
we're not bringing our A game.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:57.520
And also, what's risky
for one person is not

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.820
risky for someone else.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.100
So it's figuring out what
that risk is for you.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.354
Anyone else?

00:33:06.354 --> 00:33:07.770
AUDIENCE: Can you
speak a bit more

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.990
to the concept of
pivoting and re-launching?

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:19.430
So how in your career
have you faced the need

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:24.350
to pivot from perhaps
one particular field

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.060
to a completely different one?

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.850
Or could you just talk a bit
more about how that plays out?

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:29.600
WENDY SACHS: Sure.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.560
I would say that the
through line to my career

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.060
has been storytelling.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.550
But that's before it was even
called storytelling, right?

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.270
It was called reporting.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.870
It was called journalism.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.950
It's called writing.

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.220
Now it's all storytelling.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.620
I did-- I really
wanted to move into--

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.900
I wanted to get some
tech experience.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.690
Although I'm not an engineer,
so not that kind of experience.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.110
I've never coded before.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.410
But I wanted to work
for a tech company.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:58.780
So I had started on the Hill.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.570
So I started in politics.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.190
And then I moved to New
York, and I worked in TV.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.570
I worked at
"Dateline NBC and Fox

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.199
and then Larry
Ellison was starting

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.630
this new internet
computer company.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.770
And I got a job to be
his media director.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.179
The company really blew up.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:19.270
But it was my first experience
going to CS back in the day,

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.880
before CS became so wild.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.830
And so I did that.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.440
And then I actually
wrote another book

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.980
on work-life balance called
How She Really Does It.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.130
And that actually
led me into going

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.449
into what we would call the
dark side, for journalists.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:35.020
But I went into PR.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.154
And I was doing the other side
of it all, which I actually

00:34:38.154 --> 00:34:39.070
had an okay time with.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.150
Now, of course, that's
called branded content,

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.540
everything that I was doing.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.440
So the vernacular
keeps changing.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.699
So I would say that there's
a bunch of different things

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:49.989
to mention with pivoting.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.480
For people who are
going and doing

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.290
a full 180, like I want
to become a dentist now,

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.530
obviously that would be
incredibly different.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.442
It would require me to
go to dental school.

00:35:00.442 --> 00:35:02.900
But a lot of things, when people
say that they're pivoting,

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.490
at least what I've
found, they're

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.310
things that are almost
companions to things

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.150
that they're doing.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.880
So they're not completely
removed from their skill sets.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.670
So my whole advice is about
really leaning into your skills

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.370
and just figuring out the new
ones that you have to learn.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.520
And as you know
better than anyone,

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.230
you can do this stuff online.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:23.520
There's a lot of
ways to take classes.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.950
To have that whole
side gig that everyone

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:29.690
seems to feel very
romantic about these days,

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.530
but having that sort of
side project that you

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.770
start noodling with to see
is there viability here?

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:37.420
Am I any good at this?

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.860
Can I make money if
I need to make money?

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.910
What can I really do?

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.530
And what I've also found is
just changing the language

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.490
of how we talk about ourselves.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.560
I will tell you I have
scrubbed my LinkedIn profile,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.850
in the past 10 years,
probably 35 times,

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.430
because I keep seeing
how job descriptions are

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:58.930
being posted now.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.510
The language being used is so
different than the language

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.750
I was using.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.320
So now everything that
I've done in my past

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.210
seems to be storytelling
and marketing.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.920
I would never have called myself
a marketing person before.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.080
But yet that's what
branded content is.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.070
And so the world
just keeps changing.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:19.040
So it's about also not
feeling like a fraud

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.860
for calling yourself--

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.720
putting that label on, when
you feel like that label

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.966
isn't exactly what you
went to school for,

00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:27.590
but that's what
they're calling it now.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.055
And yes, your skills apply.

00:36:29.055 --> 00:36:32.074
So I'm not saying lie
and be a fraud at all.

00:36:32.074 --> 00:36:33.990
But I'm saying that we
have to be a little bit

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:37.250
more open minded and realize
that to stay relevant,

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.830
you need to really see
where trends are going,

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.900
and see how you fit in there.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.020
Or, if you want to
do a total relaunch,

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.900
figure out what you need to know
and learn to completely shift

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.120
gears, which could be
incredibly different than what

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.100
you know right now.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:58.030
AUDIENCE: Hey there, so I was
actually at the confidence girl

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:02.680
code, whatever it's called,
conference that they hosted,

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.680
Katty, Shipman and whatnot,
in Baltimore a few months ago.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.670
I was a panelist
on the STEM panel.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.450
And so I took my
daughter, and we attended

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.630
the whole conference, actually.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:18.730
And a summary of some
of the messages I heard

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.560
was, obviously, be
confident, stand up

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.420
straight, give a firm
handshake, look them in the eye.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.330
But be authentic, be yourself.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:31.800
And it was like this
tug of war of advice

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.920
that I felt like was kind of
contradictory in the message.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.420
Because at the end
of the day, we're

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.320
telling women to sort
of reshape themselves,

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.120
to be more acceptable
in the male environment.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.170
And one of the
things that I really

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.720
liked about Google
and Silicon Valley,

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.210
is that this concept
of, you don't

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.470
have to wear a suit
to be taken seriously.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.740
And so the point
is that you don't

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.710
have to look a certain way--

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.880
as a man-- or sound
a certain way,

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.190
or even be particularly
social-- socially acceptable--

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.150
to be taken seriously.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.200
And what really mattered
was that you were smart,

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.980
you had great ideas, and
you got the thing done.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.650
So I guess my-- this is
probably more a comment,

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.800
to see what your
response might be.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.980
But my hope is that
we can get to a place

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.630
where we can stop telling women
to change themselves, and get

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:27.850
to a place where--

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.870
just like the culture
we have built here--

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:32.630
you can be whatever you
need to be as a person,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.890
and you'll still be accepted
because the work you produce

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.710
is excellent.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:42.190
So I guess I'm kind of tired of
hearing all the advice around--

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.690
WENDY SACHS: That
we need to change.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:44.898
AUDIENCE: --do this, do that.

00:38:44.898 --> 00:38:46.240
And I did all those things.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.880
And so when I sit
on panels, now,

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.290
what I say to the
young woman thinking

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.420
about careers in tech is, I'm
going to be honest with you.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.970
You can stand up as straight
as you can stand up.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.520
You can give firm
handshakes until you

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.690
make their knuckles bleed.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.640
You can be the smartest
person in the room.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.720
But you're always going
to be disadvantaged

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.920
because you're a woman.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.400
And there's literally nothing
you can do to change that.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.204
And so--

00:39:14.204 --> 00:39:15.620
WENDY SACHS: I
think you're making

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.790
all very important
points that I think

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.560
we can all really appreciate.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.289
And one of the things--

00:39:22.289 --> 00:39:23.830
when I was talking
about even writing

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.700
about Hillary Clinton
in the book, and the way

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.350
she was perceived,
and her shrill tone.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:30.040
And she's not warm, she's not
authentic, she's too smiley,

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.242
she's whatever it may be.

00:39:31.242 --> 00:39:33.200
No one likes the way she
looks in her pantsuit,

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.760
she needs to lose weight,
all of that kind of stuff.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.990
You're absolutely right.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.230
And one of the women
who I quote in the book,

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:43.690
she talks about the fact that
we need to re-hear the way women

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:44.380
speak.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.420
She actually makes this
comparison to pre-Title IX

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.640
and sports in women, that the
way that women in sports were

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.810
perceived 20 years ago, I
would argue still a bit today--

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:59.649
that they're not given
the same validity.

00:39:59.649 --> 00:40:01.440
They're certainly not
given the same money.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.110
We see that with
the US soccer team,

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.500
with the women's soccer,
that they make less then men,

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.010
yet they win way more
than the guys do.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.520
But even that whole
idea that anyone

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.050
should tune in and watch women
play soccer-- that has changed.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:14.550
Right?

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.341
I would say that people
still aren't really

00:40:16.341 --> 00:40:18.666
watching the women
NBA league the way

00:40:18.666 --> 00:40:20.400
that they watch the
men because people

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.169
say it's not as exciting.

00:40:22.169 --> 00:40:23.960
And they don't have
the same kind of money.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:31.450
But the notion is that we
as a country, as a people,

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.430
need to re-hear the
way that women speak.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.670
So if a woman is
sounding a little--

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.400
her voice is going to
be higher than most men,

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.760
because that's the
way women are built.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.920
To not discredit that,
and not think that that

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.400
is too harsh, or too
bitchy, or too annoying,

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.380
that we all must adapt to that.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.070
So I do think
that, and maybe I'm

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.910
being a little
Pollyanna here, but I

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:56.940
think as more women
move up the ranks,

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.680
and as we lift more women, as
the sisterhood keeps bringing

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.465
women up with them,
and as I'm seeing

00:41:02.465 --> 00:41:05.770
and as I feel very
strongly about, that things

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:06.700
will start changing.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.360
We'll see more
females in technology.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.270
We'll see more women
in leadership position,

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.210
we'll see more
women in Congress.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.080
And we will adapt
and accept the way

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.840
they look, the way they sound,
the way that they communicate.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.610
And that is when things
will start changing.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.450
But even women don't like
the way that women present.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.370
We really saw that play
out in the election.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:29.289
It was really shocking
to so many of us,

00:41:29.289 --> 00:41:30.830
when we looked at
the numbers, and we

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:33.040
looked at what was coming back.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.030
Women just didn't
even like women.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.290
And that's another big issue
of what needs to change.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
what I'd like to see

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:44.320
is more books around how to
be a person that can just

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.829
accept women the way they are.

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:50.120
I heard the advice around,
don't say I'm sorry so much.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:50.953
I've heard it a lot.

00:41:50.953 --> 00:41:52.400
And I really tried,
myself, to not

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.990
do it, until I reached a
point where I was like,

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.930
you know what?

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.680
Maybe we have it right.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.770
To say you're sorry
is a good thing.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.630
It's like you're being kind,
and empathetic, compassionate,

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:03.550
considerate.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:06.720
Maybe the advice should
be to the assholes who

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.770
treat people who say I'm sorry
badly to not do that as opposed

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.420
to the other way around.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.319
WENDY SACHS: Well, I
think, being authentic,

00:42:14.319 --> 00:42:16.110
there's nothing wrong
with being authentic.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:18.590
I think that when we are
authentic, that is actually--

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.550
the people who come across the
most authentic are the ones who

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.080
get jobs, are well liked.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.210
And there's tons of
studies on all of that.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.460
But when we are faking it,
people can size that up in it

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.400
millisecond.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.030
I mean we see
facial expressions,

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:36.140
and we're sort of brilliant
at seeing inauthenticity.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.190
So keep being you.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.730
AUDIENCE: In your research,
did you hear any murmurings

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:47.640
or indications that perhaps
men are learning and listening

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.971
from how women usually approach
things, opening [INAUDIBLE],,

00:42:50.971 --> 00:42:54.340
getting to the point,
closing warmly.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.920
I don't think it's just
what can we learn from men,

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.630
and be better at.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:03.141
It's what are women doing right
that men can also learn from?

00:43:03.141 --> 00:43:04.640
WENDY SACHS: Well,
I mean, there are

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.330
a lot of studies that show that
the nurturing skills that women

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:11.750
have are incredibly
effective in leadership.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:13.930
And we also know
that when women are

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:16.540
at the top in organizations,
when they have more management

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.860
roles, when they are in C-Suite
roles, businesses do better.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.520
Study after study after
study proves that diversity

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.190
is good for the bottom line.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.020
I didn't really see that the
guys are looking to women

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.910
to sort of soften up or
to be more collaborative

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.860
or to do the things
that women do so well.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.822
I think that to the other--

00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:39.030
I don't know your name, but--

00:43:41.796 --> 00:43:46.080
to Katty's point, that
embracing who we are as women,

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.410
is really important
and really essential.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.910
And I agree.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.550
We don't need to change.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:53.910
We need to be aware
of how we present,

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.750
because the truth is,
the rest of the world

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:57.720
hasn't caught up to us yet.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.940
So I think it starts
with an awareness,

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.060
even back to Tammy
Reese's gmail plug.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.230
And she's not saying, never say
just or actually or I'm sorry,

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:10.360
it's more of an awareness
of how we're communicating.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.160
But I do think that
women should be leaning

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.510
into all of the skills
that we do so well, which

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.720
is we're great collaborators.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.220
Right?

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.722
So even going back to that
whole idea about networking,

00:44:19.722 --> 00:44:21.180
I've spoken to many
rooms, and I'll

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.777
say to women, who
likes to network here?

00:44:23.777 --> 00:44:24.860
I mean, I can ask you all.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.050
Who likes to network?

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.760
Anyone like to network?

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.300
No one?

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.350
So OK, well, you like
to-- well, you're really

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:32.940
confident and authentic
and good for you,

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.730
but so many women
don't like to network.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:39.520
We feel that it makes us
feel a little uncomfortable.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.550
We're asking for something,
and transactional,

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.420
and it feels very cold.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.770
Guys have been doing it forever.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:48.811
They go in, they say what
they need, they're out,

00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:51.810
they get a beer, you know,
they go play golf, done.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.860
Women don't like to do that.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.760
But what we're
really, really good at

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.470
is building relationships.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:59.600
And we're really good at
creating relationships

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.500
that last a long time.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.840
We need to play the long game.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.530
So I would argue,
that women, we need

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.370
to sort of rethink networking.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:09.400
Think of it more--
even relabeling that.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.070
We're connecting.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.880
We're showing up and we are
connecting, because women

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.410
do that really, really well.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:17.190
We bond very quickly.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.355
If we were all sitting
together, in like five minutes

00:45:20.355 --> 00:45:22.230
I'd know what you all
did for a living, where

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.540
you lived, if you were dating
someone, if you had a child.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.380
I might comment
on the cool shoes

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.080
that you're wearing,
whatever it may be.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.750
Women bond very, very naturally
and very authentically.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:37.560
So I really do think it's almost
re-imagining what networking is

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.230
and realizing that we're
building sort of relationships

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:44.760
with one another that are
real, that are authentic,

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.615
and that we know
will last awhile.

00:45:49.085 --> 00:45:50.210
AUDIENCE: Folks, I'm sorry.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.170
If you have a question, if
you can use the two mics,

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.160
just so that the sound
is picked up properly.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.136
Thank you.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.330
AUDIENCE: I mean,
obviously, it's true that--

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:05.010
I think we have it
right, and I think

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.700
we are aware of the
issues that women face,

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.599
that women aren't wrong for
doing the things that they do

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:13.640
and the way they present.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.280
Being warm is never a bad thing.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.740
Being kind is never a bad thing.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:22.080
But I feel like we are in the
very vast minority of people

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.680
who are aware of this issue.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.960
And obviously you
mentioned Hillary Clinton.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:34.730
The vast majority of America
is not aware of the biases

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.320
that we are aware of.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.220
So I guess, navigating
through this world,

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.460
I obviously am not condoning
that we should change

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.460
or anything.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.222
But you did mention you
wanted to say sorry,

00:46:46.222 --> 00:46:48.180
because you felt like
that was how you came off

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.800
as warm, warmer.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.610
Because I grew up, people
calling me bossy all the time,

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:58.100
because I was confident, I
was able to say what I wanted.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.810
Not being rude, but in
just a sense being direct.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.890
But how do you avoid that?

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.579
Like what kind of strategies--

00:47:04.579 --> 00:47:06.370
could you delve more
into like other things

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:07.850
you've tried as like a leader?

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:08.760
WENDY SACHS: Yeah.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.540
Yeah, I do think that a lot
of it is facial expression.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.110
So the problem when I was
told that I was abrasive,

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.020
I was actually working remotely.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.560
So a lot of my conversations
were over the phone.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.430
So I thought I was
being very direct.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.140
And my boss actually said
to me, who is a woman,

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.240
she said, I know
that you're warm.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.160
You smile, you're very
engaging in person.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.810
But you know, on
the phone, people

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:32.050
think you're a little bossy.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.940
And again, a man
would never have

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.540
been accused of being bossy.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.800
I was just direct.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.510
I thought, we've got time.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:41.810
We've got 30 minutes on the
call, in, out, done, good.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:46.520
They're not seeing me smile,
because it's on the phone.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.330
But I do think so
that personal-- so

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:52.270
what I have learned is
I do try to smile a lot.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:55.320
I mean, it's not
unnatural for me to smile.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.440
I think I'm probably
now more aware of that.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.940
And I also think,
maybe, that it also

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.560
comes with a little bit more
confidence in age, also.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.520
Of just not feeling like
I have something to prove,

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.110
so maybe I'm not coming in
like, the bull in the china

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:14.300
store type of thing, that I'm
a little bit softer as I even

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.220
speak.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:16.950
Yeah, I do.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:20.890
I am hyper aware
of how I present.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.890
And so my advice
to you is smile.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.900
Smile, warmth, and then
say what you need to say.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.160
Be smart, and never hedge on
being smart, as none of us

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.910
would do, I'm sure.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.600
But you know, you
want to come across

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.100
and make your points clear.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.820
There was something
else that I didn't

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.760
mention when I was talking.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.160
And I think it's actually
really interesting.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.760
And it goes to sort
of the solidarity

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.010
of the sisterhood, and this
networking, and the change

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:44.677
that I'm seeing.

00:48:44.677 --> 00:48:46.843
And I write about, and it's
called the amplification

00:48:46.843 --> 00:48:47.410
effect.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:48.590
Have you all heard of this?

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.370
Yeah, yeah, right on.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.480
So for those who
don't know, I had

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.590
read about this in
"The Washington Post"

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:57.640
that the women in
the Obama White House

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.270
realized very early
in the administration

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.470
that they were being ignored.

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:05.460
They were ignored
by the president,

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.540
and by pretty much
everyone in the West Wing.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.160
And they'd come into meetings
and the president never

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:14.260
called on them for questions or
for their thoughts or anything

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.430
like that.

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:18.130
Or, if they did
speak up, their ideas

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:20.450
were being usurped by
the guy in the room.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:21.090
You know?

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:23.256
So they made a point, and
all of a sudden, you know,

00:49:23.256 --> 00:49:24.800
like, John is owning that point.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.250
So they got together,
and they realized

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.510
that they needed to do
something about this,

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.870
and that they were going to
amplify each other's messages.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:35.270
So if Yas said something
brilliant in a meeting

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:38.370
with the president,
as I'm sure she has,

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:41.330
I would then say, you
know, as Yas said earlier.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:44.500
And now the point is
being owned by Yas.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.631
I'm emphasizing that.

00:49:45.631 --> 00:49:47.630
The president's looking
over at Yasmin like, oh,

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:50.350
yeah, smart lady, good point.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:51.950
And they started doing that.

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.580
They started making sure that
they were calling on each other

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.670
and reinforcing the comments to
make sure that the guys weren't

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:59.280
stealing any of these ideas.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.100
But something
interesting happened,

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:04.820
which was that President Obama
started calling on the women

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.320
more.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.080
Started inviting them
to more meetings.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.130
They were visible.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.290
They made themselves visible.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:12.940
So this whole concept
of amplifying each other

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.000
is really important.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.810
And certainly not just in the
West Wing, but in the work

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:17.620
space, right?

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.240
We need to be
supporting each other.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.150
We need to be recognizing
what we're saying,

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:23.740
what our contributions are.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.660
And it's really,
really helpful to have

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.810
someone else do that for you.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:32.522
I don't know if anyone here
read Jessica Bennett's book,

00:50:32.522 --> 00:50:34.230
and I'm going to screw
up the name-- it's

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.880
"The Feminist Fight
Club" is her book,

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.600
and which is a great read.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.790
And she writes about
having a boast bitch.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:43.872
And that boast bitch
is someone who--

00:50:43.872 --> 00:50:45.580
by the way, it could
be your best friend,

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.955
it could be your
mother, it could

00:50:46.955 --> 00:50:49.660
be your sister-- it's having
someone be able to amplify

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:50.700
messages for you.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.300
And I'm sure there's
tons of studies on,

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.890
with Facebook likes, and
Instagram likes, and you know,

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.360
what gets the most likes
and all this kind of stuff.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.060
But there's something to be
said, when someone else says

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.410
something about you, or
someone posts something like,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.440
oh, I'm so proud of my wife--

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.940
her book was published--

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.570
that tends to get more likes
than if I actually put out,

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:13.410
hey, my book was published.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.115
So it's the same
sort of concept.

00:51:15.115 --> 00:51:16.960
So you have someone else.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.180
You have someone who's
amplifying the great work

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.690
that you're doing
in the workplace.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.820
And having that boast
bitch is really effective.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.220
First of all, I
just love the idea,

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.000
and I think it's very empowering
and very much as a sisterhood

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.200
that we need to be
supporting each other.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.150
I know I digressed.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.731
Does anyone have
any other questions?

00:51:39.731 --> 00:51:40.980
I think we need to wrap it up.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.990
Thank you all, thank you
guys for inviting me.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.190
Thank you Google for having me.

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:47.090
This is quite an
honor to be here.

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.480
Truly, I'm thrilled to have
been able to speak at Google.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.400
This is really very exciting.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.200
Thank you.
