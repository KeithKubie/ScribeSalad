here today to tell you about how you can

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420
here today to tell you about how you can
 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.390
here today to tell you about how you can
make your app ready for the wrist with

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400
make your app ready for the wrist with
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.060
make your app ready for the wrist with
Android wear let's take a look at how

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
Android wear let's take a look at how
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.009
Android wear let's take a look at how
developing for Android wear is different

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
developing for Android wear is different
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.749
developing for Android wear is different
than developing traditional Android apps

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759
than developing traditional Android apps
 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.450
than developing traditional Android apps
one key benefit of Android wear is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
one key benefit of Android wear is
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.670
one key benefit of Android wear is
giving people the information they need

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
giving people the information they need
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830
giving people the information they need
right when they need it we realize that

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
right when they need it we realize that
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.720
right when they need it we realize that
your Android device already does a lot

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
your Android device already does a lot
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.609
your Android device already does a lot
of this through notifications so we

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
of this through notifications so we
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.320
of this through notifications so we
decided to start by bringing those same

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
decided to start by bringing those same
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359
decided to start by bringing those same
notifications to your wrist I'll show

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
notifications to your wrist I'll show
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.959
notifications to your wrist I'll show
you what I mean here I have my Nexus 5

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969
you what I mean here I have my Nexus 5
 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.610
you what I mean here I have my Nexus 5
I've installed the Android wear preview

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
I've installed the Android wear preview
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.200
I've installed the Android wear preview
app on it and I've paired it to my

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
app on it and I've paired it to my
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.780
app on it and I've paired it to my
emulated device I have a small app which

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
emulated device I have a small app which
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.400
emulated device I have a small app which
creates notifications with different

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
creates notifications with different
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.709
creates notifications with different
styles notice how the notification

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
styles notice how the notification
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.810
styles notice how the notification
appears on Android wear automatically I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
appears on Android wear automatically I
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180
appears on Android wear automatically I
can update the notification and the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
can update the notification and the
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.389
can update the notification and the
changes are immediately bridged over

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399
changes are immediately bridged over
 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.799
changes are immediately bridged over
even better I can dismiss the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
even better I can dismiss the
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.630
even better I can dismiss the
notification from my Android wear device

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
notification from my Android wear device
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.150
notification from my Android wear device
and it will disappear from my phone this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
and it will disappear from my phone this
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400
and it will disappear from my phone this
is a really powerful concept this means

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
is a really powerful concept this means
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.750
is a really powerful concept this means
that if your app post notifications

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
that if your app post notifications
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.689
that if your app post notifications
today it's already on your wrist it's

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
today it's already on your wrist it's
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.039
today it's already on your wrist it's
worth noting that all of this is

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
worth noting that all of this is
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.840
worth noting that all of this is
possible thanks to the notification

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
possible thanks to the notification
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120
possible thanks to the notification

4.3 so let's talk about how to get
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920
4.3 so let's talk about how to get
started developing for Android wear

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
started developing for Android wear
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.100
started developing for Android wear
first go to developer.android.com where

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
Preview and browse the documentation you
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.560
Preview and browse the documentation you
should also download the system image

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
should also download the system image
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.660
should also download the system image
from the SDK manager to create an

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
from the SDK manager to create an
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.469
from the SDK manager to create an
Android virtual device with Android wear

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479
Android virtual device with Android wear
 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.700
Android virtual device with Android wear
finally install the Android wear a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
finally install the Android wear a
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.499
finally install the Android wear a
preview app and run it on your Android

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
