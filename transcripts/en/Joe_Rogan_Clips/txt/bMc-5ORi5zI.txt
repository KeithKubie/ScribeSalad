Speaker 1:          00:01          The Joe Rogan experience. It seems like a lot of people would want to listen to you though. I would imagine if I was in camp with a guy like you and I saw the kind of cardio that you have for a big guy and the amount of effort that you put in. I would imagine there's other dudes that are following you now.

Speaker 2:          00:16          No, I my teammates. Yeah. They know like I'm one of the guys, my bike, a brother to me, his car over sin. You're saying he stepped down, he stepped up on the glorified. That's something we talked about when he was an amateur. I've been working with amateur and I told his coach stand like this kid is good. He's correct stuff. He'd go pro. He'd been UFC in no time telling you cause he was, I watched him, me, him and Chris Weidman. He came in with us when I was hoping why more the Rocco fight and I've, I'm not sure if he was an amateur or pro yet, but he was hanging his, you just, you and her hustling. He didn't have that, but striking wise, he was giving us problems. It was like, this is, this kid is good. He's like, oh, he's a glory kickboxing.

Speaker 2:          00:49          Ah, that makes sense. He kicks hard like, I haven't seen them put many people were asleep with his head kicked in practice like Yo pull. He's like, Bro, that wasn't your heart. Like what'd you mean? It wasn't high. Like I just flicked it up there, but he's just so explosive and athletic. He hit me with a knee. What? Last Saturday my chest still hurt. It was like I shot and he caught me coming down and shot and I was like, Oh shit. But I was in deep, but he just so quick. It's just, but like he's one, he hits me up all the time. When you come to camp like, oh, he has died down because of Bo and Clint out of the pie, but to come like the work and stuff. Should we keep doing this? Should we do this? I'm going to run today, so when I want to work on my Jujitsu, what should I do this?

Speaker 2:          01:28          Should I just drill? Should we go hard? Should I go? Who trained? Sometimes the performance institute in Vegas, every time we get to camp, me and him, we got to think if one of us getting camp, we already know I'm a contact him. You gotta fight when we go into Vegas. So I go, we go out there for a week or two weeks. Me, him and Rex Harris, he was in the Pff, we call each other. The bass pro's only three dudes that you'll see in Jersey. We didn't traveled around. We'd been to Vegas, we've been to Arizona or wherever we go and we go hard. And that's why we call it a basketball. There's no, oh we're going light today bro. Don't hit me every time. It's like, are we ready? You Ready? Rex actually texted me was gonna take Mo. He was like, yeah, I'll be there tomorrow cause I'm flying here and I'll get back in time for training.

Speaker 2:          02:05          So Bass Bros meet up and we'd go at it. That's it. Are you, are you always far and hard or do you spark? We got certain days, like if we don't want to spoil heart, we know not to go with each other because it's kind of like if one week I get the best of wrecks. Like there's been times like I had Carl for we're OSP cause he south Pauling super good. So I won't recall three rounds heart. So it was his main focus was take down, no let them up. So I take him down and beat him on the ground, feet on the ground, taking him down and beat him on the ground cause he didn't have wrestling at the time. And then he would go with like somebody else. Like I need one more around and he'd be mad a lot. I know that, but that's why I'm not going home on the fourth, the fourth round, cause he's mad and he'd go out there with somebody else and just, you just eat them up.

Speaker 2:          02:43          It's like, I'm sorry, I have to apologize. The other guy like I'm sorry for beating him up because the hostility. So we go hard, but there's times we pull other guys and like I'm gonna call this amateur guy in pretty good amateur or a low level pro pro. Some guys at 80 Alvarez knows whenever I got this kid, he's pro two oh five he's the beginning or whatever you want to work with him. That's the guy. Bring him up to the, I'm going to do a technical move day. Kinda like wall work, drilling. We sparring. We have Hagar on just in case cause accidents happened, but nothing has strong with intention to hurt anybody.
