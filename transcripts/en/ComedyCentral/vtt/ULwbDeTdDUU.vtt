AND THEN IT'S GOOD TELEVISION.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:29.929
LEGALLY, I'M OBLIGATED TO SAY

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.565
DON'T TRY JUMPING
OVER A SLOW-MOVING CAR.

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:35.201
YOU GOT TO TRY IT WHEN
THE CAR'S GOING SUPER FAST.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:38.404
THAT WAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY
IN THE AIR VERY LONG.

THAT HUMAN ROADKILL

HE'S NOT
A PROFESSIONAL STUNTMAN.

HE'S NOT AN ATHLETE.

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:48.481
HE'S JUST YOUNG, DUMB,
AND FULL OF [BLEEP].

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:49.882

BUT IT'S NO DIFFERENT
THAN WHEN YOU GALS GET TOGETHER

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:00.393
TO HURT EACH OTHER'S FEELINGS.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.695
DARES WORK BECAUSE
THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.464
OF HEAD TRAUMA ARE MINOR

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.533
