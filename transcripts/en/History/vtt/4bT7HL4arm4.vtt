00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:05.588
Well, the,
uh, scimitar right --

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:07.674
you see a weapon
similar to this.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.051
It's essentially
a -- a saber.

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.805
It is a type of slashing
and, uh, brawling blade.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:15.223
It goes by
different names

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.016
across Central Asia
and the Middle East.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.602
Uh, in Persia,
it's known as a shamshir.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.104
In India,
it's a talwar.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.523
And what they all have
is a single-edge blade

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.650
with a, uh, false edge
back here.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.818
Sometimes
they're straighter.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.570
Sometimes
they widen here,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.907
giving more mass to the point,
very similar to our falchions.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.701
It's not
the most maneuverable of swords,

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.327
and of course, this one's
a little bit enlarged

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:38.163
for the armored sport.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:41.708
But, um, it does have the
capacity to actually turn it,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.420
so that you can slip
that curvature of that point

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.216
right down in behind shields,
um, into faces, with thrust.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.676
It's a decent weapon,

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:55.096
and it survived for probably
more than 1,000 years.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.432
It's best on horseback,
camelback.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:01.269
It's not real effective
against hard armors, though.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.730
It's made for
soft targets.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.274
Blocking situation's
a lot more blade

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.901
to block
their blades with.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.361
Um, this does go
naturally up into that --

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.155
into that guard,
into the high guard.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.743
You can do a cross guard with
your shield, if you have to.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.536
I gotta be honest -- it feels
a little awkward in my hands...

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.079
-Yeah.
-...as far as compared

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.539
to the falchion
that we've had in here before,

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.208
where it felt very --
maybe because it was

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.335
a little heavy on top,
it felt even.
Right.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.587
But this feels
pretty awkward.
Once you get it
against a target

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.048
and do that draw,
you have that resistance.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.633
It actually feels
pretty good.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.636
Yeah, you're right now.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.806
And you'll see, uh,
a lot of, uh, period depictions

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.893
of particularly calvary charges,
where the calvary officer

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.813
is holding his weapon
along this line.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:48.316
This will tear.
It will do a ripping motion.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.027
It'll go into the body
and then roll out,

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:53.863
tearing out,
gouging out a large --

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.323
a large wound
in somebody.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.450
And as your --
as your horse goes by,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.328
the arm goes into this
natural position like this...
Right.

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:02.705
...which allows you
to bring it back on a slice,

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.374
or just hold it out
on the side.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.751
It's a little unwieldy.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.254
