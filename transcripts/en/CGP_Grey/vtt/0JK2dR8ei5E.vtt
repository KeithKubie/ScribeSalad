00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.061
In my animal misconceptions video I casually
mentioned that daddy long legs aren’t spiders

00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:07.310
and received a ton of comments asking for
clarification or suggesting that it’s not

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.330
that simple, so I feel the need to clear things
up a bit, but first, a disclaimer:

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.490
If images of spiders make you uncomfortable,
1) you shouldn’t have clicked on this video

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.450
and 2) you should stop watching, right, about
now.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.090
Cutest, spider ever.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.090
Right?

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.010
When editing the video, I decided to cut out
a daddy-longleg discussion, and now you’ll

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.010
see why.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.330
To answer the question ‘are daddy longlegs
spiders?’ we first need to know, what are

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.330
spiders?

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.699
And for that we need the biological classification
system you should have learned in high school.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.660
Spiders are in the animal kingdom – which
is a pretty broad class of life and not helpful

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.160
in narrowing things down.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.700
The phylum that concerns us are the arthropods
which are a subset of animals with external

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.000
skeletons, segmented bodies, and jointed limbs.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440
The arthropods with exactly eight legs and
two body segments are in a class called arachnids

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.800
– where the name arachnophobia comes from
– and while often used to mean fear of spiders,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.000
there are plenty of arachnids that are not
spiders, such as scorpions and mites.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.170
The true spiders, are a subset of Arachnids
in the order Araneae.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.489
What defines these as spider are their fangs
and the poison glands within them, their numerous

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.579
eyes and their spinnerets that allow them
to make webs.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.489
Now that we have a spider checklist on to
the second problem: the name ‘daddy longlegs’

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.460
means different things in different places.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.780
In Australia this cellar spider is called
a daddy longlegs – which as an eight-legged,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.140
multi-eyed, web-spinning member of Araniee
makes it an official spider.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.710
It also produces venom, but then so does everything
in that bloody country.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.409
Where I grew up this is a daddy longlegs (sometimes
called a harvestman).

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.670
They have just two, soulless eyes, can’t
web sling and lack fangs and poison glands

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.350
and so fail the spider checklist and are in
a different order called Opiliones.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.570
It was these I had it mind while making the
video.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.479
To make things more complicated, in my adoptive
UK the british call this Crane Fly daddy long

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.479
legs.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.080
Unlike the closely related Opiliones and Araniee
the Crane Fly isn’t an arachnid but an insect,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.659
the class of arthropods with six legs and
three body segments.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.350
And, as if the name wasn’t ambiguous enough
at this point, there is also a plant called

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.540
daddy long legs.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.479
For taxonomical completeness the plant is
over here a different kingdom.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.750
But, because of the way life works even this
plant is distantly related to those other

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.080
daddy longlegs because plants and animals
are both eukaryotes which means that their

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.780
cells have complex structures, most notably
a nucleus.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.510
So, to fully the first question: there are
four daddy long legs, three animals, two arachnids,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.060
but only one spider among them.
