00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.970
( intro music )

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.909
( radio noise )

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.482
( swooshing sound )

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.891
( audience applause )

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.398
(Natalie Batalha): Thank you
very much for having me.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.400 line:0%
Kepler, exoplanets.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.772 line:0%
NASA is on a quest to find
evidence of life beyond Earth.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.741
Do not doubt.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.610
It is the one of
the grand questions,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.445
"Is there anybody out there?"

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.682
One of the grand questions
that drives strategic planning

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.719
for NASA astrophysics, right.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.922
There are three paths that
we can take to get us there,

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:58.757
to find evidence of
life beyond Earth.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:02.228
One is solar system exploration.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:06.432
This beautiful image of
the plumes of Enceladus,

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:11.371
the landscapes of Mars
the Curiosity shows us,

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.940
compels us
to explore the solar system

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.475
and see if there is life lurking

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.711
in any of these
nooks and crannies,

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.748
in a subterranean cave on
Mars, in a subsurface ocean

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.418
on Europa or Enceladus.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.320
Whether or not we find life?

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.357
Maybe we'll find death,
in fossils, in extinction.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:35.495
Regardless, the
implications are profound.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.332 line:0%
The second path is
the SETI search,

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.968 line:0%
ears to the universe, listening,
searching for signals that

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.705 line:0%
are not astronomical
as we understand them.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:49.542 line:0%
Signals that are big
surprises that might be due to

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:53.546
technology, might be due to
intelligent life depicted by

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:57.717
the Allen Telescope Array
up in Northern California.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.119
But there's a third path

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.024
and that's looking for the
cradles of life as we know it,

00:02:06.024 --> 00:02:10.129
looking for planets like Earth

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.699
that could harbor surface
liquid water and could give rise

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.101
to life as we understand
it here on Earth,

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.271
carbon-based life.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.442
Well, this path was made
possible 20 years ago with

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:25.845
the first discovery of an
exoplanet orbiting a normal

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:28.781
main sequence kind
of star like our Sun,

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.350
and I just happened to be
at that conference,

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.653
I was a young graduate
student at the time,

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.389
and it was a conference
on stars, not planets,

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.158
that field of study
didn't exist at all!

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.995
It was cool stars, stellar
systems and the Sun,

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.831
no exoplanet in
the title, right?

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.100
In fact, that talk
wasn't even on the agenda.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.537
But next thing we knew, Michel
Mayor, a Swiss astronomer,

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:54.140
went up to the stage,
cameras were there,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.145
and announced the
discovery of 51 Peg b,

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:03.182
and it blew our mind!

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.452
It was unlike anything
we understood, right?

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:09.322
We understood the solar
system; close to the star

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:12.124
you've got the small rocky
planets; further out,

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:14.894
you've got the ice
and gas giants, right?

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.063
That's how solar systems
are supposed to form,

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.764
that's how they're supposed
to lay out, our own

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:21.000
solar system says it is so.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.469
And yet, here we had
a planet discovery,

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.539
a planet almost as
large as Jupiter,

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.942
with a four-day orbital
period around its star,

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:32.979
blasted by stellar radiation.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:37.984
Theorists did not know how
to make a planet like that.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.720
And that's basically how
the field of exoplanets

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.288
has been ever since.

00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:44.423
We have uncovered

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:48.160
an unparalleled
diversity of worlds.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.564
But what we want to look for,
what NASA wants to look for

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:55.968
are worlds not like this
gas giant

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:58.104
blasted by stellar irradiation

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:00.273
where surface
liquid water cannot exist;

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.741
we're looking for
the cradles of life.

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:06.479
And so we fast forward
to March of 2009.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.915
- (NASA):<i> Three, two...
 - engine start...</i>

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:13.352
<i> one, zero and lift off of the
 Delta II rocket with Kepler.</i>

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:16.655
<i>On a search for planets in some
 way like our own.</i>

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.124
( Technicians speaking
in background )

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:20.693
( Natalie Batalha ):<i> Kepler,
 NASA's first mission capable</i>

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:24.797
<i> of detecting potentially
 habitable earth-sized planets.</i>

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:28.501
<i> A space telescope launched
 into orbit about the Sun,</i>

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:32.704
<i> pointed toward one field of
 view about the size of my hand</i>

00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:35.575
<i> near the plane of
 the Milky Way galaxy,</i>

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:38.811
<i> focusing on about a
 150,000 stars there,</i>

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:42.714
<i> measuring their brightnesses
 with very high precision.</i>

00:04:42.714 --> 00:04:44.817
<i> Because for some of
 those systems,</i>

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.386
<i> planets that are in orbit</i>

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:49.822
<i> about the star will pass
 directly between the disk</i>

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:52.925
<i> of the star and the telescope,
 and the telescope will</i>

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:56.228
<i> perceive the presence of
 that planet as a momentary</i>

00:04:56.228 --> 00:05:01.100
<i> dimming of light, a dimming
 of light that repeats once</i>

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.069
<i> every orbital cycle.</i>

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.938
<i> This is Kepler's
 first light image.</i>

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:10.610
<i>Every tiny speck you see, every
 tiny pinpoint on that image</i>

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.846
is a star in this one hand
print on the sky in the

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:16.982
constellation of
Cygnus and Lyra.

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:21.553
There are 4.5 million
stars in this one footprint.

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:24.656
Kepler observed 150,000 of them.

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:28.393
The precision that's required
to see an Earth-sized planet

00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:31.664
transit across the disk
of a Sun-like star,

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:35.001
can be described with the
following thought experiment.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.337
Imagine the tallest
skyscraper in New York City,

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:41.174
maybe something like 80 stories
high, I don't even know how

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.977
tall the highest skyscrapers
in New York City anymore,

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.546
but let's pretend it's
about 80 stories high,

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:51.451
and it's occupied, every single
room is occupied, and it's

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:54.920
nighttime, all the windows
are open, every light is on.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.424
And one person in that
building goes to the window

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:02.728
and lowers the blinds
by about a centimeter.

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:06.098
That's the precision that's
required to see this tiny

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:09.501
diminution of light
caused by an Earth.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:13.506
So what I'd like to do is give
you kind of the big picture

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:16.108
of what exoplanets have
been discovered since that

00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:20.779
historic meeting in 1995 in
Florence, Italy where the first

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.547
exoplanet was announced.

00:06:22.547 --> 00:06:25.284
And I'm gonna do that
with a scatter plot.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.354
Kepler doesn't take beautiful
pictures of planets, right?

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.788
We don't find planets

00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:31.757
by pointing our telescope
up into the sky

00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:33.559
and saying,
"Aha, there's one!"

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:36.996
We must infer their existence
by measuring some property

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:39.865
of the star itself, okay?

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:43.935
So in this scatter plot,
it's going to be
radius or diameter

00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:47.039
of the planet versus
orbital period, okay?

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.375
And we're going to animate
this plot, adding discoveries

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:53.079
as they're made, and I'm
going to first show you those

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.214
discoveries that have been
made by every other team

00:06:56.214 --> 00:06:58.718
around the world except Kepler.

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.719
There will be some
horizontal...

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:02.721
There will be
some horizontal lines

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.057
to give you some reference.

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:09.027 line:0%
Earth sized has a horizontal
line, Neptune sized

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.797 line:0%
and Jupiter size.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:13.332
They're color coded by the
technique that was used

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:16.702
to find them, but I want you
to just get a general feel

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:20.006
for the patterns
that are emerging.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.841
2005, 2006...

00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:29.715
Earth is there for reference
at the orbital period and size.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.817
2011...12...

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.686
We start to see some patterns.

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:37.290
There is a swarm of blue
points up there on the left,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.093
Another larger swarm of pink
points in the upper right.

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:43.395
For reference, Jupiter
would have an orbital period

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:48.867
of just over 4,000 days, so
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000,

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:52.171
up to the line that is Jupiter,
and you see we have found

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:56.175
some Jupiter analogues out
there in the distant environs

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:58.344
of the solar system.

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:03.415
So this is what the scene
looks like, barring Kepler.

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:06.485
Over 85 percent of those
discoveries are planets larger

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:08.654
than Neptune.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.560
Now I'm going to show
you what Kepler has added

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.663
after analyzing four
years if its data.

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:22.301 line:0%
Through this technique
of transit photometry,

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:26.672 line:0%
measuring brightness,
Kepler has found over 4,200

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:31.310 line:0%
transiting objects; 90
percent of which, or more,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.347 line:0%
are going to be bona fide
exoplanets, planets orbiting

00:08:35.347 --> 00:08:37.416
other stars in our galaxy.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:41.687
Our blinders have been
lifted to small planets.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:44.857
The landscape has changed
dramatically, right?

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.660
Now more than 85 percent of
the known planets

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.161
or the planets
known to humanity,

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.631
are smaller than Neptune,
instead of larger,

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:53.999
which just goes to show

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:57.102
that our technology, we were
hampered by our technology.

00:08:57.102 --> 00:09:00.472
Every time you build a
new piece of technology,

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:02.908
you learn a tremendous amount.

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:05.911
Moreover, you can see that
there are some yellow points

00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:10.415
kissing that Earth locus
at one Earth diameter

00:09:10.415 --> 00:09:13.519
and 365-day orbital periods.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:18.190
So Kepler has begun to find
Earth, true Earth analogues.

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:24.363
The big question that
Kepler set out to answer is,

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:28.734
"What fraction of stars in
our galaxy harbor

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:31.036
potentially habitable
Earth-sized planets?"

00:09:31.036 --> 00:09:35.141
We want to get a feeling for
the for the ubiquity of planets

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:37.209
like Earth, these
cradles of life,

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.144
these potential cradles of life.

00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:40.580
Are Earths common?

00:09:41.646 --> 00:09:43.649
Are they are they prevalent
in our galaxy

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:47.119
or is our own Earth
somehow special?

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:49.154
So what have we
learned from Kepler?

00:09:49.154 --> 00:09:52.157
From Kepler, we can now with
this large sample of planets,

00:09:52.157 --> 00:09:56.361
we can ask the question, "Okay,
what is the population of

00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:58.730
planets out there?
What is their diversity?

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.166
What is the population?

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:04.803
How far do I have to go
out into the galaxy before I

00:10:04.803 --> 00:10:09.508
happen upon a potentially
habitable Earth-sized planet?"

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:12.010
You can ask this question
because of Kepler.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.649
And so the answer is, if we
were to take our own galaxy

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:19.417
and we were to shrink it down
to the size of the continental

00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:22.488
United States, and you
stand on one coast,

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:25.124
maybe here in Washington,
D.C., you look out

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:28.627
over the continent and
you ask yourself,
"How far is the nearest

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:31.363
potentially habitable
Earth-sized planet?"

00:10:31.363 --> 00:10:36.602
The answer is, about a stroll
across the National Mall,

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.137
between about
the Capitol building

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:40.005
and the Lincoln Memorial,

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:42.541
or about 15 light years.

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:45.644
( audience laughter )

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:49.715
Which is very close, given
the fact that the galaxy is

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:52.451
100,000 light-years across.

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:54.486
( continued chuckles )

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:56.856
Okay, so what's next?

00:10:56.856 --> 00:11:00.225
So we're kind of learning
that Earth-like planets are

00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:02.294
pretty common; that's good.

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:05.931
That means that exploration,
finding evidence of life,

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:08.367
following this path,
has great potential.

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:10.135
So, what's next?

00:11:10.135 --> 00:11:13.238
Well here on the left, I'm
showing you an image actually

00:11:13.238 --> 00:11:16.875
taken of Venus
transiting our own Sun.

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:20.612
This is an actual image of a
planet in our own solar system

00:11:20.612 --> 00:11:23.648
transiting across
the surface of our Sun.

00:11:23.648 --> 00:11:26.351
The Hinode spacecraft
took this image,

00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:30.389
and I'm showing it to you
because I want you to see

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:35.394
the very thin layer of orange
hugging that planet.

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.062
Do you see that?

00:11:37.062 --> 00:11:40.032
That's the Venusian atmosphere.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:43.402
It's very thin; it's only
five kilometers thick.

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:46.739
I think that's about the scale
height we call it, very thin.

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:49.040
In terms of area, if you
collected that whole area,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.212
it's only 1/200 the
area of the disc itself.

00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:59.584
So it's very, very thin, but
here's the thing: the sunlight,

00:11:59.584 --> 00:12:04.289
shining on the planet from
behind is filtering

00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:07.359
through that atmosphere
that's hugging it.

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:10.696
And when it does that, the
atmosphere itself is leaving

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:13.031
a fingerprint on that light.

00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:15.234
If I'm on the other side,
I can collect that light,

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:19.171
I can spread it out
into a spectrum, I inspect it,

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:22.107
and I can disentangle

00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:24.176
the fingerprint
that that atmosphere left

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:25.810
on the light.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.249
Which means, I may have the
ability with enough sensitivity

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:34.053
to disentangle what that
atmosphere was made of.

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:39.492
On the right-hand side of
this image is cyanobacteria,

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:43.028
it's like algae, and this
microscopic picture of

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:48.633
cyanobacteria was caught
in the act of metabolizing

00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:52.871
and producing
a tiny burp of oxygen;

00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:57.976
the very process which created
the oxygen on our own planet

00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:01.113
and gave rise
to more complex life forms.

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:04.049
So, that's the kind of signature
that we would want to see

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:07.018
by catching the light filtering
through the atmosphere.

00:13:07.018 --> 00:13:09.488
That's called "transmission".

00:13:09.488 --> 00:13:12.691
Now that's very tough, but
the James Webb Space Telescope

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:16.595
is going to do that very thing
for maybe larger planets,

00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:18.931
more like mini-Neptunes.

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:24.770
Another technique that I'm
looking forward to is imaging.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.939
What we really want,
talking about big dreams,

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:31.543
what we really want is to catch
the light reflecting off

00:13:31.543 --> 00:13:33.611
of the surface of a planet.

00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:36.181 line:0%
Here you've got the
Blue Marble on the left,

00:13:36.181 --> 00:13:39.951 line:0%
an iconic image taken by the
Apollo astronauts leaving Earth

00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:41.519 line:0%
on the way to the moon.

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:45.590 line:0%
That's an image that was
taken from 22,000 miles away;

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.460 line:0%
the first full disk
image of our planet.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.163 line:0%
And you can see the reflected
light, the light from the Sun

00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:54.800 line:0%
that's reflecting off the
planet and into the camera

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.169 line:0%
of the Apollo astronaut.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:14:01.606 line:0%
On the right-hand side, it's
the pale blue dot of Earth,

00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:07.545 line:0%
taken by the Cassini spacecraft
from 900 million miles away.

00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:11.416
It's unresolved; you don't
see the surface features,

00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:13.685
but the information is there.

00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:18.123
If you look at the Apollo image,
the way light reflects off

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:21.793
of every element of that
disk is different, right?

00:14:21.793 --> 00:14:24.129
The way it reflects off ocean
is different than the way

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:26.832
it reflects off land, which
is different than the way it

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:29.101
reflects off forest.

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:33.505
And those features, those
peculiarities, will be present

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:36.341
in the light, even
if it's unresolved.

00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:39.144
It will be present in the light
if we can take it with enough

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:41.947
sensitivity, we can spread
it out into a rainbow,

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:45.251
and we can see the indications
of those surface features.

00:14:46.584 --> 00:14:51.657
It's tough; these
planets are faint.

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:55.894
10 billion times fainter
than the star they orbit.

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:58.997
We are overwhelmed by
the glare of the parent star.

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:02.267
How are we going to see this
faint, little smudge that is an

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:06.538
Earth-like planet, potentially
habitable Earth-like planet?

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:10.709
Well, the way that we think
about doing it is kind of like

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:13.145
the way I would see you
out here in the audience.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:16.048
I'd have to put my thumb
over these lights.

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:18.550
Oh, wow, ( laughing ),
that works!

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.052
( audience laughter )

00:15:21.052 --> 00:15:23.322
We block out the light
of the parent star.

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:26.592
The problem is, you know that
the little planet,

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.327
it's like a little gnat
orbiting a big searchlight

00:15:29.327 --> 00:15:31.062
or a spotlight, right?

00:15:31.062 --> 00:15:35.500
A lighthouse; so, I take my
thumb and I cover it and then,

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.570
maybe I can see the
gnat flying next to it.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.706
But light bends, it bends around
obstacles; it still kind of

00:15:41.706 --> 00:15:44.576
introduces this diffraction,
this interference,

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:47.179
so I have to be careful
about the way that I design

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:50.816
my thumb, you know I need
to be kinda fancy about it.

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:54.352
But that kind of technology
is being developed today

00:15:54.352 --> 00:15:57.789
as we speak, and here's a little
clip showing some of that

00:15:57.789 --> 00:15:59.925
technology happening at JPL.

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:04.930
This is an animation of what
the thumb would look like.

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:12.003
<i> You launch a system, a space
 telescope that has connected</i>

00:16:12.003 --> 00:16:15.173
<i> to it, a sunflower.</i>

00:16:15.173 --> 00:16:18.443
<i> The petals that you see
 unfurling are a star shade,</i>

00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:21.012
<i> that's the thumb that
 you hold up.</i>

00:16:21.012 --> 00:16:24.249
<i> You fly it out some
 thousands of kilometers away,</i>

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:28.253
<i> and you use it to perfectly
 block the glare from the star,</i>

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:33.425
<i> thereby revealing the faint
 gnats orbiting the lighthouse.</i>

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.462
<i> So, I'll end with this image.</i>

00:16:37.462 --> 00:16:42.534
<i> 500 light-years away, there
 is a star called Kepler-186</i>

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:46.671
<i>in the constellation of Cygnus;
 that's Cygnus Lyra region.</i>

00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:50.042
<i> It's a red star, a star that's
 cooler than our own Sun,</i>

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:53.011
<i> and Kepler has found
 five planets so far</i>

00:16:53.011 --> 00:16:54.946
<i> orbiting that star.</i>

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:57.448
<i> The fifth planet out,</i>

00:16:57.448 --> 00:17:00.952
<i> at an orbital period
 of about 192 days,</i>

00:17:00.952 --> 00:17:05.524
<i> is within the uncertainty
 the same size as the Earth</i>

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.926
<i> to within 10 percent.</i>

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:11.096
<i> So what you're seeing here,
is not an image of that planet,</i>

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.465
<i> remember Kepler does not
 take pictures of planets,</i>

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:16.368
<i> it infer its existence and so
 we have to put a little bit of</i>

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:18.570
<i> our imagination into this.</i>

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.473
<i> We tell everything that we
 know to the artist and let him</i>

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:25.777
bring this world to life, but
I ask myself the question,

00:17:25.777 --> 00:17:28.613
"You know, if you have
water, you're likely to have

00:17:28.613 --> 00:17:31.016
at least simple life
forms, simple microbes,

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:34.319
maybe single-celled
things; how does life begin?

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:38.423
Does it begin with a spark,
a sputter, a smolder?

00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:40.625
Does it evolve slowly?

00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:43.595
Or is it that when you have

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:46.331
simple-celled organisms,
microorganisms,

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:48.466
when they take hold,

00:17:48.466 --> 00:17:51.503
does life begin by igniting,

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:53.705
transforming
the global landscape?"

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:57.709
We don't know which it is or
if it's someplace in between.

00:17:57.709 --> 00:18:02.247
But what I know is we creatures,
we are these creatures,

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:05.117
these portals to the universe,
we are the universe

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:07.252
become self-aware, right?

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:09.020
Our bodies are these portals

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.756
to the universe observing itself

00:18:11.756 --> 00:18:16.227
and as such, by our
self-awareness, by definition

00:18:16.227 --> 00:18:20.832
that means that by
necessity, we reach out.

00:18:20.832 --> 00:18:24.235
So when we do find a
planet that harbors life,

00:18:24.235 --> 00:18:27.038
that is a habitable environment,
that has biosignatures,

00:18:27.038 --> 00:18:31.276
and this is possible within the
next one or two generations,

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:35.480
maybe two or three, by
necessity, we are going

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.983
to want to reach out.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:44.857
And I wonder what potential
will be unlocked when we go,

00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:49.094
what potential will be
unlocked when we connect.

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.295
Thank you very much.

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:51.663
( audience applause )

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:55.267
( outro music )
