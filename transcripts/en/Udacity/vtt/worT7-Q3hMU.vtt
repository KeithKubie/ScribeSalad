Last time we finished up breaking up HTML and JavaScript into tokens.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We'd specified them by regular expressions,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which are implemented by finite state machines.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And this has always been one of my favorite parts of programming languages,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it actually sticks in my mind when I was a student

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
taking this in a more traditional classroom,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the instructor asked after talking about regular expressions in lexing

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"Is there anyone interested in doing research?"

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And this was actually my first step towards becoming a professor,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but actually, I was doing really poorly in the class at the time.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was not a very good student,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so I went to the professor's office.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
He said, "Show up if you want to do undergraduate research."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I was there, and when I came in the door, there was a second

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
where I could see in his eyes this "You? Not you."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But then he quickly sort of changed to a more positive attitude,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and I continued to work with him, and that began my career

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
pushing forth the boundaries of human knowledge

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
by studying programming languages.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And to some degree, what I want you to take away from a story like this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is it's not necessary to have mastered these concepts

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
right at the beginning or the first time you see them.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What I really want is for you to master these concepts by the end of the course,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so don't feel too bad if the original units have been giving you a bit of difficulty.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They gave me a lot of difficulty when I learned them the first time.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We finished up with regular expressions, and this time we're going to move on to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
context-free grammars, the sentences of programming languages.

00:01:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's get started.
