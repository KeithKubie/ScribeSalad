00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:06.080
Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder or
ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.610
disorder among children and teenagers. But
what’s going on inside the brain and body

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.800
of these individuals and could it actually
be an advantage?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.150
While some environmental factors such as maternal
drinking and smoking during pregnancy may

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.589
play a role in brain development, ADHD is
highly linked to your genetics. And most of

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.339
these genes are directly associated to the
brain’s reward pathways. It turns out that

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.879
those with ADHD have lower levels of dopamine
receptors - dopamine being the ‘feel good’

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.510
hormone. This means they are less sensitive
to rewards, ultimately making them feel bored

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.339
or unstimulated by what may keep another individual
entertained.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.309
We also see a major difference when we look
at fMRI scans. Normally, a brain at rest shows

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.850
activity in the default mode network, and
quickly switches over to the task-positive

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.320
network when your focus is required. But for
ADHD brains, the default mode network fails

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.640
to automatically shut down, meaning both networks
stay active, resulting in a decreased ability

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.280
to concentrate. Scientists have also observed
a thinner prefrontal cortex in ADHD patients,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.420
which is responsible for attention control,
emotional regulation, and response inhibition.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.280
As a result of these difference, Ritalin is
often prescribed for ADHD; it helps to increase

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.810
dopamine concentration in the synapse, increasing
the likelihood of it binding to the fewer

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.909
receptors . However, there is conflicting
research on its overall efficacy and concern

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.580
over unknown long term side effects. Of course,
many non-ADHD individuals have also been known

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.930
to abuse ritalin as a method to increase concentration
during work or school to study more effectively.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.520
Perhaps more controversial is the dramatic
increase in diagnosis of ADHD over the years.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.229
Whether warranted or not, a 5% increase was
documented each year from 2003-2011 in the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.829
US. Medication prescriptions have also followed
this pattern, with some reports indicating

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.359
a 35% increase in dispensed prescriptions
from 2008-2012.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:07.890
But it turns out that there may be an evolutionary
advantage to having classic ADHD symptoms.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.290
For hunter-gatherers and nomadic cultures,
being restless and hyperactive translates

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.150
directly into higher chances of successfully
bringing home food and increased vigilance

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.010
for protecting offspring. This means a greater
chance of survival and passing on your genes.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.340
Even in a current study of settled vs. nomadic
members of the Ariaal tribe in Kenya, nomads

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.610
that had a higher frequency of genes linked
to ADHD were better at getting food.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.330
On top of this, studies have routinely shown
that those with ADHD tend to be more creative

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.390
in both controlled tests and in real life,
as they often think randomly and outside the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.080
box. Finally, while structured and orderly
school environments may not be conducive to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.220
ADHD children, many adults thrive in the right
work environment. Studies show that if their

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.230
high energy is channeled into the right careers,
especially those that demand great resourcefulness

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.870
and adaptability, this once viewed handicap
can become a strong asset.

audible.com/asap. This week we wanted to recommend
the book ‘The ADHD Advantage’ by Dale

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.600
Archer, which highlights how some of the most
successful entrepreneurs, leaders and entertainers

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.260
were strengthened by their ADHD. You can get
a free 30 day trial at audible.com/asap and
