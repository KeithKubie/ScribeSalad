DR. EMERAN MAYER: I'd like
to thank Liv and the team

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.640
here to invite me.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.160
It's a great honor.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.660
It's exciting to give
this presentation.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.300
I should preface that
I'm not a nutritionist.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.570
I'm not a dietary expert.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.290
I'm really a hybrid between
a gastroenterologist

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.730
and a neuroscientist,
and have used these skill

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.230
sets during my career
to study the interaction

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.370
of the brain and the gut.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.520
Let me start with a couple
of historical things.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.320
I will walk you through--
well, let me say this.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.940
You're not going
to come out of this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.830
with a detailed
instruction of what I

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.420
want you to eat to be healthy.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.131
For that, you can buy a lot of
books that are out there right

00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:51.630
now.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.010
Most of them are really
not the whole truth.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.520
But I'm going to give you
the background for you

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.110
to look at your digestive
system and the brain-gut axis

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.430
in a totally different way.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.560
And I think that will
change when you-- whenever

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.330
you eat something, you will have
a very different perspective

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.950
on what happens in your body.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.200
I'm going to start with a
couple of historical slides.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.970
This shows my grandfather
in 1895, I think.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.360
He was one of many generations
of confectioners and chocolate

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.880
makers.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.426
And that's the business that
I was supposed to take over.

00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:40.530
It didn't turn out this way,
but I did stick with something

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.740
that appeals to the
tastes and which clearly

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.620
involves the brain and the gut.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.750
Another historical
thing that I want

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.580
to mention-- 1929, the metaphor
of the digestive system

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.390
and the illustrator in Berlin,
Fritz Kahn, published his book,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.550
"Man is Machine."

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.800
And the reason
I'm showing this--

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.330
it shows the paradigm that was
predominant for a long time--

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.000
actually, in some
people's minds,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.580
it's still the paradigm--
that our digestive system

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.540
is this industrial-age machine
that you put things in.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.910
It's a conveyor belt.
It grinds things.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.460
Puts in chemicals, breaks it
down, and then eliminates it.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.530
And that's quite different from
where we have arrived today.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.455
So what I'm trying
to convince you,

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:40.200
and what I've done
in my book, is

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.570
that the model-- as
we always take models

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.460
from the technical world
to explain our bodies--

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.400
is limited.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.570
But I think the
supercomputer model

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.130
is much closer to the way
we are understanding, now,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.570
how the brain, the gut, its
microbes, and food interact,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.530
generating, ultimately,
health and well-being.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.620
Why did we come up with this
concept of the brain gut

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.402
microbiome supercomputer?

00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:08.860
We've known for a
long time there's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.910
close interaction between the
brain, the nervous system,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.690
and the gut.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.340
We knew this long before the
microbes-- the microbiome came

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.960
on the scene.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.700
And let me show you how
far this has taken us.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.410
On the left side, we now
know there's the human brain

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.720
connectome effort.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.620
We know many of the
networks now in the brain.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.260
There's no longer regions,
but the interconnectedness

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.200
of many of these systems
regulate not just

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.720
information goes out to
our skeletal muscles,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.380
but it goes out-- through the
autonomic nervous system--

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.170
into the gut.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.336
And on the right side, you
see what's been evolving,

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:50.460
in terms of the gut connectome.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.920
Again, in my career, we
started with focusing

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.060
on individual cells.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.870
Now we know they're
all interconnected

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.810
and they generate the
output that ultimately

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.390
is then picked up
by sensory nerves

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.860
and goes back to the brain.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.815
So the brain gut axis is this
continuous circular movement

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.440
between things that
go on in our brain.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.690
Emotions-- they're
always reflected

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.600
in a change in the
network in the periphery

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.380
and the output of this network
feeds it back to the brain.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.910
So imagine you put
something in like food

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.150
into the lumen of your gut.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.330
A lot of things will
happen at multiple levels

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.780
of this circular brain
gut communication.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.210
A few years ago, some very
spectacular animal experiments

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.870
were published which
suggested that there

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.440
is an interaction
of the microbes

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.960
in our gut with the brain--
with the nervous system.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.660
And in the meantime,
we have clearly

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.690
incorporated these microbes
and their signaling molecules

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.690
fully into this circular system
between the brain and the gut.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.250
I'll show you a few
examples of this.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.397
A few illustrations.

00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:05.730
Some of you may have heard this.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.250
This has almost become,
now, common knowledge.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.930
The microbes-- there's 100
trillion of them in our gut--

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.130
if you put them together,
they will be larger

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.600
than either the
liver or the brain.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.140
We can't see them, but if
you could compact them,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.490
it would be a very large organ.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.090
And some people have referred
to this as a forgotten organ

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.740
because we have really made
all our concepts about this

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.660
without taking this
into consideration.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.490
It's amazing that
we could actually

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.100
come up with health
recommendations

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.270
by leaving more than half of
the system out of the equation.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.520
So all the stuff that you
still read in textbooks--

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.070
because this has not made
into the GI textbook--

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.875
still has to be
re-conceptualized and

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:56.375
re-edited.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.070
Why are the microbes
so important?

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.190
Not just because of the
100 trillion numbers.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.810
Much more important
is that they have

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.260
the potential of doing a lot
of things that we can't do.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.540
And if you compare the number
of genes that they have,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:23.080
which allows them to produce a
lot of things, then between 350

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.520
and 500 times more genes.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.990
So they can produce a lot
more substances and things

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.870
than any human being can do.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.900
So we're just scratching
on the surface of this--

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.827
what this means for us.

00:06:36.827 --> 00:06:38.660
The fact that they have
all these genes that

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.100
can be activated within
minutes of doing something,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.920
either at your mind level--
changing your emotion--

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.890
or at your gut level, putting
something into your gut

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.177
that they will respond
to you immediately.

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:53.010
We, as humans, are much
slower and much more

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.080
limited in doing this.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.040
There's a lot of things
that the microbes can do.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.020
The most important one
is it breaks down--

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.160
that's probably why we
developed this-- they

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.760
break down indigestible
food products--

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.400
complex carbohydrates,
which are in plants--

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.380
into smaller molecules.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.950
Some of these molecules
are being absorbed

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.090
and you can harvest
this additional energy

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.650
that otherwise would be lost.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.310
So they help us, really,
to extract more energy out

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.820
of food.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.000
The second one is-- and that's
kind of the most interesting

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.270
one-- that many of
the molecules that

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.960
arise from this breakdown
of these plant carbohydrates

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.240
are signaling molecules
that can talk not only

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.930
to the other microbes,
are also to our gut,

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.970
and through mechanisms,
back to our brains.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.550
So probably this whole
thing arose mainly

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.740
because humans and
microbes found out

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.460
that they can benefit
from each other.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.800
Humans mainly extracting
more calories out

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.200
of what they were eating.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.460
Our hunter-gatherer ancestors
were obviously dependent

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.536
on that.

00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:05.160
And there's a lot of
things-- it's just

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.610
showing a few examples here.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.290
A lot of molecules that
are quite interesting.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.560
They can affect virtually
every organ in the body.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.740
The science is mainly
focused on metabolic

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.810
processes-- the
liver, fat tissue.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.060
Our group has had
a primary interest

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:28.420
of which one of those molecules
actually can affect the brain?

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.510
Some of these
spectacular things that

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.010
have started this
interest in the brain

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.799
have been that it was
possible to transplant

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.390
behavioral traits, like
anxiety from a mouse that

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.350
was-- or the other way around.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.070
From a timid mouse
into an outgoing mouse.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.580
And this is obviously
anthropomorphic language.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.230
And just by transferring
the microbes,

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.910
the behavior of that mouse
would change to the one

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.820
to the donor mouse.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.140
And nothing else changed.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.060
Whatever those microbes--
those substances

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.910
they produced changed the
behavior of the mouse.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.910
Another one-- equally
interesting and important.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.120
By just transplanting
the microbes

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.650
from an obese and a mouse
with a veracious appetite,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.250
it changed a lean mouse
into one that not only

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.240
gained a lot of weight,
but also that had

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.810
the same abnormal eating
pattern of unrestricted eating.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.280
Unfortunately, those
spectacular findings

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.960
have not been translated
into human studies.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.240
A lot more difficult than
in these artificial mouse

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.270
experiments.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.620
But certainly, it started
a lot of enthusiasm-- a lot

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.430
of potential-- for obesity
metabolic syndrome.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.190
And there are many
studies going on

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:49.180
with fecal microbial
transplantation,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.390
antibiotic treatment,
and so forth.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.609
Why would these microbes
be able to talk to us?

00:09:56.609 --> 00:09:58.400
Most people would think,
well, the microbes

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.191
learned it from us.

00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:01.460
But in reality, over
billions of years,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.010
microbes have
lived in the oceans

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.510
and have perfected-- developed
these 500 genes-- 500-fold--

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.650
so millions of genes,
really-- to synthesize

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.630
these communication
molecules that allow

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.180
them to talk to each other.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.990
When they decided to settle
in the gastrointestinal tract

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:25.600
of the first primitive
marine animals,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.330
the two found out that this was
a very beneficial relationship.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.338
And that stayed for
the rest of evolution.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.710
This symbiosis stayed there
for the rest of the time.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.450
And the
neurotransmitters that we

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.920
have now in our gut-- in
our enteric nervous system

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.000
and in our brain--
really originated

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.170
from this genetic
information that the microbes

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.680
developed over a long time.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.540
So we're intricately--
over millions

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.360
of years-- connected
to that world

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.372
of microbial communication.

00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:00.080
And probably have a
lot to learn from it.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.680
And very important to
say that I think we're

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.290
just really at
the very beginning

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.090
of understanding the
implications for our health

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.600
and for disease.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.640
This just illustrates
the transition

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.590
of these very primitive
nervous systems

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.870
from the first marine
animals to our first gut,

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.600
which is really the gut in
our-- the brain in our gut.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.870
Ultimately, into
our nervous system.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.660
All this originates in this
vast experience and information

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.670
that the microbes
developed while they

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:38.010
were living without any
mammals or any humans around.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:43.200
Let me say one thing about gut
reactions and gut feelings.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.352
Everybody uses this term.

00:11:44.352 --> 00:11:46.560
When I wrote this book, I
realized-- paying attention

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.705
to it-- there's not a
day goes by in the press

00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:50.080
that people would
not talk about,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.390
they made a decision with their
gut or they had a gut reaction.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.179
It's present in every language.

00:11:58.179 --> 00:12:00.637
So something very fundamental
that people have experienced.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.100
Let me just give
you two examples.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.630
The one is the top
down-- the gut reactions.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.920
How the gut reacts when you are
in an emotional state or when

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.185
you're stressed.

00:12:14.185 --> 00:12:15.935
If you don't have one
of those disorders--

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.670
these stress sensitive
disorders where

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.800
you get stomach pains when
you're stressed or anxious.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.810
It happens all the time.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.470
Your emotions are
reflected a mirror image

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.670
in your gut function.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.420
The secretion, the
contractions, the blood flow,

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.790
and now, also the microbes.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.170
We know that these signals
that go down from the brain,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.920
specific for every
emotion and stress,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.280
will directly talk
through this shared

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.910
language to your microbes
and will change what

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.160
they do to the food you eat.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.950
So when you eat a meal
when you're angry, anxious,

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.730
or stressed, you will
process this food

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.840
very differently than if
you're relaxed, happy,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.190
in a pleasant social context.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.460
This is illustrated here.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.750
Just like everybody
can tell if you're

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.130
angry or anxious by
looking at your face--

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.450
your facial muscles-- the gut
does exactly the same thing.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.880
You may not feel it, but
it has a big impact on how

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.650
your gut processes the food.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.741
The other way around is equally
intriguing, possibly more

00:13:21.741 --> 00:13:22.240
intriguing.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.010
And I've used in the
book this analogy

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.090
to the Google search engines.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.660
There's constantly a huge
amount of information flow

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.420
from the gut, including all
the chatter of your microbes,

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.700
into centers of the brain.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.760
And all these signals
are being stored.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.690
You may not feel them.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.390
You may not have the cramps.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.430
But all these-- if you're in
a situation that is upsetting,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.940
is threatening, you will store
this vast amount of information

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.670
at your brain
level and later, be

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.680
able to recall it by
accessing this vast database.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:04.140
It's just like the
Google search engine.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.035
Last year, I was at this
art exhibition in Venice,

00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:14.380
the Biennale, and I saw
this interesting screen

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.360
where hundreds of these
little videos were playing,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.624
and each person was
telling an emotional story

00:14:21.624 --> 00:14:22.290
from their life.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.250
And I thought, this
is the perfect analogy

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.710
to what happens in our brain.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.200
We have billions of
these emotional moments

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.520
with their gut
sensations stored there.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.140
And when we make a
gut-based decision,

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.960
our brain can access
them within milliseconds

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.680
without going through a
logical, linear attempt

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.500
to come up with a conclusion
or with a decision.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.700
I can't prove this, but I think
it's a very tempting model,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:56.310
or analogy, to understand that.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.710
Food microbes and the brain.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.800
As I mentioned
before, food interacts

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.850
with the microbes
with many sensors

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.100
in the gut and this information
makes it to the brain.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.600
And then the brain responds
in a circular fashion

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.400
on the right side to influence
contractions and bowel

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.800
movements.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.419
One signaling system is
particularly intriguing.

00:15:22.419 --> 00:15:24.960
If anybody's in here who takes--
it's probably not the case--

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.630
but if anybody took an
antidepressant-- serotonin

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.820
reuptake inhibitor--
you would think

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.780
that this medication
acts on your brain,

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.580
on the serotonin system.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.610
But we know now that only about
3% of your entire serotonin

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.160
is in the brain.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.170
All the rest is in
the gut, in cells that

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.780
are influenced by the microbes.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.080
The microbes actually
can influence

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.350
the synthesis of the substance.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.630
And these cells, then, can
feed it back to the brain

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.420
into centers that deal with your
regulation of emotion, sleep,

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.240
appetite, and well-being.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.930
So you have you on your own
Prozac factory in your gut

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.304
and the microbes play
a big role in this.

00:16:08.304 --> 00:16:09.470
We're just at the beginning.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.260
Psychiatrists have
refused to really look

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.790
at this for a long time.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.636
Most of them still are not
aware of that collection.

00:16:15.636 --> 00:16:17.590
But it, obviously,
opens up a lot

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.150
of intriguing
possibilities, not just

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.620
for pharmacological treatment
targeted at this gut system,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.010
but also in terms of how
food and different food

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.470
components-- by
changing your microbes--

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.280
can influence that and generate
well-being and affect all

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.700
these other vital functions.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.910
Another system of
great importance

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.990
are these inflammatory cells.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.100
The circled type of cell
in the lining of the wall

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.340
are these dendritic cells.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.860
They are immune cells and they
have these little tentacles

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.820
that stick out into the lumen
of the gut and their receptors.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.910
The microbes talk
to those, as well.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.070
So there's an
ongoing dialogue to

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.330
your gut-based immune system.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.680
And immune cells, then,
signal this back up,

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.290
virtually of your organ,
particularly interesting,

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.060
to the brain.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.000
Why would this be
important for diet?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.940
The inflammation doesn't
occur because you

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.240
have a gastroenteritis, but
it's modulated to a large degree

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.630
by the food that you eat.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.850
We know that food with a
high animal fat content

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:31.810
and with a high degree of
unsaturated fatty acids

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:37.630
will activate your microbes
to release a substance called

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.210
LPS-- lipopolysaccharide--
which increases

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.070
the leakiness of your
gut and then gets

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.930
into these immune cells and
triggers this whole cascade

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.210
of a systemic low-grade
immune activation,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.230
including effects on the
central nervous system.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:00.290
It's now believed that it's
not only your adipose tissue

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.830
that produces inflammation
through this mechanism.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.140
Because the signals go to
the fat cells, as well.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.830
But it's also the brain
and the chronic influence

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.740
of that low-grade
inflammation on the brain

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:20.000
may play a major role in
neurodegenerative diseases

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.700
such as Parkinson's disease
and Alzheimer's disease.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.250
So that's a very intriguing
aspect that links--

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.670
and there's already now
studies, just recently published

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.930
from UCLA.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.800
For example, that
a particular diet,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.410
together with other
lifestyle factors,

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.570
can slow the development
of Alzheimer's

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.930
in high-risk patients.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.164
So probably, that mechanism
is at the bottom of that.

00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:43.830
The question that's
always being asked--

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.760
is there an optimal diet?

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:52.810
And this is not something that
people have asked just now,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.460
in the last 10 or 20 years.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.770
But this has been at
the center of attention

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.430
for many ancient
healing traditions.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.410
The modern answer
to this question,

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.940
is there an optimal diet,
as you can see here.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.720
You get these very
contradictory answers.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.560
A clean gut versus
eating dirt, eating

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.230
fat to get thin versus
eating complex carbohydrates.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.710
And then, "The Grain Brain,"
which basically recommended

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:27.890
all grains, which contain many
of those-- the whole grains--

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.740
many of these
complex carbohydrates

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.160
that microbes is food
for the microbes--

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.690
that this would cause all
kinds of diseases, including

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.560
brain diseases.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.860
I had the pleasure
and the privilege

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.690
to participate some
30 years ago in a film

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.340
expedition to the
Yanomami Indians

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.166
in Venezuela on
the Orinoco River.

00:19:52.166 --> 00:19:54.040
And I never thought that
that would come back

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:59.220
to me 35 years later, in
terms of optimal diet--

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.740
the question of optimal diet.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.360
We lived with these people for
four weeks, ate the same things

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.250
that they ate.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.570
We observed that they have
a very high, about 80%,

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.290
complex carbohydrate diet.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.220
Very diverse.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.020
They collect from the jungle.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.170
Small amount of animal products.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.810
And that they had several
hundred herbal medicines

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.600
that they used to
stimulate their-- used

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.580
for various diseases.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.210
These are some of the few
remnants of hunter-gatherers

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:33.850
in the world.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:40.190
Another entity are the
[? Hasta ?] in Africa.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.490
Totally different environment,
but very similar dietary

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.160
habits.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.870
The same kind of hunter
gatherer diet with small amounts

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:53.550
of meat, virtually no animal
fat, and large amounts

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:57.700
of complex carbohydrates.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.830
Now, the reason I
got led back to this

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:07.490
was when a paper was
published by Gloria Dominguez

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.840
from NYU, where they
looked at the gut

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.250
microbes of those
Indians that lived very

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.760
close to the Yanomamis--
not identical,

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.819
but-- and the main
thing was they

00:21:20.819 --> 00:21:22.360
and the [? Hasta ?]
have the greatest

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.250
diversity and abundance of
gut microbes of any known

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.850
human being in the world.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.720
Several fold higher than
individuals in North America.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.940
And that goes all the way
down to newborn infants

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.130
that already have, in this
country, the same depletion

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.600
of the microbial diversity.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.870
This is obviously-- now
that we think that diversity

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.450
is one of the main
determinants for gut health,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.820
and probably also
health, in general.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.340
This obviously, is
a big warning sign.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.410
What are we doing in
westernized societies?

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.720
What are we doing to
our diet, primarily,

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.160
in order to result
in this decimation

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.290
of our inner microbial world?

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:17.400
Another jump, not
expected-- but I

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.570
have found in my
travels and reading,

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:26.230
that there are diets--
not the extreme of vegan

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:32.250
or the diets free of
any natural grains--

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.640
but there are diets out
there that are actually not

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.540
that dissimilar in the
composition overall

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:43.510
of large amounts of very
complex carbohydrates

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:50.950
from plant-based food and small
amounts of animal products.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:56.790
And both, mainly in terms
of chicken and fish,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.390
which is the Mediterranean diet.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.360
If you look at the field of
the pyramid based on that,

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.310
it's interesting.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.180
To summarize what I
said, the biggest portion

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.630
are these plant-derived foods.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.570
At the bottom, it's
important-- when

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.110
we talk about the mind brain
gut axis-- it's not just

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.730
what goes on or what you put
in, but also the state of mind

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.230
you are in.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.420
So many investigators that
study the extensive health

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.480
benefits of this diet
not just on brain health,

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.680
which I was talking about--
the recent Alzheimer

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.530
study at UCLA-- but also
in metabolic health.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.520
It was the social interactions
that these investigators

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.780
commented on that were a
major determinant in how

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.950
successful this diet was
in enhancing well-being.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.960
Is this Mediterranean diet
beneficial for our gut

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.500
microbes?

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.564
Here are some reasons.

00:23:49.564 --> 00:23:51.480
As I told you earlier,
one of the main reasons

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.060
we develop the microbes,
or this cohabitation,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.770
is because the microbes break
down plant-based carbohydrates

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.130
and generate these
signaling molecules

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.430
to the rest of the body.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.200
They also have
anti-inflammatory effects

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.250
against this low-grade
immune activation.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.060
And then, clearly,
the Mediterranean diet

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.100
has something that is
not directly related

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.280
to the microbes-- this
high level of antioxidants

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.680
from olive oil and red
wine and nuts and berries.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.075
Probiotics.

00:24:26.075 --> 00:24:27.450
We are going to
have the pleasure

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.370
to taste some fermented food.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.230
clearly that's been another
unique feature of the North

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.820
American diet that has,
until recently, completely

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:43.110
eliminated fermented
foods from the staples.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:49.804
And there's been a lot of
hype now from animal studies.

00:24:49.804 --> 00:24:51.970
Probably one the biggest
one is this psychobiotics--

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.110
that you may be able
to treat depression

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:59.130
and anxiety with the
intake of daily probiotics.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.520
I can assure you that it's
almost certainly not the case.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.730
There's a lot of work going on
in developing novel probiotics.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.830
Some of them are engineered
to produce something

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.090
like an antidepressant.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.280
Others are combinations
of human microbes

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.610
that produce short
chain fatty acids, which

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.594
are anti-inflammatory.

00:25:20.594 --> 00:25:21.760
We're just at the beginning.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.550
The ones that you currently can
buy-- and there are hundreds--

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.480
will not do that.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.180
They will not act as
an antidepressant.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.760
However, there's
pretty good evidence

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.950
that regular intake of
natural fermented food

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.970
contains different
types of lactobacilli

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.850
and bifidobacteria,
that it will benefit

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.950
the diversity of
your gut microbiome

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.680
and will make it,
because of that,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:56.100
more resilient to perturbations
through infections or stress.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:03.700
But just to summarize this now,
what I have tried to do here

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.630
is to get across a very
different way of thinking

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.410
about how our mind, environment,
the brain, and the gut,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:14.490
and its internal environment
interact with each other.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.520
It's clearly no longer
possible to have

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.360
these simple linear models.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.880
I take one pill and that
gives me optimal health.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.530
I think, really,
any intervention

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:29.320
has to involve strategies that
aim at the brain, at the mind,

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.420
and our internal ecosystem
to enhance and maintain

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.770
the diversity.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.940
And we can do this through a
combination of relatively easy

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.750
lifestyle changes
that involve things

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.290
like mindfulness-based stress
reduction, healthy eating,

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:51.480
conscious eating, and sticking
to some fairly simple dietary

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.850
recommendations.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.880
Hopefully, I gave
you some rationale

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.772
of why they might be beneficial.

00:26:57.772 --> 00:26:58.855
Thanks for your attention.

00:26:58.855 --> 00:26:59.825
LIV WU: Thank you.

00:26:59.825 --> 00:27:03.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.940
Thank you so much.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.510
Dr. Mayer, you are the director
of the Oppenheimer Center

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.179
for Neurobiology--
Neuroscience--

00:27:11.179 --> 00:27:12.595
DR. EMERAN MAYER:
The Neurobiology

00:27:12.595 --> 00:27:13.636
of Stress and Resilience.

00:27:13.636 --> 00:27:15.260
LIV WU: Oh, stress
and resilience.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.650
I want to go right there.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:22.180
What does resilience look like?

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.390
Let's just assume most of us
in this room are stressed,

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.690
let's say.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.540
AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.595
LIV WU: No.

00:27:31.595 --> 00:27:32.800
What does it look like?

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.510
If we are resilient, how are
we eating, how are we thinking,

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.466
how are we behaving?

00:27:40.466 --> 00:27:41.840
DR. EMERAN MAYER:
Certainly, most

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.450
of the research over the years
has focused on the stress part

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.250
and the negative part
and the damage it can do.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.670
It's gradually changing
in the scientific world.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.770
Still very difficult
to get grants

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:57.500
on the positive
aspects-- resilience

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.470
and this whole ecological
perspective on health.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:05.100
How do we-- starting
with something as focused

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.800
as the gut microbiome, how do
we optimize the resilience?

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.840
And the current concepts are
based on ecological theory.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.600
The more diverse and the more
abundant the organisms are,

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:22.900
the more is it able-- the
system-- to bounce back

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.400
from a perturbation like an
infection or a major stressor

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.680
and even not being affected
to the same degree.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.432
Keep in mind that the stress
I mention will always--

00:28:36.432 --> 00:28:38.140
you may not notice
it, but it will always

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.430
affect your
gastrointestinal activities

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.870
and your microbial world inside.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:49.720
About 10%-- I'm not sure--
Googlers are a very special

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.610
selection of people, so these
statistics may not apply.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.850
But in the general population,
about 10% to 15% of people

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.870
have digestive issues that
are typically stress-related.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:05.440
We have to assume
that their resilience

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.260
to those perturbations
is decreased.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.940
And what we recommend-- when
I see patients like that

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.140
have the symptoms--
to really target

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.410
the brain, the mind part, and
dietary part of the gut part.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.080
What can people do in here?

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.330
There are simple techniques.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.070
One is clearly the healthy diet.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.370
The anti-inflammatory
diet that prevents

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.962
these-- what I mentioned.

00:29:35.962 --> 00:29:38.420
The worst thing that you could
do is to eat a high-fat diet

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.100
and be stressed.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.040
It makes you feel better
temporarily-- the concept

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.320
of comfort food.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.540
But in the long
term, it enhances

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.050
this inflammatory
reaction and has

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.300
detrimental effects
on your brain

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.530
health and general health.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.760
So the dietary awareness.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.330
And the second thing is-- I
would never leave the mind out

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.630
of this.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.992
Mindfulness-based stress
reduction, abdominal breathing

00:30:05.992 --> 00:30:07.700
are very simple
techniques that everybody

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.830
can use to enhance that
state of resilience.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.340
LIV WU: We actually teach
mindful cooking and mindful

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.370
eating in this kitchen.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.900
I hope all of you
will look into that.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.330
When we're doing all-nighters
and putting out a product,

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:34.942
pizza and French fries
is not the thing to have.

00:30:34.942 --> 00:30:36.400
DR. EMERAN MAYER:
It feels the best

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.940
because fat will--
this has been shown,

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.520
that particularly animal fat
will temporarily down regulate

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.750
your system in the brain.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.150
But in the long term, it will
have the opposite effect.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:55.000
It will lead to these long
term, low-grade changes

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.870
that will make you more likely
to be chronically stressed

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.790
and develop all kinds of things,
from the metabolic syndrome,

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.470
which is also a low-grade
inflammatory condition to heart

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.040
conditions.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:15.440
So the challenging
thing is to be aware

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.330
that these comfort
foods are the worst

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.930
thing that you can do in
order to maintain or enhance

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:22.890
your resilience.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.410
You're drawn towards them.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.760
That's why companies-- you see
it on TV and in the evening.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.570
It's all high-fat food.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.790
But I think it's very
important, this concept

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.790
of this low-grade inflammation.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.270
You don't want to have your
body in that state all the time,

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.850
day and night.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.720
So I think if you only
take that message home--

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.310
I'm sure nobody has these
unhealthy eating habits here--

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.810
but a lot of people do.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.060
And it's tempting.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.740
Work late and let's get a pizza.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.450
LIV WU: So what does
low-grade infection feel like?

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.660
Am I not sleeping well?

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:07.750
Am I likely to bite off the
head of somebody I work with?

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.160
What does it look like?

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.900
DR. EMERAN MAYER: It's low-grade
inflammation, not infection.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.780
There's no organism involved,
other than the microbes

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.650
that produce these substances.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.400
It's something that you
don't feel, unfortunately.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.210
At some point, you may
feel exhausted, fatigued.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.140
So chronic fatigue
syndrome would be

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.330
the end stage of that process.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.550
But a lot of people
lose their vitality

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:39.720
and just don't feel right when
they wake up in the morning.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.110
And keep in mind, it
starts a chain reaction.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.300
Because exercise--
there's several factors

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.870
that influence that
low-grade immune activation.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.060
One is you diet,
so very important.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:55.970
Another one is risk.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.110
Another one is physical
aerobic exercise,

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.400
which down regulates it.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.870
And sound and
healthy sleep is also

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.640
a major factor to downregulate
this inflammatory state.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.360
So I think what's
happening is we're slowly

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:16.330
developing a very comprehensive
model of health and well-being.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.630
This system's view, with
the low-grade activation

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.220
of the immune system
being the common currency

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.240
for many of these influences.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.970
If you only do one,
it may not harm you.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.750
If you do more than
one, it will gradually

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.700
have this accumulating effect.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.710
A lot of people-- if
you go out in the street

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:39.420
and see obese people-- they
don't feel it right away.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.185
And some people
may be very healthy

00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:43.510
even though they
have a high BMI.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.430
But if several of these
factors come together,

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:50.380
then you clearly play
with your health.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.130
LIV WU: Is the brain
the last thing to go?

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:56.560
I mean, is the fogginess or
I'm not thinking as straight

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.560
as I used to-- is
that an indicator?

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.405
And is that more a
final stage indicator?

00:34:02.405 --> 00:34:03.780
DR. EMERAN MAYER:
It's not really

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.280
the-- I would say Alzheimer's
disease is a final stage.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.409
But the brain fog--
a lot of people

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.330
have this and the loss
of vitality and sense

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.520
of exhaustion.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.080
It's definitely
not the end stage.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.040
It can come fairly early.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.630
It can come before
somebody starts overeating

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:25.870
or have other health issues.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.210
And it probably depends on
the genetic vulnerability.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:32.820
Some people are more vulnerable
to one organ over the other.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.900
If you have a genetic
predisposition for Alzheimer's

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.550
disease and a lot of
relatives with it,

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.940
then I'll be particularly
worried about the brain being

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:47.510
affected by these
factors than if you

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.760
don't have these risk factors.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.719
Same-- family history
for heart disease,

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:55.159
family history for obesity.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.850
So the human genes
set the stage of where

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.860
the damage occurs first.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.450
Some people get the full
hit that all organ systems

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:03.670
are affected.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.540
In others, it's selective.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.734
And in others, they're so
resilient that they will not--

00:35:09.734 --> 00:35:12.200
there's a lot of people with
very unhealthy lifestyles

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.510
and being stressed and will
not get the full damage

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:20.690
that you would expect in
a situation like that.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:25.855
LIV WU: I'm not sure I-- you're
asking how the genetic material

00:35:25.855 --> 00:35:30.710
and what you feed your gut
interact with each other?

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.050
AUDIENCE: Number one, what's
the significance of that?

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.110
DR. EMERAN MAYER: Yeah.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.450
So I can answer this, too.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.116
LIV WU: What's the
significance of that?

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.610
DR. EMERAN MAYER: First of all,
the options that the microbiome

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.490
has to adapt to
new situations, be

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:47.380
it signals coming from the brain
or coming through nutrition

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:51.410
or they have been able to
adapt to eating seaweed.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:55.570
Most people in the world
don't have microbial capacity

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.760
to break down the
carbohydrate of seaweed.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.570
But in Japan, they
have developed it

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:06.520
through eating seaweed
on a regular basis.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.700
There are other examples.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.910
What microbes also do-- they
break down many of our drugs,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.840
so-called xenobiotics.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.616
These are substances that have
never occurred in evolution.

00:36:18.616 --> 00:36:23.070
And the microbes, through this
combinatorial possibility,

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:28.060
can develop strategies to break
them down and inactivate them.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.240
They also, through
these-- probably

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.250
people are familiar with
this concept of epigenetics.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.779
They can influence
our own cells--

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:40.070
the immune system-- during
development, the first three

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.460
years of life.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.060
There's a lot of interactions
and clearly the microbes

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.620
have much more to
say because they

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.100
have a lot more capacities
to talk to our immune system

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.180
and to our nervous system.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:58.120
I didn't get to this in
my talk, but I believe

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.000
and quite a few
investigators believe

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.850
that the biggest influence
of these microbes

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.740
is early in life-- prenatally
and the first three

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.950
years of life, where
many of these systems

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.230
are being established
and set up.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:15.060
Once they're programmed, both
the brain and at the gut level,

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.370
they remain fairly constant.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.380
They vary in a
certain bandwidth,

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.740
but you don't change
them fundamentally.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.860
So I think the main interests--
including the probiotics

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.560
and nutrition-- it should really
focus on these first three

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.580
or four years of life,
starting during pregnancy.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.650
I think that's most
data suggest that.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:36.910
LIV WU: Yes.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.290
AUDIENCE: On that vein, my
first introduction to this topic

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.710
was in New York.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:44.000
The Museum of Natural
History had a big exhibit

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.400
on the microbiome.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:50.590
And they mentioned the
importance of, for example,

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:54.550
vaginal birth and breastfeeding
on introducing that microbiome

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.970
to an infant.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:38:01.490
I'm wondering what is
your thoughts on how--

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:07.010
as C-sections increase in our
population and, let's say,

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.510
bottle feeding increases
in our population--

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:13.190
how can we introduce these
really important microbiomes

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.862
to our infants and our children?

00:38:14.862 --> 00:38:15.820
DR. EMERAN MAYER: Yeah.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.611
This would be a the
topic for a whole talk,

00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:21.130
really, because it
starts during pregnancy.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.130
There's the stress
of the mother.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.110
Fix the mother's
microbes, including

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.160
the microbes that live in the
vaginal canal of the mother.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.405
The baby is born.

00:38:30.405 --> 00:38:31.530
It goes through this canal.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.069
It's the first
contact with microbes.

00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:35.610
And it's been shown
in animal studies

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.632
that a stressed
mom will transmit

00:38:38.632 --> 00:38:40.340
a different set of
microbes to the infant

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.540
and these mice have
different brain development.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.280
So it starts-- the
stress-- the nutrition

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.660
of the mother-- the metabolites
get towards the infant.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.790
Breast milk is a huge component.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.450
There is the so-called human
milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs,

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:03.400
that are contained in breast
milk, which are specifically

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.370
targeted at feeding
the microbes.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:09.140
We cannot-- humans cannot absorb
those or do anything with them.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:14.450
So breast milk produces those
to target the evolving gut

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:16.770
microbiome of the infant.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:21.500
If that's altered, the
whole program will be off.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.270
And I've talked to
experts in this field.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:27.800
They say that-- but it's
not just the breast milk.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.040
The breast milk, for example,
of these Yanomami Indians

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.350
and moms in North America
is fundamentally different.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.290
Because the nutrition of the
mother really affects that.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:43.700
So this whole-- what we
see also with the diversity

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.980
of the microbiome
starts, really,

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.571
with the diet of the
mother that affects

00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:51.570
the breast milk and that
affects this human milk

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.300
oligosaccharides.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.470
So it's a major conflict.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.140
I personally think
in 10 years from now,

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.740
the microbiome field and
the probability field

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.980
will mainly focus
on this period.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.630
AUDIENCE: Is there
anything that can

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.627
be introduced for children who
aren't breastfeeding that can--

00:40:11.627 --> 00:40:14.210
DR. EMERAN MAYER: Well, I think
the only thing that you can do

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.010
is the same thing
that you would do

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:23.390
as an adult-- non-pregnant
adult. To eat a healthy diet

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:27.690
and learn to deal
with stress better.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:32.520
I often see it with our
postdocs who get pregnant.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:37.580
And then they work on a grant
to one week before delivery

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.830
and come back a week later.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.000
This is really insane.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.710
When you think about it,
the potential consequences

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.750
of that-- now that we know
many of these connections--

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.080
is definitely not worth it.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.810
AUDIENCE: Do you
vegetarian or vegan diets

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.370
reduce the diversity
of the microbes

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.870
in our stomach in
a negative way?

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.080
DR. EMERAN MAYER: No.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.690
No.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:04.040
As I said a few times, the
main food for the microbes

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.920
and why they evolved is to use
these complex plant-derived

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.760
carbohydrates-- these complex
molecules-- that we, as humans,

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.330
can't absorb.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.090
Many mammals can't
do that either.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.770
I think humans have gotten
better since they developed--

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.700
discovered the fire to
be able to cook things,

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.420
so they easily break down.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.920
But even cooked food will still
have a very high percentage

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.340
of those substances.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.430
So if you want to do something
to feed your microbiome,

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.970
a vegetarian diet-- can't really
compare vegan and vegetarian

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:38.970
in that respect.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:42.980
But the main thing is
this high percentage

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.900
of these plant-derived foods.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.440
I think that is
the key, also, when

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.830
I made this huge jump
from the Yanomami

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.900
to the Mediterranean diet.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.477
It's the common principle
that underlies them.

00:41:56.477 --> 00:41:59.060
AUDIENCE: Since I was a little
girl, and I'm sure a lot of you

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.360
have also heard the same,
we've heard this phrase,

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.376
you are what you eat.

00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:04.750
But as I've gotten
older and I've

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.300
seen family members in the
hospital or in hospice,

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.670
or I've talked to friends
who've gone to medical school,

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:13.202
nutrition and food isn't
discussed or it's skimmed over.

00:42:13.202 --> 00:42:15.326
And they look at me like
I'm crazy when I'm talking

00:42:15.326 --> 00:42:17.360
to them about probiotics.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.996
Why do you think there
is such a big disconnect?

00:42:19.996 --> 00:42:22.440
Why are my grandparents
being fed horrible food

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.356
when they're trying to
recover from illnesses?

00:42:24.356 --> 00:42:28.180
And why am I getting ice
cream in the hospital?

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.180
DR. EMERAN MAYER: This
is an excellent question.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.270
And I've been trained as a
gastroenterologist at UCLA

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.290
and have never been
exposed to-- we deal

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:38.740
with gastrointestinal
disorders--

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.230
never been exposed
to a single minute

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:47.070
to anything that had
to do with nutrition.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:51.840
And so it's the
expo-- I'm not sure

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.780
why we have developed--
there's two things in medicine.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.110
One is medicine, basically,
has not paid attention

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.425
to the brain and the mind.

00:43:00.425 --> 00:43:02.460
This whole
mindfulness revolution

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.164
is really taking traditional
medicine by surprise

00:43:06.164 --> 00:43:07.830
because they never
paid attention to it.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.330
And nutrition is
the other aspect.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:16.010
It's still, today-- I would
say in most training programs

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.600
for health professionals, it's
not a mandatory component.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.940
The good news is-- I was
mentioning this earlier--

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.750
some of the UC campuses have
really started these campaigns.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:35.020
Some of what you do here in this
kitchen-- this healthy campus

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.800
initiative with a healthy food
component and a healthy mind

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.350
component-- it's extremely
popular among students.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:46.540
I think there's a phenomenal
involvement in both UCSF

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.070
and UCLA.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.340
The goal is to become
the healthiest campuses

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.030
in the world.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.620
That's the mission statement.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.120
That's almost
starting a revolution,

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.790
but it's outside of medicine.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:58.690
It's amazing.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:01.340
It comes-- even though
all these data come now

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:06.320
from medical science,
the practice in medicine

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.650
has not changed, really.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.270
AUDIENCE: Can you say
anything about glyphosates

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.682
and the impact on the gut
and implications of that?

00:44:14.682 --> 00:44:15.640
DR. EMERAN MAYER: Yeah.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.306
The glyphosates?

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.880
This is this substance
in the Roundup, which

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.810
is a genetically modified food.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.680
Mainly, it's modified
in order that you

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.530
can kill off everything
else but not the crop

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.010
that you want to have.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:39.480
And it's fascinating
when you read over

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.370
how this was approved.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.840
It was approved on the lack
of effects on human cells

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:51.120
in a test in a Petri dish
on a short term basis.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.350
So this was done long, long
before the whole microbiome

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:57.051
science came onboard.

00:44:57.051 --> 00:44:58.550
And it has not
really been repeated.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.430
So these early
experiments suggested

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:05.400
that humans do not metabolize
that substance, so do not

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.586
get the toxic effects--
the cells, at least.

00:45:09.586 --> 00:45:10.960
But now we know
that the microbes

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.610
can break it down
into-- can activate it

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:17.070
into a substance that
is really harmful to us.

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.320
So not only is it bad
for some of the microbes,

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.410
but also for our own gut health.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.330
And it's been interesting to me
that this whole GMO debate has

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.650
always been about the potential
harm of the genes, which

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.580
I'm not so sure
if they are really

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.190
that dangerous to humans.

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:35.510
To the environment,
they are, probably.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:38.630
But the main danger, I, think
comes from these chemicals that

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.680
are being given at
higher and higher doses

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.810
because there's
resistance developing.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:47.250
And without ever having studied
the impact on the microbiome,

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.820
now, with all the
things we know.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.143
So it's really
amazing that people

00:45:51.143 --> 00:46:00.280
will not-- I had a venture
capitalist coming down once who

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.660
asked me this question
and said, would you

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.050
be willing to do a
study to look at that?

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.520
And what would this cost?

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.260
And so we talked this
through and you probably

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.810
have tremendous
resistance at every level

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:15.050
to do a study like this.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.910
At this multibillion
dollar business,

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.230
like the tobacco industry.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.840
I think the reason there
is no research is probably

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.620
for that reason.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.133
People are afraid
to get into this.

00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:24.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.927
What are your
thoughts on fasting?

00:46:26.927 --> 00:46:29.010
DR. EMERAN MAYER: Fasting
is an interesting thing.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.710
First of all, there's
a diurnal rhythm

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:39.170
to what microbes do, both their
numbers and what they produce.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:43.220
So when they sleep and no
food gets into your intestine,

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.340
it's a completely different
set up than when you are awake.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.280
So compromised sleep, which
means compromised fasting,

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.610
because many people get
up and eat something--

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:56.860
usually fatty and sweet things.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.360
The other thing has not
really been studied so well.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.770
I've always had this philosophy
if something has been around

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:06.020
for a long period of time, like
the fasting tradition and all

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:10.850
the fasting practice and all
the major healing traditions,

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:14.790
there must be something to it.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:18.500
I would imagine it's a
reduction-- it's clearly--

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:23.180
one is the reduction of the
numbers, which is temporary.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:29.064
The other one is that
the microbes-- there's

00:47:29.064 --> 00:47:30.980
another source of food
for the microbes, which

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.570
is the mucus layer of the gut.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.590
So when you don't feed them,
they go after the mucus layer

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:39.490
and use that as a substitute.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.260
And so it will definitely affect
that layer that separates us

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.880
from the lumen from the inside.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.860
That mucus layer is a big
part of the leaky gut concept.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.380
It's not just holes in the
wall, but it's this mucus layer.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:03.150
If this strengthens the
barrier function of the gut,

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:05.400
I would say, most likely,
it has a health benefit.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.110
I would not dismiss that.

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.779
Not enough research on
that topic, unfortunately.

00:48:10.779 --> 00:48:11.570
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:15.730
Is their proof that eating
probiotic food increase

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:19.704
the amount of the bacteria
in digestive system?

00:48:19.704 --> 00:48:20.620
DR. EMERAN MAYER: Yes.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.210
There's a couple things to it.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:25.800
The first person who
propagated probiotic yogurt

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:30.810
was the scientist Mechnikov,
who also got a Nobel

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.580
Prize more than 100 years ago.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.190
But he realized that he
had to eat it continuously

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.410
in order to have the benefits.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:44.560
And that's one limitation if you
are the occasional yogurt eater

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.860
or if you go and buy your pills
when you don't feel right.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.880
If you change your
dietary habit chronically,

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.620
or constantly, I think
that's really required

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.720
to get the health benefit.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:02.520
I don't think by going on
a two-week course of taking

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:07.411
your probiotic pills will really
have any significant effect.

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:08.910
We have done a study
where we looked

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:12.820
at the changes in the
microbial architecture

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:18.340
with a four-week intake of
a probiotic-enriched yogurt.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:22.290
And there was no change in the
architecture, in the players.

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:26.680
But the signaling molecules
that they produced changed.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.450
But only as long as you took it.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:31.240
The minute you--
it would stop it.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.950
I think-- I mentioned
this earlier.

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:36.780
Probiotics, really, in the
first three years of life

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.590
and during pregnancy probably
have a very big impact.

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:44.770
The same impact-- and this
is just my personal opinion.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.240
There's no science on it.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:53.190
If you are on a diet that's
enriched in fermented foods,

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.374
you will have a
sustained benefit.

00:49:55.374 --> 00:49:56.790
But you have to
stay on that diet.

00:49:56.790 --> 00:50:00.210
It's not like let's go
once a week in a restaurant

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.985
and eat a kimchi or
a sauerkraut dish.

00:50:03.985 --> 00:50:07.120
It has to become-- like
in the Korean culture,

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.180
it's really integrated.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.770
And that's also
been interesting.

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.120
When I was working on
the book, to realize

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.080
how important that that is.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.410
I think there was a time
during the war where

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:20.910
Korean soldiers
would refuse to fight

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:22.900
because there was
a threat that they

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.470
wouldn't have their kimchi.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:30.770
That shows how dependent
they became on this, possibly

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:32.640
through some changes
within their brain

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.890
or they just feel different.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.850
But the key thing is
the regular intake.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:43.169
It cannot be the occasional
breakfasts-- yogurt and--

00:50:43.169 --> 00:50:44.210
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:48.780
So what can we-- rather
than taking probiotics,

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.725
what can we eat--
complex carbohydrates,

00:50:51.725 --> 00:50:53.690
it sounded like--
what can we eat

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:58.420
to nurture our gut bacteria?

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.530
You've talked several
times about a healthy diet.

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.005
You've mentioned the
Mediterranean diet.

00:51:02.005 --> 00:51:03.254
Can you say a little bit more?

00:51:03.254 --> 00:51:05.750
What can we do to
nurture our gut biome?

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:10.440
DR. EMERAN MAYER: If you take--
there's a lot of these-- a lot

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.521
of diets, nowadays,
recommend what you can't eat.

00:51:13.521 --> 00:51:14.270
I'm always amazed.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.810
You buy something,
a drink and it

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:20.570
has five-- no gluten,
no sugar, no-- I

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.070
think you really have to think
much more about the other way

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:27.310
around-- what should we eat?

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:28.410
Plants, in general.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:31.020
A high variety-- one
is the high variety

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.470
because each plant has
a different composition

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.735
of these molecules.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.060
A larger amount, which is not
just good for the microbes,

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:46.550
but it also has a lower caloric
density and glycemic index,

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:50.080
so your insulin won't go up.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.460
And all the
plant-based oils, which

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:58.870
are generally low in these
saturated fatty acids.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:02.560
On top, probably the
olive oil is probably

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.590
on top of all these.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:08.085
But avocados-- anything
that has fat in it

00:52:08.085 --> 00:52:12.009
and comes from a
plant has a-- doesn't

00:52:12.009 --> 00:52:13.550
have the inflammatory
effect that you

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.080
get with the animal fats.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.860
So I don't think you have to
pick any particular vegetable

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.190
or any particular--
it's variety and it's

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:27.070
the relative proportion of
the overall food intake.

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:29.760
So it's different,
clearly, than what

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.510
you would get from any
specialized cookbooks,

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:36.470
that you have to eat
this particular thing.

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:40.360
There's other substances, which
goes beyond the microbiome more

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:45.420
into this low-grade
inflammatory state.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.650
Turmeric, for example, has these
anti-inflammatory properties.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:52.930
And I'm sure there's other--
I said in the beginning,

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:55.470
I'm not a nutritionist.

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:57.410
I can't really give
you this in detail.

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.820
But there's a lot
of plant-based foods

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:02.590
that have these
anti-inflammatory properties.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:06.080
And so that's another thing.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.141
AUDIENCE: So more plants.

00:53:07.141 --> 00:53:08.390
DR. EMERAN MAYER: More plants.

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:10.000
A lot of more plants.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.380
LIV WU: Thank you very much.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.546
DR. EMERAN MAYER: Thank you.

00:53:12.546 --> 00:53:15.330
