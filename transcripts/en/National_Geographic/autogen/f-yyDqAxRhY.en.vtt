any any great detail on that basically

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180
any any great detail on that basically
 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.600
any any great detail on that basically
we're going to actually place an

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610
we're going to actually place an
 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.460
we're going to actually place an

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470
explosive charge on the other side of
 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.590
explosive charge on the other side of
this panel detonate that explosive

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600
this panel detonate that explosive
 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.870
this panel detonate that explosive
charge and then look at the structural

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880
charge and then look at the structural
 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.630
charge and then look at the structural
response of this material from that the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
response of this material from that the
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.870
response of this material from that the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880
 
 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.210
 
yeah like it started at every three

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220
yeah like it started at every three
 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.220

three two
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.640
three two
why

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650
 
 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.410
 
multiple high-speed cameras record the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420
multiple high-speed cameras record the
 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:42.280
multiple high-speed cameras record the
blast so what you see here is a failure

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290
blast so what you see here is a failure
 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.020
blast so what you see here is a failure
of the material due to shock hole

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030
of the material due to shock hole
 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.460
of the material due to shock hole
failure but you can see where the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470
failure but you can see where the
 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.070
failure but you can see where the
materials kind of bent out and peddled

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080
materials kind of bent out and peddled
 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.690
materials kind of bent out and peddled
back the make up of the alloys is

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700
back the make up of the alloys is
 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.360
back the make up of the alloys is
classified but it's obvious you wouldn't

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
classified but it's obvious you wouldn't
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.430
classified but it's obvious you wouldn't
want to fly with this one our second

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
