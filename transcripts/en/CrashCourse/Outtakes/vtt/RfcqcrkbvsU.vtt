00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.740
And when you think about fictional realities
where different universes of discourses meet,
like the DC/Marvel crossovers,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.260
you're actually engaging in some pretty serious ontological ponderings.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.620
[laughs]
Hank: That was the nerdiest thing I've ever said.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.980
[all laugh]
Off camera: And you have said some nerdy things!

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.560
Hank: That was like, top--top of the list.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.600
Hank: Oh, Abby's the little artwork.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.200
Nick: Corgis are kind of artwork,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.520
Nick: Corgis are kind of artwork, but then again, bred...
Hank: ...so cute...

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.120
Off camera: It's a process.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.700
Hank: "Bred," with no 'A'.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.960
We are not mere objects that exist to be used by others.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.060
We our...are our, we're our own ends...

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.940
But this means we can choose to develop stronger levels of control over many of our actions,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.060
which is what we do when we get to work a break bad habit or ingrain a good one!

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.740
Some people lie more than they tell the truth.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.340
Off camera: Those people... suck.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.840
Like Sandy!

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.120
*accusingly* Sandy!

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.940
*laughing*

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.040
*singing* Wittgensteeein!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.460
We're naturally built -

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.500
*fart noise*

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.180
And you must - *mlaaagh*

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.360
Maybe your desire to not care what other think - *waaargh*

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.800
Try to interpret whatever your interloc...interlocu - *blargh*

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.080
There are a whole lot of things that most of us think are totally fine,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.920
but are actually expressly forbitten, buh-bitten

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.540
They're not just for cartoon cowboys!

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.340
*in a southern accent* Dem's fightin' words.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.960
A brain scan revealed a large tumor in his orbito frontal -

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.080
orbito frontal cortex

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.380
orbito-front, orbito frontal cortex

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.960
orbito frontal cortex

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.620
orbito frontal cortex, 'kay.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.240
They contained subjects and verbs and are glamma - glammatically legit.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.780
But remember, if you really think that beauty is in the bo - ugh, bye of the beholder.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.680
There are other kinds of,

The tragedy for Sartre, is that he was an atheist,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.180
so he believed there was an emptiness that can never -

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.500
This wasn't... *arghhh*

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.600
This is a good-

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.400
Patricia Chu -

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.440
Patricia Shurshland -

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.500
and yet they consider other rules from the Old Testament to be like the Ten Command -

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.260
like the Ten Commandments

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.260
*singing* to be still binding

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.960
like the words that are coming out of your mouse-th

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.920
mouse?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.620
No.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.460
*singing 'Ho! Ho! Ho! To the Bottle I Go'* Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain and the sh-rain that falls from the hill to plain

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.020
better than... something. I dunno

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280
or something that - *whoogh*

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.580
For example, the prohibition that says 'do not kill'

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.880
is a prohibition

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.940
and *whosnosumim* the other factors

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.500
Really weign- reigned it in there at the end, it's great.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.080
Or some historical facts about the workst- *weird sound*

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.780
This is *brrr*

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.920
ah-boo boo boop

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.500
The mythical lost island that our old monk friend 'Gaun-ee-lo' said could be the-

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.000
*pained whining*

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.260
*laughing in the background*

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.520
Some beings are able to do this on their own

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.960
but, since we need to coordinate matters with a partner, God kindly instilled us with a sex drive

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.440
and made the *prrahcess* feel good

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.800
to make sure that we noo- to make sure that we dooo-it.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.400
Thanks, God!

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.080
or that a speech act can cause nations-chr- to chrchchrr

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.260
and takes offench-

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.100
Offench?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.300
Off camera: Offench!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.500
[yawn]

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.720
Nick: Good take.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.080
and that's a violation of Kant's setic-

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.640
seticah-

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.140
segli-

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.680
sah-

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.820
sedizah- I died.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.820
Everything fell apart.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.320
But they also think that there's something different about some human actions--

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.620
that some of the actions we take really are free.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.180
Please, please be true.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.640
Nicole: Just a little--

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.120
just a little bit.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.020
each of us as- has- has a box

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.740
and Kant phrased it this way:

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.940
Act only according to that maxim which you can at the same time with whaatt--

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.500
--with that should be a universal law without contradiction.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.520
Nick: with whaatt

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.680
*sounding very much like a duck* with whaatt

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.320
If a skunk walks through paint and leaves footprint on- footprints

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.480
He was lookin' pretty smart.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.060
the ones that some people would include in a groooup

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.940
*emphasizing wrong syllables* but oth-ers would ex-clude.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.940
God.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.280
He's up there.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.960
On the second floor.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.740
[hauntingly] Of the univeerrrse...

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.480
or was it Ne-

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.200
-either?

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.680
Elvira's impulse is to lie and say that Tony isn't there

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.740
in order to protect him from this word-be murderer

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.800
word be?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.920
Early 20th century German philosopher, Gottlob Frege

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.520
helped pruh-perabara-

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.040
that an artist must want to evoke some valuable emo-

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.360
*weird voice* vhaluable emootion in the auudience

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.940
We talked about hypothetical and categorical imperatives

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.940
the universi- ilisabil-

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.500
we studied the basic goods

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.660
and the way that instinct bynd-reason becomes together and shrorns the natural law

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.860
Nick: Maybe again.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.400
Like if you're in your sister's room, having an argument, and she says, "There's the door,"

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.900
you can assume that she's not just randomly naming house parts

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.100
[laughing]

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.000
[laughing in the background]

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.220
I think that's the first time that's ever happened to me.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.140
[laughing in the background]

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.460
[laughing]

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.260
I knew it was coming too.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.360
Nick: That's a good joke though, I can see a person in the middle of that argument who actually thinks that.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.220
Yeah--

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.380
There's the door.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.820
Well, there's the phone!

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.880
*laughing in the background*

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.180
There's the wall!

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.740
Okay.
