papers together one I was especially

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130
papers together one I was especially
 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.849
papers together one I was especially
struck by the fact that all of the

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859
struck by the fact that all of the
 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.999
struck by the fact that all of the
papers actually asked what the archive

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009
papers actually asked what the archive
 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.440

this question that India says look this
 

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:49.410
this question that India says look this
is a domestic matter and in all your

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:49.420
is a domestic matter and in all your

so I think the India's position saying

00:46:16.799 --> 00:46:16.809
so I think the India's position saying
 

00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:18.839
so I think the India's position saying
that this is a domestic matter and it's

00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:18.849
that this is a domestic matter and it's
 

00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:20.400
that this is a domestic matter and it's
accompanied by another position which is

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:20.410
accompanied by another position which is
 

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.529
accompanied by another position which is
to always say that caste is not race and

00:46:22.529 --> 00:46:22.539
to always say that caste is not race and
 

00:46:22.539 --> 00:46:24.480
to always say that caste is not race and
therefore it does not belong in the

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:24.490
therefore it does not belong in the
 

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.279
therefore it does not belong in the
international community's conversation

00:46:26.279 --> 00:46:26.289
international community's conversation
 

00:46:26.289 --> 00:46:29.809
international community's conversation
and that's a misguided and actually a

00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819
and that's a misguided and actually a
 

00:46:29.819 --> 00:46:32.009
and that's a misguided and actually a
misinterpretation of international human

00:46:32.009 --> 00:46:32.019
misinterpretation of international human
 

00:46:32.019 --> 00:46:33.839
misinterpretation of international human
rights law and it's assuming that

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:33.849
rights law and it's assuming that
 

00:46:33.849 --> 00:46:35.519
rights law and it's assuming that
various conventions only talk about race

00:46:35.519 --> 00:46:35.529
various conventions only talk about race
 

00:46:35.529 --> 00:46:38.130
various conventions only talk about race
and don't include caste what India has

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:38.140
and don't include caste what India has
 

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.170
and don't include caste what India has
inadvertently done by doing that is that

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:40.180
inadvertently done by doing that is that
 

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.960
inadvertently done by doing that is that
it's actually thrown fuel into the fire

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:42.970
it's actually thrown fuel into the fire
 

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:45.930
it's actually thrown fuel into the fire
and actually created a firestorm on

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:45.940
and actually created a firestorm on
 

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.180
and actually created a firestorm on
these issues in a way that has allowed

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:48.190
these issues in a way that has allowed
 

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.470
these issues in a way that has allowed
for conversations to take place

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480
for conversations to take place
 

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.599
for conversations to take place
internally and it has it's been on

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:51.609

so there's a way in which a conversation
about caste in India was forced by the

00:47:02.009 --> 00:47:02.019

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640
fact that India had such a recalcitrant
 

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.900
fact that India had such a recalcitrant
position

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:04.910
