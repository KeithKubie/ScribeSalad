LIV WU: Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.420
Thank you for coming.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.510
I'm Liv Wu on the Global
Food team.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.510
I just spent a very enjoyable
hour having lunch with Pati,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.750
who I'm delighted to have
here, talking about

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.260
all sorts of things.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.580
And in particular, about this
beautiful book, her cookbook.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.620
But she has a breadth
of knowledge.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.930
She is a political scientist and
interested in furthering

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.090
democracy and immigration
issues.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.710
But I think the force and the
pull of her family finally

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.900
brought her back to food.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.730
There are three other
people, her sisters,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.310
who are also in food.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.850
And it's what she's come back
to, with this wonderful

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.580
background that she has.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.710
And I think probably the one
thing I'll tell you from our

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.300
luncheon conversation that was
so striking is that she's just

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.680
real, just like all these
recipes that'll work for you.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.120
She's raising three boys.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.170
And I raised one boy, and that
was enough for me, but anyway.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.030
And she knows what they like
to eat and how to cook for

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.800
them and how to take
them out to eat.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.370
And so this cookbook is totally
accessible, and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.050
largely because of
the force of her

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.560
personality and her family.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.780
So I'm just going to
give her the floor.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.070
Welcome.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.100
PATI JINICH: Thank
you so much.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.360
Thank you so much.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.440
You have no idea how I've been
looking forward to this day,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.660
because I use Google a
thousand times a day.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.270
So, so nice to be here inside
Google with all of you.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.070
Such an incredible team
and incredible people.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.770
And I just had the most
fabulous lunch.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.660
I kept saying, get
out, really?

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.540
Get out, really?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.530
They gave me a tour of the
kitchen, and they're making

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.910
their own Mexican-style
chorizo.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.280
I would have stayed there, but
I had to come talk to you,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.210
which I'm delighted about.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.140
So I'll tell you a little bit
about my story, and then

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.480
afterwards, please,
if you have any

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.828
questions, let me know.

00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:20.910
I wanted to begin by telling you
a little bit of the roots

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.820
of this book and where the
contents come from.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.820
And I'll start with something
that happened to me after I

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.750
moved from Mexico.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.390
I got married, move to Dallas,
Texas, and I was going to be

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.970
there just for a couple of
years with my husband.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.820
And then we decided to stay
longer, and I got pregnant and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.000
had my firstborn.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.250
And when my mother realized that
I was not going to come

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.330
back to Mexico soon, or maybe
for a few more years or more,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.410
she got really sad, because
she was really missing me.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.470
And she told me something, as
we sometimes do, we tell

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.360
things to our kids that we
regret, and they're a little

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.000
bit hurtful.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.870
And she said, you know, trying
to make me feel guilty and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.710
wanting me to come back to
Mexico, she said, you know

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.090
what you've become?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.630
And I said, what?

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.400
And she said, a despatriada.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.070
Which is--

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.070
I mean, it makes my skin, as we
say in Mexico, have piel de

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.080
gallina, con los pieles de
gallina, like the hairs go up.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.230
Despatriada is a really strong
word, let me tell you.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.470
Despatriada means that you have
no roots, that you've

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.860
lost your patria,
your country.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.990
That you're sort of
floating around.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.030
And that was very
hard to swallow.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.580
And then, of course, thought,
oh, she misses me terribly.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.820
And it take many years for me
to understand that she said

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.970
that because she missed me.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.680
And that I have really strong
roots to my home country, and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.530
I have really strong roots
to my new home country,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.530
which I also love.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.510
So I am happily torn between
the US and Mexico.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.600
And what happened--
and this is what

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.150
brought me into cooking--

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.080
I started political science.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.890
I wanted to be an academic.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.990
I grew up being an idealist.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.050
And my parents were
even concerned.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.670
I struck conversation with just
about anyone who would

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.430
share a little bit
of their story.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.520
And when I moved to Texas after
having studied political

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.400
science, and wanted to be an
academic and work in a think

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.560
tank, I became insanely
nostalgic about Mexico.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.480
I was newly wed.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.300
My husband was traveling all
over, working a lot.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.990
I was writing write my
dissertation on Mexican

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.550
democracy, which took
many, many years.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.190
And I was insanely nostalgic,
and I started cooking.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.370
I've always been a big eater,
but I had never been a cook.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.510
I was a terrible cook.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.860
I just think about the things
I put my husband through.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.910
He ate some crazy meals,
let me tell you.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.960
But so I started to cook, and
then I started hunting down

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.650
Mexican ingredients.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.310
And it was that distance from
my home country that made me

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.420
perceive its food dimension, and
all the ingredients under

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.640
a new light, and seeing how
exotic and beautiful and

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.450
gorgeous and sophisticated
it is.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.360
I grew up with tomatillos and
avocados and chiles every day.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.360
Now when I found them in the
Latino aisle of a store, or a

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.660
little Asian store, I would go,
oh my god, the tomatillo

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.930
and the chile, and I would
romanticize about it.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.530
And started making all the foods
that I grew up eating,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.980
which make me feel at home.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.320
It made me feel nurtured.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.820
It made me feel warm and cozy.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.745
Started making all that.

00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:51.630
But I kept on studying political
science, because as

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.720
my father would say--

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.260
I mean, of course I flirted with
food so many times before

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.140
I decided to take the plunge.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.040
My father would say, Pati, we
put you through college, and

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.380
now you're going to
go wash dishes?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.840
So I kept on studying,
kept on working.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.490
And then we moved to
Washington, DC.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.710
And further studied and worked
at a think tank, which I

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.370
really admire, the Inter
American Dialogue, which was

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.590
fabulous work, with
the relations

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.330
between US and Mexico.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.400
And I was still crazy
about the food.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.430
And my husband kept on
poking fun of me, and

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.650
he would quiz me.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.620
OK, Pati, you're a political
analyst.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.630
Who's the president of France?

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.990
You know?

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.560
Because all I read was the food
section and cookbooks.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.340
And I would be cooking
all the time.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.920
And I would be really unhappy at
work, thinking, I just need

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.110
to put a little more
effort and get

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.600
involved in more projects.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.090
And the thing that really
was pulling me was food.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.310
So after thinking a lot about
it and struggling--

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.710
you know, because I think we
all have expectations of

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.690
ourselves, and the people that
surround us have expectations

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.280
of ourselves.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.440
And I saw myself as an academic
with glasses, writing

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.920
articles that would help with a
small grain of salt or sand,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.050
as we say in Mexico--

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.300
[SPEAKING SPANISH]--

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.090
to contribute to the
strengthening of democratic

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.240
institutions, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.480
And I decided to take the
plunge and resign, and I

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.180
enlisted to an intensive
course at L'Academie de

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.330
Cuisine, which is a
cooking school in

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.285
Gaithersburg, Maryland.

00:07:40.285 --> 00:07:44.360
I had done it once before, when
I had been on maternity

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.440
leave with my second son.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.330
And I decided to do it again, to
test the waters, and see if

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.550
I really wanted to do it.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.170
And oh boy, did I really
want to do it.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.380
I just, I went crazy.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.300
And since then, I haven't
looked back.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.910
And I've never worked
as hard in my life.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.610
It's funny, because people say
you should do what you love

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.300
and be passionate about
what you love, and it

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.130
really takes over.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.770
And it's really taken over, and
I sometimes have to stop.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.790
My husband's like, Pati,
it's Sunday.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.310
So in this book, you will
find those two roots.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:32.080
I tried to show Mexican home
cooking, and recipes and

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.860
ingredients that may be already
very familiar to

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.960
Americans from both routes.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.860
The traditional foods and dishes
that I grew up eating,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.830
and that I love and that I
miss, and many that I've

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.270
gotten through requests
from the blog or my

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.570
classes or the PBS show.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:58.700
And I feel that by doing that,
I help find those links that

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.230
sometimes are missing from
that chain that connects

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.870
communities and families, to
continue passing them on.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:12.190
But you will also find recipes
and dishes and stories of me

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.460
testing those ingredients
and those dishes

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.500
in my American kitchen.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.480
Sort of testing the limits,
expanding the uses of those

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:23.990
ingredients.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.210
And I try to do it in a genuine
way, respecting the

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.500
soul of the ingredient and the
dish, or whatever I may be

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.110
playing with.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:36.800
But sort of helping, again, like
with my small grain of

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.680
sand, to continue to expand
Mexican cooking, as many cooks

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.090
and chefs are doing
around the world.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.280
So you will find the traditional
and sort of the

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.720
innovative.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.070
And then as far as the stories,
I try to share not

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.840
only how to make a certain dish
or how to use a certain

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.050
ingredient, but I think that
Mexico and the United States,

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.320
we think we know each other,
and you know, we have that

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.210
huge border between each other
that connects us, but I think

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.730
there's so many things that
we're missing out.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.730
And let me tell you,
I've been the very

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.040
first one to be humbled.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.010
When I moved to the US, I always
thought, oh, Mexico, we

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:29.270
have the centuries of history,
and infusions of other

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.560
countries and ingredients
and so much richness.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.190
And the US is such a young
country, when you compare it

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.100
to the pre-Hispanic Mexico.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.960
I used to think that food and
the culinary world in the US

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.960
was going to be much more
shallow than it is, and that

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.750
there weren't going
to be the 32

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.420
original cuisines of Mexico.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.250
And I really think there's
dozens and dozens more.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.800
I've been humbled
time and again.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.140
I mean, I went to Memphis--

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.780
I couldn't believe the food, the
culture, the specialties.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.210
Everywhere I go, I've become
really, again, humbled about

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.975
how little I know of
my new country.

00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:05.460
And now I'm super curious.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.250
I'm dying to go to Nashville,
for one thing.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.710
New Orleans, for another.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.170
I want to come to San
Francisco for

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.420
more than one day.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:18.120
You know, I just, I realize,
as a Mexican, how little I

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.790
know of the US.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.260
And I think it goes the
other way around.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.890
People think they know
Mexican food.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.570
And I think the US, and the
world, really doesn't.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.630
If the few dishes that have
crossed the border and have

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.230
become like crazily popular
that everybody knows.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.105
But not many people know that
in Mexico, we're crazy about

00:11:42.105 --> 00:11:44.270
salads, for example.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.150
We just don't call it such.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.190
We were talking before about
how in Mexico, I think, we

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:56.260
haven't done such stark or
marked categorizations or

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.550
compartmentalizations.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.450
You know, the words vegetarian
and vegan.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.700
I was talking to my editor when
we were writing the book.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.780
I was really lucky.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.890
I had this fabulous editor who
helped me sort of give

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.880
direction to the book.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.430
And she was saying, Pati,
let's do a chapter on

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.360
vegetarian food.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.080
And I jumped up--

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.976
I'm like, no!

00:12:14.976 --> 00:12:16.500
Vegetarian, what do you mean?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.830
No, no, I eat chorizo.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.980
I eat bacon.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.680
Chilorio.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.260
Huevos con chorizo.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.730
No, there's no way I'm going to
go do a vegetarian chapter.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.050
And then I realized all the
foods that I eat that are

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.830
vegetarian or vegan.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:34.030
Naturally, the Mexican diet was
mainly a vegetarian diet

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.720
before the Spanish arrived and
brought the pork and the

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.310
lard-- which we of
course love--

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.570
and so many other ingredients.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.700
But we just don't
call them that.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.660
So the example about salads--

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.800
we eat, for example,
cactus petal salad.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.860
Let me tell you about
an ingredient

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.040
that's going to go wild.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.460
Remember how portobello
mushrooms were all the rage

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.240
for vegetarians?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.390
Just wait until cactus petals
start being sold clean.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.430
Because the hassle is to get
rid of the spinas, or the

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.190
little thorns.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.920
They're very persnickety
and hard to clean.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.105
But cactus petals, oh my god!

00:13:15.105 --> 00:13:16.820
They're wholesome, nutritious.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.310
They're tart, they're chewy,
their mealy, they're

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.370
incredibly delicious.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.730
You can use them in a thousand
different ways.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.350
And just like the cactus
petals, there's so many

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:28.420
ingredients that people may find
in the supermarkets but

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.660
they don't know how to use them
or what to use them for.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.880
Jicamas, chayote squash, all
different kinds of tomatoes,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.360
and the tomatillo.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.430
Everybody knows the salsa
verde and has

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.460
tried a salsa verde.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.560
But not many people know that
all you need is a pound of

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.620
those tomatillos that come
covered in that husk.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.226
And people are a little
intimidated, but you just peel

00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:52.630
them, boil them, drop a chile,
drop an onion, throw it in a

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.190
blender, you have salsa verde.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.070
So I think I'm trying to build
a bridge in whichever way I

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:02.000
can, to say, hey, you already
have all these things here.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.250
They can give you so much power
in your own kitchen.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.680
It's about empowering those
connections and those things

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.920
that we now share, thankfully.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.850
Because now you can find any
ingredient that you want

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.220
that's used in Mexican cooking,
either if not in your

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.270
corner store, with the click
of an online button.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.570
And so try to share, you know,
you're going to bring the

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.200
tomatillos into your house.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.160
Let me tell you how you find
them, where they come, how

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.740
they've been used, how they've
been used throughout history.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.470
And I don't want to bog people
down with so much history, but

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.420
hey, you can make salsa verde.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.480
You can make a salad
using it fresh.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.440
You can make a jam.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:49.060
And I'll give you an example
of how distance has been a

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.610
blessing and a curse.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.960
So I miss my family terribly.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.050
I do, horribly.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.530
My kids--

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:55.940
I have three boys.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.640
They have so many cousins in
Mexico who they love seeing

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.230
and playing with all the time.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.990
But wait, I wasn't going
to talk about my boys.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:09.060
I was going to say the
tomatillo, which I'm

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.140
passionate about, it is just
such a gorgeous fruit.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.540
In Mexico, tomatillos are mainly
used to make a salsa

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.940
verde, a cooked salsa verde.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.650
It's very rare to find the
tomatillo used raw.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.850
There's a few salsas here and
there, but not like raw,

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:25.920
chopped in a salad.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.810
It's a very new thing.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.800
So when I was coming up with
more recipes for the book,

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.910
like new spins on ingredients,
one summer it was really hot.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:42.140
I had a really ripe, fresh,
super juicy, sweet watermelon.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.070
And I was trying to come
up with a salad.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.360
And I thought, oh my god, the
perfect thing would be the

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:47.930
tomatillos.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.350
They're hard.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.780
They're tart--

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.230
uniquely tart, because you can
find nothing too match that

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.440
flavor of the tomatillo.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.710
Not green tomatoes, guys.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.090
It's a different things.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.170
In a pinch, you can substitute,
but a tomatillo's

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.320
a tomatillo.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.645
So I thought, that's
a great contrast.

00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:05.230
And I came up with a
vinaigrette, jalapeno and

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.790
mint, and some feta
cheese in there.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.510
So I was telling my mom all
about this salad one day, and

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.170
she's like, Pati,
raw tomatillo?

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.590
Yuck, no!

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.970
No, no, we use it cooked!

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:16.820
It's in salsas.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.020
And I'm like Ma, you won't
believe this salad.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.310
No.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.860
No way.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.930
There's no way.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.300
She comes visit, what
do I give her?

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.050
The watermelon and
tomatillo salad.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.650
Who's making it in her
house in Mexico City?

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:29.540
My mom.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:34.820
So it's that distance that has
given me, at the same time,

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.890
the nostalgia, that really,
really heavy nostalgia--

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.950
which can be beautiful, when
it's so heavy sometimes.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:49.090
But the freedom to play and to
test those ingredients and

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.190
those dishes.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.470
I've been talking too long.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.120
Should I take some questions?

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.990
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.210
PATI JINICH: Hi.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.250
AUDIENCE: I've got four younger
children that age from

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.486
ten down to four.

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:00.420
PATI JINICH: Four?

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:00.760
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.490
Ten, eight, six,
four years old.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.079
What recipes do your boys
like to make with you?

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.510
Or what's a good one
for the children?

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.810
PATI JINICH: Let me tell
you, Mexican food

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.450
is perfect for kids.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.490
Perfect.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.109
Because it's accommodating, it's
versatile, it's easy, and

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.200
the kids can participate.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.450
I'll tell you something funny,
and then I'll tell you when

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.099
you can feed your kids.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:26.690
I always like to compare the
food of a place to its people.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.960
So you know, the French.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.560
Think about French food.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.090
It's a little bit fussy.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.440
It's a little bit like,
things have to--

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.750
I love France.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.870
I would go to Paris tomorrow.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.150
I love French food.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:40.850
But they're a little fussy.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:41.520
You know?

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.990
Everything has to be perfect.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.640
And think about what they
do to tomatoes.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.730
When they're going to use a
tomato and it's going to be

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:51.330
cooked, they boil it for
just enough minutes.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.040
Then they take it out, then they
peel it, then they core

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.310
it, then they seed it.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.320
Then they cut in perfect
little squares.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.500
What do Mexicans do with
tomatoes for a sauce?

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.970
We boil it and we throw the
entire thing in the blender.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.650
With the seeds, with the
skin, with the core.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.780
I love the tart flavor of seeds,
so as many Mexicans.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.320
So I think just to tell you how
easy this book is going to

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.210
be for you--

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.900
you're not going to have to
peel and core and seed and

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.790
dice in perfect little
squares.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.500
My kids love chicken tinga.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.310
They love chicken tinga.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.170
It's something you can pull
together in half an hour.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:34.340
You can make it with chicken
that you cook at home or with

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.510
rotisserie chicken.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:39.260
You make a big batch, and one
day you serve it was rice.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.200
A couple of days later,
Wednesday comes, what do we

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.470
have for dinner, kids?

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.190
Tingadillas, quesadillas with
chicken tinga, which is

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.480
incredible.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.890
You have a little
bit left over.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.690
Friday, you can make some tortas
or some sandwiches.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.380
The great thing is that many
of the food here--

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.580
another one is chilorio.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.180
Chilorio is like a similar take
on the tings, in that

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.400
it's shredded meat.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.540
This time, pork, but you can
make it with chicken, too.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:10.020
It's a sauced-up, sort of drier,
moist stew that is

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.230
super versatile and

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.370
accommodating, like us Mexicans.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.760
You can eat it on top of rice.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.940
You can eat it in quesadillas,
in tortas, in molletes.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.600
So those things you can make
ahead, you can make them on a

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.190
Sunday and then eat them.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.360
My kids love making the piggy
cookies that are in here.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.660
AUDIENCE: Well, my kids
love chicken.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.200
So I know [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.730
PATI JINICH: They
love chicken?

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.080
AUDIENCE: I notice--

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.790
how much of the cooking
is between the men and

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.864
the women in Mexico?

00:19:39.864 --> 00:19:41.770
PATI JINICH: That's
a good question.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.980
We're getting political.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.830
I used to do political
analysis.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:50.085
There's a reason why I got out
of political analysis, though.

00:19:50.085 --> 00:19:52.800
You know, most of the
cooking is done by

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.770
women, I think, in Mexico.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.540
It's sort of a new thing, and if
you think about the leading

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.860
people in the culinary world,
professionally in Mexico, it

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.680
used to be mostly
women, The grand

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.370
dames of Mexican cooking.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.800
Diana Kennedy to begin with.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.830
She's British, but she
rules, like a British

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.260
woman should do.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.630
Patricia Quintana,
Monica Patino--

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.080
I mean, there's so many-- there
was like a cadre of

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.640
women who ruled the
culinary world.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.390
And it's been, I think, the
past generation, like this

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:32.470
generation, the past 15 years,
that men have entered and

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.940
really broken the perception
that it should only be women.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.470
And they're doing crazy fun
things, testing and playing

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.110
with ingredients and
the concepts.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.790
But it has been mainly women.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.580
And in the homes, it's
also mainly women.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.570
I can tell you, in my house,
it's mainly a women thing.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:58.660
When I got married, and I met my
husband, I asked him on our

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.420
first date, do you
like to cook?

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.710
And he said, of course.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.610
And I said, so what
do you cook?

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.400
And he said, soup,
chicken, salad.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.020
I've never seen a soup.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.080
I've never seen a chicken.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.990
I've never seen a salad.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.160
PATI JINICH: I've never
seen the pouring of

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.200
cereal into a bowl.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.890
But I love you him so,
and he will eat

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.210
everything that I give him.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.300
I can keep on talking.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.272
Yes?

00:21:25.272 --> 00:21:27.050
I'll tell you more theories
about what my

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.800
boys like to eat.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.200
Anything that's sweet.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.700
My little one, he's wild about
chipotles in adobo.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.780
You guys familiar with
chipotles in adobo?

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.600
Yes.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.070
No?

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.300
Yes?

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.630
Oh my god.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.320
OK.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.190
You have to try that.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.225
And you buy it in the store.

00:21:45.225 --> 00:21:46.780
It comes in a can.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.330
You can make them by
yourself, too.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:55.150
See, this is a great thing about
Mexican cooking, and why

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.960
I think-- you know, many people
think about Mexican

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.960
cooking, and it's either--

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.780
they think it's very spicy,
which it's not.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.340
First of all, not all
of the dishes or

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.220
recipes or food are spicy.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.130
Or not all of the chiles
are spicy.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.660
There's like 100 different
kinds of fresh and dried

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:23.090
chiles, and I would say like
maybe 80% are super mild.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.080
Chiles, think about
the poblano chile.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.860
Who knows the poblano chile?

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.100
Yeah?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.350
Yeah?

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.660
I love poblanos.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.280
I'm infatuated with them.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.270
They're so gorgeous.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.000
They're green, they're plump,
they're curvy, their meaty,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.230
they're delicious, they're
shiny, they're incredible.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.630
And you can find them in the US,
which you couldn't when I

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.130
first moved to Dallas.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.900
They're vegetables.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.630
I mean really, they're
a gigantic chile.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.030
And I think people are
intimidated because of the

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.100
word chile.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:54.080
But I like to refer to poblano
chiles as vegetables with a

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.080
load full of personality.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.660
You can use them-- you stuff
with cheese, with meat.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.940
You can make rajas with them,
for eggs, for so many things.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.480
So there.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.590
We dealt with the first myth of
Mexican cooking, that it's

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.430
always spicy.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.840
It's not.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.450
The second myth about Mexican
cooking, I think, is that it's

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.700
very laborious.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:21.470
So we do have phenomenal dishes
like the mole poblano,

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.270
or you know, that laborious
sauce to make.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:31.610
Or the chiles en nogada, which
are such an artistic creation.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.180
Who's heard about the
chiles en nogada?

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:34.810
OK.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.230
It's poblano chiles that are
charred and sorted and

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.260
cleaned, and stuffed with meat
that's cooked in a mix of

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.190
tomatoes and onion and garlic.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.940
And I know you guys
had lunch--

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.810
I hope I'm not going to
make you hungry again.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.850
The meat is cooked with tomatoes
and onion and garlic,

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:54.230
and olives and capers
and raisins and

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.860
dried and fresh fruit.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.150
Talk about the combination of
cultures, with Spanish.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:02.540
OK, so those chiles are stuffed,
and then they're

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.190
bathed with this walnut
creamy sauce.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.810
And that's not all.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.090
Then they're garnished with
pomegranate seeds.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.520
They're to die for.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.330
They're incredible.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:18.160
They're baroque, and they're
from a time in Mexico's

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.380
history that was very baroque.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.630
Those dishes are like on one
end of the spectrum.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.310
We eat them for holidays,
for weddings, for

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.550
Independence Day.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.770
You eat them at a certain times
or on certain occasions.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.705
But most of the cooking in
Mexico is home cooking, and

00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:39.290
it's super simple and
easy to make.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.970
You have tons of soups and
pastas and rice dishes and

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.500
salads and vegetable sides
that are very easy.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.850
So they haven't become
very popular.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.770
What I'm trying to do--
just because those

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.050
things stand out.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.100
And so that's one myth.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.360
Then that's the other myth.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.620
Another myth--

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.670
and I'll stop at the third,
but I can just go on--

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.930
is that Mexican food is
like Tex-Mex food.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:15.430
Or very greasy, cheesy,
creamy.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.300
I love Tex-Mex food.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.050
I'll lick the plate of
a combo platter.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:21.520
And I recognize what it is.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.340
It's a kind of regional food
from the US, and there's

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.290
wonderful things about it, but
it's not Mexican food.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:32.630
There's so many different layers
and things inside of

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.580
Mexican cooking, which is what
I am trying to do in here.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.130
Wait!

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.580
I had started talking about the
chipotles in adobo sauce,

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.850
and I never got to that.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.980
Wait, can I tell you about
the chipotle sauce?

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.360
In adobo?

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.830
The chipotles in adobo?

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.300
OK.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.520
So my youngest son
is crazy about

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.900
chipotles in adobo sauce.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.950
They come in cans, and what they
are-- you all need to go

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:56.900
and get some.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.870
What they are, it's jalapeno.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.230
So everybody knows a
jalapeno, right?

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.910
A chipotle--

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.660
which is a beautiful name,
I think, chipotle--

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.130
is a jalapeno that
has been picked

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.250
when it's at its ripest.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.610
So not green, but red.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.780
And then it's dried.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.980
And then it's smoked.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.410
So can you imagine if all
that flavor is super

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.720
concentrated, OK?

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.880
And smoky, super smoky
and rustic.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.850
Think of a chile
in cowboy land.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.770
You have the chipotle.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:37.070
Then that chile is pickled
in an adobo sauce.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:43.900
The adobo sauce has vinegar and
spices and tomatoes and--

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.200
I found out--

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.260
ancho chiles, too.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.190
So think about it.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.280
A chile is being pickled
in another chile.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.640
How crazy is that?

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.800
Spectacular.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.060
Because the chipotle, it's smoky
and it's super spicy.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.740
And the ancho chile that it's
pickled in is chocolatey, and

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.550
it's bittersweet, and it
has a taste of prunes.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.190
So you have this condiment
that's incredible, and you

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.510
already buy it in
a can, right?

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.940
And you can use that
for so many things.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.070
So that's one ingredient that
you are going to have to get

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.380
to make the chicken tinga.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.680
Because it's in the chicken
tinga recipe.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.820
But you can get it online with
the click of a button.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.370
You can get it at the
grocery store.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.200
And I'll tell you something.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.720
You can make your own.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.900
And you know how I found out?

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.740
Because of a request
that I got from

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.650
a woman from Australia.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:36.250
So having this blog and this
site has really been an

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.120
enriching and incredible
experience for me.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.110
Because first I started
getting requests from

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.250
nostalgic Mexicans like me.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.910
I started teaching classes,
and then I

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.450
started getting requests.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.540
People wanted to see photos of
the how-tos, and stories

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.260
behind the recipes.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:57.190
So I started a blog to show
and share more recipes and

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.250
more stories.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.820
And then I didn't know it then,
but you guys know how

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.760
the online world is a crazy
thing, and it just goes

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.420
everywhere.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.250
It explodes.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.900
And I started getting requests,
first from Mexicans

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.400
that were nostalgic like me, and
wanted the cookie that my

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.550
grandmother used to make,
from Zacatecas.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.530
And she died many years ago,
and I want to make

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.420
it now for my kids.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.500
So that's what I talk about when
I talk about the links

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.460
that are missing in the chain.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.630
But then I started getting
other requests from other

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.870
people that weren't
even Mexican.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.340
I got this email from a
woman in Australia.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.740
She grows her own chiles.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.970
And then she pickles them
and she makes salsas

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.160
and she sells them.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.870
And she said, great
about your site.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.110
Now can you help me?

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.760
And want to make chipotles
in adobo sauce.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.230
I can't find them here, and
people really love them.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.100
And I want to make them
and sell them.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.550
Can you help me source
a recipe?

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.710
And I thought, who on Earth
would want to make the

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:52.580
chipotles in adobo sauce?

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.150
It's like trying to make
your own ketchup.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.470
Like you wouldn't do that on
a Sunday night, right?

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.840
Like you go to a fancy
restaurant that has its own

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.280
homemade ketchup, but it's not
something that every people

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:03.870
wants to do.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.790
So I thought, you know, you can
buy them online, and it's

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.810
not something that people
really make.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.840
She was really insistent, and
she said, no, but I really

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.760
want to make them on my own.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.150
Can you please help
me research?

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.220
And this is something
I love doing.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.260
Like when somebody sends me a
request, it's like they sent

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.380
me on a mission.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.100
So I started researching
in all my cookbooks.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.670
And as all my family now knows,
I am obsessed with

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.940
cookbooks and cooking manuals
and anything that

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.450
has a recipe on it.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.660
Whenever they come visit, they
bring me cookbooks from all

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.380
over Mexico.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.450
The last one my dad brought
was a book from Colima--

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.470
which is a state in Mexico
that is really not

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:44.370
well-known--

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.860
about how to cook iguana
in 200 ways.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:51.320
PATI JINICH: So that's--

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.270
I don't cook iguana.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.300
But it's been a really
fascinating

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.330
read, let me tell you.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.180
But so I come through all my
cookbooks, couldn't find a

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.680
recipe for chipotle
in adobo sauce.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.810
So when I went to Mexico,
I would try to find out.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.760
Because people pickle chipotles
in vinegar, but

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.180
guys, that's a different
thing.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.100
That's a different recipe, OK?

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.700
So I told her I had found
recipes for chipotles pickled

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.130
in vinegar, but not in adobo.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:14.890
OK.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.400
You know what?

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.470
I'm going to stop trying
to find it somewhere.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.600
I'm going to try and play
with it in my kitchen.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.660
Four frustrated years later--

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.180
PATI JINICH: It wasn't that I
was all the time playing with

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.900
those chipotle in adobe sauce,
but every couple months, I

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.510
would try a new tweak on the
recipe here and there

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.060
until I nailed it.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.430
And that's when I realized that
what my recipe had been

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.620
missing for all of those tries--
a little more vinegar,

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.530
a little less vinegar--

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.800
aside from a little bit of dark
brown sugar, it was the

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.740
ancho chiles.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.060
Who would have thought that a
chile would love to be pickled

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.660
in another chile?

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.990
So that's for just
one ingredient.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.460
You guys, you don't even
have to make that.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.250
You can buy it in cans.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:06.520
So here's why I think that
Mexico and the US, and Mexico

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.150
and the rest of the world--
because I think everybody

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.670
knows a taco, right?

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.820
Everybody knows, or thinks
they know, Mexican food.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.240
So here I'm sort of inviting
people into, hey, look a

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.090
little closer.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:20.250
We are very similar.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.140
We have pastas.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.930
We have rices.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.730
We have soups and salads.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:28.010
And they're going to give you
lots of options and things to

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.110
make at home.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.340
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask
you a question about--

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.270
for food enthusiasts who
actually want to touch and

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.010
feel the food, and like connect
with the ingredients

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:45.230
and stuff, are there culinary
tours, are there workshops and

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.380
other things that we could
get access to?

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.880
Because I feel if you do that,
you love food at a very

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.620
different level, versus just
picking up this recipe.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.290
Like going to a supermarket,
getting the

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.350
ingredients and doing it.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.510
Like are there resources
that folks like me and

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.550
maybe others can use?

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:01.600
PATI JINICH: Absolutely.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.480
There is a ton.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.210
In fact, in Mexico, there are
a lot of food tour companies

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.770
and food tour guides.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.205
And it's really exploding.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.730
I can give you--

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:17.980
I mean there's so many.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.440
There's so many.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.306
I'll tell you something.

00:32:23.306 --> 00:32:26.480
Like for the classes that I
teach at the Mexican Cultural

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.230
Institute, and the recipes
that I do, I

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.500
really dig in deep.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.730
Like one of the classes that I
did, that I have enjoyed the

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.820
most, was a class on vanilla.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.295
Everybody thinks that
vanilla comes from--

00:32:42.295 --> 00:32:43.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.570
PATI JINICH: Who said?

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.410
AUDIENCE: Madagascar?

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:47.690
PATI JINICH: Not Madagascar!

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.540
Yes, everybody thinks that
vanilla comes from Madagascar,

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.010
because they've been so
good at producing it

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:54.790
and marketing it.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.210
I've never been to Madagascar,
but I know vanilla from

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:58.150
Madagascar.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:03.640
Vanilla comes from Papantla,
from a really exotic, tropical

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.410
place in the state of
Veracruz in Mexico.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.530
That's where vanilla
originated.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:12.570
And that's the only
place where the

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.190
orchid or vanilla grew.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.130
And it's existed since
Totonaca times.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.890
I mean, pre-Hispanic times.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.340
There's beautiful legends
surrounding--

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.760
you know, how did people come
up with producing vanilla?

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.880
You know that vanilla has
to be picked green?

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.040
And then it has to be sweated
in wooden boxes for 28 days

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.920
and then basked in the
sun during the day.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.460
I mean, it's a really
complex process.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.350
Whoever came up with it,
it's not an easy thing.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:48.390
But I once taught a class,
because I try to do the myth,

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.950
and also show, hey,
we're Mexico, and

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.560
vanilla comes from here.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.750
But now I'm here.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.660
As my kids tell me, when we
get stopped, and they say,

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.380
where are you from?

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.980
And I say, we're Mexican.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.910
My kids say, no, Ma,
you're Mexican.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.720
We're American.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.840
But I taught a class about
vanilla, and I developed a

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:13.540
menu that had dishes starting
from soup to dessert.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.020
It even had the drink.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.460
It was from the drink, salad,
soup, to dessert.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.630
And it was like a historic
route of dishes that have

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:30.010
existed using vanilla, since
Totonaca times to more modern,

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:35.739
colonial, and to today, like
really experimental spins.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:39.739
So it was like a historical
tour, and also the different

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.150
uses of vanilla.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.659
The vanilla bean, the seeds,
if it's simmered.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.000
I have the recipe for
a vinaigrette

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.690
with the vanilla fried.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:54.460
And all the different uses of
vanilla bring out a different

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.080
facet of the ingredient,
right?

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.750
Anyway, just like me, there's
a lot of people that are

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:05.030
trying to showcase the cacao
in Mexico, and the vanilla,

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.000
and the coffee, in
the tequila.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.550
And I can give you a
list of sources.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.800
I mean, it's really booming.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:14.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:19.450
What do you think a cook that
starts working with this book

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.230
needs in his pantry?

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:24.220
What are the basic ingredients
you need to start cooking

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:24.720
Mexican food?

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.820
PATI JINICH: That's
a great question.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.470
Beans, either black or pinto.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.870
But you know, you can cook
them or you can buy.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:37.020
I mean, I give people choices,
because I believe being in a

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.590
kitchen is all about choices.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.770
Like I don't believe that there
should be only one way

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:42.430
to do something.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.190
There's really shortcuts, and
people can decide where they

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.390
start, where they begin with.

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:50.145
But beans, rice, avocado
for sure.

00:35:50.145 --> 00:35:52.130
Do you like avocado?

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.180
Chipotles in adobo sauce.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.790
They're an utmost necessity.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:01.610
So when I don't make them on
my own, I have cans in my

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.380
pantry, just in case
of an emergency.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:09.030
You know, tomatoes.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.840
You know, most of the basic
things in here are tomato,

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.230
onion, garlic.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:18.910
And either jalapeno or chipotle
in adobo sauce.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:19.630
Limes.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.340
Limes are really crucial.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:26.900
I was asked last week, which is
my favorite cooking tool?

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.010
And I love my comal.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:31.700
My mom gave it to me, and I use
it for making tortillas,

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.370
toasting tortilla, trying
ingredients.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.480
But you know what my favorite
kitchen tool is?

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.400
My lime squeezer.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.070
It's a powerful tool.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.490
I got it in a market
in Mexico, and

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.210
it's super heavy metal.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.555
And it'll squeeze the
juice of any lime.

00:36:49.555 --> 00:36:52.390
But you know, it's just fresh
ingredients like that.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:55.420
And if you want to try
more of the recipes

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.046
in here, ancho chiles.

00:36:58.046 --> 00:37:02.070
They're easy to find,
dried ancho chiles.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.850
I would say queso fresco,
or farmer's cheese.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:12.810
Last week, a food editor asked
me, and she said, Pati, I got

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.240
your book, and I love
the photos, and the

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.080
recipes look great.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:22.060
But did you and your editor have
a discussion about having

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:26.770
a resource section, you know,
where people can find things?

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.950
And of course we had
that discussion.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:34.670
But different from 50 or 40 or
30 years ago, when it was

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.980
really hard to find Mexican
ingredients, and you had one

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.020
or two brands that did
the canned stuff.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.170
And the resource page in a
Mexican cookbook was literally

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.980
half a page.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.640
Call this weird 1-800
number or ask your

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.330
aunt to smuggle some.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.540
These days, if I wanted to make
a resource section to my

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.620
cookbook, it would be bigger
than the book.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.300
Because by the time it would
have been published, it would

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.560
have been outdated.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.970
There's so many brands
that carry

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.340
different cans of things.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.680
From the pickled jalapenos, to
the chipotles in adobo, to the

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.910
already-cooked beans, to the
salsas, to so many things--

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.060
there's so many brands that by
the time it would have been

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.570
printed, there would be new
companies and people would be

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.520
making many things at home.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.960
And then if I wanted a list of
stores that sell Mexican

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.725
products, I would spend the
rest of my lifetime.

00:38:31.725 --> 00:38:33.470
And you can find
things online.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.200
So what I do in the book, and
I really worked very hard at

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.030
it, is describing the
ingredients and giving people

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:44.030
the knowledge in very
simple, fast ways.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.570
You know, you have all
these options.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.450
How do you choose what
you bring home?

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:51.420
Or if you don't find something
and you really don't want to

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.730
source it-- like piloncillos,
to give you an example.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.380
It's a fabulous Mexican
ingredient, that I would try

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.600
to find it if I were you.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.750
Just because I like
it so much.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.980
I put it in my coffee.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:07.600
Piloncillo is the purest
form of cane sugar.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.100
So when cane is processed, the
first-- it's like extra

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.100
virgin olive oil.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.920
The first press of cane sugar,
it's this liquid, this cane

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.910
syrup, that is put in cones.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.050
That's why it's called
pilon, or piloncillo.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.470
It's put in these cones
and it dries.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:29.970
And it has a beautiful,
dark caramel color.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.770
And it's no preservatives.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.750
Really not processed.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:40.250
It tastes like a little bit like
molasses, like dark brown

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:44.530
sugar, but with an extra layer
of something rustic.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.270
It tastes a little bit
like coffee, a

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.060
little bit like nuts.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.150
It is so rich, I can't
even describe it.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.990
There's some cookies in here
and recipes that use it.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.770
You can sub it for
dark brown sugar.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.190
But you find the piloncillo.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.970
Now it's easy to find.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:03.240
It goes by other names, and
I tell you [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.600
You'll be just having in your
pantry many more ingredients,

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.750
that not only will I--

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.620
I give you here a story, so you
know how they came to be,

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.940
what are the legends
surrounding.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.420
Because I really think that
being in the kitchen is sort

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.150
of magical.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:20.030
Like if you're cooking
with a vanilla part--

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.230
you like history.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.740
If you're cooking with a vanilla
part, and you know the

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:29.210
legends and the history behind
it in an entertaining way and

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.370
you're using it, I think
connecting with that

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.300
ingredient is different.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.010
You know?

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:38.860
You're here in San Francisco, in
your kitchen, and you have

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.830
this vanilla bean that
came all the

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.375
way from the Pantitlan.

00:40:42.375 --> 00:40:46.610
You know, I just think legends
and stories and all of that

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:53.770
just make the cooking experience
more magical.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.090
AUDIENCE: This is just a really

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.790
practical sort of question.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.080
My book club is coming to my
house tomorrow and I didn't

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.540
realize it.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.340
So I'm going to be home at 6:00
and they're all going to

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.510
arrive at 7:00.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.080
And I've got this
new cookbook.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.030
PATI JINICH: Today?

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.450
AUDIENCE: Tomorrow.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.060
PATI JINICH: Tomorrow, OK.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.080
AUDIENCE: So I can soak things
overnight or put things in the

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.330
slow cooker or in the rice
cooker or whatever.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:21.930
But do you have any
ideas for me?

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.327
PATI JINICH: Of course I do!

00:41:23.327 --> 00:41:24.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.540
PATI JINICH: Of course I do.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.640
So many!

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.550
So there's a fabulous
pasta in Mexico--

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.320
do you like past?

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.480
Do your friends like pasta?

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.520
OK.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.010
In Mexico, we call it
pasta seca, when the

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.490
pasta is sort of dry.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.110
Well, it can have a sauce,
but it's not a soup.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.390
And we call it sopa aguada
when it has broth.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.680
And the pasta seca is--

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:53.910
think of a pasta al pomodoro,
but with a Mexican spin.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.240
All you need are the
same ingredients--

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.470
pasta, a little bit of oil,
tomatoes, garlic, onion.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.750
If you can find those
chipotle in adobo

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.350
sauce, it would be fabulous.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.830
If not, you can use
a jalapeno.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:12.100
And so you're going to cook that
pasta the Mexican way.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.980
We cook pasta many
times like this.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.440
You're going to break
the pasta--

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.130
either the fettuccine or angel
hair or spaghetti-- whatever

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:21.960
pasta you have.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.970
It doesn't even matter.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.000
Little stars, if you have
little stars, alphabet,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.080
doesn't matter.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.580
You're going to cook that pasta
in a saucepan with a

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.300
tiny little bit of oil.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.820
But the oil has to be hot.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.780
And you're going
add the pasta.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.990
You're going to fry
it a little.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:42.380
So this is different from the
Italians, what we do to pasta.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.940
And there's no way that your
pasta will ever be bland.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.740
Because you're adding
that layer of--

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.040
like when you make roux?

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.880
It's just, you're toasting
the pasta.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.710
It's adding a layer of
depth and flavor.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.200
And it just takes
like a minute.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.930
And then you're going to add the
sauce, which you can make

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.840
it by pureeing tomatoes or with
a can of tomatoes, just

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.070
with some onion and garlic
and the chipotles.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.990
You're going to add
that to the pasta.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.670
So instead of boiling the pasta
and then adding the

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.580
sauce, think of an risotto.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.560
It's sort of the same.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.420
You fry the pasta for just like
a minute, and then you

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.440
add the sauce.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.750
And the pasta cooks
in that sauce.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:29.750
And so it plumps up and
cooks in sauce until

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.450
it's nice and moist.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.580
It's incredibly delicious.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.820
And then you add on top avocado
slices, fresh cheese.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.660
Don't find Mexican cheese,
queso fresco?

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.500
Use a mild feta.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.130
And it's really good.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.070
So that--

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:46.790
I can give you many.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.320
There's a great salads
in there.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.530
I have my everyday
green salad.

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:53.580
You make the vinaigrette
with just a jar, you

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.510
just shake it up.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.490
And you can do it with lettuces,
with asparagus, with

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.190
green beans, whatever
you want to use.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:02.390
And you really pull
dinner in a snap.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:03.250
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.970
PATI JINICH: Yeah,
my pleasure.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Pati.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:11.590
How important is it to
have good corn masa?

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:13.610
PATI JINICH: That's
a great question.

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:19.330
So I was just in Texas this
weekend, and I was at some

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.760
markets where they have their
own freshly made tortillas,

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.580
where they produce their
own fresh masa.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.750
So I think these days--

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.830
I mean, it's fabulous if you
can find fresh corn masa.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.190
And maybe in San Francisco,
there is.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:40.930
I wouldn't tell anybody to grind
the corn and cook it for

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:46.370
48 hours with lime, and then
peel it, and then kneel down

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.410
on the floor, and make a masa.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:53.900
It is great if you can find
somebody to do that in a

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.630
tortilleria.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:59.050
But if you don't, you can buy
the corn masa flour and just

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.500
mix it with water and a
little bit of salt.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.490
And it is really good quality.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:11.060
So you can have fresh-made masa
in the fast way, which

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.070
honestly, is what Mexican
peoples do in their homes in

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.740
Mexico, when they don't have
access to a tortilleria.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.230
Everybody uses those.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.430
You know, Maseca or
a masa like that.

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.570
You buy it, and it's
really delicious.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.590
So there are things in the book
where I use fresh masa.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:32.150
Like there's some chochoyotes,
some dumplings, that go into a

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:35.060
very easy yellow mole.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.450
I also show people, if
they want to make

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.790
their own corn tortillas.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.290
But it is not crucial.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:44.360
There's a thousand gazillion
things that you can make

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.800
without fresh masa.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.930
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:49.430
PATI JINICH: Hi.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:50.300
AUDIENCE: I'm from Puebla.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.110
PATI JINICH: No!

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:51.440
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.770
PATI JINICH: Oh my god.

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:54.770
The food in Puebla
is spectacular!

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:55.610
I was just there.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.743
I had an episode on the
foods from Puebla.

00:45:57.743 --> 00:45:58.650
AUDIENCE: Oh, cool.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:59.840
PATI JINICH: OK, sorry.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.420
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to ask
you what your favorite region

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.540
of Mexico is, in
terms of food.

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.730
PATI JINICH: That's so hard!

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.420
That's like asking me
which one of my

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.503
kids I like the most.

00:46:09.503 --> 00:46:11.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:12.760
PATI JINICH: I love them all.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:18.160
Well, I love the food
from Puebla.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:18.670
Love.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:23.220
And I think it is really one
example of the Baroque period

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.300
in Mexico, where so many
elements got intertwined.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:32.020
You know, the native Mexican
and the Spanish nuns.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.280
I mean, we owe so much
to them, right?

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.280
Las tortitas de Santa Clara, the
mole sauces, all of that.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.530
I love the food from Puebla.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.860
I love the food from
Michoacan.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.810
And I think it is a cuisine
that is not so well-known.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:50.160
And it's simpler than the
food from Puebla,

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.970
but it is very unique.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:55.100
It has a very defined
personality.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.290
And it's simple and
it's super homey.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:02.430
And every chance I get,
I go to Michoacan.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.450
But then again, funny thing
is being away--

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:12.440
so when I lived in Mexico City,
we used to go to certain

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.380
places for vacation in Mexico.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.090
Either Acapulco, or
Valle de Bravo.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:19.860
Or you know, you don't move so
much throughout the country.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.350
It's like here in the US, I
don't know if people really,

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:25.750
how many people go across the
country and try to go to every

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:26.850
single state.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:31.830
But being in the US has made me
really hungry to learn much

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:33.990
more about my own country.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:37.910
So any chance I get with my
family, any vacation, we'll go

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:40.140
to somewhere where
we haven't been.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:45.060
You know, a different place
in the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.570
So not Yucatan, but Campeche.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:52.410
We just took this trip from
Chihuahua to Los Mochis.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:55.150
Have you gone to el
Canon del Cobre?

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.640
So beautiful.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.400
So beautiful.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:03.270
That train, El Chepe, one
full wagon is a kitchen.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:08.630
So as you're rocking back and
forth in the rails, they're,

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:12.020
like, squeezing the juice and
making your coffee and making

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.590
your huevos rancheros.

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.030
It's really incredible.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.730
And so we got to eat the food
from the north, and the

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.600
chilorio, and the machaca,
and the--

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.990
so I didn't answer
your question.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.430
I'm sorry.

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.380
Mexico City.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.115
I love the food from
Mexico City.

00:48:25.115 --> 00:48:25.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:26.620
PATI JINICH: That's
where I grew up.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:31.630
Because in Mexico City, you have
the combination of the

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.310
really metropolitan,
up-and-coming, modern trends.

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:38.370
New things, you know, chefs
that have fabulous

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:39.460
restaurants, that are really

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.340
revolutionizing Mexican cuisine.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:46.780
But then you have this influx
of people from all over the

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.120
country that are coming because
they want to find

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.730
better opportunities
or they want to get

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:51.830
into the food world.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:55.900
And they bring into the city all
these regional foods that

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.830
haven't been so well-known.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.480
So I think Mexico City--

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:03.190
which is taken, I think, many
times as just a stop to go

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.940
into other places--

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.510
shouldn't be taken
for granted.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.730
The food is fabulous, and
the museums, too.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:10.680
The food.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.020
AUDIENCE: Can you tell a
little bit about your

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.600
experiments with other cuisines
and how you try to

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.130
fuse that with Mexican?

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:18.110
PATI JINICH: Yes.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.230
Other cuisines or other
ingredients?

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.490
Other cuisines?

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.730
AUDIENCE: Cuisines, if you
took a spin on it.

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:23.960
PATI JINICH: Oh, Italian.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.010
I love Italian food.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.270
I've been playing a lot with
pasta, 'cause I have a thing

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.840
with pasta.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.150
I love pasta.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:36.470
I've been playing just with
pasta a lot, like making

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:39.260
different kinds of lasagna.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.120
I have a friend who taught
me a trick to make

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.200
lasagna with chilorio.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.640
Who knows chilorio?

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:45.940
No?

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:46.550
OK.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.700
Chilorio is in here.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.620
You guys have to make it.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.070
Chilorio is a dish--

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:53.530
similar like the
chicken tinga.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.050
You can make it, you know,
ahead of time.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:56.320
You can make it fast.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.000
It's pork meat-- but you
can use chicken--

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.740
that's cooked in orange juice.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.150
Can you imagine just
how good that is?

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.910
And after the meat is cooked,
you either leave it in chunks

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:07.690
or shred it.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.570
And then it's finished off
in an ancho chile sauce.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.630
So you get sort of like a sloppy
joe feeling, that has--

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:15.920
I mean, just think about it.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.995
It's the meat cooked in citrus
and then chile and tomato and

00:50:19.995 --> 00:50:22.530
a little bit of vinegar
and spices.

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:27.960
Think, that layered in
between pasta sheets.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.750
It's really good.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.800
But what I mostly play with,
really, is just like Mexican

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.520
ingredients and different
things,

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.580
different ways to use them.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.620
LIV WU: Well, if nothing else,
you've got us hungry again.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:43.720
LIV WU: Thank you so much.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.712
PATI JINICH: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:50:45.712 --> 00:50:48.202
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:48.202 --> 00:51:16.782
