[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.960
TERO ISOKAUPPILA:
When I say to someone

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.470
that I'm interested in mushrooms
or that I have a mushroom

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.380
company, you get often a
few kinds of reactions.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.860
Some are like, are you
talking magic mushrooms?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.330
And some are like,
gross, I don't

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.740
like the flavor of mushrooms.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.890
And some are really excited
for various reasons.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.958
But they are a kingdom,
as you saw in the video.

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.500
And when something
is a kingdom, that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.750
means that there's a lot of
different kinds of things.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.097
So if you think of all the
animals that live on Earth,

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.180
there's quite a few kinds.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.960
Just take mammals.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.090
Compare a Chihuahua
and a blue whale,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.160
and they're drastically
different, right?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.112
And if you compare even
plants, not all plants

00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:47.820
are good for you.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.050
I know, obviously, a plant-based
diet is right now a big thing.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.967
A lot of people on it.

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:52.920
But a lot of plants
will kill you.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.220
And mushrooms are no different.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.345
Some of them will hurt you.

00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:57.190
Some of them will heal you.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.300
And just to kind of get the
mushroom lingo out of the way,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.920
mushroom is actually what
is called a fruiting body.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.660
And fungi is a kingdom.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.490
Fungi is like an umbrella.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.949
But often people, when they
talk about the fungi kingdom,

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.032
they talk about mushrooms.

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:14.190
But mushroom is actually
like the fruiting body.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.000
So let's think of an
apple tree, for example.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.740
The fruit, the actual apple,
would be the fruiting body

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.240
here.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.323
That's the part that is
visible, and you will eat.

00:02:23.323 --> 00:02:27.430
And it usually gets reproduced
annually with some exceptions.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.300
And then the rooting
system, which is often

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.955
referred to as mycelium--

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:35.190
it was also like hyphae,
like an early version of it--

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.770
but mycelium is like
the actual apple tree

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.530
itself, the bark and the roots.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.320
And there is a lot of
mycelium underground.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.340
So wherever you will
go around the world,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.453
there will be
mycelium underground.

00:02:47.453 --> 00:02:49.620
And then sometimes, you'll
see these fruiting bodies

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.180
popping up.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.590
And the mycelium is really
important for the environment.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.440
And the fruiting body can
be really helpful for us.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.800
So since there is
mycelium everywhere,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.820
it serves a big purpose.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.010
So about 2.4 billion years ago--

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.320
so if the Earth is 4.2,
4.5 billion years old,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.430
2.4 billion years ago mushrooms
or fungi came from the seed

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.850
to the dry land.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.730
And what's actually fascinating
about mushrooms to me

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.800
is that they're actually
very similar to animals.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.450
So we're way closer
as humans to mushrooms

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.700
than we are to, for
example, plants.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.400
For example, mushrooms cannot
produce their own food through

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.690
photosynthesis like plants can.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.690
They have to eat something.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.610
By the way, they also breathe
oxygen and expel CO2, just

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.210
like animals.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.650
But they need to eat something.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.540
And since nothing
else grew on dry land,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.090
mushrooms decided to, for a
little over a billion years,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.320
eat rocks.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.880
So they're survivors, you know?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.440
And then later, as plants
were entered in to the Earth,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.440
the mushrooms helped the plants
to collect water and nutrients

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.302
from the soil.

00:04:02.302 --> 00:04:03.510
And that happens still today.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.700
So almost all plants
that you'll eat

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.970
have used fungi to collect
water and nutrients.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.400
But this is not
a biology lesson.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.610
I'm not here to talk to you for
hours and hours about fungi.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.290
Some of you might
find it fascinating.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.220
Some of you might not.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.980
But I just wanted to give
you kind of a quick overview.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.680
And the spores are-- by the
way, those are the seeds.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
So you go from the rooting
system to the fruiting body.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.300
The fruiting body
will produce spores.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.830
Spores are like the seeds.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.890
And then the spores will fly
away and produce more hyphae

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.610
and mycelium.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.900
So that's kind of the
lifecycle of a mushroom.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.520
My company Four
Sigmatic is focused

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.810
on these functional mushrooms.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.430
Those are like
healthy mushrooms.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.470
Often sometimes known
as medicinal mushrooms.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.620
But since medicinal marijuana,
that's often a bad label.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.330
These are completely
legal, safe,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.280
nothing to do with psychedelics.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.723
So that's why I prefer the
word functional mushrooms.

00:04:52.723 --> 00:04:54.390
And these functional
mushrooms are often

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.730
also called adaptogens.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.630
How many have heard
the word adaptogen?

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.610
A good bunch.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.290
OK.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.030
So this is right
now really trendy.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.820
It's actually not
that new of a concept.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.150
It's just become very popular.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.200
So adaptogen research started in
the Soviet Union for the army.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.477
What the army figured out--

00:05:14.477 --> 00:05:16.560
and this is, by the way,
not just the Soviet army.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.280
I had to go to--

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.720
I'm originally
from Finland, and I

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.980
had to go to the Finnish Army.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.320
And the same thing is
in certain situations,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.250
the soldiers are
given stimulants.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.160
Amphetamine, for example.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.120
I was in the Air Force.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.320
You fly in a fighter jet.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.210
You crash on enemy territory.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.740
Pump you up a
little amphetamine,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.360
and try to run as far as you
can in the next 24 hours,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.190
so hopefully you'll
be safe after that.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.390
But what happens is that you
have a little bit of a letdown.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.070
A lighter version
of a stimulant might

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.190
be like Adderall, lighter
compared to amphetamine,

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.490
or caffeine that we often
consume all the time, right?

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.070
So the Russian-- the
Soviets were like, hey,

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.570
is there anything
else that we could

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.120
take which would perform
performance, maybe not as much,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.970
but would improve performance
and wouldn't give you

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.220
the letdown the next day?

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.800
And they send this
doctor, Dr. Lazarov,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.390
to research a few things.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.850
And Lazarov studied
the best things

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.180
that he could find in the world,
and came up with five things

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.650
that he thought were adaptogens.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.480
And the word adaptogen
comes from the fact

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.600
that it helps you to
adapt to stressors.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.440
So it helps you to
adapt to stressors.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.810
And hopefully, it will
not give you a letdown.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.320
So in order for something
to be an adaptogen,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.100
it needs three things.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.420
It's non-habit-forming.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.880
It means it's not addictive.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.620
If something is addictive,
it cannot be an adaptogen.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.220
They have to be something you
could take every day safely,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.860
and you don't get used to it.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.060
Secondly, it restores balance.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.190
So it restores
balance in your body.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.980
And then, finally,
it's nonspecific,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.752
which is often sometimes hard
if you have a scientific mind

00:06:50.752 --> 00:06:52.960
to figure out, because
scientific studies are usually

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.300
done on one single
variable, one marker.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.800
And when something
is nonspecific,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.230
it can help with the
brain and immune function.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.472
And that can be complicated.

00:07:00.472 --> 00:07:02.680
And that's where it's often
in health, like hormones,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.620
for example.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.620
Even though you have a
marker like testosterone,

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.930
it's sometimes complicated,
because hormones

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.590
go up and down.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.298
You pull a lever.

00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:10.930
Another one goes
up or down, right?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.250
But that's what adaptogens are.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.470
And that's what some of these
best mushrooms are as well.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.790
And these are kind of
my passion, I would say.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.590
I love fungi.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.090
And I love the biology of fungi.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:27.680
But I'm mostly interested in,
what can the fungi do for you?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.760
How can it improve your
cognitive function,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.690
your immune system, your skin?

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:40.510
I've been running my business
now for about seven years.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.005
Normally, I've been traveling
40 to 60 times a year.

00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:43.880
And during that time.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.270
I've lived in-- in
the last 10 years,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.130
I've lived in 10 countries.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.400
And I've not been
sick in 11 years.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.150
And one of the reasons
why I have to thank

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.760
is the use of
adaptogens and mushrooms

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.680
for the immune system.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.070
But back to my story.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.100
So I was brought up in Finland.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.360
I'm a 13 generation farmer
and mushroom enthusiast.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.570
And I was brought up to learn
about mushrooms through my mom.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.940
My mom, when I was like
yay high with my brother,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.040
we went foraging for mushrooms.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.278
And one of the first things
that people get wrong

00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:16.570
about mushrooms is that they
always grow on the ground.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.945
They actually also
grow on trees.

00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:20.080
This is a chaga
mushroom that we also

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.140
use in the mushroom
coffee that is outside.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.580
And a lot of them are hard.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.480
You can't eat them.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.362
Actually, you should
not eat mushrooms raw.

00:08:27.362 --> 00:08:28.570
Just a general rule of thumb.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.910
Whatever mushroom we're
talking about, don't have them

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.490
raw, because they have this
structure called chitin

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.559
that we humans are not
really good at absorbing.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.590
And we lack this enzyme.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.110
Think of the shell of a
lobster is made out of chitin.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.070
So try eating a lobster shell.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.570
Not good.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.545
So you kind of
have to process it.

00:08:48.545 --> 00:08:50.170
But they are these
beautiful creatures.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.180
Most people just think
of that classic mushroom

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.450
shape, which I showed you
with the stem and the cap.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.730
But there's so many
different shapes and sizes,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.250
different types of mushrooms.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.330
And some of the best
ones grow on trees,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.030
because, like I mentioned,
mushrooms, like animals, they

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.340
need something to eat.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.740
And often when people ask me
like, what should you eat?

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.180
What's a healthy diet?

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.120
I joke to them that you
should eat dirt and trees.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.310
The healthiest thing you
can eat is dirt and trees.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.900
Unfortunately,
we're not equipped

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.490
to assimilate either of them.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.860
So we need to eat something
that has eaten them.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.010
So things that grow in the soil,
that have minerals, and then

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.800
can get the good gut biome
from the soil into our body.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.080
And also trees are
incredibly healthy.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.590
So obviously from maple
syrup to pine pollen,

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.200
but also to these
tree mushrooms that

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.000
serve so many
different functions.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
This is called turkey tail.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.070
This is called reishi.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.640
And a lot of the mushroom
names are a little exotic.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.497
Cordyceps, which are
used for performance.

00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:55.330
This is lion's mane.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.640
This is right now one of
the most popular mushrooms

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.360
in the US.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.650
It's touted to help with
focus and cognitive function.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.040
And it's funny how they look
as well as like lion's mane.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.980
It looks like a, I
guess, a mane of a lion.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.000
So that's how it's
named that way.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.430
But my fascination
with these is mostly

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.320
through the health benefits.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.880
Like you saw in the
beginning video,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.020
mushrooms are used in almost
half of the pharmaceuticals

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.578
out there.

00:10:23.578 --> 00:10:25.120
Penicillin is the
one you would know.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.340
But out of the 20 best selling
drugs, about 10 utilize fungi.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.190
And they can be used
to clean oil spills.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.510
They can help remove
diesel from the soil.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.470
They can eat plastic.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.870
A few years ago we found a
mushroom that eats plastic.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.000
Plastic has been
around 100, 120 years.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.970
And so far we haven't
figured out what--

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.160
does it compost or not?

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:48.925
We don't know yet.

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:50.800
But we found a mushroom
that likes to eat it.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.175
And then we can
eat the mushroom,

00:10:52.175 --> 00:10:53.450
and it has health benefits.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.440
But I think the
environmental change

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.050
is it's hard to change the
world through the environmental

00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.930
impact.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.260
It's hard to change the
world, too, sometimes.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.238
A lot of like very
esoteric topics.

00:11:07.238 --> 00:11:09.280
But what often people are
first interested in is,

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.370
hey, what can I do today
to feel good today?

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.180
And mushrooms can
help with that.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.030
Here's a little chart
that shows a mushroom

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.160
chaga, which is this one.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.720
It grows on a birch tree.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.890
It grows from 10 to 25 years.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:22.930
So very slowly.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.360
And birch has these healthy
compounds, like betulin

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.410
and betulinic acid.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.330
That's why if you go
to Finland or Russia

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.130
you hit yourself
with birch leaves,

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.410
because they have these
healthy oils in the bark.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.680
And kind of the mushroom kind
of eats them, and then gets them

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.930
in a form that then
we can utilize.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.360
And the amount of antioxidants
is quite incredible.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.200
So antioxidants are
one of the things

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.840
that are most proven for
general health and wellness

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.890
in the world.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.210
It's kind of a buzzy word.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.835
People don't really
know what it means.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.240
But they are color pigments.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.460
Not all color pigments
are antioxidants,

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.740
but all antioxidants
are color pigments.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.470
It's like the champagne thing
with the sparkling wine.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.970
Not all sparkling
wine is champagne,

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.980
but all champagne is
sparkling wine, right?

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.480
And these color
pigments can help

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.980
with cardiovascular health.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.780
They can help protect
our immune system.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.820
A lot of the most common
ways how people die today.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.920
And they can really
help with longevity.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.470
And people off the
internet love to debate

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.090
what antioxidants are good and
what has the highest amount.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.250
But just for the sake,
the two big bubbles

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.563
are two different ways I can
process a wild Siberian chaga.

00:12:28.563 --> 00:12:30.730
And then you have some of
the other more antioxidant

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.000
rich foods from dark
chocolate to acai berry.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.760
And this gives you an idea of
how abundant these mushrooms

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.360
are in these nutrients
and how potentially you

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.870
could benefit from them.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.630
And that's a chart
on how to use them.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.900
So mushrooms are often used--

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.050
for most people, they're
used in like pizza or pasta

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.730
or something like a
very narrow focus.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.950
People mostly
focus on portobello

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.600
and like cremini type mushrooms.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.090
Maybe shiitake.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.830
And shiitake is a good mushroom.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.210
But a lot of these culinary
mushrooms are not that good.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.130
They grow on the ground.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.630
And they're not
that nutrient dense.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.400
They're kind of
like mass produced.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.350
Think of like your
normal culinary mushrooms

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.610
almost like iceberg
lettuce versus arugula.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.750
There's nothing wrong
with iceberg lettuce.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.260
But clearly, nettle or
dandelion or arugula

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.620
has a lot more punch.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.470
And the same with mushrooms.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:27.750
And when we talk generally about
mushrooms, it's like anything.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.750
It's like you have really good,
really average, and then really

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.532
bad things.

00:13:31.532 --> 00:13:33.615
And that's where actually
my company Four Sigmatic

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:34.260
also stems.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.100
It's just geeky out of math.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.370
So if you take all
the world's foods.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.370
There's roughly like, let's say,
1.8 million things you can eat.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.920
And if you put it
on a bell curve

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.790
and compare the
nutrient density,

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.165
it'll form a normal
distribution.

00:13:46.165 --> 00:13:48.540
And this is normally science,
including natural sciences.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.165
If you take a large
enough sample size,

00:13:50.165 --> 00:13:54.270
you look at single variable--
like how tall are people?

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.915
Or what is their IQ?

00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:57.540
It tends to form a
normal distribution.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.890
The foods are the same.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.840
And if you look at
their nutrient density,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.970
most foods are
just normal, good.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.610
Some are like
solid health foods.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.970
And then some foods
are kind of bad, right?

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.080
And if you go four standard
deviations, which are sigmas,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.520
if we go four
standard deviations,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.580
you get to the top 50
foods in the world.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.800
And out of those
top 50 foods, there

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.680
are things like lemon, black
pepper, cinnamon, coconut,

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.620
green tea, cacao,
things that you know.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.050
Then there's foods that you
might know, like turmeric,

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.747
or ginseng, or maca.

00:14:29.747 --> 00:14:31.830
And then there's really
foods that very few people

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.520
know, like the reishi
mushroom or astragalus root.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.600
And I'm just passionate
about the things

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.505
that are the most currently
scientifically studied foods.

00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:41.130
And funny enough,
those tend to be also

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.170
the foods that have
been used the longest

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.860
throughout different cultures.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.600
So every part of the world
tends to have their own foods

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.770
that they've elevated to
kind of a sacred status

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.060
over multiple generations.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.130
And every generation
after that has

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.080
thought that that food is
special for some reason.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.020
So if you go to
Bali or Costa Rica

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.450
or you go to Finland and
Russia or you go to Africa,

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.330
you'll find certain foods
are elevated over others.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.080
And that's what I'm
most passionate about.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.390
And out of those 50,
about 10 are mushrooms.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.380
That's our farm where I grew up.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.330
And I think besides the health
benefits of mushrooms, the one

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.310
thing that I really
want to leave you today

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.400
with is just
generally about what

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.200
it takes to do something new.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.055
I feel like the topic was like
how to go from dirt to gold.

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:32.680
And I think that's
the lesson that I've

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.130
learned over the years of coming
from a small farm in Finland

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.370
to Venice Beach, California
and building a business

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.160
and creating companies, like
understanding that in order

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.730
to create value
or capture value,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:51.190
you have to see
undervalued things.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:56.650
So any form of business, be it
investing or something else,

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.730
you're trying to find an
asset or a thing that has more

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.950
value than other people think.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.170
You think the
stock is worth $10,

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.210
but the market thinks it's $5.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:07.993
You buy it at $5.

00:16:07.993 --> 00:16:09.910
You think eventually the
market will know it's

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.830
worth $10, right?

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.160
The same with if you start a
business or you have an idea,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.010
you try to find something
that others don't yet see,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.560
or they see it, but they don't
understand the true value

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.970
and power of it.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.108
So probably, let's say,
Google in the early days,

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.650
there were people who thought,
oh, a search engine has value,

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:27.150
right?

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.330
It's some value.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.220
But then people
didn't see what's

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.650
the implications of
having that value

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.330
and how you can transport
it to other factors.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.430
And then investors of Google
probably made good profit

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.910
by seeing that it was
an undervalued asset.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:47.040
So I'm from a town of
maybe like 150 people.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.300
And I'm there-- like I
didn't travel growing up.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.090
And my dream is to get
Americans drinking mushrooms.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.820
That's a pretty
radical idea, right?

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.162
So it's like I came here.

00:16:57.162 --> 00:16:58.120
I started the business.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.170
And I told everyone.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.840
It was like, hey, I want to
get the whole America drinking

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.790
mushrooms, because that's the
most ancient way of actually

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.082
consuming these tree mushrooms.

00:17:05.082 --> 00:17:06.393
And I know there are benefits.

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:07.810
And people are
like, you're crazy.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.690
Nobody drinks
mushrooms around here.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.130
But I believed in it, which
is one of the three tips

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.859
I want to leave you guys today
with from the business side.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.010
If you want to
achieve anything, you

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.339
have to be super passionate
about it and believe in it.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.589
And the second thing is that
hopefully whatever you do

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.300
is based on some
first principles.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.640
With me, with science,
understanding the research

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.800
around mushrooms,
understanding their history,

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.050
and their culture implications,
and also understanding

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.120
how to prepare them.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.170
So you can't just make up stuff.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.040
It needs to be based on some
sort of like first principle

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.990
or a logic.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:50.320
And then, finally, as you
start building the business,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.300
remembering why you started it.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.010
I was a couple of
weeks ago in Lapland

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.900
with a bunch of friends.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.710
It was minus 39 degrees,
and it went to frozen water.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:00.880
It's actually below.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.080
It's like 25 degrees.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.480
There's a stream that
keeps the water open.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.410
This is the culture--

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.540
why I started the business
is the Finnish culture,

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.060
and the culture of
like natural living.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.150
And then I moved to California
to build the business,

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.250
and sometimes the life
here is not as natural

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.780
as it was at a farm.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.050
But it's really important for
me as I go to remind myself

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.190
why I started the business.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.850
This is the Sami culture.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:29.470
This is the only indigenous
culture in Europe, partly

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.670
in Finland as well.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.710
And how they use mushrooms
is one of the sources

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:33.800
of inspiration for me.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.592
And here's examples of
products that we do,

00:18:35.592 --> 00:18:39.880
like mushroom coffee,
mushroom chocolate, lattes,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.870
wellness tonics.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.812
And one of the
reasons why we do this

00:18:43.812 --> 00:18:45.520
is that mushrooms,
the healthy mushrooms,

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.140
don't taste anything
like portobello.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.730
They actually taste very bitter.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.790
And most Americans
don't like bitter.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.850
So when I came here and
I made like mushroom tea,

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.183
people were like, this is gross.

00:18:54.183 --> 00:18:55.480
First of all, I don't like tea.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.543
Secondly, I don't
like this flavor.

00:18:57.543 --> 00:18:59.710
So I had to kind of reverse
engineer and figure out,

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.230
what are the bitters that
Americans like or most

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.370
Anglo-Saxon cultures like?

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.000
And I figured out there's only
a couple, coffee and chocolate.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.530
Black coffee and
dark chocolate were

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.947
some of the only
bitters that were

00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:11.590
commonly available to people.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.140
So using those palettes
and those delivery systems

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.470
is incorporating
into people's lives.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:23.740
But to kind of recap, here are
some of the books I've written.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.260
One about the history
of the Sami people, one

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.800
a cookbook how to use mushrooms,
and about the top 10 mushrooms.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.597
But to recap kind of
my talk is I believe

00:19:34.597 --> 00:19:35.680
in the power of mushrooms.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.800
I think they're an organism
much smarter than we realize.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.710
I think they're undervalued.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.722
And that's why I'm
also excited to build

00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:44.680
a business around them.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.900
I believe a lot in
their power for myself,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.400
but also, I believe,
that you should

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.890
focus on doing something
that is undervalued

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.270
and getting people to
understand the value,

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.350
then that's also smart business.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.470
I think if you want to
learn more about mushrooms,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.387
there's a lot of resources
that you can go to.

00:20:01.387 --> 00:20:06.670
I can highlight a few
books and learning methods

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.120
how you can learn about them.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.980
And I think in
the next 10 years,

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.790
we'll see multiple different
research coming out

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.530
for mushrooms for
health benefits,

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.750
for cognitive function,
for the immune system,

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.790
that I think will
shock a lot of people.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.280
And that gets me
excited every day

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.890
to start building Four Sigmatic.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.980
But with that, if you have
any questions about the health

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:31.670
benefits on Four Sigmatic
or the mushrooms in general,

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.755
if you have questions on
anything mushroom related,

00:20:35.755 --> 00:20:37.025
I'm happy to take it.

00:20:37.025 --> 00:20:38.420
AUDIENCE: Is this
the microphone?

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.698
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yeah.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.240
AUDIENCE: This isn't
about mushrooms.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.805
But snails eat mushrooms.

00:20:44.805 --> 00:20:46.430
Does that mean snails
are healthy, too?

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.638
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yes and no.

00:20:52.638 --> 00:20:53.930
Not because they eat mushrooms.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.290
That's not the reason.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.590
So there are sort of
mammals that eat mushrooms;

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.470
bears, deer, rabbits.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.270
There's certain insects
that eat mushrooms.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.740
That doesn't mean
that that's why

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.710
that species is good for you.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.780
But I would say,
generally, we're

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.900
very focused as a culture on
large mammals that have flesh.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.960
This is a complete
separate topic from health.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.203
We're really obsessed about just
eating a few types of animals.

00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:20.120
So the classic debate
is, should I eat animals

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.830
or should I not eat animals?

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.330
But often, it's
coming from the lens

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:27.410
of eating mostly large mammals
that are very domesticated that

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.060
are almost always female.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.950
We almost only eat women.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.380
So we don't eat bull.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.240
We eat the cow.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.560
We don't eat like a boar.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.270
We eat the female.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.080
Chicken, the same.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.500
We don't eat the rooster.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.770
We eat very highly
processed animals.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.110
And we don't even eat the
whole piece of that animal.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.060
We mostly focus
on the flesh part

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.450
versus like the liver and the
eyeballs and all the things

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.000
that most people think is gross.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.990
It's actually like
really nutrient dense.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.472
And a lot of insects
and smaller animals

00:21:56.472 --> 00:21:58.430
tend to be healthier,
actually, because they're

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.550
lower in the food chain.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.900
So you tend to be like the
lower you are in the food chain,

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.950
and early you are,
the cleaner it is.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.830
Or if you go further
in the food chain

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.183
and you go to bigger
animals or even bigger fish,

00:22:09.183 --> 00:22:11.100
you have to be more
careful about the quality.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.680
So it's usually safer to eat
a small fish than a big fish,

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.570
but you really
have to know where

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.903
the big fish is coming from.

00:22:15.903 --> 00:22:17.570
But it's not because
they eat mushrooms.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.950
That's why snails are healthy.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:19.980
They just are.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.048
Can you pass the mic?

00:22:24.048 --> 00:22:25.090
AUDIENCE: Can I throw it?

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.670
TERO ISOKAUPPILA:
You can throw it.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.512
Thanks for the talk.

00:22:29.512 --> 00:22:30.470
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yeah.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.110
AUDIENCE: You raised the
point about bitterness.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:39.650
I was just wondering, have you
found yourself compromising

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.710
the healthiness of the
mushrooms by like adding sugar

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.037
at any point?

00:22:45.037 --> 00:22:47.620
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yeah, most of
our products don't have sugar.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.690
And I don't really
believe in adding sugar,

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.068
especially processed sugar.

00:22:51.068 --> 00:22:53.360
We have a couple products
that have coconut palm sugar,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.610
about 2 grams per serving.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.360
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.580
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: And coconut
palm sugar is a lot healthier.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.510
It has more minerals.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.910
And is more kind of
diabetic friendly.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.650
But I don't believe
in adding sugar.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.950
We use things like monk fruit
and stevia in certain products

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.935
and certain products
are unsweetened.

00:23:07.935 --> 00:23:09.310
It's kind of this
healthy balance

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.860
of knowing where the
market is, and knowing

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.468
where you want to get to, and
kind of like bridging the gap.

00:23:15.468 --> 00:23:17.260
So let's assume you
want really technology.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.190
I'm from Finland.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:23.050
We love like MySQL and
Linux, and all this stuff.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.270
Linux never really got
big, except in servers,

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.630
just partly because the
user interface was not

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.600
the easiest to use.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.290
Or even Nokia, where our
farm is, is I think of Nokia

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.625
leading that mobile technology.

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:37.750
And then Apple taking over.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.375
And it's partly
because Apple is just--

00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:41.920
the iPhone is just so much
easier to use for most people,

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.430
right?

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.890
And Nokia's were always not.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.180
And the same here.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.155
My dream is to get here,
but consumers are here.

00:23:49.155 --> 00:23:50.530
How do I meet them
in the middle?

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.780
How do I make a product that is
a little more bitter than what

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.060
they're used to, a little
less sweet, a little less

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.090
artificial, still healthy.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.090
But I kind of meet them.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.160
Because without compliance,
there's no change.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.880
There's no-- like you can
buy a pass to the gym,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.590
but if you never go,
it doesn't help you.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.670
So I'd rather do a shitty
workout than no workout.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:11.030
So in this case, the same thing.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:16.120
But yeah, I wouldn't add
much sugar or any sugar

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.000
to these products,
because I think

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.040
it jeopardizes the
main function, which

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.350
is kind of being more
like anti-inflammatory

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.830
and protecting
the immune system.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.250
And when you add these
sugars and sweeteners,

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.110
you can kind of do the opposite.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.970
Mushrooms can also
balance blood sugar

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.950
and support blood
sugar management.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.370
So when you kind of do that,
it kind of counterbalances

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.310
the benefit.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that was great.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.320
Thanks.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.278
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yeah.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.920
AUDIENCE: So I've heard
formulating new products

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.980
and bringing them to market
is like a multi-year process.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.530
And it takes a lot of
R&amp;D and energy resources.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.760
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Sure.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.343
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious if you have

00:24:54.343 --> 00:24:55.510
a lot of different products.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.860
I keep seeing new stuff you
produce quite regularly.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.767
How long is your design process?

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:05.100
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: By the way,
thank you for asking that.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.748
You're the first
person to ever ask it.

00:25:06.748 --> 00:25:08.290
I'm very passionate
about this topic.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.935
So I'm like the product founder.

00:25:09.935 --> 00:25:11.310
So if we would be
a tech company,

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.250
I would be like loving
to make the code myself.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.870
And I'm like this
is really a topic

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.273
that I could talk for days.

00:25:17.273 --> 00:25:17.940
So you're right.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.180
Most people take multiple
years to build a product.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.790
For us, my goal is two months.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.050
Realistically, we're at three.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.830
But it's still drastically
shorter than for most people.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.580
And that requires a
few fundamental things

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.370
to be in place to
innovate so quickly.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.598
So obviously, like sourcing
ingredients, any ingredients

00:25:35.598 --> 00:25:38.140
that you're going to use, you
have to be really good at that.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.980
So you have to have a baseline
infrastructure of like, hey,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.390
where do you get products?

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.670
But that's still like
somewhat easy to solve,

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.380
where most even
large companies take

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.060
years to develop a product.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.518
And they don't succeed with it.

00:25:49.518 --> 00:25:51.060
And I think one of
the key things why

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.480
we've been successful in a
short while building products is

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.690
a couple of fundamental
things that I think

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:01.660
is transferable to any industry,
any product, any situation.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.550
First of all, being close
to the end consumer.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.640
A lot of people who-- especially
large companies try to create

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.080
products from an ivory tower.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.473
They send out surveys
and focus groups

00:26:12.473 --> 00:26:14.640
and whatever trying to
figure out, what's the trend?

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.140
They read reports.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.600
And I think they're
already from then

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.990
they're behind the
curve versus everyday

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.060
engaging with the
consumer, and knowing

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.580
what's out on the market,
and listening to their needs

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.480
and wishes.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.132
So we do tons of community
work in person to meet people,

00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:33.090
to talk with them, and
being in that interface.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.800
So whatever you're
trying to build,

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.800
the more time you can
spend or actually even

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.360
be the consumer, who--

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.700
I think I am as well-- is
everyday using these products

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.490
myself, the easier the R&amp;D is.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.580
And the more removed you are
from the end consumer, target

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.900
consumer, or the
lifestyle, or the industry,

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.200
whatever, the
harder it is, right?

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.360
Sometimes you can get
too close to it, yes.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.100
But nevertheless, like the
closer you are to interface.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.938
So I could come out with 20
to 30 product ideas in an hour

00:27:01.938 --> 00:27:04.230
just by looking at my own
lifestyle and different parts

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.370
of my day, week,
month, year, and figure

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.550
out where the gaps are where
I need optimal performance.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.480
So where do I need a boost,
an enhance, a support.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.070
And it would be so easy.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.720
And then you kind of
pick your battles.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.130
What is easy to execute?

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.660
What has big upside?

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.240
And then the other thing
that very few people

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.500
have besides the customer
proximity or the customer

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.050
interface with
products is that they

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.420
think they have to be right.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.150
And I think even our best
products, our currently

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.120
best-selling products, have gone
through multiple iterations.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.070
And I think if you
remove your ego,

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.770
and you just have,
hey, I have a thesis.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:47.490
This is what I hope to get;
eye health, gut health.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.810
I think most people,
their gut is messed up

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.810
because of A, B, and C.
And this time of the day

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:52.920
they need support.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.360
Hey, this is my idea.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.520
Let's bring this, like
make healthy lemonade,

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.820
whatever it is.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.550
And then you try
to innovate for it.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.890
And then you come with
the concept to the market.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.030
You let people try it.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.410
They give you feedback.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.310
And then you iterate.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.960
Most large companies,
especially they

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.900
want to get the product to
be so good from the get go.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.300
And probably Gmail
or something like

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.000
that has gone through
seemingly, so similar,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.940
gone through hundreds or
thousands of iterations

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.020
over the years, right?

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.633
And that's just how it is.

00:28:20.633 --> 00:28:22.800
And I think most people try
to get a perfect product

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.988
from the beginning.

00:28:23.988 --> 00:28:25.030
And that's a big failure.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.610
So we have a big
direct to consumer

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.530
business, besides
the retail business

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.790
with Whole Foods, and
Erewhon, and Sephora

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.440
and whoever we work with.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.080
But with that online
kind of like email

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.740
list and our community, we can
test products really quickly.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.640
And within like 30 days, we
saw how many people bought it.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.780
We can send them a survey--

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.822
ask them what they think.

00:28:46.822 --> 00:28:49.560
In 45 days to 60 days, we know
how many people of those repeat

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.060
purchased.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.310
And then we already have a
good baseline understanding

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.560
on how to make it better.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.380
So being really
close to the customer

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.550
and not being scared to fail,
or be ready to iterate-- like we

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.560
assume that we will
not get it right.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.980
And we assume that we need
to tweak it and amend it

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.480
over the--

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.300
and we also assume that some of
them, like half the products,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.220
will be discontinued
at some point.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.200
You're more likely to
create more innovation

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.360
versus if you're
always scared to fail,

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.390
then you're kind of frozen,
and you try to perfect it.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.430
So I don't know if that helped.

00:29:25.602 --> 00:29:27.060
AUDIENCE: I got
here a little late.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.230
So I don't know if you
covered this already.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.397
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: That's OK.

00:29:29.397 --> 00:29:32.250
AUDIENCE: What was some
of your biggest challenges

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.370
to like growth in
the early stages?

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.920
Like getting your
first customer,

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.920
what did that look like?

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.360
What did you-- what should
you have spent more time on?

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.568
What should you
have deprioritized?

00:29:43.568 --> 00:29:45.610
I guess getting through
that initial hurdle where

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.162
no one knows who Four
Sigmatic is, suddenly

00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:50.370
you have your first customer.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.670
What does that look like?

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.800
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Sure So I
started the company in Europe,

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.342
and then when I
brought it to the US.

00:29:55.342 --> 00:29:57.880
So I kind of had to go
twice through the process.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.130
When I was first getting the
first customer in Europe,

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.922
and then I came to the
US, and nobody cares

00:30:01.922 --> 00:30:03.190
about what you did in Europe.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.875
Americans just
don't care at all.

00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:06.250
So you kind of
have this restart.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.830
So when I started in Europe,
it was actually really easy

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.270
for me to get the
first customers,

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.097
because I was in that industry.

00:30:12.097 --> 00:30:13.180
And I had tons of friends.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.860
So the first 50
or 100 people, it

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.082
was just like friends, people I
knew, which is really valuable,

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:20.290
because you could really
get feedback really quickly.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.880
But it was a lot
harder to scale.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.100
So in Europe, it was easier
to get initial traction,

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.810
but then harder to scale for us.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.900
And some of the things I spent
a lot of time focusing on

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.600
is the ingredient and sourcing,
which is like the geeking

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.590
out part.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.950
And unfortunately, most
consumers don't care.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.700
But it was important
for me to know that I

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.340
have the best raw materials.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.927
I don't regret it, but it
definitely took a lot longer.

00:30:41.927 --> 00:30:44.260
The second thing is that I
didn't raise venture funding.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.500
I didn't have capital.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.090
So even if you had success, just
by not having a lot of cash,

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.520
you have to kind really
slowly chip away.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.500
And that was a big
hurdle, having patience,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.458
because as an entrepreneur,
you want everything

00:30:55.458 --> 00:30:58.180
to happen overnight, and
just crush it and kill it.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.322
And when you didn't
have cash, and you

00:31:00.322 --> 00:31:02.530
had a big dream of getting
people to drink mushrooms,

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.810
and nobody drank mushrooms,
it was like really hard.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.100
So having patience.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.780
And then figuring
out how to scale.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.700
I had initial traction,
but how to scale

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.530
was really difficult
in the beginning.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.410
And then if I say
something other than that,

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.850
it's like the
flavor was something

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.200
that we focused a lot on.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.480
And if you don't have a food
or beverage product, just

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.880
the user, ease of
user experience

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.280
is kind of maybe the touchpoint.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.120
I was so obsessed with the
technology and the ingredients

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.300
versus not enough with the
flavor and the ease of use

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.500
straight out of the gates.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.208
And then when I came
to US, the challenge

00:31:37.208 --> 00:31:38.410
was being an immigrant.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.070
I have lived in
multiple countries,

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.862
but this is the only
country where I really

00:31:41.862 --> 00:31:43.930
felt like it was hard
to open a bank account.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:49.100
Everything was so difficult.
And that took a lot of time.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.753
And it was harder here to
get the initial traction,

00:31:51.753 --> 00:31:53.920
but then when it scaled,
it scaled more beautifully.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.410
There's just one language,
one currency, versus Europe

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.360
is multiple
languages, multiple--

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.810
it's legally just a hassle.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.830
The US, it was just
easier to scale.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.780
And I'd already thought
about that scaling.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.900
And what I would have hoped
I would focus even more on

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.390
is the thing that people
think we did really well,

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.200
but I just think you can
never do it well enough is

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.097
storytelling and community.

00:32:16.097 --> 00:32:17.680
And if you ask people
in the industry,

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.810
they often know that we
build an awesome community.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.240
But I wish I would have
even doubled down on that,

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.135
and maybe focused a
little less on kind

00:32:25.135 --> 00:32:29.800
of the minutia of
just like retailers

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.540
and caring about
the industry stuff.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.840
The B2B stuff, I should have
focused even less on, and even

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.130
more doubled down on
community and storytelling,

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.610
and get those made even better.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.750
AUDIENCE: So I want to sort
of silo in on one point there.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.130
So what would you say
was your best growth

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.870
channel in that early stage?

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.010
Was it content?

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.500
Was it building a community?

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.940
Was it Instagram?

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.270
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Oh, yeah.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:55.770
OK.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:59.253
So purely growth
marketing-wise, our success--

00:32:59.253 --> 00:33:01.420
because we didn't have
money, and I couldn't do any.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.010
So there's three types of media.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.440
There's paid, owned, and earned.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.780
We mostly killed it with the
earned and through influencers.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.780
It's because your favorite
health influencer's

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.020
favorite influencer probably
used our products, still today.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.700
If you think of the
person you go to

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.600
in health advice, whoever
they go to for health advice

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.740
use our products.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.250
And through that we have
this constant credibility

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.470
and support from people
that really matter.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.830
And that helped us
grow into one phase.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.980
And then soon after
that, we started

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.420
winning with like podcasts.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.010
That was a big thing for us.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.770
It's because podcast
allowed long-form content.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.130
Our topic is not easy.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:44.200
It's not bullet-sizable.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.982
You can't sell it easily on a
20-second, 50-second Instagram

00:33:49.982 --> 00:33:51.190
story or something like that.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.550
It requires deeper
explaining, and trust.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.860
It was like, hey, mushroom
coffee sounds gross.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.550
I definitely don't
want to try that.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.670
But if somebody you
trust says, it actually

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:01.960
doesn't taste like mushrooms.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.310
And it makes me feel awesome.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.112
You should try it.

00:34:04.112 --> 00:34:05.320
You're more likely to try it.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.340
So on the kind of second
wave long-form content

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.690
really worked well for us.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.840
Predominately
podcasts, but also long

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.139
email marketing blog posts,
other educational forms,

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.030
but especially podcasts was--

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:21.550
I think still podcast
is so undervalued

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:26.237
as a form of growth way
for any product or service.

00:34:26.237 --> 00:34:27.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:30.374 --> 00:34:32.374
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I found
out through Tim Ferriss.

00:34:32.374 --> 00:34:32.960
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Oh, cool.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.932
Yeah.

00:34:33.932 --> 00:34:35.500
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious how-- you

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.510
were talking about
sourcing, and then

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:43.190
you also mentioned how large
scale mushroom production

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.409
kind of lost its nutrition.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:46.969
And then I was also
thinking about--

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:51.469
I've read that truffle
production is down about 99%

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:54.739
over the last 100 years
due to too much harvesting

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:55.699
of wild truffles.

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:59.850
And they're hard to grow
and mycorrhizal and whatnot.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:04.250
So how do you view sourcing
and maintaining quality

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.373
and the sustainability thereof?

00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:09.540
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yeah,
definitely, again, a topic--

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.590
thanks for asking.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.480
I don't think a lot of
people focus on that.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.490
There's a lot of foods
that have become popular.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.130
Let's say, chia seeds
or maca, and then

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.100
suddenly people are like, we
can't actually produce that.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.560
The internet kind of made
a few things really popular

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.807
really quickly, and agriculture
is a slow moving thing.

00:35:24.807 --> 00:35:26.390
It's like it doesn't
change overnight.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.850
You can't just-- physical
agriculture doesn't-- you

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:29.540
can't just--

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.740
it takes a long time.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.108
And farmers usually are
risk averse a little bit.

00:35:33.108 --> 00:35:35.150
It's like they're not
going to change their plans

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:39.230
because Instagram influencers
want to sell chia seeds

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.290
or something like that.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.150
So with mushrooms, about 1/3 of
our mushrooms are wild-crafted.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.280
2/3 are grown on logs.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.830
And the wild-crafting
is the harder part.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:50.750
And the log growing
is the easier part,

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:54.770
because it's a super good yield.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.440
So $1 per square
feet is really high.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.410
So you take trees that are
already dead, because that's

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.790
their natural habitat.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.880
A lot of these mushrooms grow
on dead or decaying trees.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.660
You drill a hole.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.460
You put a spore in.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.795
It will grow mushroom that you
can-- for that square foot,

00:36:09.795 --> 00:36:10.920
you can get a lot of money.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.450
So there is-- that part is
a little easier, especially

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.160
when you talk to
people who understand

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.650
what mushrooms to grow.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.212
And mushrooms are extremophile,
so they grow really easily.

00:36:20.212 --> 00:36:21.920
You just give them
the right environment.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.140
So that 2/3 part was easy.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.210
Wild-crafting was the
harder part, right?

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.835
Because you have to
actually-- somebody

00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:30.140
needs to go to the forest
and pick up a piece of chaga

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.040
to get this.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.560
And I could talk
for this for hours.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.020
The one benefit we had is
Finland is a small country,

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.075
but it's bordering--

00:36:37.075 --> 00:36:38.450
I used to have
one of the biggest

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.090
economic borders in the world
between Finland and Russia.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.860
And Russia, starting
from Finland,

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.060
they happen to have the
largest forest in the world,

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.560
called taiga, T-A-I-G-A.
And that's a forest the size

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.760
of the United States.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.760
So one forest, the size of
the United States, right?

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.650
And that forest is predominantly
perfect for a birch tree

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.420
that happens to grow chaga.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.820
And it happens to grow
pretty much everywhere.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.250
And you just need to kind
of know where it grows,

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.180
and how to collect it.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.750
But it's more like
education on harvesters,

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.340
and telling them where to
get it and how to get it.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.428
That was like operationally
a little bit more difficult.

00:37:15.428 --> 00:37:16.970
But yeah, it takes
a lot of thinking,

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.070
and most people
don't focus on it.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.177
They just read on a blog that
acai berry is good for you.

00:37:22.177 --> 00:37:23.510
And then, let's say, acai berry.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.910
And they don't ever think
about the supply chain

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.790
until they're much
later in the process.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:31.430
And even with collagen
right now, there's like--

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.490
most collagen brands, they don't
have enough collagen to sell,

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.260
because collagen
has become popular.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.385
And I don't know if you
know how you make collagen,

00:37:38.385 --> 00:37:42.440
but you basically usually boil
like the hides and the bones,

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.930
and you kind skimp the
cream from the top.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.760
And it's like quite the process.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.220
And it was just a waste
product before, kind of.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:53.665
And now it's become like
every beauty person is trying

00:37:53.665 --> 00:37:55.040
to use collagen.
Every athlete is

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.230
trying to use collagen.
The demand just

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:58.650
went sky high in a few years.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.110
And people are like, hey, we
don't have enough of this.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.693
So now they have to
try to figure out,

00:38:02.693 --> 00:38:04.640
how else can we
produce collagen?

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.710
So yeah, most entrepreneurs
don't think about that.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.290
So thanks for asking that.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.123
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.320
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: I
love this, by the way.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.998
You can throw it.

00:38:15.998 --> 00:38:17.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks for your talk.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:17.995
It's been really interesting.

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:18.953
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yeah.

00:38:18.953 --> 00:38:21.610
AUDIENCE: How do you go
about picking which mushrooms

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:24.070
are going to end up in the
tea products or the coffee

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.030
products?

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.510
And how do you figure
out what the benefits are

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:32.800
that you can advertise
associated with the mushrooms

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.610
that you've picked?

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:34.568
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Sure.

00:38:34.568 --> 00:38:37.360
So that's actually easier
than with most food products

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.453
with mushrooms, because
you have to cook them,

00:38:39.453 --> 00:38:40.870
because they're
not available raw.

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.220
It's like a rock.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.320
There's a few outside
if you want to try them.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.820
So you have to cook them kind
of like you do bone broth.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.370
So you do this like decoction.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.110
So you cook it for a long time.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:53.380
And because you can control
the temperature and the amount

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.860
of mushrooms, you
can standardize

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.690
to a certain strength.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.390
So it's almost like
cooking it for days

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.840
to standardize it to a
certain strength of coffee.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.820
And it's a very
easy lab test just

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.440
to make you have a
strong enough tea.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.540
So some years you have
to use more mushrooms

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.000
than other times, and
sometimes you use less.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.220
Sometimes you have to
cook it longer or shorter.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.620
So you can just
control the process

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.630
to get a standardized output.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:21.167
So yeah, actually, that part
is quite easy to engineer.

00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:23.500
But you just need to-- sometimes
you put more mushrooms.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.910
So sometimes we're more
profitable than other times,

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:26.410
I guess.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:27.702
That's the other way to say it.

00:39:27.702 --> 00:39:30.952
Sometimes it costs more to make
that cup, and sometimes less.

00:39:30.952 --> 00:39:32.410
AUDIENCE: And then
for figuring out

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:37.330
what the health benefits are,
is that like historically based,

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:38.163
based on traditions?

00:39:38.163 --> 00:39:39.122
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yeah.

00:39:39.122 --> 00:39:40.930
And if I may comment
on that, that's

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.150
a common theme that I
hope us as consumers

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.290
will be more educated on.

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.360
We want everything standardized.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.190
And I don't think
nature works like that.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.380
Our product is
standardized, but I

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.990
would hope that we as
consumers can accept the fact

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.065
that sometimes the nutrient
density of a food we buy

00:39:56.065 --> 00:39:59.110
is higher or lower depending on
seasonality and what you eat.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.860
And I think us expecting
always to get the same flavor,

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.770
same result is forcing us
to eat actually worse food,

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.860
because then the producers have
to produce a product like that.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.840
The apple always
tastes the same.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.830
And nature doesn't
work like that.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:17.200
So if we're can accept
some variability in flavor

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.058
and nutrient density, as long as
we know the baseline sourcing,

00:40:21.058 --> 00:40:23.350
that would be actually better
for the world than always

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.720
expecting the chocolate
to taste exactly the same,

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.090
because even chocolate
has seasonal variety.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.340
But to your second question
about nutrient density.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:35.270
So the benefit of
mushrooms is that about 40%

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.740
of pharmaceuticals
use mushrooms.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.820
So there's a lot of research
funding for fungal research.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.100
Unfortunately, there's not
a lot of research funding

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.390
for whole foods.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:48.292
So of all foods, even let's
say blueberry, which is people

00:40:48.292 --> 00:40:50.000
generally-- everybody
knows it's healthy.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.500
And it's been a long time.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.340
It's researched.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.830
There isn't that much
research on blueberries.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.330
Because who would fund that?

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.665
There's no economic interest
on blueberry research.

00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.040
If somebody
researched blueberry,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.910
they want to isolate a compound,
an anthocyanin in the blueberry

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.880
that is good for
eyesight, and then we'll

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.480
brand it as the
Alaskan anthocyanin,

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.730
and then we'll put it in
supplements and sell it.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.180
So whole food
research by and large

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.940
is so limited versus
something that you can patent,

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.500
because you can't
patent whole foods.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.120
But lucky luck,
because mushrooms,

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.530
there is a lot more of them.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.050
I would recommend if you want
to look at any food product,

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.080
PubMed is kind of a database
for various research.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.240
You can put the Latin
name of any food.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.530
You can get roughly
the amount of research.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.920
The fact that there is
5,000 research papers

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.505
doesn't mean it's healthy.

00:41:35.505 --> 00:41:37.130
The most researched
fruits in the world

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.640
are tobacco, number one,
and marijuana, number two.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.265
Soon after that you get to
things like lemon and ginseng

00:41:43.265 --> 00:41:44.390
and other things like that.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.950
So it doesn't guarantee
if something is well

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:47.908
researched that it is
healthy, but it gives you

00:41:47.908 --> 00:41:50.060
a pretty good oversight
of what it is good for.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.120
Mushrooms, shiitake,
reishi, things like that

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.347
are very well studied.

00:41:55.347 --> 00:41:56.930
So you look at their
general research,

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.140
and you figure out that they're
good for like maintaining

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.280
blood glucose levels.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.900
They're good for gut health.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.580
You kind of like give oversight.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.670
And then we make, first,
just to be safe side,

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:08.750
we make puffery claims.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.880
So instead of
saying that you will

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.100
be smarter when you
consume our products,

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.490
we say, hey, this is like
a hug from your grandma.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:19.100
And then you can do the rest.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.920
But yeah, it's baseline
on just hard science

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.550
on a genus of anything.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.650
And then looking at what
it is generally good for,

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.780
how well it's researched,
who researched it,

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.350
how they researched it.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:35.340
And then you kind of try to
apply it into a food product.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.820
But yeah, I mean,
just unfortunately,

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.540
there just isn't a lot
of whole food research.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.890
You can't own that research.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:43.773
You can't patent it.

00:42:43.773 --> 00:42:44.440
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.898
TERO ISOKAUPPILA:
It's a challenge.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.330
Throw it.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.090
AUDIENCE: There's one
if you want to ask.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.360
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to know
about your mushroom diet.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.987
How do you use these products?

00:42:57.987 --> 00:42:59.570
And what kind of
mushrooms do you use?

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:00.710
And how do you cook them?

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.050
And all that kind of stuff.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.700
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: So I don't
answer that question partly

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.980
ever, including I
don't answer how I eat,

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.593
because people want a shortcut.

00:43:08.593 --> 00:43:10.760
And how I eat is not
necessarily how you should eat.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.468
Or how I use mushrooms
is not necessarily

00:43:12.468 --> 00:43:13.940
how you should use mushrooms.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.940
Also, how I use mushrooms
in February 2019

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.820
is not necessarily
I'll use them in March.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.190
March is a busier month
for me than February.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.980
So maybe when I'm busy, I
have to use different things

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.800
to support my busy
lifestyle, right?

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.575
I had that one
slide somewhere here

00:43:30.575 --> 00:43:34.310
to give you a rough
idea of time frame.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:37.670
So generally speaking,
you don't necessarily

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:40.430
want caffeine in the morning,
because your cortisol already

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.000
spikes.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.010
A lot of people
love it as a method.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.290
But you naturally
should be energetic.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.590
You should probably go outside.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.382
Get some fresh air.

00:43:47.382 --> 00:43:48.660
Maybe move a little bit.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.850
But you want to hydrate.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.380
And you probably
want antioxidants,

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.750
like a shield, a body
guard for the day.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:57.320
So mushrooms like
chaga and shiitake

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.120
that have a lot of SOD,
Superoxide Dismutase.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.060
It's this super antioxidant.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.970
Using things like that might
be really good for the day

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.420
to kind of get started.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.230
And then in the afternoon when
you need a little pick-me-up,

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.180
using something like
a Lion's Mane that

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.670
boosts cognitive function,
or using something

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.220
like cordyceps that gives
you energy without caffeine

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.620
or sugar might be a good
idea when you naturally

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.350
get that little dip
in the afternoon.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.110
The best scenario is you
taking a nap or siesta.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.210
But if that's not
possible because of work,

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:27.608
maybe try something like that.

00:44:27.608 --> 00:44:29.150
And then in the
evening time you want

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:33.320
things that support somehow
kind of a calming down process.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.115
So reishi is used for kind
of like the endocrine system.

00:44:37.115 --> 00:44:39.428
The [INAUDIBLE] acts as
kind of calming your body.

00:44:39.428 --> 00:44:40.970
It's known as the
Queen of Mushrooms.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.130
Maybe it'll help you
reach deeper sleep.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:46.290
And then shiitake could help
with phase 1 and 2 liver detox.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.505
That often happens overnight.

00:44:47.505 --> 00:44:49.130
So that might be a
good strategy if you

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:50.300
want to cleanse your liver.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.250
The liver is kind of a mirror
of the skin health as well.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.850
So there are different
times how you can use it.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:57.303
I just never answer
how I use it.

00:44:57.303 --> 00:44:58.970
You just have to
figure it out yourself.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:00.595
I know it's not the
answer people want,

00:45:00.595 --> 00:45:02.120
because they want a formula.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.462
Do A, B, and C. But maybe
that gives you some framework.

00:45:06.462 --> 00:45:08.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wasn't
looking for a formula.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.700
I was just curious
how you apply it.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.110
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: A lot.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.870
Different ways.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.740
And yeah.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.840
And high quality.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.460
That's my three formulas.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.963
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:21.963 --> 00:45:23.630
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: But
variety is useful.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:27.040
Even if you have an adaptogen
you can use everyday,

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.100
variety is awesome.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.130
So even with dark leafy greens,
even if arugula is awesome,

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:34.320
or dandelion is awesome,
try all kinds of greens,

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.820
and just kind of
mix and match them.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.820
The same with mushrooms.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.240
It's beneficial to
mix and match them.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.300
And so even though I'm
not a fan of portobello,

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.710
you can still have it.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:44.780
Just get different
varieties into your system.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.360
And the more variety you
have, the more intelligence

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.910
you're getting from food into
your cells and into your DNA.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:53.510
Yeah.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:54.177
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:45:54.177 --> 00:45:56.870
I might have missed this when
you were talking about scaling.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:02.820
But in terms of the timeline,
I was wondering what was the--

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.210
how long did it take for
you to go from zero--

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.570
or not zero, but
like a product idea

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.840
to get a packaged product
ready for the market?

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.260
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: It took
about two years the first time,

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.050
because you have to solve the
operational challenges, which

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.550
is harder for me than
the product concept.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.870
So the first time
sourcing ingredients,

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:26.720
getting a partner who can
make the packaging, that

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.330
took a lot longer than coming
out with the vision and the use

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:31.830
case.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.060
So that was easier for me.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.240
But maybe for another
founder, it's different.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.790
But if you've never done food
or beverage manufacturing,

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:40.130
I highly recommend
having patience

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.260
that it might take a lot
longer to actually get

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.070
the product produced
than you think.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.590
If you have a donut
that everybody--

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:46.820
all your neighbors
love your donut.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.545
And your friends and
family are saying,

00:46:48.545 --> 00:46:49.670
you should make this donut.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:50.610
It's a hit.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:51.620
It's a great donut.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:53.480
And then you figure out that
you've been making at home,

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.647
and now you need an
FDA-approved commercial kitchen,

00:46:55.647 --> 00:46:57.870
or a contract
manufacturer to make it,

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.360
it could take a lot
longer than you think.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.520
So it took about two years
to get the first version out,

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.930
partly it was my--

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:09.950
like not just-- me just not
knowing enough of the details.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.530
It probably takes about
a year normally just

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:14.173
to have every
paperwork in order.

00:47:14.173 --> 00:47:15.590
And for me, it
took two years just

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.173
because I didn't
know all the details.

00:47:17.173 --> 00:47:19.610
AUDIENCE: And did you have
to do most of it yourself?

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:22.377
Or are there like
contractors that

00:47:22.377 --> 00:47:23.960
do a bunch of different
steps for you?

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.377
TERO ISOKAUPPILA:
I had to do most

00:47:25.377 --> 00:47:27.020
with myself and
my founding team,

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.640
because nobody had
done what we did.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.130
Nobody had done a dual
extracted wild-crafted mushroom.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:32.202
Nobody had done it.

00:47:32.202 --> 00:47:33.410
So we had to figure that out.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:35.720
Nobody had done these
packaged mushroom beverages.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.520
They were sold in capsules,
or in big round bags.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.580
So I had to figure out
how to put these mushroom

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.550
powders in packets that look
almost like Emergen-C or a tea

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.200
bag that you can just pour
in a cup and add hot water.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.940
I had to figure out
that kind of stuff.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:49.930
And that was it.

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.510
But if you ever think of
doing a dietary supplement,

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.210
there's like hundreds of
companies that can help do it.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:56.890
If you want to make
a beverage yourself,

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.557
there's hundreds of
companies making it.

00:47:58.557 --> 00:48:02.890
I would just highly recommend,
don't outsource R&amp;D and IP

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.690
fully to someone ever.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:07.000
Even if you use their
resources for certain things,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.060
always have really engaged--

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.730
you or someone else in the team
really engaged in that process,

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.005
so you know, A, how it's done.

00:48:14.005 --> 00:48:15.880
So it's easier for you
to sell and market it,

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.330
because you know
it's like, hey, how

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.280
is this natural
orange flavor made?

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.960
Is it squeezed from an orange?

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.543
Or how do we get this orange
flavor into your product?

00:48:25.543 --> 00:48:27.460
That's like a question
somebody might ask you.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.470
So you know the answer.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.140
But secondly as well, it's like
then you own the technology.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.890
Because in food and
beverage, there really

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.700
isn't the same way code or
technology that you have in IT.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.202
So be really engaged.

00:48:38.202 --> 00:48:39.910
And there's definitely
a lot of resources

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.880
for beauty, skin care,
protein, food and beverage.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.590
Just for me, there
wasn't, because nobody

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.302
had done what we did.

00:48:46.302 --> 00:48:48.560
AUDIENCE: We have time
for one more question.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.435
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: OK.

00:48:49.435 --> 00:48:51.745
Last one.

00:48:51.745 --> 00:48:53.700
AUDIENCE: You're nervous
when it comes at you.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.200
You have to catch it.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:01.200
So you've talked about
mushrooms breathing and eating

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.103
and being a smarter food.

00:49:04.103 --> 00:49:05.520
Are you saying
that mushrooms have

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.390
like a type of consciousness
that is measurable?

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:12.640
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yes, that's
what I'm exactly saying.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.530
And you can measure it.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.180
And they've measured
it multiple times.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.760
They've put mushrooms in a
maze, and funnily enough,

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.080
the mushroom finds its
way out of the maze.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.600
They put mushrooms
to figure out how

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.020
to build the subway
system in Tokyo,

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.390
or actually the railway
system in the UK.

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:30.360
And the mushroom figured
out how to build a railway

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.430
system more efficient than
what humans had built.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.830
So yes, it is measurable.

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:37.650
I also think that the most
interesting intelligence

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.950
that mushroom have of
global consciousness

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:41.950
is not measurable.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.270
And we have no clue of it.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:45.090
And I think we will
not have a clue of it

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:46.800
for a long, long time.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.848
And that will be a whole other
talk about the consciousness

00:49:50.848 --> 00:49:51.390
of mushrooms.

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.490
But yes, I think
they're a higher being.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.460
I'm just leaving you with
a nugget, planting a seed.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.690
It's that mushrooms almost
always live with bacteria,

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:03.130
and bacteria almost always
lives with mushrooms.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:04.920
So right now in
your body, there's

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.690
about 10 times more
bacteria than you

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:07.890
have cells in your body.

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:09.900
And there's a lot of cells.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:14.130
And almost always this
bacteria lives with mushrooms.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:16.470
If you take kombucha,
it's a symbiotic organism.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:19.080
Basically, brewed black tea
with a little bit of sugar

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.090
that interacts with
bacteria and fungi.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:24.420
If you think of fermented foods,
sauerkraut, kimchi, whatever.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.370
And right now, we've
talked about how

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.760
your gut is your second
brain, or your first brain.

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.980
How we talk about
your gut instinct,

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.710
your spider sense, how
you just know something.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:37.500
You can't explain it in
words, but you feel it.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.580
You know it.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:42.000
And it's often related
to your gut biome,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.920
which is now a big
research topic,

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.420
and how that gut
biome is actually

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.890
tied into probiotics
and prebiotics,

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:51.210
and how those prebiotics live
with the bacterial kingdom

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:52.620
and the fungal kingdom.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.540
And they have knowledge that
we have yet to figure out.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.170
And I think that knowledge
is much greater than us.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:01.590
And they found mushrooms
growing at every level

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:02.760
of the atmosphere.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.920
Mushrooms can survive in space.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.920
So they've traveled a long
ways in different places.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.917
And I think I'll probably--

00:51:11.917 --> 00:51:13.500
I don't think during
my lifetime we'll

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.610
figure out that intelligence.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.200
But I do believe that
one of the things that

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.033
will happen during my
lifetime is we'll find

00:51:18.033 --> 00:51:20.400
the seventh kingdom in biology.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.160
I think there will be a new
kingdom that is not named yet.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.110
And that kingdom will
be somehow related

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:29.880
to the yeast or the
collaboration between bacteria

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.430
and fungi.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:33.252
And we'll figure out a new
kingdom lives on this planet.

00:51:33.252 --> 00:51:35.460
Because back in the day,
there were not six kingdoms.

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.468
There was two, and
then there were three,

00:51:37.468 --> 00:51:38.510
and then there were four.

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:39.473
There's five.

00:51:39.473 --> 00:51:40.140
Now there's six.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.790
And we think biology
has come to its end,

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:42.915
and there are six kingdoms.

00:51:42.915 --> 00:51:46.060
And I think-- my belief is
that we'll find a seventh one.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.500
And with that,
thanks for coming.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:52.770
And I appreciate you
sharing my knowledge.

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:54.990
AUDIENCE: And Tero,
really quickly,

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:58.712
where can people find you
and more about your product?

00:51:58.712 --> 00:51:59.670
TERO ISOKAUPPILA: Yeah.

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:02.340
We have a-- the easiest is
actually-- if you're here,

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.800
we have a shop on Abbot Kinney
called the Shroom Room that

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.360
serves free beverages.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.662
I know shit here at
Google is free as well.

00:52:08.662 --> 00:52:10.370
But if you want to
walk on Abbott Kinney,

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.950
you can get a free
mushroom tonic anytime.

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:17.170
We are also on all
social channels.

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:21.120
@FourSigmatic,
F-O-U-R-S-I-G-M-A-T-I-C.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.620
I'm a little bit
hard to find, but I

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.630
have a really bad
Instagram called IAmTero

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:27.600
that you can follow
my adventures.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.240
I post rarely, and randomly.

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.200
Sometimes good stuff.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.880
Sometimes not so good stuff.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.720
That's kind of where
you can find us.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.970
But stop by at Abbot Kinney.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.460
You can find us on Whole Foods,
Erewhon, different places,

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.990
here as well if
you want to buy it.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.120
Amazon.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.420
FourSigmatic.com.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.100
We'll figure it out.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.470
Anyway, thank you.

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:50.720
[APPLAUSE]
