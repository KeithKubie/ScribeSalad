&gt;&gt;Presenter: Welcome everybody. Before introducing
our, today's guest. I want you to picture

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:24.150
a different time. I want you to forget about
these; which hold a million or so gates on

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:36.570
them, called CPUs. I want you to think in
these terms. Vacuum tubes. This is probably

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.890
half a dozen logical gates in this module
alone.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.170
[pause]

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.750
Megabytes of memory, forget about that. We're
talking visible bits here. You're free to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.180
come later after the talk to see the bits.
Each single bit of memory.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.910
[pause]

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:19.670
And as far as input goes? Forget about this.
And get used to this. Patch panels.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:33.219
It is my distinct pleasure to introduce today
Kurt Beyer, who is going to transfer us to

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:44.749
this time of early pioneering computer science
giants, and take us on a little journey about

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:51.509
Grace Hopper, whom you all know about. So
let me just read a little bit about Kurt.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.549
So, Kurt grew up in a blue collar immigrant
family in Huntington, Long Island. Kurt's

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.920
dad Karl was a baker and his mum, Ann a nurse.
Kurt was a captain of the baseball and basketball

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.069
teams at John Glenn High School and an accomplished
trumpet player. And received his nomination

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.250
to the US Naval Academy from the late Senator
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.640
While at Annapolis Kurt played baseball and
in senior year, was named brigade commander.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.650
In charge of the 4500 person brigade of midmanship,
midshipman. He graduated Annapolis in 1990

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.180
and was commissioned an officer in the United
States Navy. Before attending flight school,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.080
Kurt continues his education at the University
of Oxford for 2 years. At Oxford he completed

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.300
a Master's degree and rowed for Oxford where
his crew competed in the finals of the Henley

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.410
Royal Regatta in 1991. He also played on the
university basketball team which won the British

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.590
university championship in 1992. Following
Oxford, Kurt headed to Pensacola for naval

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.030
flight school where he graduated first in
his class. Kurt flew F-14 Tomcats and was

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.220
assigned to a fighter's squadron at Naval
Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach. Injury

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.489
cut his naval career short and Kurt was honorably
discharged receiving a Navy Commendation medal

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.170
and National Defense Service Medal. In 1997
Kurt moved to California to convalesce and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.939
complete a PhD at the University of California;
Berkeley.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:40.120
Kurt really immersed himself in the Bay Area
Dot-Com revolution, co-founded a digital media

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.530
start-up, and married the beautiful fourth
generation San Franciscan.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.549
That's why it's important to move to California.
Listen to us guys, out there.

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.410
The tragedy of September 11 changed Kurt's
path and he returned to Annapolis as a civilian

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.549
professor to help create the Naval Academy's
new information technology major and lecture

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.719
regularly in the process of technological
innovation. He served on the academy faculty

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:14.819
3 and a half years and helped direct the international
scholarship program. During this period the

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.859
naval academy had the most British scholarship
winners of any American University, including

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:29.280
8 Rhodes, 3 Marshall and 4 Fitzgerald scholars.
In January 2006 Kurt returned to the San Francisco

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.710
area to head up full-time a digital media
start-up and co-author, multiple patents pending,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.170
on high speed digital data processing. Kurt
currently works at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.750
and advises start-ups and executives in Silicon
Valley. He lives in Mill Valley, California

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:56.100
with his wife Johanna and two sons Charlie
and Gus. Please welcome Kurt Beyer.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:07.140
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Thank You Boris. I'd also like everyone
to forget about Larry and Sergey and think

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:16.730
of a woman named Grace Hopper who actually
I feel is one of the key founders of the computer

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.730
industry. And also influenced the direction
of that industry. So I'm assuming in this

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:29.280
group people have heard of Grace Hopper. Great,
I see a lot of nods. Often times when I'm

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.820
giving talks I just get blank stares. And
those blank stares were actually one of the

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.030
reasons why I decided to write the book. I
first met Grace Hopper when I was 13years

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.440
old. I went to my sister's graduation from
the College of William and Mary.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.820
And Grace Hopper was the commencement speaker.
And I remember that day; 2 things really stuck

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:05.630
in my mind that day. One; I saw this old frail
woman; she looked like that in 1983, who was

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.840
sitting there knitting while the president
of the university was introducing her. And

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.660
I thought that was a little strange. And then
she stood up and I really thought; what am

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:24.440
I going to learn from this grandmotherly figure?
And she started talking about a technical

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.610
age that I couldn't even imagine at that time.
And that's really strange right? Usually your

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.080
grandmother is telling you about the past
and how hard it was in the past and how easy

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.800
you have it now. So Hopper was talking about
the future and a future that we would all

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.570
inherit one day. The next time I ran into
Admiral Hopper was plebe year, freshman year,

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.630
at the naval academy. And what was really
neat about my experience in the mid 80's at

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:02.370
the academy, is Grace Hopper arranged for
all incoming students to receive their own

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.780
computer. Which was a really big deal in the
1980's for an eighteen year old. We could

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.510
bring that computer up to our room, we could
plug it in to something called the Ethernet

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:19.340
which was connected to MILNET and we could
schedule our classes, email our professors,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.730
our medical or dental records were all digital.
And this was all in the 1980's. And she came

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.870
back to the academy and addressed my entire
class, and she said we're giving you these

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:38.190
tools so that you can help lead this digital
revolution. And so I never forgot that. When

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:46.560
I came to Silicon Valley in 1997 I was shocked
first of all, how everyone was telling me

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.490
how they were inventing this thing called
the Internet and the World Wide Web. And we're

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.940
going to be able to do things like have digital
medical records online, and email each other,

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.990
and I thought, you know, there's an 85 year
old woman that explained all that to me about

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:08.901
12 years ago. And I couldn't believe that
no-one had heard of this woman. So when I

00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:14.740
started researching the foundations of the
computer industry when I went back to the

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:26.071
naval academy, one thing that struck me was,
this woman, a much younger vibrant Grace Hopper

00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:34.149
who was responsible for so much. So I decided
to tell the story of that first 30 years through

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:45.439
her career.
It's hard to know when to start a book. Especially

00:08:45.439 --> 00:08:52.759
a book about an industry. Most people would
start with the most obvious thing. The first

00:08:52.759 --> 00:09:00.130
computer. And that didn't seem right, because
one, which computer do you pick? Is it an

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:05.529
English computer? Is it a US computer? Other
people would argue, well you can't start with

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:12.319
a computer; you have to go back to calculating
machines prior to that like Charles Babbage.

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:19.191
So I decided to start the book, not with a
piece of technology but with an event. My

00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:29.279
argument is that all radical technical change
needs some type of crisis to bring it on.

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:38.650
And so that crisis was December 7th 1941.
Within a week's attack of Pearl Harbor, you

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:46.110
saw the US government go to war, start changing
it's policy of research and development and

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:54.910
start funding exotic projects. Some of those
being in calculating machines. But these types

00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:03.889
of events also have an effect on the individual.
Think back to our own experience in 9/11.

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:09.589
Most of us remember where we were and for
many of us our lives were changed forever

00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:17.949
because it makes you reflect on your own path,
and maybe you take a new path after the crisis.

00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:23.379
That happened to a woman named Grace Hopper.
We would never have heard of Grace Hopper

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:31.660
if it weren't for Pearl Harbor. On December
6th, Grace Hopper was a tenured track professor

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:39.209
at Vassar College. She had her PhD in mathematics,
she was married. She lived in New York City

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:43.749
with her family, ah, all living on the same
street. They had a summer house in upstate

00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:52.560
New York. She had a very normal, stable life.
Within 6 months of Pearl Harbor she quit her

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.850
job, left her husband and tried desperately
to join the Navy. The problem was there were

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:06.070
no women in the Navy at this time. And I think
this gives us the first insight into Grace

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.560
Hopper's personality. She didn't let simple
things like there were no women in the Navy

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.379
stop her from doing something. Well sure enough,
the rules were changed, the WAVES were formed

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:24.149
and Grace Hopper got her wish. The Navy didn't
know what to do with a 5 foot 2, 105 pound

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:31.310
PhD in Mathematics, so they sent her to a
top secret project up at Harvard, called the

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:43.980
Harvard Mark 1. Let me read to you a little
about her first day on the job.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.110
"Hopper reported to Howard Aiken's Harvard
command in the basement of Harvard's University's

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:54.860
Croft Physics Laboratory on 2 July 1944. After
being escorted down to the basement by an

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.589
armed guard. If this wasn't disquieting enough,
the presence of her physically intimidating

00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:03.779
boss was. 'I was a little bewildered and at
that point, of course thoroughly scared',

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:08.620
Hopper recalled. Years later she distinctly
remembered the first words uttered to her

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.720
by Aiken. 'Where the hell have you been?'
Aiken had expected Hopper months earlier and

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.440
had not seen the point of sending a female
mathematician to midshipman school. Aiken

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.199
proceeded to give his new recruit a tour of
the automatic sequence control calculator.

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:27.850
Hopper had arrived before IBM had installed
the smooth steel casing, so the machines thousands

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.350
of moving parts were full exposed. 'All I
could do was look at it. I couldn't think

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.490
of anything to say at that point'. Aiken ordered
his new assistant to put off finding a place

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.999
to live for another day and to get to work
immediately. Her first task was to compute

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:47.399
the interpolation coefficients for the arctangent
to the accuracy of 23 decimal places within

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:54.470
in a week." [Pause] Pretty simple project,
right?

00:12:54.470 --> 00:13:00.240
The problem was; it couldn't be done in a
week. And she was told she was in charge of

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.329
this machine. A machine that had never existed
before. A machine that she had never seen

00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:14.670
the likes of. 81 feet long, 10 feet high,
750,000 moving parts, 5 miles of wiring. So

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:21.149
what did she do? She went to the manual of
operation. There was no manual of operation.

00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:28.290
This is the first computer and she's in charge
of it. Think about how disquieting that could

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:36.360
be. The machine actually was developed like
most machines were of the day. For a singular

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:45.249
purpose. And this case, this was a machine
to create ballistic tables. So that's what

00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:51.220
Hopper had to do initially. Was figure out
how to get the outputs to be what the purpose

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:56.510
of the machine was.
The navy, once they started hearing that they

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:03.279
had some type of high speed calculating machine,
that could, in fact, do 3 calculations per

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:10.630
second, which was revolutionary at the time.
They started sending Hopper and her crew other

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:19.999
problems to solve. And this kind of put Hopper
in a conundrum. They had to continue to start

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:28.600
reconfiguring the machine each time a different
problem was given to them. The most famous

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.769
problem that was given to them in the fall
of 1944 was brought by a man named John Von

00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:42.269
Neumann, a famous mathematician, and he wanted
them to figure out how to cause a sphere to

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:49.389
implode upon itself. And they weren't sure
where to put the charges to create this sphere

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:57.889
implosion at a specific rate. It was a problem
that Von Neumann and his team couldn't solve

00:14:57.889 --> 00:15:04.470
with computers. Well what was a computer?
A computer in that day was a person with a

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:10.259
piece of paper and a pencil. And they would
have rooms of computers. Often times they

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:15.809
were women. And you would bring the problem,
like you'd bring a shirt to the Laundromat.

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:20.149
You'd hand it in, they'd divide the problem
up, and people would actually solve it with

00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:25.440
paper and pencil. They didn't have enough
time; this was a critical war problem. So

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:32.449
it took Hopper and her team four months to
solve the problem and of course we all know

00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:40.209
what the problem was used for. The "Fat Man"
was dropped on Nagasaki, it used that implosion

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:47.279
problem, and 6 days later the war ended.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:50.889
[Silence]

00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:58.839
Now Howard Aiken was in charge of the Harvard
Mark 1. He has an interesting story in and

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:06.749
of his own right. In 1938 he was a graduate
student at Harvard. But he had spent many

00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:13.769
years working in, for power plants for industry.
And he got the idea for a calculating machine

00:16:13.769 --> 00:16:20.610
initially to help him do some of his PhD work.
Harvard saw itself as a [Labrard] school and

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:26.449
was not willing to support Aiken's effort.
And Aiken tried for 5 years, excuse me, for

00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:34.569
3 years to get their support. It wasn't until
Pearl Harbor which opened the door for Aiken

00:16:34.569 --> 00:16:42.119
to receive funds to try to build his computer.
He had been a Naval reserve officer, and so

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:49.120
he bypassed Harvard administration, and received
funding directly from the US Navy, rented

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:55.850
the basement of the Croft Laboratory, built
out the computer and then staffed it, not

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:03.079
with Harvard students and professors, but
with naval officers and enlisted. He would

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:10.430
not allow any of the Harvard professors who
wanted to run their problems on this machine,

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:18.270
he would not allow them to use the machine.
People offered compare him to Charles Babbage

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:23.240
and Aiken was the first to compare himself
to Charles Babbage. He saw himself as the

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:29.630
second coming of Charles Babbage. And here
you have Aiken and Hopper reviewing parts

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:36.670
of the original difference engine that Babbage
had created. In effect Aiken saw himself as

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:42.550
Babbage and Hopper, his assistant, as Ada
Lovelace, if any of you are familiar with

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:52.210
that history. Aiken was a hard man to work
for. He decided to run the computation laboratory,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:58.960
not as a civilian laboratory but as a military
ship. And the computer was their ship. Everyone

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:06.240
called him commander. They operated the facility
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They had watches,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:14.410
they had logs, they had an officer of the
deck. But the advantage was that he got things

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:20.550
done, and he got them done rapidly. One, they
built a prototype and got it functional during

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:26.290
the war, and it did some significant work
including the implosion problem for the war.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:33.900
That type of innovative environment was good
for getting things done, but it has its shadow

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:40.590
sides as well. And let me read you a piece
from Hopper to describe what it was like working

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.420
in this environment.
"Early programming innovations grew out of

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.410
the intense pressure generated by the war.
Hopper compared the experience to working

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.900
in a long tunnel with only the problems to
solve ahead of her. Her and Richard Block

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.441
were constantly searching for ways to increase
the speed of the coding process and their

00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:04.910
solutions evolved out of the expediency rather
than intellectual curiosity."

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:11.620
So what did they create during those war years?
Well they came up with the concept of subroutines.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:18.050
They would use a tape to program the machine,
to code the machine. And what they realized

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:25.420
was that once they had a piece of tape that
was cleared of errors, why not use that tape

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:31.120
over and over again. So they started building
a library of tapes, and then they could bring

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.960
and put those tapes together when they were
working on another problem. They didn't call

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:42.050
it subroutines at the time but in effect it
became the basis for some of Hoppers work

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:49.800
later on. They developed a concept of flow-charting,
to chart out the problem they were working

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.790
on, and to allow people who were working on
the problem to know what the person had done

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:02.400
before them. So you start seeing the rudimentary
operational system behind programming also

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:12.400
developing in '44 and '45. The most famous
problem that they solved, or at least identified

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.270
during this period, was discovered one night
when the machine stopped working and they

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:24.750
inspected the machine and realized that a
moth had been captured in one of the relays.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:30.370
So in the log book, they taped the moth down
and under it they wrote that "we've de-bugged

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:35.860
the computer and it seems to be working fine
now". And you actually can find the original

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:48.650
computer bug at the Smithsonian Museum. [Pause]
A lot of people feel that Von Neumann is the

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:57.060
one who came up with the stored computer architecture.
We even refer to it as Von Neumann architecture.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:05.060
And a lot of historical background is based
on a lawsuit between Von Neumann and Presper

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.200
Eckhart and John Mauchly who are here in the
middle who built another computer down in

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:16.750
Philadelphia at the time, called the ENIAC.
What I discovered in the research was that

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:23.270
before Von Neumann went down to the ENIAC
project, he had been working with Hopper for

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:31.320
four months at the Harvard project. The ENIAC
didn't even have programming tape; they just

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:37.360
had plug boards that they would reconfigure
the machine to do a problem with. So it's

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:44.930
my feeling that Von Neumann was the one who
got to see what they were doing up at Harvard

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:51.050
and then look at the Vacuum tube technology
that they were using at ENIAC and then write

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:58.950
his famous spring of 1945 paper 'First Draft
of the EDVAC' to kind of build the case for

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:05.920
the stored program architecture. These ideas
don't come out of the blue so I think we need

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.500
to give credit where credit's due and if you
actually read the original paper, he even,

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:21.160
in his footnotes thanks Aiken and Hopper,
but never mentions the ENIAC project.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.130
[Pause]

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:33.990
The hard work at, um at Harvard, started to
take its toll on Hopper. I think during the

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:41.090
war, during that mission she was fine, but
then once the war was over, she started having

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:47.070
road blocks to her career. She wanted to stay
in the military but once the war ended, the

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:52.440
military said "we're going to go back to our
pre-war policy and not have active officers

00:22:52.440 --> 00:23:00.730
as women". She wanted to stay on at Harvard,
Howard Aiken was made a full professor, but

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:08.910
Harvard did not hire women as professors.
So they gave her a 2 year part time research

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:15.010
grant to continue to help Howard Aiken, and
then they released her. Now let me read a

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:22.420
little bit of what happened to her next.
"On a cold night in November 1949 only 6 months

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.990
after leaving Harvard and joining the Eckhart
and Maulchy Computer Corporation, Grace Mary

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:31.960
Hopper found herself behind bars at the Central
Philadelphia police station. The programming

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.570
pioneer was arrested at 3am for drunk and
disorderly conduct. She was eventually placed

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.610
in the custody of Pennsylvania General Hospital
for treatment. Hoppers' life was unraveling.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:47.170
At the age of 43 years old she had accomplished
much, yet her growing dependency on alcohol

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:52.830
was jeopardizing her career and her relationships.
As winter approached, she attempted to commit

00:23:52.830 --> 00:24:00.350
suicide 2 different times."
I wanted to include that in the book because

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:09.990
I think it's important for us to realize that
pioneers and innovators are human. And Hopper

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:15.860
went through a lot during those years. She
accomplished much, but it had a grave toll

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:22.390
on her personally. And interestingly enough,
it's her crew from Harvard, her team from

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:27.070
Harvard that she built and worked with during
the war that came to her rescue during those

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:34.330
years. Got her sober and got her back on the
right track. And so she started working on

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:40.470
this project, the first computer start-up
company, the Eckhart and Maulchy Corporation.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:46.970
And they build the EDVAC which Von Neumann
mapped out, and so this would be America's

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:55.150
first functioning stored program computer.
Now Hopper didn't have much to do in 1949,

00:24:55.150 --> 00:25:03.170
1950 and 1951 because no one really understood
why you would want one of these. Howard Aiken

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:08.730
was asked one time, "How many computers do
you think the country needs?" And he thought,

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:16.980
well, about 12 and that would handle all the
computational needs of the nation. Well there

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:27.690
was an event that occurred which I think epitomizes
the change in perspective around these machines.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:34.730
Someone in the marketing department at UNIVAC,
got the idea to use one of these computers

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:43.530
during the first televised presidential election;
Eisenhower vs. Stevenson. They would collect

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:51.380
data from previous elections; voting patterns,
enter those into the UNIVAC, and then with

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:58.530
1% of the vote in, they would try to predict
the outcome of the election. They couldn't

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:05.950
fit a UNIVAC on set next to Walter Cronkite,
so they built like a Star Trek version of

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:13.840
it with just some flashing lights next to
him. And with 1% of the vote in, the UNIVAC

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:22.700
was saying that Eisenhower was going to win
by a landslide. 490 electoral votes to 89.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:28.761
The Roper poll was saying that it was going
to be a close race. So what did Walter Cronkite

00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:35.640
do? He lied to the American people and said
the UNIVAC says it's going to be a close race.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:46.070
Well sure enough, when the votes were in,
491 to 88. The UNIVAC had missed by one electoral

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:55.010
vote. A UNIVAC representative went back on
TV and told the American nation that in fact

00:26:55.010 --> 00:27:03.270
the UNIVAC had guessed what the outcome would
be. And you can imagine every CEO in the country

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:09.970
who was watching that night started thinking
these machines can predict the future, we

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:14.870
need to get one of these.
Now there's other reasons why orders started

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:22.190
taking off in 1952, 1953, but sure enough,
during this period the UNIVAC was so well

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:29.450
known and so popular amongst business that
it became their Coca Cola or Kleenex, and

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:36.690
we may have called computers UNIVAC's if that
company had, was able to beat IBM during the

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:46.250
1950's. Because of the UNIVAC's popularity,
Hopper now had a crisis. She was in charge

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:54.060
of getting these machines to work. And you
can imagine each company that bought a UNIVAC

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.120
wanted it to do something specific to that
company. So if an insurance company bought

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:05.221
one, they wanted it to do actuarial tables.
GE wanted it to do payroll. Hughes Aircraft

00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:11.860
wanted it to do engineering problems. So Hopper
was in charge of getting the systems running

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:19.870
and configured for each of these companies.
The problem was there weren't many programmers

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:27.510
at that time. The concept, the profession
was just starting to evolve. So out of crisis

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:36.780
comes innovation, and Hopper, goes and, over
an 8 month period invents a critical piece

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:44.080
that she would call the Compiler. The compiler
would allow the computer to start helping

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:55.020
the programmer program itself. She tells the
world about the compiler in a very funny titled

00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:01.780
paper 'The Education of a Computer' and in
that paper she maps out how a Compiler can

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:08.380
pull from a library of subroutines, um, take
care of many of the administration functions

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:18.070
of the programmer and create automatically,
machine code. She, 6 months later, produces

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:24.380
another paper, called 'Compiling Routines'
and this one really is the interesting paper

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:30.810
because she starts explaining the concept
of source code. She calls it Pseudo Code at

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:38.970
the time. And what you'll be able to do with
source code, or pseudo code, is the programmer

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:44.440
or programming team that creates these higher
end languages can now be linguists. And they

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.930
can produce programming languages that you
don't need a PhD in mathematics to be able

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:58.380
to use. It was key to liberating the technology.
It was the key to solving the staffing problem

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:05.930
at many of these companies.
The next step, was she had to convince management

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:14.300
that this was a good idea. So she decides
to create a program; one in German, one in

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:22.200
French, and one in English. And all 3 programs
would produce the same machine code. And she

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:28.820
demonstrates it to management. And management
is furious. "We're having a hard enough time

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:34.780
helping the American companies program. Now
you're wanting to help French and German companies?"

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:42.140
She said, "No you're missing the point. The
point is we can make source code or pseudo

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.970
code anything we want it to be. We can make
it mathematic based, we can make it business

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:53.950
oriented." That was the point she was trying
to make. One thing that Hopper was good at

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:59.880
was knowing her audience and talking to them
in a way that they can understand and get

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:08.880
motivated. So she started talking about savings.
The savings we would have if we could make

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:16.701
programs that high school students could program
or undergrads could program. Um, these companies

00:31:16.701 --> 00:31:24.300
would stop poaching our programmers. And that's
when they started getting the value of what

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:30.340
she was talking about. This automatic programming
concept. So they ended up giving her a budget

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:38.010
in 1954, and creating the Division of Automatic
Programming at UNIVAC. And Hopper was put

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:43.400
in charge of it. She became the first director
of Automatic Programming at UNIVAC.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:50.950
You know a lot of people ask me, how did Hopper
achieve so much in the 50's at a time when

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:57.220
after the war there were so many efforts to
try to get women out of the workplace? And

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.700
one of the answers was that she invented her
positions. That's one way to break the glass

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.600
ceiling, right? Is to invent the job, and
then assign yourself as head of the division.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:18.400
So that's what she did. Hopper, during this
period, becomes a sales person for this vision

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:24.740
of automatic computing. Believe it or not
a lot of programmers, so there was a community

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:31.870
of programmers by the mid '50's, were against
her efforts. They wanted to be the High Priests

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:39.380
of these machines; they wanted to keep them
complicated. And Hopper's pretty much trying

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:49.870
to undermine their new profession. Well I
think it teaches us an important lesson about

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:56.570
how technology evolves. I think a lot of times
we just think that technology is just inevitable.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:04.560
It just happens. It happens to be more logical
than other things. When in fact, an inventor

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:12.190
has to be a good sales person. So what are
the tools of a sales person? What did Hopper

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:19.441
do during the 1950's to start spreading this
concept of Automatic Programming? Well, first

00:33:19.441 --> 00:33:26.290
of all, she started employing as many people
as she could in the design process. So of

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:31.500
course people on her staff at UNIVAC worked
on the first compilers and the first programming

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:37.240
languages; Math-matic and Flow-matic were
the first two that she built out. But she

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:44.900
also incorporated people from other companies,
and the users from the companies that were

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:53.600
using the machines. So in effect, what we
would call say, open source programming today,

00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:01.800
was something that was the norm during the
'50's and something that Hopper helped orchestrate.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:08.609
She also used a variety of institutions to
help push her vision forward. So one of them

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:15.930
was a computing group called the Association
of Computing Machinery; the ACM. Many of you

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:22.369
probably are a part of it now; it's the largest
organization within computing. It was actually

00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:30.240
founded by the group that worked at Harvard.
Harvard's crew. Ah, Hopper's crew at Harvard.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.440
And by the 1950's they started having their
own annual meetings. And Hopper put herself

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:43.909
in charge of two important committees. One
was Senior Editor, so she got to pick the

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:49.619
types of articles that were being published
for the ACM. And the 2nd one I thought was

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:54.869
very interesting also. She put herself in
charge of the Nomenclature Committee. Every

00:34:54.869 --> 00:35:04.499
profession has its own language. And that
language is in essence, is power. If you can

00:35:04.499 --> 00:35:10.240
define the language of being a Doctor, or
being a Lawyer, being a Military Officer,

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:16.980
you're a pretty powerful person in that profession.
Hopper realized that. And so she was the head

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:21.490
of the Nomenclature Committee during the early
50's as well which started defining the language

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:31.950
of computer programming. She also relied on
her friends at Department of Defense. Even

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:37.460
though she had to leave the military, she
always remained part of the military during

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:44.730
those years. She was a reserve officer, and
every 2 weeks she would work at DOD, and get

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:49.749
a sense of what their computing needs were.
So during the 50's she started having DOD

00:35:49.749 --> 00:35:58.349
pay for different workshops on Automatic Programming,
on different trainings, and so this way she

00:35:58.349 --> 00:36:04.349
started getting some of the largest consumers
of these new technologies on board with her

00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:17.329
vision of programming. I think this salesmanship,
this method of inventing in an open way, culminates

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:28.710
in 1959. She goes to DOD and suggests that
we should all work together to form a common

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:38.579
business language. And so she sets up a meeting
for 2 days in the spring of 1959 where they

00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:46.130
pull in 7 government agencies, 11 computer
users, and 10 computer manufacturers. And

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:53.440
for 2 days they brain storm what would the
perfect, the ideal, business language would

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:59.339
be, what would it look like? They also form
3 committees. A short term committee, a medium

00:36:59.339 --> 00:37:03.910
term committee, and a long term committee.
The short term committee is going to take

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:10.240
the suggestions and map out what the standards
will be for this language. The intermediate

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.940
term committee then would continuously improve
it. Well, the short term committee happens

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:24.930
to be made up of people that used to work
for Hopper. And interestingly enough 50% of

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:34.430
the Short term committee were women. And through
the fall of 1959, they build out the standards

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:42.320
for what they named during the fall; COBOL.
The language is COBOL. Hopper being the senior

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.890
tech person of the committee signs off on
the standards of the new language in January

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:55.220
of 1960.
They launch the language and everyone hates

00:37:55.220 --> 00:38:07.009
it. It's terrible. It's too verbose. It takes
up too much memory. It's slow. So the question

00:38:07.009 --> 00:38:18.859
is; how did COBOL become the most successful
programming language to date? 70% of all the

00:38:18.859 --> 00:38:29.770
active code today is COBOL code. How does
this happen? Well, Hopper understood something

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:38.309
about innovation; that the most logical innovation
isn't always the best innovation. You have

00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:45.310
to build into the technology itself the different
groups that will have a hand in pushing that

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:50.651
technology forward; there are economic parts
to a technology, there are political parts

00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:56.130
to a technology and there are social parts
to a technology. So in essence Cobalt ended

00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:05.460
up being a second best solution that pleased
no one and everyone.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:12.039
But that salesmanship comes back again. You
can build the prototype but then you have

00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:18.859
to push the prototype out. And so for much
of the 1960's Hopper dedicates herself to

00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:27.769
getting COBOL used by a variety of different
companies and organizations.

00:39:27.769 --> 00:39:35.089
She used different techniques to push COBOL.
You're probably wondering what does Marilyn

00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:43.759
Monroe have to do with COBOL? Well I'll tell
you. As the 1950's came to a close, Barry

00:39:43.759 --> 00:39:49.150
Rand's, Director of Programming Research,
Grace Hopper, conducted an experiment to demonstrate

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:54.300
how far the programming language had advanced
in the 15 years since she wrote her first

00:39:54.300 --> 00:40:00.799
code. Hopper would attempt to turn a trim
attractive blond into a computer programmer.

00:40:00.799 --> 00:40:08.829
Hopper's subject; Marilyn Mealy, Marilyn Monroe,
Marilyn Mealy, a 19 year old blond high school

00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:13.710
graduate from the Mayfair section of Philadelphia,
was prettier than average and liked to swim

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:19.329
and listen to HiFi records. According to Hopper,
Marilyn was much like other young women who

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:23.539
window shopped during their lunch hours and
looked forward to their evening dates and

00:40:23.539 --> 00:40:32.670
dancing. And sure enough, in 6 weeks Marilyn
Mealy became a COBOL programmer. And Hopper

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:40.160
would parade Marilyn around and say "Look
what you can do with this language". She used

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:47.259
other techniques also. More hardball techniques
like she convinced her friends at DOD that

00:40:47.259 --> 00:40:53.380
they would not buy any more computers after
1961 that did not have an operational COBOL

00:40:53.380 --> 00:41:04.440
compiler. So there's other ways to push a
certain technology forward as well.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:15.259
In 1967 Hopper retires from UNIVAC and she
could've had a very nice relaxing retirement

00:41:15.259 --> 00:41:20.500
from that time forward. She had accomplished
a lot. And people in the industry understood

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:26.989
how important she was. The ACM actually named
her the first Man of the Year that year, that

00:41:26.989 --> 00:41:34.079
she retired, which I thought was funny. They
also named after Hopper, kind of the Nobel

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:40.390
Prize for Computer Science, the Grace Hopper
Award in 1971. And many of the luminaries

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:49.799
here in Silicon Valley have won the Hopper
award. But Hopper wasn't done. In '67 she

00:41:49.799 --> 00:41:56.579
decides to go back into the Navy and help
them standardize COBOL. It's a 6 month project,

00:41:56.579 --> 00:42:05.650
20 years later, she's still on active duty
and she's the first woman to become an admiral.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:10.160
And that's when I got to meet her. She was
at the end of her career and I was at the

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:18.109
beginning of mine. So I want to finish today
with, what are some lessons that we can glean

00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:27.339
from Hoppers experience and how can we apply
those lessons in our own work today?

00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:34.970
Hopper used to say, "You manage things and
you lead people". So what did she mean by

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:44.190
that? You manage things but you lead people?
Part of leading a group means that you need

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:59.359
to provide them with a purpose, with urgency,
with a vision. During World War Two that urgency

00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:06.930
was provided to Howard Aiken externally. People
worked night and day because of the war effort.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:12.819
Interestingly enough once you took the war
away, the process of innovation collapsed

00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:20.970
on Howard Aiken because he didn't know how
to lead people. Hopper was so good at painting

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:27.670
a certain type of computer future for people
and then pushing them all in that direction

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:37.119
and giving them a sense of purpose. One little
trick she would always do, is she would hand

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:45.770
the most difficult problems off to the youngest,
most inexperienced people on her staff. And

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:51.499
she didn't think that they'd actually solve
the problem, but what she would say is they

00:43:51.499 --> 00:43:59.130
didn't realize that they should fail and that's
half the battle. She'd watch them; how they'd

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:06.039
approach the problem and they'd usually hand
off the problem to a more senior person but

00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:16.651
maybe with some insight into a different way
of solving it. Something that Hopper was very

00:44:16.651 --> 00:44:22.329
good at also, which served her well in the
1950's was learning what I call learning from

00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:28.029
the margins. She had this peculiar habit when
she was a college professor. So she taught

00:44:28.029 --> 00:44:34.400
mathematics, but each semester even though
she was teaching a full load of classes, she

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:41.910
would audit 2 classes. And those classes had
nothing to do with Mathematics; they ranged

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:51.119
from architecture to philosophy to history.
I think what she realized was experts sometimes

00:44:51.119 --> 00:45:00.239
can't think out of the box. Their expertise
becomes an intellectual prison. So one way

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:09.029
to try to keep the pathways open is to constantly
learn about different fields. And think how

00:45:09.029 --> 00:45:16.999
well that served her during the 1950's. So
she would go visit Hughes Aircraft. And in

00:45:16.999 --> 00:45:22.270
just a few days she had to figure out how
the company worked, what the business model

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:27.759
was, and what types of applications they would
need. And then she'd go to another company

00:45:27.759 --> 00:45:34.910
and be completely different. And in a way
her mind became like that general computer.

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:42.339
Right? It was malleable; it could change to
fit the situation. And I think it's Hopper's

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:49.880
habit that she already had in the 1930's which
helped create the uniqueness of the computer

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:56.470
industry during the '50's. Because at the
end of the day, what is unique about computer

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:04.780
technology? Any technology before computers
had its own Talis, its own purpose. So you

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:11.999
design and build a lawn mower and you use
it to mow lawns. A hammer hammers nails. A

00:46:11.999 --> 00:46:21.640
computer can become whatever you want it to
become; and I think its epitomized best by

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:32.710
Smart Phones. Now, this one is manufactured
by another company that will remain nameless.

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:39.099
But when I wake up in the morning; I check
my emails, the temperature, I hand it off

00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:47.079
to my son, he plays a game, he hands it back
to me, I look up some stocks, I make a call.

00:46:47.079 --> 00:46:52.661
That's the power of computers. It's the fact
that they can evolve and be anything that

00:46:52.661 --> 00:46:57.570
you want them to be because of the software,
because of the programming. And when I was

00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:03.180
reading other histories of computing, it always
shocked me that they concentrated so much

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:09.880
on hardware and hardware development, when
in fact I think programming and programming

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:17.560
development is the real key to the industry.
And so we have to thank Grace Hopper for that.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:24.570
We talked about her ability to sell the vision.
So you've got to sell it internally to your

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:31.440
team, to motivate them. But then you have
to sell it externally, and that means you

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.789
have to be able to talk to a variety of different
audiences and know what that audience needs

00:47:36.789 --> 00:47:42.980
to hear. And think about what Hopper did throughout
her life, she always kept one foot in the

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:49.700
military, one foot in academia, and she was
a business woman. And so she knew how to talk

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:55.489
to each group. She knew the important things
that they needed to hear and she could morph

00:47:55.489 --> 00:48:03.049
her vision to their needs.
And finally, I think the main point that I

00:48:03.049 --> 00:48:08.359
want to leave with everyone today, is that
Technology is not inevitable. I think we fall

00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:15.440
into that trap sometimes. We think that it's
supposed to develop that way, or of course

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:24.430
it evolved that way. In a way that's sad because
it takes away Human Agency, right? Human beings,

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:30.049
especially in the early part of a technology's
development can influence the direction of

00:48:30.049 --> 00:48:37.150
that technology. You take out Grace Hopper
from the equation; you get a different computer

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:44.940
industry. It evolves in a different way. To
remind her of that, and to remind the people

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:51.400
she worked with of that, during her navy days
she kept a clock on the wall, and the clock

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:58.940
had all the numbers backwards and the hands
ran backwards. And her point was; we could've

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:05.769
designed a clock any way we wanted to design
it. It didn't have to be designed the way

00:49:05.769 --> 00:49:13.200
that eventually there is a consensus around.
And every technology is like that. So, remember

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:23.430
that as you work on your own technologies.
Finally, I , I think, you know, in a kind

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:30.900
of a post financial world, Grace Hopper serves
as a wonderful role model for all of us. Um,

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:43.229
she, she worked and created and innovated,
not necessarily for the stock options or for

00:49:43.229 --> 00:49:50.780
the financial payout, but she really was enamored
with the technologies that she was working

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:58.720
with, she cared about the people she worked
with. And she had a sense of duty, to self

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:07.369
and country as well which I think is not typical
sometimes for Silicon Valley. And I really

00:50:07.369 --> 00:50:12.349
admire her for that as well. That's probably
one of the reasons why people have never heard

00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:18.930
of her, because she actually didn't make much
money during these years and so we have to

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:24.640
thank her though, for being such a strong
pioneer and setting the foundation for the

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.349
rest of us going forward. So I'd like to take
some questions at this point.

00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:34.720
[Clapping from audience]

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:48.109
&gt;&gt;Person 1 from audience: So you know today
we think of compilers compiling into an assembly

00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:53.549
language which is some representation of the
underlying machine codes. Um, how did things

00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:57.730
look in the '50's to then, 'coz you haven't
mentioned the, you know, machine codes and

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:02.519
assembly languages and things like that? And
also what was the correlation, if she had

00:51:02.519 --> 00:51:05.269
any, to John Backus who did the Fortran Compiler?

00:51:05.269 --> 00:51:14.239
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Sure, sure, yeah. Um, yeah there were
2 paths that were happening. Hoppers was the

00:51:14.239 --> 00:51:19.950
compiling path. Ah, there were other languages
growing, mainly out of MIT which were taking

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:24.890
a different path. She was very friendly with
John Backus actually. When I talked about

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:31.269
how she built this team that went beyond the
borders of UNIVAC, Backus was actually working

00:51:31.269 --> 00:51:42.519
at IBM. And one of the things that motivated
Backus was how slow MATH-MATIC compiled. So

00:51:42.519 --> 00:51:48.599
when he was designing what would become FORTRAN,
the main thing he was trying to solve was

00:51:48.599 --> 00:51:57.390
to figure out how to increase compiling speeds.
And so, very friendly with Hopper. Hopper,

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:04.559
there were, software wasn't monetized at that
point so she had no problems working with

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:08.170
him, making suggestions, they all knew each
other at the different conferences that they

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:13.720
were going to. So it was a much different
time in terms of development back then.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:23.579
&gt;&gt;Person 2 from audience [European accent]:
I thought that was an interesting comment

00:52:23.579 --> 00:52:31.200
on Open Source in the early days. I think,
ah, you just said it, which is that software

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:37.799
wasn't monetized in those days. Are there
any lessons that, in like the discussions

00:52:37.799 --> 00:52:44.119
around software patents for example should
take from that era when there were no patents

00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:48.349
so to speak of? And anything else we could
learn about that?

00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:54.739
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Yeah, yeah. I think one could argue
maybe you had a faster rate of innovation

00:52:54.739 --> 00:53:00.130
during that period. You start seeing a shift
because of the IBM Anti-trust case in the

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:10.039
late '60's and so IBM is forced to stop giving
the software away for free with the hardware.

00:53:10.039 --> 00:53:13.989
The beginnings of the software industry are
already developing in the '60's, but that

00:53:13.989 --> 00:53:19.849
really gives the main boost then in the 1960's,
ah, 1970's. I think it's no wonder that, you

00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:26.520
know someone like Bill Gates really helps
redefine the business model around software,

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:35.730
in that his dad was a lawyer, not an engineer.
And, I mean, one could make the case that

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:40.210
also that bringing a group of smart people
together and having them work on a singular

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:47.549
project and then patenting the outcome is
an effective way of innovation as well. So,

00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:54.029
I guess both and, both ways of doing it are
both viable and we've seen it work, um, but

00:53:54.029 --> 00:53:58.549
open source isn't something new. Open source
was actually the way things were originally

00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:59.549
done.

00:53:59.549 --> 00:54:00.549
[Silence]

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:05.980
&gt;&gt;Person 3 from the audience: OK, Very good.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.410
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Thank you.

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:09.220
[Clapping]
