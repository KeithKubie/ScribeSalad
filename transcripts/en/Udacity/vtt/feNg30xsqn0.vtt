00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If your brain is getting a little fried, stick with me for a little bit longer.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We've got one more thing to talk about with motionlessness,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is actually surprisingly fascinating.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I want to point out one thing from before.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
An object that is motionless or at rest, well, from a force point of view,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it's in the exact same situation as an object moving at constant speed.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
From here on out, whenever I talk about an object that's at rest,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we could also be talking about an object with a constant speed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's just a little easier to visualize an object that's not moving, and the key to motionlessness is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
realizing that when an object is at rest, its acceleration is 0.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
F=ma tells us that 0 acceleration means 0 total force.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
0 total force doesn't necessarily mean that there's no force acting on an object at all.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
All it means is that any upwards forces must be balanced by corresponding downwards forces.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Likewise, leftwards forces must be balanced by rightwards forces.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's take a look at Aayush and Brent who are each pushing on this cart.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This cart has mass m and we'll say that the mass is 5 kg and right now the cart is exactly at rest.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
They're both pushing very hard but the cart is at rest.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I should mention that most of these questions we do,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we're going to ignore something called friction.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Friction is the force you feel between your hands when you rub them together.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a real force and it's something we can talk about,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but to make matters simpler, we'll often ignore it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So this is a frictionless world for now--so let's go ahead and take

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
a look at all the forces acting on this cart.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm going to draw a force diagram.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Well, the first force I'm going to draw is mg, and in this case,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
mg is going to equal this 5 mg&lt;i&gt;g and we know g is 10 msÂ² which gives me a total of 50 N&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which gives me a total of 50 N and Newtons are the unit of force.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The ground must also be pushing upwards with a normal force.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Aayush is doing his best and he's pushing to the right, we'll label that Fa for Aayush

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and Brent is also doing his best pushing back to the left and.we'll label that Fb.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Noticed how I've drawn these arrows--you know Aayush is pushing from the left

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to the right--I don't draw an arrow like this.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
For me, it's much easier to see what's going on

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
if the arrow is coming from the object and moving out.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So we know that the cart is at rest and I've given you a couple of the forces.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I told you that mg is 50 N and I've told you that Aayush is pushing with a force of 100 N.

00:02:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can you use this data as well as what we learned up here to fill in these two answers.
