eye evolved underwater so it was built

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600
eye evolved underwater so it was built

much worse than their underwater

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079

ancestors since then our eyes have

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390
ancestors since then our eyes have
 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.420
ancestors since then our eyes have
gotten better equipped for life on land

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430
gotten better equipped for life on land
 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.340

but we weren't able to go back in time

and evolve a brand new eye to work best

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630
and evolve a brand new eye to work best
