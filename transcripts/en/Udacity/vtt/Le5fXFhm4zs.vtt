00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Of course, we'll do a little quiz to have you figure that out.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What I would like you think about is the following:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm going to give you 3 graphs, and I'm going to ask you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for which of these graphs is shortest toward the hardest and the easiest to solve.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So here you have 3 graphs,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and each of these graphs has the same number of vertices

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in case you're wondering, or at least I hope it does,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I counted twice, but you never know.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And what I want I would like you to tell me now

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is for which of these graphs you think shortest tour is the hardest to solve

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and for which of these graphs you think is the easiest to solve

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I've not written any distances on the edges,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but you can basically assume that I would be able to write

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
any distances that I want on these edges.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's more of a question about the structure of these graphs,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and for the one that you think is hardest,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I want you to enter the number 3 in one of these boxes,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and for the one that you think is easiest,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I want you to enter the number 1,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and guess what number I want you to enter for the one that is in between.

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So please, go ahead.
