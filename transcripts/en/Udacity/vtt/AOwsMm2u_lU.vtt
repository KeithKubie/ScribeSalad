00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now let's really prove the power of our finite state machine interpreter

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
by showing that we could figure out any finite state machine.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You should submit, via the interpreter, values for edges and accepting those 2 key variables

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that encode the regular expression "q*"--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so the empty string, "q", "qq".

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
For convenience, name your start state 1.
