00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.380
We open as we usually do with the
southern narrator,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.560
talking over flat landscapes

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.920
probably shot by Roger Deakins.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
They leave just enough space for the credits to go over,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.080
but they rarely take advantage of that.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.940
Instead,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.240
they leave me to tell you about a main
character:

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.960
A fat cat.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.884
That's right,

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:27.440
a political fat cat trying to shift things his way

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.420
by simply throwing money at his problems.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.440
This is usually where we cut to a symbol of the movie,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.620
while a Carter Burwell score plays.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.300
And even if he was a lazy man,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.680
quite possibly the laziest in Muncie, Indiana,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.740
he will push it pretty far by staring at
his calendar,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.920
so he would know when Mondays were coming.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.840
Honestly, we hold all these awkward
stares

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.100
to a point where it becomes gimmicky,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.160
but the critics seem to like it.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.840
Jon:  Hey!

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560
But even fat cats have owners...

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.700
like Jon Arbuckle here.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460
Played by Steve Buscemi.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.880
You got a job to do man.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.280
I give you money so that you can spend it on keeping those rat spies out of our political house!

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.700
I told you, Pookie's on it.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.960
Take the rats out of the house, Garfield!

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.880
He's just angry,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.580
because he can't get a date from one of his party supporters.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.000
An Army veteran named Liz

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.780
played by Frances McDormand.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.880
So uh...Liz, how about that date, huh?

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.980
You're not just asking me because I'm
a vet, are you?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.140
There are rules.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.800
I'm hoping that the comedic desperate angle overrules the creepy stalker angle.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.240
Sorry Jon, I have to draw a line in the
sand.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.619
And apart from millions of fans

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.570
demanding that I break character and date you...

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.830
No, that really happened. Look it up.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.480
I'm going to keep this running joke running.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.900
God damn running joke!

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.800
Garfield had many people he couldn't stand...

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.940
like Nermal.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.480
The wise black man who was so humble and sage-like,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.280
that it made him despicably cute.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.220
He's played by some salt-of-the-earth actor

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.700
that can easily be switched out

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.600
the next time they do this clichÃ©.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.480
Yeah...he'll do.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.700
I suppose we should probably do

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.240
that simple plan during the complicated mess thing.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240
It was only seem popular.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.800
You know...

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.180
your best friend's been taking half the shipment, right?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.560
What?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.860
I thought he was off the stuff.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.460
Come on boy...

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.820
falling off countertops,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.720
walking on all fours,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.880
he can barely speak half the time...

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.500
You know Nermal,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.900
I think it's time I sent you to Abu Dhabi...

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.460
in a box.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.640
&lt;gunshot&gt;

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.100
*Dramatic music.*

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.760
That's right, you don't know whether or
not to root for me.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.480
And finally there's Odie.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.140
played by John Turturro.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.720
I'm a dog - I'm a dog!

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.960
Woof, woof, bark, bark.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.160
My skin is turning yellow!

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.980
Sorry it's come to this, Odie,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.990
Garfield, is that you?

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.960
but the time has come to put you down.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.080
My God, what are you going to do?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.980
I'm gonna kill you in a gruesome,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.460
yet quirky way...

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.160
No, Garfield!

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.720
The audience will be emotionally confused!

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.520
True...

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.060
they won't know they actually like the movie after seeing it.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.660
But after they let it sit for a while,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.280
they figure it to themselves...

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.700
Eh, it was fucked up enough.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.780
I guess I like it fine...

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.120
NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.800
CUT!

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.980
That's lunch, everybody.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.000
Coens!

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.720
I just want to say, again,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.040
I am so thankful that you're having me

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.120
star in your latest movie.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.290
I mean...where did you get the idea to have me playing

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.240
an egotistical lazy jerk?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.500
God, I see where you guys get your gift
for dialogue.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.880
Anyway, I just want to say thank you so much again.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.600
I know you didn't just cast me in this role

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.840
because I have a studio and
I'm letting you use it for free.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.000
We don't really care.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.240
That clearly shows when you directed 'Ladykillers'

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.660
Hey Joel, great work on the shoot today, sweetie!

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.880
I'm Joel...

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.880
Oh, I'm sorry. I always get you two mixed up.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.340
We don't care.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.260
Oh, hey Critic! What's your next scene?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.540
Oh actually, I don't know I guess the Coens have to....

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.980
Oh, I hate it when they do that...

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.380
Joels...Joels...where are you Joels...

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.180
Ok...well I'm just gonna go do a
review that always ties into my personal life somehow...

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.440
Good work, everybody! Good work!

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.660
Timing is everything.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.740
Who would have
thought the Coen brothers would actually

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.450
make a Garfield movie?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.020
I mean...this newspaper comic strip that was also a Saturday morning cartoon...

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.980
and the directors of gritty surreal suspense?

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.220
They just go hand in hand!

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.120
Too bad Bill Murray didn't know that
he signed on to do the first one.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.420
Not that Bill Murray's a bad choice to play Garfield,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.580
in fact that it's actually fitting

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.960
seeing how the late voice actor Lorenzo Music
replace Murray as Peter in

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.130
The Real Ghostbusters

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.600
and now Murray
is replacing Music as Garfield.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.440
However, that wasn't the reason he did it.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.180
He agreed to it because he
thought the writer, Joel Cohen, was of

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.100
the critically acclaimed Coen Brothers.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.920
When really, he was from the critically panned

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.040
Cheaper by the Dozen

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.880
Because of this, Murray didn't read the entire script

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.420
and blindly agreed to take the role.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.500
Big of a mistake there...

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.900
What followed was a painfully painful
bit of pain

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.700
that's so bad that even

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.680
Murray's talent couldn't save it.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.640
Fans of anything Garfield could quickly see

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.700
not only did this have little to do with

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.320
what made the character so entertaining,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.600
but it was going to punish you for

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.370
liking those things to begin with.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.440
It's a hard one to watch

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.280
whether you're a fan of the beloved cartoon or not.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.180
There's a lot of kitty litter to get
through so let's start scooping...

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.940
this is 'Garfield'

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.660
As the credits roll, we see pictures of a man who clearly likes his pet too much.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.810
Who wears a suit and a picture with your cat,
unless you're a Bond villain.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.920
When we get our first glimpse of our
main character.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.640
I hate Mondays.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.820
By God, is that hideous.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.960
Not only is he sinfully ugly,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.680
but the CG is so bad that I actually think

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.900
the hand-drawn commercials
from the past look more convincing.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.320
He looks like Grumpy Cat
if he was shit out by Chester Cheetah.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.020
Just to give you an idea...

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.620
these are the hard drives of jokes I
made just based on his appearance.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.780
But, seeing how this is a short review,
let's just stick to the best of the best.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.960
'The sun-kissed tumor' seems to do things
associated with Garfield.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960
Eats lasagna,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.480
annoys his owner John, played by Breckin Meyer,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.980
who we pray to God will make
fun of this in 'Robot Chicken'.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.360
Thank you!

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.800
and talks with annoying friends like Nermal.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.180
It just seems like a weird thing to do.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.800
Who the fuck is that?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.920
Doggie to a house that already has a cat.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.700
Maybe you heard me wrong.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.420
Hangs out with Nermal...

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.900
Come on, it's just across the street.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.880
We're cats, we like milk.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.380
Thatta boy, Nermal.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.740
You're...you're really going with that, huh?

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.260
That, this is Nermal?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.620
Last time I checked,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.380
Nermal was said to be the world's cutest kitty cat.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.520
He was innocent, had a sweet high-pitched voice,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.620
and Garfield resented how adorable he was.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.380
Here....

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.360
well you got that he's a cat.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.500
Yea, fuckin well done!

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.990
You looked on the back of a DVD box!

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.000
It makes even less sense

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.620
because Garfield doesn't have any reason to hate him.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.539
He's not cute, he's not a kitten,

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.800
he doesn't really even do anything that
annoying.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.110
Yet, Garfield still puts them

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.780
through this incredibly implausible
mousetrap stunt.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.620
Come to papa, baby!

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.740
Got milk?

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.500
Wow!

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.879
You're really proud of that
one, weren't you?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.520
I mean, it wasn't like a side joke or
something you said under your breath.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.660
No, no. You made sure everything went quiet

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.640
to deliver that incredible zinger.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.780
Got Milk?

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.620
Ow, BAM!

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.880
It's a thing that said

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.440
and now you said it! It worked on so many levels!

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.420
Hey, hey, I got one.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I know I'm only
five minutes in,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.840
but I can just tell pain is guaranteed on this viewing.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.280
It actually says it on the ticket stub

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.080
as required by the FCC.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.200
Mouse! Get 'em, Garfield!

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.620
So 'The font of fungus'

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.720
also spends his
time socializing with the mouse named Louis.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.040
Louis, what are you doing in the house

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.140
when John's home?

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.980
Sorry Garfield and I couldn't help it.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.960
Jon got those macadamia nut cookies.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.080
I'm trying to maintain...

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.260
As long as you understand, I have to eat you.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.100
You know, this conversation is so believable...

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.620
I mean,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.360
between 'The Annoying Orange' trifle I know isn't there,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.149
and the mouse that's clearly being tortured by someone waving cheese above him,

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.760
I'm really enjoying how these two fake effects

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.020
are not distracting from the moment at all.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.560
He also enjoys, as you've probably
observed,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.940
making really forced jokes.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.620
That cat is everywhere. TV,
newspapers, t-shirts...

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.480
who would want that kind of exposure?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.580
Well, if it leads to a cinematic testicle
chop like this,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.769
I suppose no one.

00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.360
Let's go for a ride to someplace you love.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.720
It always leaves you feeling pampered and refreshed.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.180
Chuck E Cheese...Wendy's?

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.000
Taco Kitty? Olive Garden for you?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.260
What about product placement?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.840
Are we going to product placement?

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.920
I heard they had really good 'Buy this shit!'

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.160
He takes 'The pumpkin cancer' to a vet named Liz

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.560
played by Jennifer Love Hewitt.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.140
Some part of me

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.420
always wanted to know what it'd be like

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.459
to have a pet that actually wants to play with you?

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:22.720
You're a good friend.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.510
And you probably noticed the main problem with her as

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.670
it's the exact same problem with Jon

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.780
they're both too good-looking and bland.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.700
Don't get me wrong...

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.240
both these two have 
done good stuff in other films, but...

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.899
who is Jon? He's a doofus,

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:37.080
he's a dork, he's a loser that always
strikes out.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.740
Who is Liz? She's a cynic,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.480
she's a smart mouth,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.660
she doesn't care to impress anyone, especially him.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.420
Here...

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.800
they are fucking greeting card
commercial.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.820
They're not funny, they're not smart,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.020
they're not quirky,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.060
and their chemistry is about as convincing as this

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.550
nurse holding 'a wad of lifeless air'.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.380
Oh sorry, Garfield.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.640
But Liz decides to
give John a dog.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.760
Kinda random.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.040
His name's Odie.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.240
and he's not gonna make it

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.060
if he has to live his life in the cage.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.920
He needs to be loved.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.540
Ok, ok...couple of things. One:

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.760
There's gotta be a ton of dogs around
there that don't have homes.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.120
What makes this one so special?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.080
Second: Fuck you, that's not Odie!

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.450
I mean what the hell?

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.510
If Garfield can look like a
computer-generated abortion, why can't

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.300
Odie look more like the cartoon?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.200
For fuck's sake, at least make him like a

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.080
beagle or a basset hound.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.339
I mean...what the piss is this?

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:26.480
Are you trying to go for the Goomba Award

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.100
and making something that looks like something

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.320
not looks like something?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.900
How come the majority of the characters

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.220
look nothing like the ones they were based on?

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.840
It be like totally changing
characters around here.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.840
Right, Santa Christ?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.040
Yeah, whatever bitch.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.260
Fuck you hoe,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.960
I got a rocket ship and a Harley.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.860
Wow, he sure is acting strange. Isn't he, Devil Boner?

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.000
Oh yeah, totally strange....

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.800
Devil Boner?

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.700
I'm definitely Devil Boner.

00:10:50.709 --> 00:10:53.900
You wouldn't call me Devil Boner if I
wasn't double boner, right?

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.940
Well, I guess

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.290
I can't fault you on that logic.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.520
What do you think, Uncle Yo?

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.360
I don't really know what you mean!

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.080
I'm still a high pitch New York Jew stereotype you all grown to love!

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.120
OW! I guess I stepped on my foot!

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.300
OW! That's going to ruin my day....

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.540
Nope, you're seem exactly the same!

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.420
(The REAL Uncle Yo)

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.640
That son of a bitch!

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.280
I knew I kept that gun for the Ponyo review for good reason.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.360
Time for a sudden crossover!

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.820
Ow, ow, ow, I stepped on my own foot...

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.300
This is going to ruin my day...

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.860
So they take Odie home to Jon's Hollywood rich house,

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.480
paid by no see-able occupation,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.320
where Odie and 'The Lorax's butt'

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.300
don't seem to get along.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.140
You can tell of course because they have....

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.900
a dance-off...

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.940
is that we step out of here.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.960
Is that butt broken?

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.680
Walk this way, please. I'm a walking yarn.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.940
Well, I hope you're blown away by this

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.080
folks because it takes up a good couple of minutes...

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.300
You probably should have practiced in
the garage,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.380
before you stepped up to someone of my level.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.500
Yeah...Have you ever wanted to entertain your baby

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.700
while punishing him at the same time?

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.500
Just show 'Q'bert's nutsack'

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.660
dancing here and it will give him nightmares for a week.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.080
Oh, come on with that.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.660
I never thought of saying this before, but...

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.720
you could be watching actual cat videos

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.370
and probably get a lot more out of it.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.567
So Jon and Liz take Odie to a dog show
that she has to judge.

00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:27.700
Oh, are they gonna try to submit him or something?

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.940
No, they just brought him so he can watch.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.920
Bizarrely useless.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.940
But Charmander's pubic hair follows and naturally gets in trouble.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.120
I'll catch up with you.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.580
It's probably just a mild concussion or maybe I'll get a CAT scan....

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.620
A CAT scan

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.120
Quick vote.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.240
Um, do you think the writer work hours on that joke?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.960
Like stayed up super late at night coffee after coffee

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.000
trying to perfect that joke?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.580
Or, do you feel he ate some paper,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.700
drink some ink, and farted out a screenplay?

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.000
I am watched by good people.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.140
The dogs chase Wilford Brimley's
urine-stained mustache while Odie gets up

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.779
and starts to do...this...

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.840
It's certainly have a no-star in the arena.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.240
Ladies and gentlemen, this is amazing.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.220
I guess it is kind of amazing.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.900
I mean can science explain this:

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.220
A dog on his hind legs?

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.920
It just never happens.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.640
This is amazing.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.460
I mean...fuck the butt ugly cat that can
do karate moves, dance,

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.220
utterly beyond any realm of reality,

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.580
this dog is on his hind legs!

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.400
Of course it deserves a standing ovation! What are we, just blind to miracles?

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.680
The front page of the newspaper! Naturally! This is big news people!

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.640
A dog stood on his hind legs!

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.060
This is amazing!

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.120
Let's see what else they'll applaud. Oh look, shiny keys!

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.660
My fingernails!

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.620
Air!

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.760
Well, I think we found our real headline:

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.120
Town High as Hell!

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.060
Now it's starting to see why Garfield eats so much.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.700
So 'Tony the Tiger's Taint' accidentally
knocked over the world's most accident-prone room.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.620
Leading to Jon
putting him outside.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.120
But wait...

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.780
he puts the cat outside?

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.040
That's really fucking dangerous.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.160
You know me. I'm too lazy to try to destroy your house.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.060
Yeah I'm too lazy to destroy a house,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.160
but not have several dance sequences.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.520
You can't kick me out of my own house

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.740
like I'm some kind of animal...

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.920
Thanks for a lack of collar by the way in case I get lost.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.460
You're a seriously terrible owner.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.600
âª I used to have...Jon to myself.... âª

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.480
Oh...it's a musical now! Fuck you!

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.440
But the 'Star Fox ass hair' locks Odie outside...

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.760
causing him to run away.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.280
This leads to him being found by a

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.400
greedy TV show host looking to bank on his popularity.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.660
As you can see, Jon and
Liz are really torn up about it.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.840
We can't go out tonight.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.040
Why not?

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.620
Odie's run away.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.360
What?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.020
That almost made me change my facial expression.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.280
If I cared, I'd be really upset.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.360
I can't find him .

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.860
Why didn't you just tell me?

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.000
I guess I figured...

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.800
it was the only reason you're spending time with me.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.580
Wow...I really believe they were asked to say those lines.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.340
So they go looking for Odie,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.220
but 'The Wet Oompa Loompa armpit' sees him on TV.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.590
You're going to miss this!

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.080
He's the small one! The small on in guy's hand!

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.880
Christ, can I take this time to say that the product placement in this film is

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.730
not only bad, it's Man of Steel bad?

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.540
It's Fucking Everywhere!

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.360
Not only is it
in every scene in the movie,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.240
but it's in areas you wouldn't even see in real life!

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.920
Who the fuck puts Pepsi and Wendy's stickers on their train set?

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.420
Or...

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.560
did Pepsi actually say to their marketing team,

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.380
"You know what market we haven't tapped yet?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.800
Train sets.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.740
I mean...I was going to invest in this animated cat movie,

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.460
but the more I think about it,

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.920
we gotta go where the real goal is.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.860
Tiny little signs and this incredibly popular demographic."

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.020
I think you have something there.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.880
Thank You, Wendy!

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.320
So 'Tigger's colon' decides

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.020
he's gonna try to find Odie himself.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.320
"No...can't do this..."

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.740
Yeah, he's barely at the house.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.900
He's barely out the house.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.140
He's barely out the house...

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:43.940
He's barely out the....

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.040
yeah, let me just look at...yeah, he's barely out the house.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.640
If we guess the joke's before they happen,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.980
can we make the movie go faster?

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.120
He gets the help of his friend, Louis,
who's now in the city.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.460
You know, those commuting suburbia to Big City rats.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.340
As he points out where Odie is being held.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.980
I guess we'll just purge the system.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.800
Don't you love those vents that just
take one button

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.060
to purge the system?

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.920
Hey, don't question 'The Purge', it just works.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.260
I'm just going to choose to ignore this.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.540
I don't need anyone to know I was in a Garfield movie.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.680
He finds Odie, only to discover the owner is using

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.760
an illegal collar to control him.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.120
And...

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.340
also works for the President of the United States.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.720
Um....

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.880
how does that work?

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.860
We have to make a
deal with Iran to get more electric collars.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.740
Now,

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.360
some of you might see this as...

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.300
controversial.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.120
But, Bo needs to stop wetting the bed.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.360
&lt;dog barking&gt;

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.720
&lt;dog gets shocked&gt;

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.360
See?

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.980
Pays for itself.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.820
Odie's taken away but 'Starfire's moldy cooch' isn't ready to give up.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.820
Dead.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.440
Let's have a moment of silence from the audience.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.679
Oh wait, you're watching 'Garfield'.

00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:07.020
There's been nothing but moments of silence from the audience.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.060
My life has been saved by the miracle of lasagna.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.290
Is it too late to be a Garfield

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.740
minus Garfield movie?

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.260
He of course survives,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.780
but gets captured by a dog catcher and put in the pound.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.700
Yeah that's right, carry that nothing.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.020
It's so looks like you're trying to pretend

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.340
that something is there.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.400
Don't worry, these animators will get great jobs in Jurassic World.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.060
But 'Heathcliff vomit' frees everybody,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.900
allowing him a distraction to escape.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.559
Thus, he goes to save Odie at the train
station, where he's being taken away.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.880
What will you be having today?

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.640
Salmon, steak or lasagna?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.240
Steak

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320
I hate lasagna.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.980
Oh, now we know he's the bad guy.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.200
Not kidnapping the dog

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.280
pulling it through a bunch of tortures.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.000
No, it's the fact that he doesn't love lasagna.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.500
In case you're wondering...

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.040
no, this never comes into play again.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.400
You think Garfield would knock a bunch of lasagna onto him or something.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.760
But no, it's an entirely pointless line.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.020
It's like Shredder in the Ninja Turtles movie

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.740
suddenly saying....

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.200
I hate pizza.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.100
Just to let you know that.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.800
Well you act like a jerk sometimes.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.060
To stop the train, he sneaks into the control panel

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.580
and he starts randomly pushing buttons

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.600
controlling every single train.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.620
Because, yeah, that's how it works.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.220
I think I recognize that whine.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.160
It's similar to the people who want
their money back.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.740
Good to see you partner

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.000
But the villain comes in and stop them because...

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.300
clearly neither of them could jump over that suitcase.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.500
Just to recap, easy...

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.640
impossible to get over.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.190
This movie has a
'Masters of What the Fuckery'.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.160
Let's see how you feel with 200 volts

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.720
coursing through that thick canine skull of yours.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.880
Well I can't possibly find another dog

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.120
who stands on his hind legs.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.659
You're like the Jesus of canines.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.040
But the animals he free from the pound show up to save the day

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.440
Ok....they don't kill him, but

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.240
they do put a stop to his evil plan

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.480
just as Jon and Liz show up to pretty much contribute nothing.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.460
So, basically like the rest of the film.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.960
"Garfield! Odie!"

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.400
Come here you sack of air you...

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.840
And because this movie had so many good idea that

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.280
they couldn't film the thematic running time,

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.460
here's a completely pointless dancing...

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.820
âª Wow, I feel Good! I knew that I would...âª

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.940
Yeah it literally ties into nothing.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.980
It just cuts to him dancing out of nowhere.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.560
And that was 'Garfield' the movie

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.440
How does it hold up?

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.400
I think Bill Murray said it best.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.300
You have any regrets?

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.640
Garfield maybe...

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.160
Garfield is a great character.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.240
In many respects,

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.540
he's kind of an immortal.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.500
Much like the Looney Tunes or Mickey Mouse,

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.800
even if when he's not funny,

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.800
we'll still watch him because he's

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.520
timeless and will last forever.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.520
That's how good a character he is.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.120
This....

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.160
in no way represents any of that.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.340
It's the wrong mood, the wrong look,

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.520
the wrong feel, and the wrong humor.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.860
I love this character even to this day.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.760
And usually when they don't get them right,

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.880
I still love it because

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.360
he's so easy to love.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.860
This is the first time I actually felt betrayed.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.300
Trust me, I seen him
poorly represented before,

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.920
but I still kind of bought it.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.140
Because when that stuff failed,

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.780
it's still at least tried to represent the heart and spirit of

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.180
what Garfield was.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.370
Here, you feel every lazy,

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.100
manipulative, empty, corporate whoring second

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.240
like you're watching a funeral at a pet cemetery.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.160
I will still always love Garfield,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.640
but only when some element of care,

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.540
even the tiniest bit, is put in.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.740
As far as I'm concerned,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.040
I don't see any of that effort here.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.620
Therefore, I don't see Garfield.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.080
And I'm pretty good at spotting the real thing.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.520
Speaking of which...

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.740
Action...

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:13.880
or don't.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.740
We don't care.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.780
it's a dog-eat-dog world boy.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.320
NOOOOO!!!!!!

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.160
It's lead-tasting time, assholes!

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.520
Oooh, I am so bad as well....

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.240
Who the hell was that?

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.320
Beats me.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.600
This is amazing!

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.560
Maybe I'll get a cat scan. A CAT scan
