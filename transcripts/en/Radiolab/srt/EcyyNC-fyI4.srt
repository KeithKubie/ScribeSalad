1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,500
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today, oh,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,610
I dunno what we're talking about.
We're in a doubtful state of mind.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,360
Constant doubt. That's the topic.
Yes. Like in the last chapter,

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:17,100
we met a person who had a real a doubt
pile up. He lost his faith in God.

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:18,000
He lost his girl.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,660
This may be an extreme
example of something that
we all go through every day,

7
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,201
right? Yeah.

8
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:25,830
I mean you wake up and then you have to
get something done and then some little

9
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,950
voice inside you says, you know,
you can't do this. Sure about this,

10
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:32,730
but still you gotta act cause you're an
adult. So what do you do in that case?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,380
How do you act without the
feeling of certainty? Hello? Hi,

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,570
Mr Sanny. Yes. Okay. And we met someone
who thinks about this all the time.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,060
This is an area that I'm
pretty well versed in.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,300
Would this be your stock in
trade? This would be very much so.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,990
Her name is Annie Duke.
I'm a decision strategist.

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,650
But you might know her better
as a bad ass poker player.

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,350
Well in 2004 I won a bracelet
which is a a world championship.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,460
I also won the tournament of champions
that year. That was the cheers one a lot.

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,320
Now when we call up Annie,

20
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:10,200
we had this idea about poker that
I think a lot of people have,

21
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:15,201
which is that it's like this game
about tills like reading your opponent,

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,470
watching the way their nose quivers so
that you can tell when they're bluffing

23
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:22,200
or when they've got a good hand. Nope.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,170
Taos are actually a very
small part of the game fact.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,200
She says they often backfire.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,250
I remember the first tournament
I played after it was on TV,

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,870
I had a hand that was kind of a close
decision and this guy moved all of his

28
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,910
chips into the pot and God,

29
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:42,930
he was just confident like I could see
like he was really confident in his hand,

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,130
so I threw my hand away.

31
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,570
But then in a subsequent game she sees
the same guy doing exactly the same

32
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:52,500
thing. He pushes all his chips in
looking super confident. I was like, wow,

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,990
he must have like a crazy
hand, like two aces.

34
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,920
And he turns his hand over face
up and he's super confident in it.

35
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,250
And it was a really bad hand. It was
just the hand that he thought was good.

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,520
So the problem for me was that
I read him totally correctly,

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,350
but what I didn't understand
was that he didn't,

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,680
let's call him inexperienced, he didn't
know what a good hand or a bad hand was.

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,490
But then you get players who are a
little bit more experienced and sometimes

40
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,150
they would do what's called a reverse
towel. Is it like a double fake? Right?

41
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,240
They'd basically pretend
to be overconfident.

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,810
So she think they're dumb and I'm in
the Biz. They call that hollywooding.

43
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,450
So she says, unless you've
played someone a million times,

44
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:34,290
it's really hard to know how to read
them and what's worse. The good players,

45
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,390
they do nothing. Doing nothing is the
best choice, which you try to disappear.

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,430
You pick a spot on the table, stare at it.

47
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,760
What do you do in the case where
there aren't any signals to read?

48
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,450
And the only thing you really
know is that you know nothing.

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Well actually what you sort of figure
out is that you don't need to know.

50
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,150
The real breakthrough moment for me
was when I stopped trying to figure out

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,290
anything with certainty. And here
any laid out a way of thinking,

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,950
I just leave caming doubt that
we find completely fascinating.

53
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,300
And that has paid off for her to the
tune of about $4 million. Huh. Well,

54
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,680
you know, I think that, do you
mind if we just back up? Okay.

55
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,230
Like how did you get to be
Annie Duke? Um, well I was,

56
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,920
I was born Annie letterer
and then I married someone
with the last name Duke and

57
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:28,570
thought that's much easier to be Annie
Duke. Well, I went to Columbia Undergrad,

58
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,920
double major in English literature
and Psychology, psychology.

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,520
Then I went to U Penn, studied
cognitive psychology there.

60
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:41,290
I had a national science foundation
fellowship. And then right at the end, um,

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,450
just really had this realization that
I didn't really want to be an academic

62
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,350
holy hell. Like what am
I going to do now? Okay,

63
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:53,920
well I need some money. I'll play
some poker while I'm figuring it out.

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,900
And as you played a lot of
poker to that point, no,

65
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,340
but I'd watch my brother play a lot.

66
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,910
Well she, she would come out and
she would sit behind and watch.

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,050
That's Annie's brother.

68
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,080
This is Howard Howard letter
sounds exactly like his sister,

69
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:06,070
but with a deeper voice.

70
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,310
He started mentoring me a little bit. Um,
and I started making money right away.

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,870
She was very competitive.

72
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,620
I think your mother tearing out her hair
at this point or was she agreed at that

73
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:20,210
point? My parents had just given up
hope. My brother when he was 18, he,

74
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,060
my grandfather,
grandfather had the family,

75
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:26,570
a $2,000 check for the two of
us to help with college. And um,

76
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,340
my brother gambled it away

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,050
and a little poke around in the back room.

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,400
Well that might've been the very early
phase. I was a terrible poker player.

79
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,130
It has since become a very
decorated, open player.

80
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,310
And he's also been in the news recently
because an online poker company,

81
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:42,620
he was associated with cold, full tilt.

82
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,920
So we've gotten into some
legal difficulties. But
back when he was starting,

83
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,640
so I started,

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,760
he says he would play in these tiny
little games 36 hours straight,

85
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,660
which was not atypical for me back then
and it was all very seat of the pants.

86
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,200
But I, but I, I arrived in
this wonderful situation,

87
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,270
fortunate he happened
to be learning the game,

88
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,910
which you would later teach to
his sister at a time, you know,

89
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:05,900
1983 1984 when the game
was changing radically.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,700
[inaudible]

91
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,700
poker poker was this Texas
gambler thing happening in Vegas.

92
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,370
Like the Cliche we just
talked about, you know,

93
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,100
that you play with your gut with the Texas
Dolly and Amarillo slim and who knows

94
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,190
what's going on over there. But
then like in so many other things,

95
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,230
the geeks took over.

96
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,663
Okay,

97
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,210
well, you know, there were these
games, I was playing it and I was,

98
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:35,900
people will peg the change to different
times, different places. But for Howard,

99
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,490
it began in New York. Yup. When he
joined this regular game, but huge game.

100
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,600
These are Wall Street traders,
world champion, bridge
players, brilliant people.

101
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,720
They get together after Wall Street,
closed play for about eight hours.

102
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,650
Then go to a bar and carefully deconstruct
the eight hours they just played,

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,610
you know, hey, what were you thinking in
that? Why did you do that? Why you you,

104
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:55,760
you weren't really bluffing,

105
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:58,460
but you made this big bet w
and out of those conversations

106
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,230
came the style of play that you now find
everywhere. Yeah. Hold on. Okay, let,

107
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,240
listen. If you Google the phrase
right now, hold them odds chart,

108
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,200
you're going to be able to give him,
hold him, hold him, hold him odds chart.

109
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,450
We ended up talking to our
friend Mike about all this.

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,440
My name is Mike [inaudible].

111
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:17,760
I cover sports for NPR and he's also
spent a fair amount of time in underground

112
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:18,720
poker clubs. By the way,

113
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,660
it's always a misnomer cause in New York
City they're always on the ninth floor

114
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:25,020
of an office building or something
like that. Anyway, he showed us these,

115
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,790
these charts. Yeah. Okay, and what my
God, look at this thing. What is it?

116
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,540
It's like my nightmare. It's like a
spreadsheet with tons and tons of numbers.

117
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,390
Well first I'll say this, but Mike
says, don't be afraid. These charts,

118
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,950
this is how you achieve
zen in an uncertain world.

119
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,970
Okay, let's say, let me give you a
situation. Let me give you a situation.

120
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,560
You're playing the game of hold'em
and there's only one card to come.

121
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,870
The river card that is the
last card and hold them.

122
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,960
And you figure in fact just
explained in Texas hold'em,

123
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,430
each player gets two secret cards that
they can see and the dealer puts down a

124
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:03,640
bunch of a community cards one
by one that everyone can see.

125
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,900
And the game is who can combine their
secret cards with the community cards to

126
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:09,400
make the best hand. Exactly.

127
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,500
Now say one of your secret cards
is a heart. And on the board,

128
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,480
the community cards include
three, three hearts. Okay,

129
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,260
I've got one in my hand that's for
dealers about the deal. Another card.

130
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,350
And if the last card is a heart,
well damn, I would have a flush.

131
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:31,150
So I want to know what are the
odds of me getting that last heart.

132
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,900
Every decent poker player will know
how to calculate this automatically.

133
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,090
And for the non decent ones,
Weldon, there's the chart.

134
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,330
You know there are 13 of
every suit in the deck.

135
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:42,720
You know there are 13 hearts in the
deck and there are three hearts on the

136
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:44,070
board. One of my hand.

137
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,960
That means that you can figure that
there are 30 minus three minus one nine

138
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:53,430
cards in the deck out of the 46 that we
don't know about that can complete my

139
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,220
flush. Now look at this
chart I'm looking at nine.

140
00:07:56,221 --> 00:08:01,221
Number nine is all the way to
the right nine flush draw night.

141
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,940
So when you do the odds that you wind up
having a about a 20% chance of victory

142
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,470
of getting that last heart. Yeah.

143
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,630
Uh,

144
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,200
okay. So what do you do in this
circumstance? Am I one more time?

145
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:18,030
What am I in my odds? Your odds
are 20% you bet. Do you go for it?

146
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,910
Do you stay in, be bold or
do you fold? I personally,

147
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,090
I fall totally at fault. Of course you
fall. I walk away. Get out of there.

148
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,990
I quit the game. Live to fight another
day. Exactly. No, no, no, no, no, no,

149
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,560
no. Not necessarily.

150
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,430
Every poker. And he says there are times
when 2020 5% sure means bet. Bet. Bet.

151
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,730
I know that sounds counterintuitive.
So let me explain what I mean.

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,290
And this is the none of it right here.

153
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Let's say that someone bats $100
and there's already $200 in the pot.

154
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,250
Okay? That means that for
you continue with your hand,

155
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,490
you have to put in $100.
So if you win the pot,

156
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,540
you'll win $300 and if you lose the pot,

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,680
you'll lose $100 right?
In order to break even,

158
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,700
you could lose the pot three times
because you'd lose $100 three times.

159
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:15,780
So that would be negative 300 and you
could win the pot once. That makes sense,

160
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,270
right? Cause you're going to get
300 and then you would break even.

161
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,340
So you could lose $100 on
Monday, $100 on Tuesday.

162
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:22,750
You lose another a hundred on when they,

163
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:25,900
but if you win the 300 back on
Thursday, yeah, you're good.

164
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,570
You just need to win one
out of every four times,

165
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,140
so that means that you have to
win the pot 25% of the time.

166
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,510
Those are your pot odds.

167
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:37,750
Pot odds are what dictates good bets.

168
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,810
The amount that's in the pot determines
how certain you have to be that your

169
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:41,620
hand is good,

170
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,620
which is a really cool concept I think
because if you're pot odds are 25% and

171
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:51,280
all you really need to be is 25%
sure that you have a good hand,

172
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,120
which you are in the hearts case.
Sometimes you have to be 40% sure.

173
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,960
Sometimes you have to be 30% sure you
know if there's $70 in the pot and you

174
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:02,830
only have to call 10 you know now
you're in the 15% range in terms of how

175
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:05,410
certain you have to be. That
your hand is good. In that case,

176
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:09,400
you can bet this hand that you really
not sure about knowing that while you

177
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:13,390
might lose this time, if I do that
a million times in my poker life,

178
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,450
the law of high numbers indicates that
I'm going to be very much a winner in the

179
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:20,950
long run. It might be the very long run,

180
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,010
but you should be ahead in
the long run because it's not.

181
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,930
It's not about winning
the hand all the time.

182
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:27,640
It's about winning the
hand enough at the time.

183
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,350
That is what she got watching her brother.

184
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,970
I'm sure that I'm just quoting him and
that's warm comfort. I mean that's,

185
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,430
that's weird. So the man,

186
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,110
the probabilities or what you
carry it care about most. Yeah,

187
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:42,970
because that sort of embracing
of uncertainty [inaudible]
some really wonderful

188
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:43,804
things for you.

189
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,580
If you're in a situation where you only
have to have the best hand 25% of the

190
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,510
time. If you're playing well, you're going
to have a bad hand a lot of the time.

191
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,553
It's okay.

192
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,820
It's actually a relevant and that's
really the big bonus of this way of

193
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:58,211
thinking.

194
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:03,211
You begin to learn how to avoid that
very human tendency to feel shamed.

195
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,930
There is when you lose, you
just float right above it.

196
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,730
If you're making good decisions,
then you're making good decisions.

197
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,340
You have to be somewhat outcome blind, but

198
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,440
sometimes that's not so
easy. Yeah. [inaudible]

199
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,710
there is no event on the planet like it.

200
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,570
2004 the world series of poker,
biggest tournament in all of poker.

201
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,970
What a tournament this is,
they handle emotionally.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,700
Three people at the table
and he Duke. This guy,

203
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:40,170
Phil Hellmuth is a big player
and and his brother Howard,

204
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,650
they've played together for so
long. It never for 2 million,

205
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:46,520
never been in this type of
position. The 2 million is an alive,

206
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,550
they get their cards and hey,
Duke was sixes. I had two.

207
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Six is pretty good hand and she'll open
with 70,000 big fat opening bet over to

208
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:59,370
Phil. Phil thinks no,

209
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,750
they'll help me with immediately
gets out of the way again.

210
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,170
He folds over to our letter room and
here's where things get interesting.

211
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:08,800
Instead of folding like that Guy
Phil, my brother moved in on me.

212
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,550
Howard goes all in against his sister.

213
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,350
Decision now to Andy with the pocket
sixes. Any things? Should I stay in?

214
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,600
Should I bail? Well, mathematically,

215
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,130
two six is actually rates to be
the best hand there. So brother,

216
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,760
it's on. Yeah. However,

217
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:31,600
when they turn over their
cards and remember she has
two sixes actually he's got

218
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:35,800
a seven and it turned out he had two
seven. Yup. That's what he wants.

219
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:39,430
A four to one favorite. And
Annie knows she's in trouble,

220
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,350
her brother in a commanding position
and he was 82% to win the hand.

221
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,780
They both knew that if they
play this hand a hundred times,

222
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,460
he's gonna win about 82 of them.

223
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,580
The only thing that can save her is if
the dealer now turns over a sixth is 18%

224
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:58,390
chance and here comes the flop.

225
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,380
Dealer turns, blueprints, the cards
and he gets her six at a full house.

226
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,910
Oh God.

227
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,911
And she immediately feels horrendous
for her brother and I won the hand.

228
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,710
And that's the end of the
line for a Howard Lederer,

229
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,640
Annie Duke Knox or big
brother out in the video.

230
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:23,440
You see her getting up from the
table? She hugs her brother.

231
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,140
Oh, this is very difficult
for Annie. I want to,

232
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,050
you see her emotions and you must
have mixed about that failure.

233
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,360
Look, I was 82% when that pot.
That was incredibly, I'm like,

234
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,130
yeah, and she my sister too.
I taught her how to do that.

235
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,340
Yeah, no, I wanted to win that
hand. That's, that's for sure. I,

236
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:54,760
I was upset when my mom watched that.

237
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,950
She called me up and she was
like in tears and she was like,

238
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:00,460
how could you knock your brother out
of the tournament? And I was like,

239
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,710
I now I know your favorite
is now. Here's the thing.

240
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:09,550
If you, if your superior
cards do not win the day,

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,690
you know we have vocabulary to deal
with that. It's called a bad beat.

242
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,883
A bad beat.

243
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,390
A bad beat is when you had the cards
that should've won and you got beat. Wow.

244
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,580
There's a term that should
catch on right there. If,

245
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,100
say in stock investing you
were to say, look, you,

246
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,600
you invested for all the right reasons,

247
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:28,030
but the stock went down because someone
you'd never heard of shorted it.

248
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,770
That was a bad beat. Do you know
what, I wonder what, like, you know,

249
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:37,150
this whole, uh, rigorous
probabilistic way of thinking,

250
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,460
is that something that you just acquire
once you know the math or do you have to

251
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:46,350
first be of a certain cast of mind
in order to Kinda get into it? Well,

252
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,820
that's, I'm not sure it would work for me.

253
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,800
You have to be from a pretty unusual
family techno to get constellation that

254
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,770
I'll tell you what our
family's like. So, um,

255
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,070
my brother and my brother in law
both knew my boyfriend before we,

256
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,750
me and my boyfriend started
dating. OK. And they,

257
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,850
when they found out we
were going on a date,

258
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,860
they made a market for what
the probability was that
we would actually end up

259
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:14,810
together together. That he
was willing to give me $27.

260
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,810
If they get married, I
have to give him a hundred.

261
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,970
I was offering 73 to 27 what is
wrong with you? And I was like,

262
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:26,990
are you insane? We haven't gone
on a date together. Exactly.

263
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,070
They've never gone on a date yet.
I made one of the best bets ever.

264
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,030
I assume you'd be happy to lose
that then. I'm going to be,

265
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:39,190
I'm going to be thrilled. But, but
that's how gamblers think. I mean,

266
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,020
it's not a bad way or
taints anything, it's just,

267
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,980
that's the way that we memorialize the
fact that we had a fundamental difference

268
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:46,814
of opinion

269
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,250
that works. You know,

270
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,990
if you're bidding on your sister's
marital status I suppose, but if,

271
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,730
if it's, uh, if it's bigger stakes,

272
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:06,780
like going back to the beginning of the
program where we were concerned with the

273
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,920
presence or on presence of God,
that's not a mathematical thing.

274
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,150
Oh, well I'm not so
sure that's true, Sarah.

275
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,170
And what'd you like to say
something? They're there. You know,

276
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,130
there was a guy named Pascal, I don't
know if you've ever heard of them.

277
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,450
They have who thought that
you could do exactly that.

278
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,300
So he was one of the first
thinkers of probability.

279
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,740
So all this stuff we've
been talking about,

280
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:32,120
but he at some point was also struggling
with the question of God and he

281
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,020
couldn't decide for sure.

282
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,170
He always thought there was a chance
that he did exist, a chance he didn't.

283
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:39,260
So he didn't know what to do. So
he came up with an idea. He said,

284
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,850
if I decided to believe him, him
[inaudible] all right. In that scenario,

285
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,100
if he exists eternal
forever, happy, happy.

286
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,340
If you believe in him and he
happens to be there, then you win.

287
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,460
You win the pot big time
forever. Like infinite. Now,

288
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:57,390
if I decide to not believe in
God, that's my other option.

289
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,150
[inaudible] and now I'm a not believer.

290
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,860
If he does exist and you don't believe
very, very, very infinite, bad,

291
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,920
eternal damnation forever, you
go to hell, then you go to hell.

292
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,500
So there's a huge infinite payoff to
believing in God and there's an infinite

293
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,960
downside to not believing in God the
pot eyes. So no matter how I speak, yes,

294
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,380
because no matter how unlikely
it is that God actually exists,

295
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,210
this is like Annie having an infinite
amount of money on the table.

296
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,900
No matter how bad her cards are, how
unlikely is she thinks she'll win?

297
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,900
You gotta Bet. You have to bet the pot.

298
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:37,780
Odds are saying that you must
believe in God is what you're is.

299
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,790
That's what Pascal said. Pascal said,

300
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,960
if you do the math the way Andy
does the math, believe in God.

301
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,050
What are the pot odds on God? But
that's ridiculous, by the way. You know?

302
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,010
That's ridiculous. [inaudible]
why? Because you've Kels,

303
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,450
faith is lesser his.

304
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,990
His belief in God because he got to it
through math is somehow lesser than,

305
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,560
I don't know, say Saint Augustine or
someone you were spending less because,

306
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,330
because we're talking here about
grace and love and being connected,

307
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,280
and it's, it is.

308
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,850
It is a daredevily heart of
your hearts full of emotion.

309
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,790
That's what rules here,
and that's what guide you.

310
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,160
It is not calculating the odds.

311
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,360
The od Sir looking pretty
a divine right now.
