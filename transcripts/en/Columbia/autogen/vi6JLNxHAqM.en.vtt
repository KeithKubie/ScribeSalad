large gathering it looks great so many

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519
large gathering it looks great so many

large gathering it looks great so many
people interested in this topic I have

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590
people interested in this topic I have
 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.560
people interested in this topic I have
to say my my talk has changed almost

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570
to say my my talk has changed almost
 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.420
to say my my talk has changed almost
completely from what I started out

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430
completely from what I started out
 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.030
completely from what I started out
trying to put together this talk a few

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040
trying to put together this talk a few
 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.250
trying to put together this talk a few
weeks ago where I was focused on what

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260
weeks ago where I was focused on what
 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.689
weeks ago where I was focused on what
are the issues what are we trying to do

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699
are the issues what are we trying to do
 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.460
are the issues what are we trying to do
what are our goals what are we trying to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470
what are our goals what are we trying to
 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.649
what are our goals what are we trying to
get to because of all of the interest

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659
get to because of all of the interest
 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.030
get to because of all of the interest
and all the things that we've come out

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040
and all the things that we've come out
 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.209
and all the things that we've come out
since then I'm bypassing what our goals

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219
since then I'm bypassing what our goals
 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.939
since then I'm bypassing what our goals
are together and let's say the people at

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949
are together and let's say the people at
 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.560
are together and let's say the people at
least most of us here I think we're

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570
least most of us here I think we're
 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.200
least most of us here I think we're
together I'm saying let's like put it as

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210
together I'm saying let's like put it as
 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.460
together I'm saying let's like put it as
an assumption that we know what

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470
an assumption that we know what
 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.749
an assumption that we know what
motivates that we have to share data

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759
motivates that we have to share data
 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.150
motivates that we have to share data
right so let's not spend time I saw I've

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160
right so let's not spend time I saw I've
 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
right so let's not spend time I saw I've
taken out of my talk the motivation for

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170
taken out of my talk the motivation for
 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.050
taken out of my talk the motivation for
why we share data why we want to share

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060
why we share data why we want to share
 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.609
why we share data why we want to share
research data what we try to get out of

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619
research data what we try to get out of
 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.399
research data what we try to get out of
that and focus instead on two problems

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409
that and focus instead on two problems
 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.350
that and focus instead on two problems
that are growing with trying to share

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360
that are growing with trying to share
 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.840
that are growing with trying to share
data and I specifically focus on that in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850
data and I specifically focus on that in
 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.969
data and I specifically focus on that in
the spirit of brainstorming say okay

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979
the spirit of brainstorming say okay
 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.800
the spirit of brainstorming say okay
here's some ideas about how we might get

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810
here's some ideas about how we might get
 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.289
here's some ideas about how we might get
over those problems and that's basically

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299
over those problems and that's basically
 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.600
over those problems and that's basically
the point of my talk as opposed to all

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610
the point of my talk as opposed to all
 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.520
the point of my talk as opposed to all
of the process stuff that I've usually

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530
of the process stuff that I've usually
 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.170
of the process stuff that I've usually
given talks about so let's start with

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180
given talks about so let's start with
 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.760
given talks about so let's start with
those common assumptions right that we

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770
those common assumptions right that we
 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.380
those common assumptions right that we
need to share data we need to put them

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390
need to share data we need to put them
 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.270
need to share data we need to put them
in repositories discipline-specific I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280
in repositories discipline-specific I
 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.440
in repositories discipline-specific I
want to come back to that a little bit

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450
want to come back to that a little bit
 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.569
want to come back to that a little bit
as opposed to sort of like just a

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579
as opposed to sort of like just a
 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.340
as opposed to sort of like just a
neutral repositories that don't don't

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350
neutral repositories that don't don't
 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.609
neutral repositories that don't don't
have metadata with them or something

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
have metadata with them or something
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.050
have metadata with them or something
controlled vocabulary so that you can

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060
controlled vocabulary so that you can
 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.660
controlled vocabulary so that you can
join them up and do analytics on them

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670
join them up and do analytics on them
 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.730
join them up and do analytics on them
normalized etc so that you can do

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740
normalized etc so that you can do
 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.310
normalized etc so that you can do
something larger with the data play into

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320
something larger with the data play into
 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.469
something larger with the data play into
the all of the hype around big data if

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479
the all of the hype around big data if
 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.330
the all of the hype around big data if
you will but I'll talk a little bit more

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340
you will but I'll talk a little bit more
 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.179
you will but I'll talk a little bit more
about that so right now the problem

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189
about that so right now the problem
 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.310
about that so right now the problem
number one is a small portion of data

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320
number one is a small portion of data
 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.840
number one is a small portion of data
are being shared right so that's why

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850
are being shared right so that's why
 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.520
are being shared right so that's why
part of why we're here and there's lots

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530
part of why we're here and there's lots
 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.640
part of why we're here and there's lots
of reasons for that and so there's lots

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
of reasons for that and so there's lots
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.830
of reasons for that and so there's lots
of barriers to sharing the data lots of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
of barriers to sharing the data lots of
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.780
of barriers to sharing the data lots of
things that prevent researchers from

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790
things that prevent researchers from
 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.849
things that prevent researchers from
openly sharing their data making them

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859
openly sharing their data making them
 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.620
openly sharing their data making them
available right away lots of issues

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
available right away lots of issues
 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.500
available right away lots of issues
going on there and so maybe we can think

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510
going on there and so maybe we can think
 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.090
going on there and so maybe we can think
brainstorm a couple of ideas about how

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100
brainstorm a couple of ideas about how
 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.800
brainstorm a couple of ideas about how
to get over some of those barriers part

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810
to get over some of those barriers part
 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.630
to get over some of those barriers part
of my talk will be about that and then

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640
of my talk will be about that and then
 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.800
of my talk will be about that and then
there are problems with sustainable

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810
there are problems with sustainable
 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.569
there are problems with sustainable
funding for those databases which are

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579
funding for those databases which are
 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.490
funding for those databases which are
growing enormously the data themselves

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
growing enormously the data themselves
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.530
growing enormously the data themselves
growing at least I doubling every year

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540
growing at least I doubling every year
 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.350
growing at least I doubling every year
and the databases themselves

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
and the databases themselves
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.330
and the databases themselves
even in some of the hot areas going

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
even in some of the hot areas going
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.240
even in some of the hot areas going
between 10 and even upwards percent of

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
between 10 and even upwards percent of
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.570
between 10 and even upwards percent of
number of databases per year so there's

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580
number of databases per year so there's
 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.070
number of databases per year so there's
obviously we're heading towards a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
obviously we're heading towards a
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.660
obviously we're heading towards a
funding issues for keeping them going

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
funding issues for keeping them going
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.750
funding issues for keeping them going
and I'll talk a little bit about that so

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760
and I'll talk a little bit about that so
 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.550
and I'll talk a little bit about that so
the point of my presentation so after

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
the point of my presentation so after
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.930
the point of my presentation so after
this you can go to sleep which is why I

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
this you can go to sleep which is why I
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.450
this you can go to sleep which is why I
made the the slides back the main points

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460
made the the slides back the main points
 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.730
made the the slides back the main points
of presentation is we can we can remove

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740
of presentation is we can we can remove
 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.790
of presentation is we can we can remove
some of the barriers by sort really

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800
some of the barriers by sort really
 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.770
some of the barriers by sort really
developing rigorous processes and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
developing rigorous processes and
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.990
developing rigorous processes and
rigorous controlled vocabularies and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
rigorous controlled vocabularies and
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.360
rigorous controlled vocabularies and
everything and get simplicity and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
everything and get simplicity and
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.090
everything and get simplicity and
efficiency out of doing data management

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
efficiency out of doing data management
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.880
efficiency out of doing data management
well and most importantly providing

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
well and most importantly providing
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.979
well and most importantly providing
credit and the right credit applications

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989
credit and the right credit applications
 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.690

back to the researcher for doing that

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
back to the researcher for doing that
 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.280
back to the researcher for doing that
sharing and tracking that and so forth

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
sharing and tracking that and so forth
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.290
sharing and tracking that and so forth
there's a lot to be done in that space

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300
there's a lot to be done in that space
 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.120
there's a lot to be done in that space
but but it's something that we I think

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130
but but it's something that we I think
 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.770
but but it's something that we I think
that we've got a fair handle on Lisa

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
that we've got a fair handle on Lisa
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.780
that we've got a fair handle on Lisa
start and I think it's also possible to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
start and I think it's also possible to
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.430
start and I think it's also possible to
create sustainable funding models for

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440
create sustainable funding models for
 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.020
create sustainable funding models for
some of these databases and there's a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030
some of these databases and there's a
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.150
some of these databases and there's a
couple of well maybe the radical maybe

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160
couple of well maybe the radical maybe
 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.949
couple of well maybe the radical maybe
they're not ideas that about how we

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
they're not ideas that about how we
 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.370
they're not ideas that about how we
might work together to do that so big

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
might work together to do that so big
 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.990
might work together to do that so big
data versus research data a lot of

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000
data versus research data a lot of
 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.640
data versus research data a lot of
people there's so much hype around big

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650
people there's so much hype around big
 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.229
people there's so much hype around big
data huge datasets and a lot of science

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239
data huge datasets and a lot of science
 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.640

doesn't have large data sets they have

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650
doesn't have large data sets they have
 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.050
doesn't have large data sets they have
small dates that they may have many of

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060
small dates that they may have many of
 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.729
small dates that they may have many of
them but they have small data sets but

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739
them but they have small data sets but
 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.110
them but they have small data sets but
also the emphasis is a little bit

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120
also the emphasis is a little bit
 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.170
also the emphasis is a little bit
different so if we take this is the life

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180
different so if we take this is the life
 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.210
different so if we take this is the life
cycle the data one data life cycle that

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220

we've structured our symposium around

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190
we've structured our symposium around
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.930
we've structured our symposium around
and the the big data focus tends to be

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940
and the the big data focus tends to be
 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.210
and the the big data focus tends to be
on well if we had all these data we had

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220
on well if we had all these data we had
 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.610
on well if we had all these data we had
them all together maybe I should tip

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
them all together maybe I should tip
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.080
them all together maybe I should tip
this up early this is what we should do

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090
this up early this is what we should do
 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.550
this up early this is what we should do
what we could do right we could analyze

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560
what we could do right we could analyze
 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.680
what we could do right we could analyze
them we could get new insights from all

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690
them we could get new insights from all
 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.449
them we could get new insights from all
of the data by putting them into a giant

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459
of the data by putting them into a giant
 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.430
of the data by putting them into a giant
repository and doing analytics on this

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440
repository and doing analytics on this
 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.080
repository and doing analytics on this
and of course I'm sure all of you are

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090
and of course I'm sure all of you are
 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.670
and of course I'm sure all of you are

conference about taking science and
 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.640
conference about taking science and
moving science forward more rapidly and

moving science forward more rapidly and
 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.930
moving science forward more rapidly and
all of that I don't want to it into that

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
all of that I don't want to it into that
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.210
all of that I don't want to it into that
height but all of that is around if we

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220
height but all of that is around if we
 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.370
height but all of that is around if we
had the data and it were normalized and

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380
had the data and it were normalized and
 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.530
had the data and it were normalized and
it were joined up and it were all of

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540
it were joined up and it were all of
 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.200
it were joined up and it were all of
these things that are very very

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210
these things that are very very
 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.630
these things that are very very
important and difficult to do to get the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640
important and difficult to do to get the
 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.480
important and difficult to do to get the
data together then we could get more

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490
data together then we could get more
 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.100
data together then we could get more
value out of them and do that kind of

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110
value out of them and do that kind of
 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.320
value out of them and do that kind of
analytics and that's a big if and in

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330
analytics and that's a big if and in
 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.089

fact research data is still back here

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099
fact research data is still back here
 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.760
fact research data is still back here
still back here with the core problems

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770
still back here with the core problems
 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.189
still back here with the core problems
of annotating the data normalizing the

okay that's maybe that's the rebound

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530
okay that's maybe that's the rebound
 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.839
okay that's maybe that's the rebound
effect or maybe that's telling me my

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849
effect or maybe that's telling me my
 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.399
effect or maybe that's telling me my
time is up I'm not quite sure what the

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409
time is up I'm not quite sure what the
 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.670
time is up I'm not quite sure what the
story is but anyway so so research data

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680
story is but anyway so so research data
 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.350

really needs to focus on different

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.089
really needs to focus on different

great analytics things we can do on the
 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.689
great analytics things we can do on the
data and again many of these datasets

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699
data and again many of these datasets
 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.879
data and again many of these datasets
are smaller so here's I just picked up

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889
are smaller so here's I just picked up
 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.020
are smaller so here's I just picked up
some random we're going to hear later

and I just highlighted a couple of

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729
and I just highlighted a couple of
 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.640
and I just highlighted a couple of
things to focus on credit right getting

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650
things to focus on credit right getting
 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.649
things to focus on credit right getting
credit back and obviously one of the key

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:48.659
credit back and obviously one of the key
 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.510
credit back and obviously one of the key

later and those data sets are being
reused as part of analytics and they

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520
reused as part of analytics and they

some examples of data repositories that
are starting to do that when somebody

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250

multiple data sets they monitor that and

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419
multiple data sets they monitor that and
 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:32.510
multiple data sets they monitor that and
they give reports back to the user that

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520
they give reports back to the user that
 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.670
they give reports back to the user that
says your data set was used for this and

says your data set was used for this and
that's clearly going to be part of the

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210
that's clearly going to be part of the
 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.209

and that's a really important thing for
 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.230
and that's a really important thing for
getting this this data going again

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240

increase that and then I've just I've

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319
increase that and then I've just I've
 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.290
increase that and then I've just I've
taken this this is one of those slides

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300
taken this this is one of those slides

and then there's also money that goes
 

00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:37.720
and then there's also money that goes
directly into the data repositories and

directly into the data repositories and
 

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.430
directly into the data repositories and
the academic institutions themselves add

money the data repositories and then the
 

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:44.080
money the data repositories and then the
white is the free you deposit your stuff

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.090
white is the free you deposit your stuff
 

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.549
white is the free you deposit your stuff
for free and you get your data out for

for free and you get your data out for
free and by the way we let corporates

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:48.590
free and by the way we let corporates
 

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.320
