00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.439
estimates my own estimates of the size
of that effect which were fairly small

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449
of that effect which were fairly small
 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.450

shift not only an increase in the amount

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
shift not only an increase in the amount
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.729
shift not only an increase in the amount
of trade but a reorientation we used to

threat now of course it's China and

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519
threat now of course it's China and
 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.729

indications are we really need to mark

indications are we really need to mark

up those effects so I'm not it's I just

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
up those effects so I'm not it's I just
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.440
up those effects so I'm not it's I just
want to say look we for some reason this

in trade with China and to a lesser
