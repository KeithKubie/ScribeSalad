Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.760
Did you ever see the movie Monsters Inc.?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.300
Of course you did. Pixar is practically
your cinematic guardian now.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.680
Anything they say, you have to pay attention to.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.660
The idea of monsters popping out of the closet
only to find it’s their 9-to-5 job, though, is nothing new.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.940
It's been used in countless
cartoons and comic strips in the past.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.680
But still, it presented us with a nice,
decent movie with a creative plot and characters.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.320
But much like the yin and the yang, for every good movie that exists, there's always going to be a *bad* movie.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.420
THIS movie.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.340
Little Fucking Monsters!

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740
When you think about it, this should be great.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.500
You got big-name child star Fred Savage,
big-name funny man Howie Mandel,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.900
and a whole wide world of creative monsters.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.000
How could any kid not in their right mind enjoy this?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.460
Well, needless to say, you got to try HARD to fuck up
a movie like this! REALLY, REALLY HARD!

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.880
And by God’s pubic hair, they succeeded!

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.620
So, let’s see why this movie sucks a mighty cock-sicle. This is Little Monsters.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.920

what a pain it is to move to a new place.

The world of monsters is nothing more than a collection of stairs and boxes.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.360
Wow.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:51.260
So you’re a little kid hearing all this buildup about the kingdom of monsters, and all you get is stairs and boxes.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.560
That’s so much of a letdown, I can’t even bring myself to call it a letdown!

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.840
I mean, how lazy and unimaginative are you?!

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.780
A better description is needed to explain such an abomination of ass-ness!

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.660
This isn’t a fucking letdown! This is.....

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.480
a mini-Holocaust of expectations.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.840
That’s how bad it is, folks! That’s how bad it is!

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.600
I had to use the word “Holocaust”!

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.180
So, really, all this world is is the Foot Clan hideout from the first Ninja Turtles movie.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.440
You know, where all the kids get together to party and do bad things. In fact, it’s practically identical!

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.100
But the fun doesn’t stop there.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.900
Maurice encourages Savage to play little pranks all throughout the neighborhood.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.680
Okay, I guess a few innocent pranks here and there isn’t that—

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.140
HOLY HELL, IS THAT CRUEL!!!!!

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.360
In fact, the more you watch ‘em, *most* of these pranks are just cruel.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.780
They’re not really that funny; they’re just nasty!

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.400

And why is this kid getting so excited about it?

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.040
I think they invade the home of one boy he didn’t like: that bully from earlier.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.700
Outside of that, all the other kids are pure innocents!

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.540
So how is this funny? Where does the humor come from?

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.200
You know what? Maybe I’m thinking too hard about this.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.220
Maybe there was some comedy in here I’m just not seeing.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.360
After all, maybe we can see the kids' reactions. That oughta be pretty funny.

Yet another series of words that kids can add to the wonderful vocabulary that this film is teaching them!

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.320

we come across another monster named Snik.

[scoff] I wish.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:44.520
No, it’s never really explained exactly who Snik is, but I guess he’s sorta set up like the mafioso of the monster world.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.140
If that’s the case, how come he can’t get a better wig to stick to his head?

Oh, yeah, by the way, adding random animated sparks doesn't make your world any more magical.

IT'S STILL FUCKING BOXES!!

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.920
So Savage goes to school and sees what Maurice did to Kiersten’s big project.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.260

So Savage discovers that the more times he goes down into the underworld,

the more he starts to actually become a monster, as body parts start disappearing in the light.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.160
So he tells Maurice that he doesn’t want to go to the underworld anymore.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.180
But it turns out the evil monster Snik comes along and kidnaps Savage’s brother.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.960
Why? Because he’s stopped coming to the underworld!...

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.080

But luckily, Maurice has a secret weapon!

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.620
I’m sure he’s gonna take one of the lessons he’s learned and use it to save the day—

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.200
OR he'll just light the motherfucker on fire!!

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.580
[Snik screaming while being burned alive]

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.200
What's the moral of this film, again?

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.520
All the monsters are happy that the head monster is destroyed,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.880
though... we... don’t really know why, as we have no idea how this fucking world works, but whatever.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.280
It turns out the sun's already come up at their house.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.920
So they travel across the country—

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.860
that is, they run across the same set several times and just put up different signs—

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.940
until they finally get to California.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.540
Wheeere Savage and his brother enter a video game tournament starring Super Mario Bros. 3!

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.700
Nope! Nope, that would be the AWESOME ending.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.140
Brian: Mom! I’ve got Eric!

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.140
Holly: Where are you??

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.480
Brian: .....Malibu.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.640
Holly: Where the hell is that??

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.940
Brian: .......California?

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.440
Holly: What on earth are you doing there??

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.780
Brian: Ummm... kind of a... long story.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.160
NC:  And I’m not kidding, that’s the ending.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.760
The issue of the parents getting divorced? Never resolved!

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.980
Finding out if their kids ever tell their parents about the monsters? Never mentioned!

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.720
What happens to the monster underworld and just how the hell is it being run, anyway? Never addressed!

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.200
We just get a visual recap of the film that only consists of THREE PICTURES!

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.640
I guess even the filmmakers couldn’t think of many memorable moments from this shitty-ass film!

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.420
And that’s exactly what this is! A shitty-ass film!

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.560
What a miserable piece of cinema.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.720
There’s no moral or lesson, it’s not fun, the images are probably too scary for most kids,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.840
it’s not visually pleasing, it’s not that creative, there’s a ton of unexplained story issues,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.820
and it’s surprisingly mean-spirited!

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.760
The pranks just seem cruel, the father just seems cruel, the monsters just seem cruel...

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.660
I don't mind cruelty in a film if it's amounting to something, but this literally amounts to nothing!

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.400
It's just shit.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.940
My advice? AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.620
Or better yet, GET the plague,

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.320
so that at least you’ll have something to look forward to after watching this dumbass movie!

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.140
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.800
Maurice: Over-the-shoulder boulder holder!
