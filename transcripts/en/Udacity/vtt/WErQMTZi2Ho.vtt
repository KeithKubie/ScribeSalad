Look in your professional and
social networks and

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.750
find an Objective-C developer.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.109
Ask that person for one interview
question they commonly asked and

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.360
post that question to the forum.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.130

of what Objective-C is all about.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.708
Next stuff will get into the nitty
gritty of writing classes.

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:18.208
