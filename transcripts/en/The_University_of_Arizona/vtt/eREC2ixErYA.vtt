LISA: Here Zuli!

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:13.896
Zuli got Valley Fever, and she started coughing
four weeks after we moved here and got a fever,

00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:18.066
and I took her in and x-rayed
her lungs and they looked just

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.316
like lungs of dogs who had Valley Fever.

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:25.986
We have a lot of rooms with rope poles
and we had a hundred tons of new soil,

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:28.946
native soil, brought into the yard.

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:35.876
So it was pretty clearly some kind of a point
exposure probably associated with something

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:37.846
that was going on in this
backyard when we moved in.

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.976
We can all get it from the same thing.

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:42.456
I mean, we can all breath the same spores.

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:48.676
So... but you can't get it from the
dog and the dog can't get it from you.

00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:49.926
My mother's had it, she's immune.

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:50.806
ANN: I've had it.

00:00:50.806 --> 00:00:56.156
I had it way back in the 70's and I had to have
surgery for it because we had no medication

00:00:56.226 --> 00:01:03.536
and they removed part of the upper right
lobe of my lung and that was in 1970.

00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:07.046
She brought her home and she
discovered the Valley Fever.

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:07.716
LISA: Took them months.

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:11.746
ANN: It was October, she was - LISA: 23rd.

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:14.966
ANN: October 23rd and she couldn't walk.

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.096
She couldn't continue.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:20.216
Lisa had to pick her up and carry her home.

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:28.966
She wouldn't eat and Lisa fed her three
times a day by hand for nine months.

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:33.986
She tried every drug that was available
and it was not working and that's

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:35.456
when they went to the able center.

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:43.446
LISA: The company that developed the drug
gave us about $10,000 worth of medication

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:48.786
and we treated 23 really sick dogs over
the next two-and-a-half to three years,

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:55.966
and that was sort of my first adventure
with clinical research on Valley Fever,

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.796
and I mean these were dogs
that were failing medication,

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:04.546
so the next step for them was euthanasia
and those are the kind of dogs we enrolled

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:08.256
and we saved about 50-60% of them.

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:19.756
BUNTZMAN: In the weeks before I felt the pain
in my chest, 2-3 weeks is the incubation period.

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:24.556
I must've acquired it and breathed
it in from the air sometime

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:32.676
in that time frame 2-3 weeks before, and I had
been working on a grant for 2-3 weeks before

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:37.476
and the only places I went: home,
car, work, to work, car, home.

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:45.586
I actually recall being right outside here on
the little causeway, there's a little bridge

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:49.756
that connects the two buildings to each
other and thinking to myself, [inhales] ah,

00:02:50.786 --> 00:02:56.846
I'm finally outside, I'm going to just
let the air hit me and breath in the air.

00:02:57.796 --> 00:03:00.096
You don't have to be out in
the wilderness to get this.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:03.226
You don't have to be digging in
the dirt in order to get this.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:08.076
When spores, little fungi, are on
the wind blowing through the air,

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:13.296
all you have to do is merely walk into
that little pocket of wind and inhale it.

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:17.876
It's a very difficult thing to
answer how and where did you get it.

00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:22.786
So the presumption is I just walked
into the wrong pocket of wind.
