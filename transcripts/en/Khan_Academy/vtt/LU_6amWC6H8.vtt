00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.860
So one of the main purposes
of accounting for anything,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.920
of making these accounting
statements in the first place,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.490
is so that you
can reflect what's

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.740
going on in the business.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.550
And that might be for investors,
to see how business is doing,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.640
or it might be for the
managers of a business,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.627
so that they can see where
the business is doing well,

00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:20.210
or where it's not
doing well, or maybe

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.150
how resources
should be allocated.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.990
So let's see which of these two
methods of accounting, the cash

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.140
method or the accrual method,
give a better indication

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.180
of what's actually going
on in the business.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.180
And the way I did it in
the first two videos,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.510
for each month, this first
column right over here,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.980
this is the cash
basis of accounting.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.060
And this right here
is the accrual.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.054
So the second column
is the accrual.

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:43.720
Let's just look at
the income statement.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.970
We're assuming a very simple
world where there's no taxes.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.310
We have no debt.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.000
We have no interest,
things like that.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.810
We just literally have revenue,
some expenses associated

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.705
with that revenue, and
just a simple profit.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:57.580
We'll make it more
complicated in the future.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.170
So this right here, you could
view as our income statement.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.670
This is our income statement
for month one on a cash basis.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.939
This is our income statement on
month one on an accrual basis.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.980
Now when you look at the
cash basis in month one,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.184
and when you look at
either basis on month one,

00:01:13.184 --> 00:01:14.350
it gives you the same thing.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.558
So that's not so interesting.

00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:17.230
Let's go to month two.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.410
In the cash basis
of accounting, it

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.169
looks like you just lost $200.

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:24.710
To an outsider who didn't know
the details of what's actually

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.210
going on in the
business, they think

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.990
something shady is going on, or
it's a money losing business.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.448
Why would I want
to invest in this?

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:32.940
They're losing $200 a month,
just looking at this month

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.455
alone.

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:35.080
But when you look at
the accrual basis,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.840
it better reflects that look,
you actually did some catering.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.720
In fact, you did a pretty large
catering event that month.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.710
In fact, that's why you
had so many expenses.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.670
And if you recognize the
revenue for the service

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.240
that you actually
did that month,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.064
that $400, which we did
in the accrual basis,

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:52.480
then you could
actually say, look,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.030
I performed services
that will earn me $200,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.720
assuming that the
customer is going

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.230
to be good for their money.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.480
And instead of putting that
$400 in cash, because you didn't

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.160
get the cash, you can't do that.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.660
We said, look, the
customer owes us $400.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.940
But that's still an asset.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.150
An asset is anything
that someone owes you,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.390
some future benefit.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.700
So the customer is going to
give you cash in the future.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.734
Cash is an asset because you
can use that to go buy stuff,

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:20.400
to get other people
to do stuff for you,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.880
to get some future benefit.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.240
So both cash and accounts
receivables are assets.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.940
And so in month two,
I think it's fair

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.880
that accrual method is giving
us a better indication of what

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.950
actually happened.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.600
Let's go to month three.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.744
On the cash basis, when
you look at the example,

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:36.410
you actually did
nothing in month three.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.451
You could have gone on a
vacation in month three.

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:39.910
There was no actual
catering done.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.734
But on the cash basis,
it looks like this

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.150
was your best month of catering
ever, because you actually

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.755
get $600 inflow in
cash, and you didn't

00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:48.380
have to spend any
expenses, because you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.690
didn't do any accounting.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.140
But when you do
the accrual basis,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.640
it actually reflected
what happened.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.040
You had no revenue
and no expenses

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.690
associated with that revenue.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.440
So once again, to an
outsider, they'd say,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.699
hey month three, maybe
you took a break,

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.490
maybe you took a
vacation, or that was just

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.070
a slow time in your business.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.270
And you don't
recognize the revenue

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.460
from this $200 in advance,
because you didn't do anything

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.960
to get it.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.650
Instead, you said, look, I got
this $200, it's a cash advance,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.430
you could've even called this
a cash advance from customers,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.910
but I'm not recognizing
this in revenue in the month

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.550
that I got it.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.080
I'm waiting until I actually
perform the service.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.220
So I'm deferring the revenue.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.530
And so you defer it to
month four when you actually

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.240
perform the service.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.910
The $100 in expenses are
associated with that $200.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.360
And so it makes sense to
you had $100 in profit.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.620
Once again, in month
four, you did work,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.970
you should have profit.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.580
On a cash basis, it looks
like you lost money again.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.550
So hopefully this
gives you a little bit

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.330
of an idea of why accrual gives
a better picture of what's

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.650
happening in the business.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.610
In the next video, I'll try
to reconcile what the accrual

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.200
income statement is telling
us and the actual cash,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.020
because right now it might
look a little mysterious.
