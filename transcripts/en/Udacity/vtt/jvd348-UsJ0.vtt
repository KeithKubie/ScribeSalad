00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.200
Alright, why don't we walk through a query

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.780
that will generate the correct results? Note that

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.570
we select the two columns that we want

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.070
from the table, registrar and enrollment_agency, from aadhaar_data.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.250
In order to get only the first 50 rows, we add a LIMIT 50 to the

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.710
end of our query. So the correct query

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.418
is SELECT registrar, enrollment agency FROM aadhaar_data, LIMIT 50.
