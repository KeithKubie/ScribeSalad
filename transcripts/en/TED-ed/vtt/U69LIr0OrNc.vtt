00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.355
It's easy to forget how vast and deep
the ocean really is.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.988
About 60% of it is actually
a cold and dark region

00:00:15.988 --> 00:00:18.237
known as the deep ocean.

00:00:18.237 --> 00:00:21.753
And it reaches down to 11,000 meters.

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:26.089
Yet, this remote zone is also one
of the greatest habitats on Earth,

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.573
harboring a huge diversity of life,

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:31.243
from giant squids and goblin sharks

00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:35.524
to minuscule animals 
smaller than a millimeter.

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:40.198
How do so many species thrive
in this underwater world?

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:44.727
Over the decades, intrepid scientists
have ventured there to find out.

00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:46.784
Traveling down through the water column,

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:50.330
pressure increases 
and light begins to wane.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.061
At 200 meters, photosynthesis stops

00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:57.024
and temperature decreases 
from surface temperatures

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.630
by up to 20 degrees Celsius.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.366
By 1000 meters, normal sunlight
has disappeared altogether.

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:08.776
Without light, life as we know it
seems impossible.

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:12.928
That's why in 1844, the naturalist 
Edward Forbes

00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:15.310
wrote his Azoic Theory,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.943
Azoic, meaning without animals.

00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:23.331
Forbes was sure that nothing could survive
below 600 meters

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:25.518
on account of the lack of light.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:30.157
Of course, the discovery 
of deep-sea species proved him wrong.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:34.470
What Forbes failed to take into account
is something called marine snow,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.041
which sounds much nicer than it is.

00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:39.677
Marine snow is basically organic matter,

00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:43.766
things like particles of dead algae,
plants, and animals,

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:46.080
drifting down into the depths

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.366
and acting as food for deep-sea animals.

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:53.871
Largely thanks to that, 
abundant life forms exist in the darkness,

00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:59.159
adapting to a harsh reality where only
the weird and wonderful can survive.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.956
Fish with cavernous mouths,

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:03.752
spiky teeth jutting from their jaws,

00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:07.362
and lamp-like structures 
protruding from their heads,

00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:12.449
like the anglerfish which entices prey
with its misleading glow.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.827
Several sea creatures have perfected
this lightning technique

00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:18.015
known as bioluminescence,

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:19.490
using it to lure prey,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.135
distract predators,

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:23.040
or attract mates.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.230
Some creatures use it for camoflauge.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.857
In parts of the water column where
only faint blue light filters through,

00:02:29.857 --> 00:02:33.790
animals bioluminesce to match the glow.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.137
Predators or prey looking up
from below

00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:38.455
are deceived by this camoflauge,

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:41.291
unable to see the creatures silhouette.

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:45.539
Such otherworldly adaptations also arise
from the need to locate

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.890
and snatch up food before it drifts away.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.199
Some sea animals, like jellyfish,
comb jellies and salps

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.612
can migrate between depths

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:58.385
partially because 
their 90% water consistency

00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:01.475
allows them to withstand immense pressure.

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:03.440
But they're the exception.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.520
Most deep-sea creatures are confined
to a narrow range in the water column

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.581
where nutrients are scarce

00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.971
since the food drifting downwards
from the surface

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:14.640
rapidly sinks to the sea floor.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.399
Plunging all the way down,
we find more exotic creatures.

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.790
Some take on dwarfism,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.738
a trait that transforms them 
into miniature versions of animals

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:26.898
we see closer to the surface.

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:30.797
It's thought that reduced 
food availability causes the shrinkage.

00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:36.302
Only a tiny fraction of the food produced
at the surface reaches the sea floor,

00:03:36.302 --> 00:03:39.836
so being small gives animals
a low energy requirement

00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:42.513
and an adaptive advantage.

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:45.701
And yet, the sea is also the land
of giants.

00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:50.084
Here, gargantuan squids can reach
18 meters long.

00:03:50.084 --> 00:03:54.487
Isopods scuttle around the sea floor
like enormous wood lice.

00:03:54.487 --> 00:03:57.195
There are long-limbed 
Japanese spider crabs,

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:01.180
and oarfish, whose bodies stretch
to 15 meters.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.204
This trait is known as gigantism,
and it's something of a mystery.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:11.028
It's thought that high oxygen levels
may drive extreme growth in some species,

00:04:11.028 --> 00:04:14.353
while the colder temperatures promote
longer life spans,

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:17.442
giving animals the opportunity 
to grow massive.

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:21.781
Many of these exotic sea beasts will never
experience sunlight.

00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:24.709
Some will venture up through
the water column to feed,

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:27.249
and a few will actually break the waves,

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:28.769
reminding us at the surface

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:33.464
about the incredible survival skills
of the ocean's deepest inhabitants.

00:04:33.464 --> 00:04:38.169
Humans still have an astounding
95% of the ocean left to explore.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.547
So those depths remain a great mystery.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:46.050
What other untold wonders lie far below,
and which ones will we discover next?
