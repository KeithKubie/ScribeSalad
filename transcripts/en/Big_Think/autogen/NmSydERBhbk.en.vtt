so when we look at UAV platforms or

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090
so when we look at UAV platforms or
 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.900
so when we look at UAV platforms or
drones as we call them commonly there

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910
drones as we call them commonly there
 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.280
drones as we call them commonly there
are multiple different types of

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290
are multiple different types of
 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.650
are multiple different types of
platforms there is rotary devices a

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660
platforms there is rotary devices a
 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.470
platforms there is rotary devices a
multi rotor and then there's fixed-wing

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480
multi rotor and then there's fixed-wing
 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.349
multi rotor and then there's fixed-wing
UAV platforms fixed-wing cover the

UAV platforms fixed-wing cover the
 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.450
UAV platforms fixed-wing cover the
larger use cases where you're talking

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460
larger use cases where you're talking
 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.099

and weight starting from Group one which
 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.140
and weight starting from Group one which
is the smallest going up to group five

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150
is the smallest going up to group five
 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.270
is the smallest going up to group five
which are the larger ones which carry

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280
which are the larger ones which carry
 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.400
which are the larger ones which carry
way larger payloads and might also be

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410
way larger payloads and might also be
 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.650
way larger payloads and might also be
used for offensive purposes what might

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660
used for offensive purposes what might
 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.220
used for offensive purposes what might
carry missiles and other things so these

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230

of coming in together to help us so

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130
of coming in together to help us so
 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.639

essentially if you take a look at it we

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649
essentially if you take a look at it we
 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.249
essentially if you take a look at it we
are fairly dependent on the satellites

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259
are fairly dependent on the satellites
 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.770
are fairly dependent on the satellites
that are out there to launch a satellite

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780
that are out there to launch a satellite
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.739
that are out there to launch a satellite
to repair a satellite to do maintenance

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749
to repair a satellite to do maintenance
 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.569
to repair a satellite to do maintenance
around a satellite there's an extremely

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579
around a satellite there's an extremely
 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.539
around a satellite there's an extremely
expensive proposition and those are also

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549
expensive proposition and those are also
 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.379
expensive proposition and those are also
very easy to take out right so if there

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389
very easy to take out right so if there
 

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.779
very easy to take out right so if there
is a certain missile that attacks and

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789
is a certain missile that attacks and
 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.070
is a certain missile that attacks and
there are four or five countries in the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080
there are four or five countries in the
 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.460
there are four or five countries in the
world that actually have anti satellite

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
world that actually have anti satellite
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380
world that actually have anti satellite
that can take out a satellite but that's

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390
that can take out a satellite but that's
 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.850
that can take out a satellite but that's
not the only way of crippling a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
not the only way of crippling a
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.720
not the only way of crippling a
satellite you could do jamming you could

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
satellite you could do jamming you could
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.910
satellite you could do jamming you could
do multiple things where the receivers

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
do multiple things where the receivers
 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.040
do multiple things where the receivers
are the signals other components that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050
are the signals other components that
 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.410
are the signals other components that
are associated with satellites you mess

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
are associated with satellites you mess
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.060
are associated with satellites you mess
with any of that it kind of takes out a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070
with any of that it kind of takes out a
 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.010
with any of that it kind of takes out a
satellite right so for example I think

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
satellite right so for example I think
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.910
satellite right so for example I think
it was back in January of 2016 that we

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
it was back in January of 2016 that we
 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.900
it was back in January of 2016 that we
were we have 13 or 14 GPS satellites out

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
were we have 13 or 14 GPS satellites out
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.970
were we have 13 or 14 GPS satellites out
there and we were taking down one of

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980
there and we were taking down one of
 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.970
there and we were taking down one of
them and there was a really mining 100

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
them and there was a really mining 100
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860
them and there was a really mining 100
millisecond or 300 millisecond

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
millisecond or 300 millisecond
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.980
millisecond or 300 millisecond
difference in sync in terms of because

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990
difference in sync in terms of because
 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.900
difference in sync in terms of because
there was some components that were

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910
there was some components that were
 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.870
there was some components that were
introduced that caused lapse in the time

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880
introduced that caused lapse in the time
 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.900
introduced that caused lapse in the time
and because from a GPS or when you use

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
and because from a GPS or when you use
 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.420
and because from a GPS or when you use
GPS to guide you time is extremely

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
GPS to guide you time is extremely
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.280
GPS to guide you time is extremely
important and syncing up of that where

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
important and syncing up of that where
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.900
important and syncing up of that where
you were before and where you are now

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910
you were before and where you are now
 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.540
you were before and where you are now
and that's how GPS can guide you and so

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550
and that's how GPS can guide you and so
 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.160
and that's how GPS can guide you and so
if there is a there is a break in that

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
if there is a there is a break in that
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.410
if there is a there is a break in that
sync you suddenly will go off and we

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
sync you suddenly will go off and we
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.420
sync you suddenly will go off and we
experienced that in January of 2016 for

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
experienced that in January of 2016 for
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.300
experienced that in January of 2016 for
very small period but that shows you

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310
very small period but that shows you
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.160
very small period but that shows you
even the smallest things can literally

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170
even the smallest things can literally
 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.960
even the smallest things can literally
bring down an entire country to their

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
bring down an entire country to their
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.880
bring down an entire country to their
knees when some of these critical

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890
knees when some of these critical
 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.220
knees when some of these critical
satellites are taken out but when you

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
satellites are taken out but when you
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.430
satellites are taken out but when you
think of persistent platforms or long

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440
think of persistent platforms or long
 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.870
think of persistent platforms or long
endurance or non-stop platforms

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880
endurance or non-stop platforms
 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.160
endurance or non-stop platforms
redundancy is a key component that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170
redundancy is a key component that
 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.380
redundancy is a key component that
actually has to be covered across

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390
actually has to be covered across
 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.350
actually has to be covered across
multiple of these components redundancy

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360
multiple of these components redundancy
 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.350
multiple of these components redundancy
in communication redundancy in energy

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360
in communication redundancy in energy
 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.790
in communication redundancy in energy
sources that's where the multiple energy

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800
sources that's where the multiple energy
 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.780
sources that's where the multiple energy
sources comes in right so we utilize a

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790
sources comes in right so we utilize a
 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.670
sources comes in right so we utilize a
ram air turbine which essentially would

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680
ram air turbine which essentially would
 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.610
ram air turbine which essentially would
drop down and can utilize the wind

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620
drop down and can utilize the wind
 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.130
drop down and can utilize the wind
energy to give that push that the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140
energy to give that push that the
 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.080
energy to give that push that the
aircraft might need to carry it through

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
aircraft might need to carry it through
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.940
aircraft might need to carry it through

but if you have multiple even one is

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.010
but if you have multiple even one is
 

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.790
but if you have multiple even one is
taken down the others will take over so

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800
taken down the others will take over so
 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.250
