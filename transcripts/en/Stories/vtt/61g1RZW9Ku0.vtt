00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.060
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:27.400
SPEAKER: Niuris was only able to
start her restaurant following

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.900
the liberalization of
private enterprise in Cuba.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.420
In 1993, the Cuban government
began opening up the economy.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.780
And in 2011, Cuba
implemented another wave

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.200
of free market reforms.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.480
In only five years, the
number of private restaurants

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.960
exploded from
around 100 to 1,600.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.100
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:40.890
SPEAKER: Currently,
Cuba has two currencies.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.960
The convertable peso, or
cuc, and the local peso.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.190
The cuc is paid to
the dollar at 1 to 1,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.320
while the local peso
is pegged to the cuc

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.860
with 25 pesos equaling one cuc.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.730
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.520
SPEAKER: Despite improved
U.S. Cuba relations,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.630
the U.S. imposed
economic embargo

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.420
continues to prevent trade
between the two countries.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.230
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.640
SPEAKER: Irrespective
of the U.S. embargo,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.520
micro-enterprises cannot
import from any country.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.700
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.520
SPEAKER: Cuba's economic changes
are having a major effect

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.750
on the job market.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.490
In some cases, taxi drivers can
make more money than doctors.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.240
Check out this video
from Seeker Daily

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.150
to learn more about how the
economy is forcing Cubans

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.550
to make surprising
career shifts.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.050
SPEAKER 2: Today,
private employment

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.260
extends to more than 200
occupations, many of which

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.750
cater to tourists.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.900
As a result, many Cubans who
are employed by the state,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.020
for instance as doctors,
engineers, and farmers, also

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.147
work in their free time as
taxi drivers or servers.

00:05:12.147 --> 00:05:13.980
