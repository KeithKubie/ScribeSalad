Alright, there you, friend.

business. Next!

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.543
Hey, could you sell me more than
an ounce?

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.745
Sorry, friend, that's the law.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:16.082
Us simple farming fold respect
the law and eachother.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.484
Oh, it's fine. I'll just go over
the Anderson Weed Farm 

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:19.852
and by more there.

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.724
Well don't buy weed from
them. Their weed sucks.

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.026
It's a long way to drive out
here. I need to make it 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.027
worth my while.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:33.199
Shit! This whol Amazon strike
has more people smoking weed

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.067
thank ever. 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.635
We have to make sure Tergrity
Weed

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.170
stays ahead of the
competition

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.606
We need to find a way to get the
weed to the people.

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:43.309
Yea, like a- like a delivery
service.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.311
Some way so people don't have to
drive out here

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:46.979
and even see the other weed
farms.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:51.050
You know what they got? They got
these e-scooters nowadays.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:53.519
You mean the things that almost
killed us all on Halloween?

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:54.454
Yea, I 'member.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.591
What if we use e-scooters to get
the weed

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.660
directly to the
costumers?

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.663
Holy shit, we could have Tegrity
all over town.
