This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Audible.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.670
All you kids out there who hate waking up
early for school?

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.639
Worry not, 'cause science has your back.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:21.720
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and like many
of you out there, I am NOT a morning person.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.650
Having to wake up at 6am was probably the
single thing I hated most about school growing

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.199
up - and now, there's research to prove that
it can actually affect our academic performance.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.899
A new study conducted throughout 718 public
elementary schools in Kentucky - finds that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.030
earlier school start times are associated
with lower performance - but ONLY in students

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.750
from middle or upper class backgrounds.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.460
Researchers assessed academic performance
using standardized test scores, as well as

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.770
attendance rates, teacher-student ratios,
and retention rates - which is the number

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.140
of students required to repeat a certain grade.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.510
They theorized that earlier start times would
be associated with lower performance in almost

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.590
all of those areas - particularly in disadvantaged
schools.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.240
But to their surprise, the results showed
that wasn't true.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.920
Kids who attended schools in disadvantaged
districts saw no difference in performance,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010
regardless of what time school started.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.660
But children attending affluent schools, saw
a significant decrease in their academic performance,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.720
the earlier school started.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.500
Researchers say sleep deprivation could be
what's at hand here.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.439
Not getting enough sleep could cause students
to lose the ability to remain alert and focused

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.850
in class - and it may also lead to an increase
in illness.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.899
As for why this only seems to affect children
in affluent schools, the answers are still

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.369
unknown.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.500
Although they believe it may be because disadvantaged
children have so many other risk factors at

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.500
play.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.939
Now before we go rallying to have schools
start at 9am - there were some other unexpected

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:46.939
findings.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.390
The study also found that the later school
starts, the higher the chance there is of

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.710
students having to repeat grades.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.110
For every additional minute later school starts,
retention rates increase by 0.2%.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.369
So starting the school day off even 5 minutes
later than normal - could lead to a 1% increase

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.700
in the amount of students being held back.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.289
That's pretty antithetical to the rest of
the study, which links later start times with

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.160
improved performance.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.940
One possible explanation, researchers say,
is that starting school later may cause average

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.220
students to improve, while those with learning
disabilities have an even harder time keeping

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.220
up.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.800
They also warn that because this is the first
study to ever examine the relationship between

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.220
school start times and student retention in
pre-adolescents, more research is needed before

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.570
solid conclusions can be drawn.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.330
Still - think of all the things you could
get done if school didn't start til 10am!

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.500
You could read a book - or better yet, you
could listen to a book on Audible.com!

the bus, at home, or at recess, if you're
the indoor type.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.260
No shame in that, it's the reason I'm so pale!

Parents, I'm sure you feel differently than
your kids, but let us know anyway!
