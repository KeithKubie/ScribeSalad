00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:09.390
Autopsies: We’ve seen them on TV, but are
they an accurate depiction?

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.450
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you’ve
been following the news surrounding the Michael

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.599
Brown killing, then you’ve probably heard
about the multiple autopsies that have been

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.599
requested.

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.599
Three, so far.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.210
The first, was done by the county medical
examiner’s office.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.869
The second, was requested by the family, and
the third one - was conducted by the US Department

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:29.869
of Justice.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.230
Three autopsies is a lot to perform on a single
body, so why are they doing this?

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.260
What’s the point?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.150
Can additional autopsies really provide new
information?

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.660
Sometimes, yes.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.670
This is a high-profile case, so it’s understandable
that multiple autopsies might be warranted.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.600
But for the most part, as long as the first
one was performed correctly, there’s really

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.460
no need for a second or third.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.850
In fact, with each subsequent autopsy that
gets performed, it actually becomes easier

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.620
to misinterpret the findings - because the
body is already so mutilated.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.530
Now most of what we know about autopsies comes
from television - which isn’t exactly an

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.420
accurate picture of what goes on.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.740
So what exactly is the process involved in
conducting a thorough autopsy?

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.610
There are a lot of steps involved, but in
a nutshell - here’s how it works.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.670
Autopsies are performed by forensic pathologists,
and they’re generally split into two separate

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.670
procedures.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.229
There’s the external examination - where
they look at the outside of the body - and

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.520
try to find evidence of injury, disease, or
anything that appears out of the ordinary.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.310
Anything on the body that’s relevant to
the case, like clothing, gunpowder residue,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.810
or DNA from another person, then get sent
to a different lab for analysis.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.969
And everything is documented with photographs.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.560
Then, there’s the internal examination - where
they literally cut the body open, starting

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.619
at the shoulders and going down to the groin.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.189
In a standard autopsy, they’ll look at organs
in the chest, abdomen and pelvis.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.859
But if other parts of the body are suspected
to be involved in the person’s death, like

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.170
the legs or arms or even the brain, then those
also get inspected.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.219
The purpose of this, is to examine the patient’s
organs.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.469
First, while they’re inside the body - and
then again, once they’re removed.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.399
So after cutting through the ribcage, they
remove the organs, and weigh them - and that’s

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.469
how they point to evidence of disease.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.280
Certain illnesses will cause your organs to
swell or shrink - so based on the weight of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.900
an organ, it’s possible for a pathologist
to see exactly what type of disease a person

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.260
was suffering from, and how advanced that
disease was.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.320
Once they’re weighed, the organ gets dissected
- again, looking for evidence of anything

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320
abnormal.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.840
And when that’s done, samples of each organ
are collected, and preserved in formaldehyde,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.370
so the pathologist can examine them later
under a microscope, if it’s deemed necessary.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.070
In some cases, entire organs are preserved
- usually the brain or the heart - to be examined

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.640
by a specialist later on.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.990
But less than 5% of autopsies actually require
that.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.460
Samples of the patient’s blood, urine, and
other fluids are also collected - and sent

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.440
to a toxicology lab, to look for evidence
of drugs, alcohol, or poisonous substances

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.730
in a person’s system.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.290
Typically, those samples get held for a year,
until they’re destroyed.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.260
While organs, are retained for 5 years, after
which they get cremated.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.010
Anything else that’s left, gets put back
inside the body, and sent back to the funeral

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.880
home - at which point the family is issued
an official autopsy report, as well as a certificate

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.880
of death.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.840
As gruesome as the whole process is, forensic
pathologists have to be very careful when

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.070
they perform autopsies.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.350
They’re required to make all of their incisions,
such that an open casket funeral can still

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.900
be conducted, if the family want it.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.580
Now going back to the case of Michael Brown,
three autopsies have already been performed.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.980
But due to the generic pattern of bullet wounds
on the body, it’s been difficult to draw

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.900
conclusions about what exactly happened.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.250
And unfortunately, the third autopsy may not
resolve any of those questions either - since

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.770
the damage caused by the first two, has already
compromised any relevant evidence.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.820
Now I know this is a lot of information to
take in, and it is an incredibly sensitive

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.080
subject - but given all the publicity that’s
been surrounding this case, I thought it might

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.080
be pertinent to explore what exactly is involved
in these kinds of procedures.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.620
By the way - you may notice we didn’t include
any actual footage of an autopsy in this episode,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.300
for obvious reasons - but if you are so inclined,
there are videos of them on YouTube.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.570
Just be prepared.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.160
They are insanely gruesome.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.100
So, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.850
In the meantime, if you guys have any questions,
or anything that needs clarification, you

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.160
can leave em in the comments.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.120
Otherwise, thank for watching!
