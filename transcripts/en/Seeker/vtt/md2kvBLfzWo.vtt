00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.600
Have you ever looked across the room and thought,
"Bro looks dumb as a stick."

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.820
If somehow you didn't feel awful for judging
a someone by looks alone...

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.190
Well, science is on your side too.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:21.480
Hey dummies, Trace here for DNews -- Judging
a book by its cover is an age-old adage, and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.090
it wouldn't still exist unless people KEPT
JUDGING BOOKS!

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.250
Looking at people's faces is easy, and we
want to wheedle as much information out of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.100
looks as we can, because social interaction
is hard, guys!

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.710
You have to like, listen, and talk and listen
and in the right order...

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.960
Uhhhhhgggh can't I just look at you and know
if you can do my math homework, please?

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.530
New research in Plos One has jumped on this
bandwagon too.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.469
Researchers in the Czech Republic gave IQ
tests to 80 men and women and took a static

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.160
picture of their face.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.120
Then, 160 volunteers looked at the faces and
guessed how they'd done on their IQ test.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.020
Humans LOVE research like this.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.969
There have been studies showing how faces
reveal people's race, sex, political affiliation,

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:12.750
ethnicity, health, social statues, attractiveness
and intelligence.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.150
I'll stop the suspense.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.450
YES, this research confirms people will judge
a book by it's cover.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.969
And a face.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:20.969
By it's cover.

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:21.969
Or whatever.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.820
Basically, the faces who volunteers believed
to be intelligent actually did score highly

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.320
on the IQ test.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.710
However, the guesses were only accurate for
MEN.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.619
It didn't work for WOMEN.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.149
We all know IQ tests are a notoriously bad
measure of REAL WORLD intelligence, but at

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.509
least everyone was given the same IQ test.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.969
The volunteers DID correctly guess how people
did on that specific test, just by a picture

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.810
-- and did so with statistical significance.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.530
Oddly, though, when the researchers used a
computer to compare facial shape with IQ,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.890
they couldn't find anything, but if compared
to PERCEIVED intelligence they found intelligent

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.600
faces are prolonged, with a broader distance
between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.550
upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a
sharper, pointing, less rounded chin.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.830
The researchers guess it has something to
do with our sexual evolution.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.260
They think there must be some reason, men
benefitted from wearing their intelligence

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.440
factor on their faces, whereas women needn't
advertise their wily ways.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.379
Furthermore, since they already had faces
and volunteers, they also asked them to measure

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.010
attractiveness and sorry to say -- smarter
people are not more attractive nor are they

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.010
uglier.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.010
What do you think?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.010
Are you going to save this image to your phone
and check who your smart and dumb friends

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.010
are?
