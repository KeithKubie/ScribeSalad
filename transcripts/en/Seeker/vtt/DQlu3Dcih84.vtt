00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.560
I’ve always sucked at yoga, I have like
zero balance, but maybe I should give it another

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.340
try.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.710
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.300
Over 20 Million Americans practice yoga.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.250
I’m pretty sure most of that’s just in
the Bay Area.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.170
That figure comes from a study published in
Yoga Journal.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.930
According to their survey the top reasons
for starting yoga were: flexibility, general

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.190
conditioning, stress relief, and to improve
overall health and physical fitness.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.670
Yoga is deeply rooted in Hindu tradition,
where a series of postures and breathing exercises

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.940
prepares the body for meditation and connecting
with the divine.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.989
There’s a lot more to yoga than striking
a few poses.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.520
Traditional yoga is a whole spiritual practice
with 8 parts including a code of ethical standards

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.899
and studying scriptures.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.800
Only one of those parts, asana, involves poses.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.319
Not surprisingly, yoga has been stripped down
and repackaged to Americans as a form of exercise.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.660
But apart from the cultural appropriation,
Yoga is actually pretty good for you.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.629
Let’s look at what the science says.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.289
Chronic pain can reduce or change grey matter
in the brain which can lead to some serious

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.379
problems like memory and emotional issues.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.880
But according to an official at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), practicing yoga

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.140
has the opposite effect on the brain.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.259
So what does the brain look like on Yoga?

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.130
Well study after study reportedly heralds
the benefits of Yoga.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.530
Researchers from Boston University School
of Medicine found that the postures from Yoga

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.060
actually increases the amount of gamma-aminobutyric
acid or GABA in the brain.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.110
GABA, a neurotransmitter, calms the nervous
system and regulates muscle tone.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.220
In one study the researchers found that after
just one hour of Yoga, practitioners GABA

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.020
levels increased by 27%.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.210
This increase in GABA levels could be responsible
for decreasing anxiety and improving mood

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.159
in those who practice yoga.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.240
Another small study published in the Journal
of Physical Activity and Health found that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.009
after short, 20 minute sessions of Hatha yoga
participants performed better on tests of

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.009
brain function.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.159
They could focus better, process information
faster, and even learn more effectively than

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.549
after a typical aerobic exercise like running
on a treadmill.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.620
The researchers think that by focusing on
the body, posture or breath, you push out

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.100
any distracting thoughts and or reduce some
stress, both of which could increase cognitive

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100
function.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.470
But it’s not just your brain that gets a
boost.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.970
Researchers from the US and the Netherlands
found that yoga could help those with cardiovascular

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.970
disease.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.500
Published in the European Journal of Preventive
Cardiology, the researchers reviewed 37 different

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500
studies.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.470
They found that yoga improves risk factors
for heart disease similar to the effects of

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.970
typical exercise.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.610
Some studies showed that it lowered body weight,
cholesterol and heart rate.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.750
Other researchers think yoga can ease pain
by enhancing both the toning of muscles and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.830
releasing of muscle tension.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.610
Even sufferers of Multiple sclerosis, or MS,
a potentially debilitating autoimmune disease,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.830
that affects the brain and central nervous
system found some relief from yoga.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.750
Researchers from Rutgers University conducted
a small trial where MS patients participated

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.790
in a 8 week long specialized yoga program.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.370
After completing the program patients had
better mental health, concentration, bladder

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.080
control, walking, and vision, with a decrease
in pain and fatigue.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.660
There’s other studies that show it could
reduce inflammation, help with hypertension

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.570
or those who live with pain from fibromyalgia
or arthritis.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.590
Just know there’s a lot of research happening
within the past five years and a lot of it’s

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.590
positive.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.880
Speaking of questionably trendy healthy fads…
what’s the deal with kale?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.260
If you’re craving some kale.. watch this
episode first…

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.040
Have you ever tried yoga?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.440
I did for a few months.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.040
I have like no balance, so the instructor
would call me out and tell me to go use the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040
wall.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.840
So yeah.
