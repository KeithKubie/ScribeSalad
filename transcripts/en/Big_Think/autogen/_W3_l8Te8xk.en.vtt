thing history teaches us is that history
 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.650

learn from history so we decided we try

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570
learn from history so we decided we try
 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.470

then when we finished the book we said

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100
then when we finished the book we said
 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.710
then when we finished the book we said
well there is actually something about

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720
well there is actually something about
 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.500
well there is actually something about
the future and we'd like to think about

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510
the future and we'd like to think about
 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.289
the future and we'd like to think about
three trends that are really important

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:43.299
three trends that are really important
 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.719
three trends that are really important
for corporations to think through and in

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729
for corporations to think through and in
 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.479
for corporations to think through and in
particular how their relationship with

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489
particular how their relationship with
 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.939
particular how their relationship with
society is going to work and they were

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949
society is going to work and they were
 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.719
society is going to work and they were
first the ever increasing possibility

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729
first the ever increasing possibility
 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.329

that artificial intelligence will change

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339
that artificial intelligence will change
 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.990
that artificial intelligence will change
the way in which labor works how do we

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000
the way in which labor works how do we
 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.960
the way in which labor works how do we
communicate with companies what actually

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970
communicate with companies what actually
 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.630
communicate with companies what actually
do they do can they do things more

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640
do they do can they do things more
 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.260
do they do can they do things more
perfectly or will they become less human

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
perfectly or will they become less human
 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.060
perfectly or will they become less human
we started the discussion by speaking to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070
we started the discussion by speaking to
 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.560
we started the discussion by speaking to
Tim berners-lee and Tim rather

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570
Tim berners-lee and Tim rather
 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.520
Tim berners-lee and Tim rather
surprisingly said to me well John

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530
surprisingly said to me well John
 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.289
surprisingly said to me well John
the thing about artificial intelligence

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299
the thing about artificial intelligence
 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.039
the thing about artificial intelligence
is that corporations are already robots

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
is that corporations are already robots
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.319
is that corporations are already robots
they're already robots so there's

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329
they're already robots so there's
 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.859
they're already robots so there's
nothing new here they behave robotically

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869
nothing new here they behave robotically
 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.779
nothing new here they behave robotically
and maybe they shouldn't so I said well

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789
and maybe they shouldn't so I said well
 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.849
and maybe they shouldn't so I said well
I contend that they absolutely shouldn't

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859
I contend that they absolutely shouldn't
 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.609
I contend that they absolutely shouldn't
because they are part of the human

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619
because they are part of the human
 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.760
because they are part of the human
fabric of society so that was the first

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770
fabric of society so that was the first
 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.289
fabric of society so that was the first
thing we talked about the second we

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299
thing we talked about the second we
 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.660
thing we talked about the second we
worried about was the change in the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670
worried about was the change in the
 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.529
worried about was the change in the
economic center of gravity in the world

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539
economic center of gravity in the world
 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.309
economic center of gravity in the world
if you go back to the first year after

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319
if you go back to the first year after
 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.510
if you go back to the first year after
in the Common Era

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520
in the Common Era
 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.590
in the Common Era
one ad you'd find that the center of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600
one ad you'd find that the center of
 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.999
one ad you'd find that the center of
economic gravity in the world was

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009
economic gravity in the world was
 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.700
economic gravity in the world was
somewhere in the Middle East and over

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710
somewhere in the Middle East and over
 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.219
somewhere in the Middle East and over
the last a couple of thousand years it's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229
the last a couple of thousand years it's
 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.440
the last a couple of thousand years it's
moved from there to the middle of the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450
moved from there to the middle of the
 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.770
moved from there to the middle of the
Atlantic and now it's moving back to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780
Atlantic and now it's moving back to
 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.539
Atlantic and now it's moving back to
somewhere in the East so it moves as

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549
somewhere in the East so it moves as
 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.009
somewhere in the East so it moves as
countries become

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019
countries become
 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.830
countries become
more comparatively advantaged more

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
more comparatively advantaged more
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.720
more comparatively advantaged more
educated and things move and therefore

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
educated and things move and therefore
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.520
educated and things move and therefore

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
values the way in which companies work
 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.880
values the way in which companies work
move again and we wanted to make the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890
move again and we wanted to make the
 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.800
move again and we wanted to make the
point that our book is not about pure

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
point that our book is not about pure
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.610
point that our book is not about pure
moral values it's about practical

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
moral values it's about practical
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.759
moral values it's about practical

great endeavor which is business which
 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.640
great endeavor which is business which
makes the world better because actually

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650
makes the world better because actually
 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.259
makes the world better because actually
makes people more prosperous brings

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269
makes people more prosperous brings
 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.629
makes people more prosperous brings
people out of poverty and so forth so we

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639
people out of poverty and so forth so we
 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.759
people out of poverty and so forth so we
we wanted to do that and the third thing

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769
we wanted to do that and the third thing
 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.220
we wanted to do that and the third thing
we said was the business actually

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230
we said was the business actually
 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.000
we said was the business actually

goes on and we gave a dozen examples of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010
goes on and we gave a dozen examples of
 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.399
goes on and we gave a dozen examples of
where we thought that in order to have

where we thought that in order to have
 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.270
where we thought that in order to have
the right to be a company companies

the right to be a company companies
 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.149
the right to be a company companies
should be focused on at least in some

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159
should be focused on at least in some

these problems for the future and it
 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.520
these problems for the future and it
just may be that artificial intelligence

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530
just may be that artificial intelligence
 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.309
just may be that artificial intelligence
the ability to think more broadly to

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319
the ability to think more broadly to

more about it might just lead us to a

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799
more about it might just lead us to a
 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.800
more about it might just lead us to a
better solution to some of these

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810
better solution to some of these
 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.869
better solution to some of these

extraordinary problems that have been
 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.270
extraordinary problems that have been
around a long time it's just that we now

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280
around a long time it's just that we now
 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.300
around a long time it's just that we now
see them with greater clarity and indeed

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310
see them with greater clarity and indeed
 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.729
see them with greater clarity and indeed
they are being becoming more and more

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739
they are being becoming more and more
 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.460
they are being becoming more and more
