[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.180
ARJUNA ARDAGH:
Thank you so much.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.620
Yeah.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:16.040
For me, it's really a
very awesome experience

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.640
to speak at Google because
Google, as a company,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.780
so much represents the vision
that this book is about.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.080
I have coached people on and
off from Google over the years.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.720
And this book, in a
way, is drawn very much

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.086
on my experience of Googlers.

00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:37.507
And let me just explain
why for a minute.

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:39.090
I mean, just one
thing, I don't know--

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.844
do you call it the 20%
rule or the 20% policy,

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:44.010
or how do you refer to that?

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950
Rule sounds a little
intense, but how

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.240
do you call that, the 20% thing?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.580
AUDIENCE: 20% time.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.900
ARJUNA ARDAGH: 20% time, yeah.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.720
I mean, that, on its
own, is mind-blowing.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.160
That was definitely
not happening

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.980
in the '50s or the '60s
or the '70s or the '80s,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.410
that you get to spend,
as I understand it,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.807
20% of your time doing
what inspires you,

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:06.140
doing what you feel can make
a difference to the planet.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.530
Is that a good way to
summarize that policy?

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.110
Yeah.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.234
I mean, that is incredible.

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:12.890
But also just the fact
that we have-- that there's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.260
extraordinarily good food
just on the other side

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.810
of those doors and,
down in Mountain View,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.910
incredible recreational
offerings of all kinds.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.470
This is a company
that obviously-- very,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.750
very obviously and overtly--

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.720
is not just about people
showing up to get a paycheck.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.710
It's offering an opportunity
for its employees

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.210
to innovate and contribute
and create a meaningful life,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.674
as well as to contribute
to the company.

00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:41.590
Would that be a good--

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.250
would you agree?

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.890
Is that what Google's all about?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.460
Yeah.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.560
So that makes it really
inspiring for me.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.420
Because there are
actually, I would

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.970
say, relatively few
companies on the planet who

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.510
are so upfront and overt
about wanting to create

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.410
that kind of environment.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.400
So my experience of working
with Googlers, but also

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.169
with other people in the
technology sector, industry,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.581
is that many people find
themselves, I've noticed--

00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:15.330
I'd like to know if
this is true for you--

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.410
many people find themselves
in an interesting predicament.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.910
And I haven't worked too much.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.340
I haven't worked for
a corporation where

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.450
I show up and go away again.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.100
I'm more of a freelance guy.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.970
So the closest parallel
I can find in my own life

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.710
to what I hear from
a lot of people

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.180
who work for big companies
is, back when I was a teenager

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.480
and I was dating, all right?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.010
And I was friends with
this very beautiful girl.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.320
And actually, I may
possibly break down

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.000
and cry when I
tell you this story

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.790
because it's actually--
it was a big deal for me.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.860
I was friends with this girl
who was incredibly beautiful

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.730
in every way.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.220
I mean physically
beautiful, but also

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.350
just had an incredible
grace about her,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.000
she was extremely kind.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.290
She was really, as far
as I was concerned,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.580
she was the closest thing
to God in human form.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.710
And I was a teenager.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.230
And I really liked her a lot.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.700
I liked her so
much, I could hardly

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.754
imagine that she
could be my girlfriend

00:03:18.754 --> 00:03:19.920
or I could be her boyfriend.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.150
It was just like it was an
extraordinary experience

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.650
to be close to her.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.990
And so this happened.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.040
We used to go to the same
place for summer holidays.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.650
Our parents would drive us
to this village in Suffolk

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.367
on the east coast of
England, in East Anglia,

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:37.700
and we'd have holidays together.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.050
And we were both teenagers.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.330
And I was obsessed
with, is today

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.079
going to be the day
I'm going to kiss--

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.370
I'm not going to say her name
because this is going out

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.964
on YouTube.

00:03:46.964 --> 00:03:48.630
But is this going to
be the day that I'm

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.250
going to kiss the
object of my longing?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.439
And I remember,
after a few years,

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.980
she said something
interesting to me.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.670
She said, you know,
I really like you,

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.300
but you try way too hard.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.050
Interesting thing.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.660
She said, I really like
you, but you're obviously

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.180
just trying way too hard.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.300
When I see you just
relaxing, I really

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.950
feel I want to be close to you.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.390
But when we come
together, you're

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.580
trying so hard that, whatever
it is, the beautiful things

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.380
you have to offer get
eclipsed by the trying.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.870
Do you get the story?

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.580
And that was a very
beautiful thing.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.200
And by that point,
we were so close

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.610
that it was like brother and
sister and all bets were off.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.900
So we just developed a
beautiful friendship.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.990
But it was an incredibly
beautiful lesson

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.660
that has been replicated for
me again and again in my life.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.040
And I wonder if you've had
any similar experience where,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.610
sometimes, the harder
we try, the more elusive

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.810
what we long for becomes.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.090
Does that make sense?

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.700
Yeah?

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.090
Sometimes, you try really
hard, and what you actually

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.660
have to offer and what
the situation has to offer

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.330
you dissipates a little bit.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.800
And I've noticed that that
same situation I've noticed

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.350
gets duplicated
sometimes when you

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.830
work for an amazing
company, a company that

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.590
has built into its policies
that it wants you to thrive.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.820
And it does everything it can
to provide an environment where

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.470
people can thrive.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.910
And then sometimes we find
ourselves just trying too hard.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.380
Does that make sense?

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.710
Like, we try hard
to get a promotion.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.980
We try hard to be the
best person we can be.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.490
And all the time, the
situation is set up actually

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.020
for us to relax.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.200
And in that relaxation,
our greatest gifts emerge.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.790
Now, give me a little feedback
because if what I've just said

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.960
doesn't sound in any
way in the ballpark,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.890
I should completely rewrite
the rest of the talk.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.770
Does that resonate at all?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.020
The pressure for promotion,
the pressure for performance,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.930
the pressure to excel
in the environment

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.597
actually can sometimes
negate the very best

00:06:02.597 --> 00:06:03.680
of what you have to offer.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.460
Does that make sense?

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.840
Give me a little noise so I
know if we're on the right page.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.390
ARJUNA ARDAGH: OK, cool.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.264
Well, that's what I want
to talk about today.

00:06:10.264 --> 00:06:12.770
If that resonates with you,
that's what we'll talk about.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.012
If you'd rather talk
about tangerine La Croix,

00:06:16.012 --> 00:06:17.220
we could talk about that too.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.930
But that's what I want to talk
about is, how we can overcome

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.400
that frustrating gap between the
deepest gifts we have to offer

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.340
when we're actually
relaxed and being ourselves

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.530
versus the pressure
to perform, all right?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.460
So this slideshow is
set up such that I can't

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.600
see what the next slide is.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.860
So I'm going to have to actually
put the slide before I speak.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:51.710
So when it comes to anything
new entering the world,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:58.910
like the 20% policy at Google
is really an invitation for you

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.690
to be an instrument of something
new entering the world, right?

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.970
More or less, it
allows you to innovate.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.410
It allows you to do whatever
you feel is most meaningful.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.680
Did I get that right,
yeah-- or at least

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.440
team up with other
people and do that?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.810
When anything new
enters the world, when

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.160
anything evolutionary
enters the world,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.840
it has to begin with an event
in consciousness, right?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.120
That's where everything begins.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.260
So the idea of an
incredible search engine

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.800
that can access every
website in the world

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.590
and bring back results
in milliseconds,

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.340
that had to begin with an idea
in Larry or Sergey's head,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.840
right?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.060
Somebody had to think
it before you could even

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.730
start to build the
algorithm, correct?

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.030
Everything has to begin with
an event in consciousness.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.070
So let's take a really--

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.030
let's flesh this out.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.270
Let's take a really obvious
landmark like the Eiffel Tower.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.170
So everyone's heard
of the Eiffel Tower.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.480
The Eiffel Tower
actually, in many ways,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.140
did propel the advancement
of engineering.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.610
Before the Eiffel
Tower, there were

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.680
limits on what we
thought was possible.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.870
After the Eiffel Tower, lots
of other similar structures

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.670
start to be built.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.360
Well, the Eiffel Tower
had to begin with plans.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.220
Before you could
build a tower, you

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.460
had to have plans done
and engineering done.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.160
But the plans could
not be drawn up

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.330
before they were a thought,
just a little inkling, just

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.320
a twinkle in the eye
of Gustav Eiffel who

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.620
was responsible for
the Eiffel Tower.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.419
Scientists who
focus on neurology

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.950
estimate that we have about
48 mental events per minute.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.450
That's a little bit
slower than 1 per second.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.720
That means a new
potential mental event

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.024
is happening a little
bit more slowly

00:08:56.024 --> 00:08:57.440
than once a second,
which means we

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.890
have about 48 thoughts
a minute, which

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.070
translates to almost
3,000 thoughts

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.250
an hour, 70,000 thoughts a day.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.274
How many people work
at Google worldwide?

00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:11.110
AUDIENCE: 70,000.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.212
ARJUNA ARDAGH: OK, so
multiply 70,000 by 70,000.

00:09:14.212 --> 00:09:15.920
I'm not going to do
that math in my head.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.870
But that's a lot of thoughts
being generated by Googlers

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.080
every day, all right--

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.690
a lot of mental events
happening every day.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.460
But if we just think of
it in the world, 483,840

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.470
billion thoughts every day.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.360
Now, how many of
those thoughts would

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.380
you imagine create the
Eiffel Tower or the iPhone

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.760
or the laptop
computer or penicillin

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.372
or the general
theory of relativity?

00:09:43.372 --> 00:09:44.330
What would you imagine?

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.850
What percentage of
thoughts, of mental events

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.300
do you think turn into
thoughts that actually advance

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.600
the evolution of humanity?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.780
What would be your guess?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.100
AUDIENCE: 1%.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.954
ARJUNA ARDAGH: 1%.

00:09:55.954 --> 00:09:56.870
AUDIENCE: That's high.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.680
ARJUNA ARDAGH:
That's pretty high.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.700
Think about it, what that means.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:58.960
If there's--

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.293
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm an optimist.

00:10:00.293 --> 00:10:06.530
ARJUNA ARDAGH: --but if you look
at 483,840 billion thoughts,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.300
you've only got to
take off two zeros.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:13.850
And you've got 4,838 billion
brilliant thoughts a year--

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.640
probably not that much, right,
not that change the world.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.000
It's probably more like,
actually, even 1 in 1 billion

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.020
would be optimistic.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.780
Because that would
leave us with 483,000

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.670
brilliant life-changing
thoughts a year.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.440
Even that's probably optimistic.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.510
So what you can see is
that, although there

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.790
are all these thoughts
being generated,

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.740
relatively few turn
into innovation.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.710
Relatively few turn into
something that changes

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.970
the game for everybody, right?

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.780
If any one of us in
this room could increase

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.690
the percentage of
mental events that

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.780
go through your consciousness
that translate into something

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.560
innovative, that 20% rule would
become a lot more effective,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.910
correct?

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.520
So I'm going to
posit to you today,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.270
based on a little research
I've been doing for the last 25

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.530
years, 30 years.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.010
I'm going to suggest to you a
little model that we can share,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.730
which, to the degree we've
been able to test it--

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.010
myself and my colleagues here--

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.880
we've been able to see
it's a fairly reliable way

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.990
of increasing the
percentage of radically

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.210
brilliant,
life-changing thoughts

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.800
which pass through your mind.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.530
Maybe from 1 in 1 billion
to 1 in 1 million.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.200
That would be an
enormous increase, right?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.390
Per year, it's 176,000
trillion thoughts a year

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.530
that are generated
all over the planet.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.610
So that's a lot of thoughts.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.920
So in order to understand
this, I want to suggest for you

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.990
a little model-- and like every
model, it's an approximation--

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.990
a little model of how we
can understand thought.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.650
We can begin to think
of thought in two

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.300
ways, two kinds of thought.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:04.600
Think of it like the waves
on the surface of a pond.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.380
So one kind of thought we
could call horizontal thoughts.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.930
A horizontal thought
means it's a thought that

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.540
is generated by another
thought that was already there.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.060
In other words,
it's not original.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.050
It's not arising out of nowhere.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.880
It's a predictable thought that
was conditioned into your mind

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.110
by an existing thought.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:28.030
For example, let's imagine
you go onto social media,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.329
like Google+ where
people share things.

00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:33.370
Is that what it's called?

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.203
It's called Google+.

00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:35.800
I should know that.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.290
Go onto Google+, where people
share things with each other

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.690
or any other social
media platform,

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.274
some of which I probably
shouldn't mention in the room.

00:12:44.274 --> 00:12:45.940
But you go onto a
social media platform.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.660
And you see somebody has put one
of those pictures of a really

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.060
old person's hand
holding a baby's hand.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.140
You go, oh, how sweet,
share, like, comment.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.940
Or maybe there's a
sunset, and somebody's

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.000
put this kind of thing
like a heart superimposed

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.600
on the sunset.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.040
Oh, how beautiful-- share, like,
heart, you know, et cetera.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.170
You know, one of the things
I can never understand,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.181
there's a picture of
a rock in the desert.

00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:11.680
Maybe you can help
me out with this.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.600
There's a picture of
a rock in the desert.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.570
And there's a guy wearing
a business suit jumping off

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.710
the rock in the desert.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.560
I've never figured out why is
this guy wearing a business

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.210
suit jumping off a
rock in the desert?

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.110
But never mind,
share, like, you know.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.620
So anyway, you go
onto social media.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.050
And you find an
image of a sunset.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.450
And superimposed in
some of that writing

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.580
you can do in one
of these apps, it

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:42.190
says "Before you complain
about anything in your life,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.530
count the things you
can be grateful for."

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.750
You go, oh, that's wonderful.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.030
"Before you complain,
count the things--"

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.560
and you go share, like,
heart, like, comment, you see?

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.460
And that evening, when
your partner comes home,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.166
you say, how was your day?

00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:02.020
And your partner
says, it was terrible.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.237
I mean, I left
home late for work.

00:14:05.237 --> 00:14:07.570
I got stuck in traffic; there
was some kind of accident.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.294
I got to the office late.

00:14:09.294 --> 00:14:10.960
There was a meeting,
which I had to come

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.520
into in the middle
of the meeting.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.580
The first thing they said
is where's the report?

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.330
I searched around.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.413
I left home too quickly;
I didn't have the report.

00:14:18.413 --> 00:14:20.170
It was incredibly humiliating.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.970
I had a bellyache the whole day.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.052
I got a parking ticket.

00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:24.510
On the way home,
I had a flat tire.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.590
It was like the worst day ever.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.580
But you remember
that little thing

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.580
that you saw earlier in
the day on social media.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.850
And you say, well, honey,
before you complain

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.040
about anything in
your life, remember

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.820
what you can be grateful for.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.270
However, this is not an
authentic, original, innovative

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.560
response to the situation.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.050
It's just
regurgitating a thought

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.550
that you read
earlier in the day.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.100
And it doesn't get exactly the
response you were hoping for.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.930
In fact, it might even
earn you a slap, see?

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.600
So that's an example of
a horizontal thought.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.130
It's not original.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.490
It's not responding with
genius and creativity

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.400
in an unexpected
way to the familiar.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.050
It's just regurgitating
something you've heard before.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.560
It's hard to measure
these things.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.940
But we could guess that almost
all thoughts are like that.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.010
Almost all thoughts
are just repeating

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:22.870
something that has been
programmed into us, correct?

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.410
But then there's another kind
of thought, a thought which

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.150
is quite rare, which doesn't
get generated by a preceding

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.230
thought on the surface.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.780
It arises from deep within us.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.630
And of course, it requires
us to be connected deep

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.660
within us in order for that
kind of thought to happen.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.060
But it's a thought that
percolates up from the depths.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.500
It percolates from beyond
the mind, and gains momentum

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.390
as it comes to the
surface so that, when

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.170
it arises on the
surface, it becomes

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.320
the general theory of relativity
or a completely different way

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.880
to think of phones.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:03.760
Or it becomes a way
to end global warming.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.920
It becomes a way to cure cancer.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.160
It becomes a way to
think of things in a way

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.220
that we've never thought
of them before, all right?

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.740
Now, if we had a way--

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.260
if all of us in this
room-- if we had a way

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.770
to have more of these
thoughts that bubble up

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:25.750
out of a mysterious source
and give birth into the world

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:31.900
through us, we would benefit
from that in many ways.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.160
Is that true?

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.680
Your life would be
extraordinarily meaningful

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.420
if you were having
original thoughts that

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.440
really contribute.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.140
You would actually
make more money.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.800
You would be way more valuable
to the people you work with.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.460
Everything would get better
if we could become vehicles

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.720
of those kind of thoughts.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.740
Are we on the same page?

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.447
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:52.447 --> 00:16:53.280
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Good.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.770
Let's move on.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:17:01.370
So I've made it my business to
interview a lot of incredibly

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.240
brilliant people.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.030
I sought out the most
innovative, brilliant people

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.920
I could find in
different fields.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.230
And I did extensive interviews.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.579
I've done by now I think
close to 450 interviews.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.290
It was 420 when I
finished the book,

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.835
but I've done a few more since.

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:19.730
And I asked them
questions to find out,

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.430
what are the ways
that people live

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.990
who are incredibly brilliant?

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.730
And some of the ways
they live might not

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.470
have an obvious
connection to brilliance.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.070
But if we find a pattern that
brilliant people frequently

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.470
do this kind of
thing, we might start

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.740
to be able to
discover connections

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.170
that we didn't know were there.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.080
So what I've come to
discover, and what

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.520
I want to share
with you today is,

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.490
brilliance becomes
quite predictable.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.050
It's no longer just an accident.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.090
It becomes predictable
when we can

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.860
recognize that brilliance is
actually the byproduct of four

00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:00.890
different kinds of
subjective experience-- four

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.990
different kinds of
subjective experience,

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.780
therefore, four different
kinds of activity,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.830
and also four very different
ways that your brain operates

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.924
with different brain
chemicals involved.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.340
So what I'm going
to do now is I'm

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.410
going to go through
this cycle and explain

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.704
to you the characteristics of
these four different movements.

00:18:18.704 --> 00:18:20.120
And as you'll see,
because they're

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.220
so different from each other,
and because they involve

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.310
completely opposing value sets--

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.570
the values in this orange
arrow are the opposite values

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.770
of the brown arrow.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.080
In fact, anywhere
you go on this cycle,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.230
the values that are represented
by that position on the cycle

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.270
are the complete
opposite of the values

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.426
and completely different
beliefs about reality

00:18:43.426 --> 00:18:45.050
than the other side
of the cycle, which

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.140
partly comes to
explain why brilliance

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.460
is so unusual in the world.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.400
Because it requires us
to be able to contain

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.420
completely contradictory values
within a human life, right?

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.770
So let's start.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.870
I'm going to first
identify four positions

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.970
on this cycle,
something like a clock,

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.720
with 12:00 at the top,
3:00, 6:00, and 9:00.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.060
When we understand the flavor
of these four positions,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.660
then we can understand
the movements.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.440
But I do want to emphasize,
these stations, 12:00, 3:00,

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.000
6:00 and 9:00-- no one stays
in any one station very long.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.540
Just like with a clock,
it's not exactly 12 o'clock

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.560
for very long, right?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.740
It's 11:58, 11:59, 11:59
and 45 seconds, 46, 47.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.310
It's only for a split second
that it's exactly 12:00,

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.450
and then it becomes
12:01, you see?

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.190
So 12:00 isn't a place you stay.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.540
It's a place you pass through.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.414
Does that make sense?

00:19:39.414 --> 00:19:40.250
All right.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.730
So I'm going to describe to you
four stations, which are just

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.080
places that we pass through.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.880
So the first we
could call awakening.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.020
An awakening means
at least having

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.380
fleeting tastes of a
state of consciousness

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.260
which is boundaryless--

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.480
in other words, to be able
to experience consciousness

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.690
in its purity, when it's
not focused on something

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.040
with boundaries.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.360
Now, this is probably the most
unusual of these four stations.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.820
It's the one that requires the
most explaining because it's

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.100
not everybody's experience.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.720
It is the experience of people
who have focused on mysticism

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.720
or what some people call
spirituality or whatever.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.910
It becomes the
focus of people who

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.620
are interested in meditation.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.860
But it's not necessarily
a primary focus

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.670
for most people in the world.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.791
It means they become interested
in the nature of consciousness

00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:39.290
itself.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.840
Now, consciousness
or awareness can

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.970
look at an object
with boundaries

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.600
and see, oh, it's this big,
this tall, it has this color.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.447
And it can also experience
the same thing in time.

00:20:50.447 --> 00:20:53.030
This was not there, not there,
now it's there, now it's there,

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.280
now it's not there, not there.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.350
So we tend to experience
things that have

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.000
boundaries of time and space.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.360
But that which
experiences the boundaries

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.380
of time and space, what
boundaries does that have,

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.550
right?

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:11.670
And if we say, well, that also
has boundaries, it's this big,

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.350
then you can simply
ask, well, OK,

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.784
so if you're aware of this
big, who's aware of that?

00:21:16.784 --> 00:21:18.450
And that boundary is
going to drop away.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.090
And there's going to be the
revelation of something which

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.350
has less boundaries.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.550
If that process continues,
you have the same experience

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.080
as when you walk
over to the window

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.510
and look directly upwards.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.356
And what do you see?

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:32.730
If you look through
the buildings

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.355
and through the trees,
what do you see?

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.320
Help me.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.895
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:39.895 --> 00:21:40.645
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Hm?

00:21:40.645 --> 00:21:41.580
Say it again.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:41.880
AUDIENCE: The horizon.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.320
ARJUNA ARDAGH: The hor--
well, if you look straight up,

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.300
you see the sky, right?

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.440
And what is the sky?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.195
Tell me, how big is the sky if
you think about going that way?

00:21:51.195 --> 00:21:52.557
AUDIENCE: It's limitless.

00:21:52.557 --> 00:21:53.890
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Limitless, right?

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.556
Which actually-- I
don't know about you,

00:21:55.556 --> 00:21:57.160
but it kind of blows my mind.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.370
If I try and grock the fact that
you could keep going forever,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.790
and there's no edge to it, it's
almost impossible for your mind

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.290
to understand that.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.270
That's what happens
at 12 o'clock.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.220
Except, instead of going
out of the building

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.030
and looking up in the
sky, you look internally

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.420
to your own nature and
discover that the nature

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.340
of consciousness
itself, when it's not

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.850
trapped in an experience,
the nature of consciousness

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.070
itself is limitless.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.780
Just curious,
because many people

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.627
have explored this in one
way or another already,

00:22:28.627 --> 00:22:30.710
just let me see for a
second, how many people feel

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.160
you've had at least a taste
of that in your life--

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.647
a taste of when boundaries
dropped away and there

00:22:35.647 --> 00:22:36.980
was something kind of limitless?

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.720
It can happen in meditation.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.760
It can happen bungee jumping.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.232
It can happen making love.

00:22:42.232 --> 00:22:43.690
It can happen in
all sorts of ways.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.630
The boundaries drop
away, and you feel free

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.210
in your consciousness.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.200
So that's 12 o'clock.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.500
The next station is at 3:00.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.370
And 3:00 now is a different
kind of subjective experience,

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.260
a different kind
of brain chemistry.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.950
And it's characterized
by creative flow.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.600
A lot has been written about
flow in the last years.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.190
You know, people have been
documenting flow states.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.220
I would suggest to you today
that a flow state is only

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.540
a part of brilliance.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.380
It's an essential part.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.220
But if we focus
only on flow states,

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.270
we become incredibly creative,
but not necessarily brilliant

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.660
in terms of results.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.410
So creative flow-- it's
highly pleasurable.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.150
It's where energy is
flowing through you.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.470
You don't have to do anything.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.020
It's the musicians
jamming together,

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.390
and they're just being
played by the music.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.940
It's when you're surfing a
wave, and you just let go,

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.170
and the wave carries you.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.500
It's a writer writing
automatically,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.220
doesn't have to make any effort.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.840
Let's just, again, do a check.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.610
How many people feel you've
sometime in some context

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.780
been carried away by a creative
flow, and you can just let go,

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.170
and it happens on its own?

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.070
Great.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.430
So that's 3 o'clock,
creative flow.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:03.670
The next station at 6:00 is
the station of achievement.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:08.450
It's achieving material results,
bringing things in on time.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.030
So it's characterized
by taking action.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.990
It's characterized by
boundaries of time and space.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.770
In that way, it's the
opposite of 12:00.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.070
Remember 12:00 was boundaryless.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.900
6:00 is all about boundaries.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.830
It's about budget, agreements,
contracts, deadlines.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.590
It's all about
operating within limits.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.660
And it actually, very
often, creates stress.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.324
Because having to put
yourself within boundaries

00:24:31.324 --> 00:24:33.490
and operate within boundaries
and you might be late,

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.280
it creates a noradrenaline
response in the brain

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.800
and an adrenal response
in the kidneys.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.460
And finally, the last
position is actually--

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.220
it is difficult to explain
just as one space, one place.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.600
It's a journey,
which begins, which

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.690
I'll explain why in a minute,
it begins with feelings

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.805
of limitation and regret.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.190
It begins with feelings of
I could have done better.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.680
And that's not only a thought.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.210
"I could have done
better" is also

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.490
that sinking feeling
in your chest.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:13.560
It's a feeling of shame,
which, if you live in shame,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.505
and you can't get out of
it, it's toxic, right?

00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:19.470
If you live in
habitual shame, that's

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.760
not a good place to live life.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.600
But on the other hand,
if you never feel shame,

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.810
or if you never feel
regret, there's no learning.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.280
Do you agree?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.620
Shame also has a healthy
function in our lives.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.620
So the journey
from 6:00 to 12:00

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.020
is a journey from regret--

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.860
I messed up, I could
have done better,

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.820
I can't believe I did that,
I was rude and abrasive,

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.370
I burned myself out, I
burned other people out.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.740
And it moves through
to 9 o'clock,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.060
which is a place of
self-forgiveness, of learning,

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.120
of humility.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.860
Now, in fact, to speak
of these stations

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.390
is slightly misleading.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.150
Because you don't stay in
any one place for very long.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:01.930
You're constantly in movement.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.730
So let's look at the movements.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.020
The first movement, the orange
movement-- and incidentally,

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.110
at any point, if you start
to examine your life,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.450
or if-- as I'm a coach,
I examine other people's

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.370
lives for them.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.390
If you start to look at
your life, at any moment,

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:22.880
you will find yourself somewhere
in one of these four movements,

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.180
OK?

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.190
Now, we'll find out in a moment.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.470
You may have a
preference for some parts

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.270
of the cycle over others.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.490
And that creates an
imbalance in brilliance.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:36.120
But at any moment, you can
find yourself sitting somewhere

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.200
in one of these four movements.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.770
And what tends to happen
is, the movements tend

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.050
to get divorced from the cycle.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.000
So we experience the movement
to be what life's about instead

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.261
of being part of a cycle.

00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:50.760
So let's look at
the first movement.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.630
The first movement
begins right after 12:00.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.480
It begins right after that
moment of boundaryless

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.780
transcendence or a
deeply meditative state.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:06.630
And it begins with the finest
impulses of creative tremor.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:10.050
That's long before it's become
a thought or a clear idea.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.580
It's just the faintest
tremor like a perfume carried

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.680
over the wind from far away--

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.610
just something in the air,
just like a faint melody.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.460
And often, we become
desensitized to those kind

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.390
of faint tremors.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.200
We're too busy.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.990
We're too getting things
done to even pay attention.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.800
But if we do pay attention,
the first movement

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.930
is a movement from that faintest
impulse into creative flow.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.210
As you pay attention
to that impulse,

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.530
give it attention,
give it encouragement,

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:48.600
it builds in intensity, and
it becomes creative flow.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.990
But the entire journey
from 12:00 to 3:00

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.520
is a journey that is effortless.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.030
It's something that's
happening to you.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.490
The next movement is
the blue movement,

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.650
is the movement from flow
to getting things done.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.195
So you start with flowing.

00:28:05.195 --> 00:28:06.820
Things are just
happening on their own.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.360
You're surfing the
wave of creativity.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.990
But if you surf it and
move through the cycle,

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.350
it becomes productivity.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:21.600
Now, there's actually a
masculine and a feminine way

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.795
to do that based on
different hormones.

00:28:24.795 --> 00:28:26.619
If you have a--

00:28:26.619 --> 00:28:29.160
you could call it, I suppose,
a masculine and feminine style.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.560
But if you have more
testosterone running

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.750
in your body, you're
probably going

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.140
to get things done in a
testosterone style, which

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.939
means you have a goal, right?

00:28:38.939 --> 00:28:40.230
There are obstacles in the way.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.146
Never mind, we're going
to blast through them.

00:28:42.146 --> 00:28:43.740
If necessary, we'll
stay up all night.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.160
It doesn't matter.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.940
I'm going to make it alone.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.856
I don't need any help.

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:46.980
We're just going to go.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.460
And that way of thinking
is more associated

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.580
with the hormone testosterone.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.290
And of course, if you go back
to the '50s, a lot of business

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.110
was run like that.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:08.190
The more feminine style, if you
have more oxytocin and estrogen

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.260
running in your body,
the more feminine style

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.940
is to have a feeling of team.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.140
We're in this together.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.660
I've got your back;
you've got mine.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.350
We're going to trust it's
going to work out well.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.100
We're going to move
through this together.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.560
And there's less
of a willingness

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.351
to get stressed and
burned out because it's

00:29:21.351 --> 00:29:23.310
seen as unproductive.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.380
But either way, whether
we go through a masculine

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.700
or a feminine style,
somehow we make our way

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.090
to bringing things home on time.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.540
But the closer we
get to 6 o'clock,

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.540
the more we start to create
noradrenaline in the brain.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.510
Adrenaline in the kidneys, but
noradrenaline in the brain,

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.780
which means the closer
you get to the deadline,

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.300
the more you move into
sympathetic nervous system

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.490
activity, and you
start to suppress

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.644
parasympathetic activity.

00:29:52.644 --> 00:29:54.060
You probably know
what that means.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.120
But strong sympathetic
nervous system activity

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.030
means you stop noticing if you
need to go to the bathroom.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.180
You stop noticing if your eyes
are itchy or you feel tired.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.250
You stop noticing
if you need to eat.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.800
You stop noticing the effect
you're having on other people.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.990
You just get really driven.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:14.100
And parasympathetic activity
means you go, oh, whoa,

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.270
my back's hurting.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.260
I'm really tired.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.280
I'm actually-- ugh.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.890
And you can keep up sympathetic
dominance for months.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.550
And then, of course,
you have a burnout,

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:27.090
and that creates what's called
parasympathetic flooding, which

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.790
is something that I notice a
lot when I work with people

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.410
who work under deadlines.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.170
They push and push
and push at 6 o'clock.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.870
When they finally,
either take a break

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.460
or are forced to
take a break, there's

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.160
this flood of
parasympathetic activity.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.830
And suddenly you
feel terrible, right?

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.480
Because all the
symptoms that have

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.540
been building up in the body
suddenly flood your system.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.900
And everything's hurting,
including all of your emotions.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.180
And this moves us into
the next phase, OK,

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.180
which is-- this can
happen in a mild way.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.090
If you balance your
life, every day

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.460
you have a little
nervous breakdown.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.270
You know, at 6 o'clock, it's
like, oh, I did this wrong.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.280
But it takes 15 minutes,
and you're through it.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.220
If you don't do that every
day, if you don't do that

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.662
repeatedly, then it
builds up over months,

00:31:13.662 --> 00:31:15.120
and then you have
a real breakdown.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.790
But the movement
from 6:00 to 9:00

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.970
is the movement from
some kind of regret--

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.220
regret for the way
you treated yourself

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.220
or regret for the way you
treated other people--

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.580
to humility.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.260
Now, there's a little, I
think, very interesting side

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.590
note about just after 6:00.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.330
There was a book written
in the 20th century--

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.900
if you can remember
back that far--

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.520
by Gregory Bateson.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.260
Gregory Bateson,
in my opinion, was

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.700
one of the greatest minds
of the 20th century.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.780
He wrote a book called
"Towards an Ecology of Mind."

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.440
And in that book, he coined
the word double bind.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.450
And Gregory Bateson
saw double bind

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:02.040
as the inevitable result of
fully participating in life.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.530
So if you really jump
in with both feet--

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.250
I'm here; I'm going to fully
give everything I've got--

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.910
you're going to inevitably--
not just if you're unlucky--

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:16.860
you're going to inevitably be
faced with impossible choices.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.360
Should I do this?

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.590
Or should I do that?

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.050
But whichever way
you choose, there's

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.660
going to be some regret
about what you didn't do.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.850
I'll give you a
really quick example.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:30.420
If you watch soap
operas on the TV,

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.790
like dramas on the
TV that repeat,

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.930
every episode almost invariably
involves a double bind.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.090
That's what makes
drama interesting.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:43.680
So a typical double
bind would be

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.680
someone inherits the
company from their parents.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.600
Their parents have gotten old,
but they inherit the company.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.891
There's a lot of people who
work for the company who've

00:32:50.891 --> 00:32:53.340
been with a company for
years, so it's like a family.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.580
But there's also a lot of
family money in the company.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.739
Automation has taken over.

00:32:57.739 --> 00:32:58.530
Now what do you do?

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.200
Do you let go of the people
because of the automation,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.090
which means you're
letting down families

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.150
who've been with the
company for generations?

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.790
Or do you keep the people on
and disappoint the shareholders?

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.250
Within the double bind,
there's no solution to that.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.360
See the point?

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.360
Within that double bind,
you can't please everybody.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.970
Sometimes the double bind
is, do I please other people,

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.580
or do I care take
care of my own needs?

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.740
But a double bind
means that, once you've

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.490
made the decision with the best
faculties you could muster,

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.460
there is still regret at
the end of the decision.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.200
And it's that double
bind that moves us

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.390
from regret to humility.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.510
By the time you move through the
parasympathetic nervous system

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.920
activity, by the time you come
to terms with the double bind,

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.550
when you get to 9
o'clock, you're fully

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.610
settled in a state of humility.

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.057
You realize, I did my best.

00:33:50.057 --> 00:33:52.140
I did the best I could do
under the circumstances.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.990
I made some mistakes, but
everybody makes mistakes.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:58.420
I'm a limited human being
with limited resources,

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.630
but I'm a good person,
and I forgive myself.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.350
You see?

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:05.460
That's 9 o'clock, which is, from
a brain chemical standpoint,

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.300
is a preponderance
of GABA in the brain.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.580
GABA is the brain
chemical which allows you

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.190
to feel it's OK to rest now.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.440
I've given the best
that I could give.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.960
I'm essentially a good person.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.580
And it's OK for me
to take a break.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.480
The last movement is the
movement from that humility

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.030
to awakening.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:34.409
And it begins with an intuition
of something beyond your mind.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:38.940
It begins with the intuition,
there's a few things I know.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.920
I'm a good person doing
my best, but there's

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.110
so much I don't know.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.210
There's so much that
future generations

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:49.409
will know that I don't
have access to just now.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.510
And that feeling
of humility allows

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:55.949
you to have the intuition of
something beyond your mind.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.770
It could be an intuition
of the future of humanity,

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.440
like where will we
be in 100 years?

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.500
It could be an intuition
of your own deepest nature,

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.070
deeper than the
thoughts that limit us.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.240
And it could be a kind
of religious thing,

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.370
where you have an
intuition of the divine--

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.860
something bigger than the
human, some intelligence

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.940
bigger than the human.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.180
But that is the last movement,
and it brings us back--

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:23.850
if you follow that, it brings us
back into moments of awakening.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:28.530
If it's possible-- and
it's very, very rare--

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:32.880
but if it's possible to
create a human life where

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.330
each of these four movements
are active simultaneously

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:41.100
in a life, ideally, where
each of those four movements

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.790
is active in a day,
I would suggest,

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:48.840
based on everything I've been
able to track with clients

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.260
and other coaches,
brilliance becomes

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.810
much more of a
predictable outcome

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.010
and much less of an accident.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.010
Because we're accessing
a consciousness

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.280
beyond the boundaries
of the human mind

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.540
and bringing that
forth in creative flow,

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.700
and bringing into
manifestation a willingness

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.680
to learn from mistakes, when
those four phases are active,

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.340
brilliance becomes
much more likely.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.330
And the corollary
is true that, when

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.920
I've interviewed
brilliant people,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.255
you can find evidence of
all of those four phases

00:36:25.255 --> 00:36:25.880
in their lives.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.500
So the book that you
have on your seat

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.120
gives a lot of examples of that.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.662
We've got a hard
finish at 1 o'clock?

00:36:33.662 --> 00:36:34.161
Yeah.

00:36:34.161 --> 00:36:35.420
OK, I'll move on through.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:41.130
So everything I've described to
you so far is nice in theory.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:41.630
OK?

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.850
It's a great theory,
a great model.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:49.880
In actual fact, you find
almost nobody living all four

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.620
of those phases in a
completely balanced way.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.120
It's a little bit like you
go to the acupuncturist.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.350
And theoretically, there
is chi flowing through all

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.469
of the meridians in the body.

00:37:02.469 --> 00:37:04.760
But actually-- have you ever
been to an acupuncturist--

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.370
if you go to the acupuncturist,
they measure your pulses.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.745
They're going to
say, oh, there's

00:37:08.745 --> 00:37:11.330
a little deficit in the liver,
a little build-up of energy

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.220
in the spleen.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.900
I've never been to
an acupuncturist

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.950
where they said,
oh, everything's

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:16.741
perfectly balanced.

00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:19.460
And I don't know if anyone's
ever been to an acupuncturist

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.510
and been told that.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.750
The nature of the human body
is there's always some excess

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.310
and some deficiency.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.860
Well, in the same
way, when we actually

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.680
come down on the ground
and work with human beings,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:36.000
instead of this, we
see that, you see?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.480
Instead of the free flow
of these four movements,

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.810
we actually see various
kinds of blockage,

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.700
which is kind of
depressing news,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.590
I suppose, relative
to our brilliance.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.360
But relative to our potential,
it's very good news.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.220
It means we can actually start
to map the nature of blockage.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.830
And when we're able to
accurately understand

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.530
the nature of blockage,
it means, very simply,

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.110
at any particular
moment, either you

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.010
are being completely brilliant,
you're being Einstein,

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.530
or we can diagnose
some kind of blockage.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.030
You see?

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.337
It's very helpful, right?

00:38:09.337 --> 00:38:10.920
It's very helpful
as a coaching method

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.290
because either you are
just wowing everybody,

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.250
it's just flowing
through like genius,

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:19.200
it's just flowing everywhere,
or something is blocked.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.489
And this has become
more and more

00:38:21.489 --> 00:38:23.280
and more accurate in
the way that we coach.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.200
We can go, wow.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.580
You can actually--
once you recognize

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.220
the flavors of
blockage, it becomes

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.710
very easy to diagnose
the blockage,

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.137
and then to be
able to free it up.

00:38:34.137 --> 00:38:35.720
So we've been able,
as a group-- there

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.460
are a couple of my
colleagues here today-- we've

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.790
been able to map four
kinds of blockage.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.790
And the four styles of blockage
exist everywhere in the cycle.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.870
So the first is addiction.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:52.650
Addiction means that we fixate
on one part of the cycle,

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:55.282
and we say, this
is what life is.

00:38:55.282 --> 00:38:56.490
The rest of it doesn't exist.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:57.900
Life is about this.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.569
So you could get
addicted to flow, right?

00:39:00.569 --> 00:39:01.860
You could get addicted to flow.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.290
I just want to flow and flow
and flow and flow and flow.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:05.790
Never mind about
achieving anything.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.850
Never mind about learning.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:07.830
I just want to be in flow.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.980
That would be an addiction.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.250
See, you can get
addicted to awakening.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.020
That would be a kind
of spiritual life

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.624
where all you want is just
limitless consciousness.

00:39:15.624 --> 00:39:17.040
I don't ever want
to open my eyes,

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.350
just like more and
more om mani padme hum.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:20.850
See?

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.600
That would be a spiritual
addiction, which

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.580
is actually a possible thing.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.860
So addiction means that you
pick out one part of the cycle,

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.290
and that's where
you choose to live.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:35.901
Now equally, that can express
itself also as judgment.

00:39:35.901 --> 00:39:37.650
And judgment has a
different flavor to it.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.690
Judgment would mean
that you develop

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.420
a kind of disdain for a
certain part of the cycle.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.220
I can't believe people do that.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.030
So you could actually imagine
two people, one addicted

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.180
to a part of the cycle, the
other one in judgment of it.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.190
I teach a lot in
Germany, so I usually

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.942
tell the story as
two German brothers,

00:39:54.942 --> 00:39:56.400
that there are two
German brothers.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.440
They graduate from university.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.380
And Hans, Hans is a
very practical guy.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.850
He gets a job with Mercedes.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:03.580
He's an engineer.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.830
He rises up through the ranks.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.246
He's driving a
great car, he's got

00:40:06.246 --> 00:40:07.860
a big house, a lot of money.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.270
Hans is doing great.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.950
But Wolfgang says, I
don't want any of that.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.860
He goes off to India.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.940
He changes his name to Swami
Sri Sri [INAUDIBLE] Maharaj

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.190
Sri [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:24.210
And he comes back in orange
robes and beads and everything.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:24.900
And they meet.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.850
After a few years, they meet.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.610
And there's Hans in his fancy
car, and his fancy house,

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.190
and everything's great, and
the yacht and multiple houses.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.770
And there's now
Wolfgang as the Swami.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:38.290
And Wolfgang says to
Hans, what are you doing?

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.930
What are you doing
with all this stuff?

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:43.270
You're not even a human being
anymore, you're a human doing,

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:47.790
you're a human achieving,
you're a human having.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.610
You need to find god, see?

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:56.040
Because Wolfgang has a
judgment of 6 o'clock.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.440
He has a judgment
of accomplishment.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.110
But meanwhile, Hans says,
what are you doing in India?

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.194
Why are you wearing
all that weird stuff?

00:41:04.194 --> 00:41:04.860
What's in India?

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.750
Is there like a business
opportunity there or something?

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.340
Because I don't
get it, why you're

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.940
wasting all your time with that.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.000
They have conflicting
values where

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
each one thinks that the part
of the cycle where they live

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.760
is the purpose of life, see?

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.290
And most people
you meet, when you

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.920
come to recognize the
possibility of this cycle, most

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:27.840
people you meet have given
an inordinate importance

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.330
to one part of the cycle
at the expense of the rest.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:33.810
So that's judgment.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.760
Judgment means you look
at one part of the cycle,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.440
and you go, oh, I
can't believe anybody

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.870
wastes their time with that.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.130
And you can do that with
anywhere on the cycle.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:45.240
The next kind of blockage is
called aspiration resistance.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.270
And that means you look at
somebody doing something,

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.560
and you think, that is amazing.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.850
It looks like a magician
pulling a white rabbit out

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:55.170
of a-- how did you do that?

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.250
I want to learn to do it.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.570
That's incredible.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.202
But you can never
do it yourself.

00:41:59.202 --> 00:42:00.660
So let me give you
a quick example.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:05.100
Let's take aspiration resistance
in the brown arrow, right?

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:10.140
Aspiration resistance would
mean, you're going up to Marin?

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.790
You're going on holiday
to the wine country?

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.190
That sounds great.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:17.110
Oh my goodness, and you
just went for a massage,

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.110
and you're going to
Hawaii next week?

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:20.670
Wow, I so admire you.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.250
I really want to learn to
take care of myself too.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.955
I'm going to do that next month.

00:42:25.955 --> 00:42:28.080
But this weekend I've got
to work late because I've

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.550
got this big deadline, you see?

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.212
So that would be
aspiration resistance.

00:42:31.212 --> 00:42:32.170
You're not in judgment.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:35.370
You think it's great to rest;
you just never go around to it

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.720
yourself, you see?

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.580
Equally, we could go back.

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.366
You see, on the blue cycle,
that would be the artist.

00:42:41.366 --> 00:42:42.490
Did I ring any bells there?

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:42.990
OK.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.660
That would be the artist who
goes, like, you've actually

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.460
managed to finish your novel?

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.860
How did you actually finish it?

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.460
Well, how much have you written?

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.770
783 pages.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.030
I'm only halfway through.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.067
Because that's someone
addicted to creativity.

00:42:57.067 --> 00:42:57.816
They want to-- hm?

00:42:57.816 --> 00:42:58.550
AUDIENCE: 10 minutes.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:59.400
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.170
Want to create, create, create.

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:04.480
Getting something finished
at 6 o'clock looks amazing,

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.850
but you can never pull it off.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:10.800
The last kind of blockage
is called looping.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.570
And that's where you
become a specialist

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:13.950
in one part of the cycle.

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:15.990
And you just go round
and round and round

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:18.850
and round and round in that
little tiny area, for example,

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:19.970
like an editor.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.780
You know, an editor is going
to be working at maybe 2:45

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.569
or maybe 3:15, just
going do-do-do-do.

00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:27.360
That's all they do.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.943
They just go round and round and
round and round in that area.

00:43:29.943 --> 00:43:31.600
Or a project manager--

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.730
be going round and round
and round at about 4:30,

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.070
do-do-do-do-do.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.489
And that's the problem a
little bit of specialization

00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:39.030
and people who work
in organizations.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.910
It's more efficient for
people to go around and around

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:42.930
in one little area.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.970
But of course, they
become efficient

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.177
as a cog in the machine.

00:43:46.177 --> 00:43:47.760
But they lose their
innate brilliance,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.730
which is why the 20% policy
is so brilliant because it

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.200
allows people to flourish
as whole human beings.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.020
OK.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.400
So those are four
kinds of blockage.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.640
But remember, there are
also four quadrants, right?

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.570
Four kinds of blockage in four
quadrants-- so 4 times 4--

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.820
that's going to be a difficult
one for Googlers-- what

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:06.509
do you think?

00:44:06.509 --> 00:44:07.050
AUDIENCE: 16.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:07.799
ARJUNA ARDAGH: 16.

00:44:07.799 --> 00:44:10.680
16 kinds of blockage, right?

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.490
So it means, as
coaches, we can now

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:19.230
recognize the distinct
flavor of 16 ways

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:22.110
that brilliance gets
blocked, isn't that great?

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:23.509
16 unique styles.

00:44:23.509 --> 00:44:25.050
And you start to be
able to smell it.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.390
It's like-- I don't
know if you drink wine.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:30.120
Personally, the only distinction
that I'm aware of with wine

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.120
is red and white.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.000
I know the difference
between red and white.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
But when they say, it's a
Merlot, it's not a Chardonnay,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.750
it's a Merlot.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.590
I don't know the difference.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.760
It's red wine or white wine.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.485
I'm a Philistine with wine.

00:44:40.485 --> 00:44:42.610
To this day-- I've been
drinking wine all my life--

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.730
I can't tell the difference
between the different kinds.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:45.740
But some people can.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.120
Some people go, ah, it's
a cheeky little wine

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.706
with a little back splash of
[? blackberry. ?] I'm going,

00:44:51.706 --> 00:44:52.830
what are you talking about?

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.462
Yeah, it's a little je
ne sais quoi of Paris.

00:44:55.462 --> 00:44:57.420
I'm going, wha-- its
[? just ?] wine, you know?

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.970
But anyway, you can get
really refined with this.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.560
Well, I can't do
that with wine, but I

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.390
can do that with blockage.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.960
When I coach somebody, I can--

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.330
all of us, we're getting
more and more skilled at it--

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:14.010
you can smell the exact
which one of these 16 flavors

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:14.965
is happening.

00:45:14.965 --> 00:45:16.590
So let's just move
on to the last piece

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.390
of this, which is
the way all of this

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.690
becomes really,
really helpful is,

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:26.100
we have a project going called
the Radical Brilliance project.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.920
And we are able, because
more and more people

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:34.170
are involved in this now, we're
able to actually map practice.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:38.400
Now, what I mean by
practice is anything,

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.450
anything that's ever been done
by anybody in the whole history

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.990
of humanity which changes
your state of consciousness.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.600
Anything which has
the effect of shifting

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.510
your state of consciousness,
we would call a practice.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.390
So meditation is
obviously a practice,

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:59.370
but so is going shopping,
if it changes your state.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:00.630
So is going swimming.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:01.560
So is making love.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.440
So is having a glass of wine.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.800
Under the right circumstances,
anything could be a practice.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.780
But what we see now, as
the more this cycle becomes

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.380
accurate and verifiable
in experience,

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.920
we realize anything that
any human being has ever

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.070
done in the history
of all of humanity,

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:24.840
anything we have
ever done that was

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.850
intended to change consciousness
fits somewhere into this cycle.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.330
So any consciousness-changing
practice

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:35.030
is actually a
viable way of moving

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.250
through a part of the
cycle where you're blocked.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.900
So I'll give you a few examples.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.170
Right after 12:00-- remember,
that was these finest tremors--

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.230
you can make a practice
of experiencing pleasure

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:47.460
in your body, like
you deliberately--

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.390
oh, there's a little pocket
of pleasure, mm, right there--

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:54.140
so deliberately experiencing
pleasurable sensations

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:58.010
in your body is a way of
amplifying those tremors that

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.720
happen soon after 12:00.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.240
Automatic writing
is a practice that

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.480
happens somewhere in the
middle of that orange cycle.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.000
Musicians jamming together,
where they're taken over

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.190
by the music, that's
a practice that's

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:14.210
going to amplify like, 2:45.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:15.927
Setting intentions--
there used to be

00:47:15.927 --> 00:47:18.260
this thing about the law of
attraction was very popular.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.260
Setting an intention-- I'm
going to do that in the future.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.970
That happens right after 3:00.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.040
It's got all of
the flavor of flow,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.680
but it's got the
future attached to it.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.520
Making agreements-- OK, I'll
have this done by 3 o'clock.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.560
I give you my word, right?

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.200
That agreement is
a 4:30 practice.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.810
It's right in the middle
of getting things done.

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.660
Pushing through at the last
minute, staying up late,

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.010
drinking coffee to
get the deadline met,

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:47.560
that's a practice
sometimes useful at 5:45.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.060
You can see you don't want to
live your whole life that way,

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.600
but it's a great practice when
you need to meet a deadline.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.530
Right after 6 o'clock is,
not a very popular practice,

00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:59.420
but deliberately feeling pain.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.469
Stopping-- maybe
that's why sometimes

00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:02.510
why we go to a therapist.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.640
The therapist helps
you to feel pain

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.230
you've been unwilling to feel.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:07.930
And under the right
circumstances,

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.390
it's a great thing to do.

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:12.080
That's a 6:15 practice.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.440
Making atonement-- very popular
in the 12-step movement--

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.050
writing letters, I'm really
sorry I did this 30 years ago.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:19.340
I really feel bad about it.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.370
That's a repairing
practice at 7:30.

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:24.890
Self-forgiveness--
going for a walk

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.500
and really thinking about
that you're essentially

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.770
a good person, getting in touch
with your essential goodness

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.120
and forgiving yourself.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.850
That's an 8:45 practice.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:36.830
And in the last
segment, prayer, when

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.220
you feel very separate from
something outside yourself,

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.600
but you ask for help.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.910
That would be a practice
right after 9:00.

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:46.040
Meditation would be
a practice that--

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.040
or the beginning of meditation,
like Hinayana meditation.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.350
But as we get closer
to 12:00, there

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:54.380
are practices designed to
just push you over the edge,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:57.620
like, for example, the Dzogchen
teachings in Tibetan Buddhism,

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:01.010
or the self-enquiry
method of Ramana Maharshi.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.470
So that's the power of practice.

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:06.650
And you can start to see now
the way that all this works is,

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.560
if your intention in life
is brilliance-- people

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.810
have a lot of-- there' are
a lot of ways to live life.

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.880
You could live your
life for pleasure.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.040
You could live your
life for money.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.900
You could live
your life for fame.

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:21.050
You could live your life
in all kinds of ways.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:25.730
But if you get just
a little taste--

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.776
in German, they call it
[GERMAN],, which I think

00:49:27.776 --> 00:49:29.150
is a much better
word than taste.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:33.530
But if you just get this
little taste of the possibility

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.160
of a life of contribution--

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.380
and Google offers you this
incredibly generous opportunity

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.240
with the 20% thing--

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.800
a taste of what it's like to
live a life of contribution

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.260
to the grandchildren
of your grandchildren,

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.090
contributing to
the quality of life

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.660
of people who are not yet born.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.660
When we get a little
taste of that,

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:57.125
it becomes a positive addiction.

00:49:57.125 --> 00:49:58.250
You understand what I mean?

00:50:00.691 --> 00:50:02.690
If you drink alcohol,
it's a negative addiction.

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.430
You drink more alcohol,
you smoke more cigarettes,

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.096
going oh, I don't
want to be doing this.

00:50:06.096 --> 00:50:07.950
But contribution is
a positive addiction.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.620
The more you contribute
and serve other people,

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.190
the better you feel about
yourself, the more energy

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:15.599
you have, the more
money flows on its own

00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:17.390
without you having to
do anything about it.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.900
Contribution is a
positive addiction.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.050
The more we live a
life of contribution,

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:27.440
the more we become
interested in fostering

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.000
this quality of
brilliance, the more

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.490
we become interested
in helping it along.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:34.940
And hopefully, what I've
shared with you today,

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.960
is a very practical, repeatable,
verifiable way of doing that.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.160
Thanks for listening today.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.310
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about the clock analogy

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:49.500
that you used with the cycle.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.420
Did you intentionally
make that to mirror,

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.560
the structure of a day?

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:53.800
Because it seems
like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.310
ARJUNA ARDAGH: No, no.

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:56.060
Actually, that's a
great point, thank you.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.914
And in that way, I could
have gone north, east, south,

00:51:00.914 --> 00:51:01.830
and west or something.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:03.780
No, it actually-- in that
way, it's a little misleading,

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.930
because it doesn't--

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:09.480
in fact, if you think
about it, 12 o'clock

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.420
is something that I visit
early in the morning.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.730
Intentionally, I get up at
4 o'clock in the morning--

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:17.400
4:30, actually-- and
if you do get a chance

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.460
to look at the book,
you'll find out why.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.350
But very, very
early in the morning

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.180
is the best time
to access 12:00.

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.790
Before the sun comes
up, it's a great time.

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:29.650
And there are a lot of
traditions that support that.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:33.114
The time from 12:00 to
3:00 doesn't need very long

00:51:33.114 --> 00:51:34.530
to activate unless
you're actually

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:36.600
writing a book or something.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.940
You only need, like, 15
minutes of 12:00 to 3:00

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:40.270
to activate it.

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:44.370
But that's also a good thing
to do right around the dawn.

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:47.310
As, literally, as the sun is
coming up over the horizon,

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.380
that's a great time to
be in 12:00 to 3:00,

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.960
where you're ushering in
these creative impulses.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.090
You can write some
notes or do something.

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:58.470
Most of our day, because
of the society we live in,

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.500
in the post-Industrial
Revolution, most of our day

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.760
is spent in 3:00 to 6:00.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.160
I mean, you're going to spend
a great part of your day

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:05.920
in 3:00 to 6:00.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.836
But it doesn't matter.

00:52:06.836 --> 00:52:09.060
So long as those other
quadrants have been opened,

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.800
it doesn't matter.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.620
The best time for the 6:00
to 9:00-- the brown phase

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.790
is at the end of the day.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.340
So whenever you shut
off your computer

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:20.130
and say I'm done with working,
that's a time to reflect.

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:23.610
And we have practices
in our coaching method

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:26.700
that encourage you to
actually feel, ugh,

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.700
to feel this kind of, ugh,
embarrassment or shame

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.300
and to learn from it.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:35.010
And finally, the movement
from 9:00 to 12:00,

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:36.480
that is actually
something that you

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.330
can enter into sleep with and
also come out of sleep with.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:44.700
So yeah, no, the times
don't measure the 24 cycle,

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.306
but it's an analogy.

00:52:46.306 --> 00:52:47.430
SPEAKER: Thank you, Arjuna.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.780
[APPLAUSE]
