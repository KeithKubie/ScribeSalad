00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.500
Hi, I'm Adrienne Hill. And I'm Jacob Clifford, and welcome to Crash Course Economics.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
What's wrong with you?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.180
Today we're talking about deficits and debt.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:16.960
[Theme Music]

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.400
You've probably heard a lot about the national debt, so

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.220
what is it and where does it come from and is it a problem, and most importantly, should you even care?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.760
First off, deficit and debt are not the same thing.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.780
A budget deficit is when the government spends more than it bring in tax revenue in a given year.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.940
Then it has to borrow money to cover that year's shortfall.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.460
The debt is the accumulation of budget deficits.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.960
For example, let's start a country called, I don't know, Cliffordonia. It's a pretty cool name.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.560
In its first year, the Cliffordonian government brings in $400 of tax revenue,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.340
and it spends $500, because starting a new country is kinda expensive. So in that year, the deficit is $100.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.420
Then, in the next year it brings in $600 of tax revenue,
but spends $800. That year's deficit is $200.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.620
To calculate Cliffordonia's debt,
add up all those yearly deficits.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.320
So at the end of the second year,
it has a debt of $300

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.700
-- $100 from the first year, and
$200 from the second year.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.100
Things are looking pretty tough for Cliffordonia.
Not only is the nation in debt, it also has an average tax

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.400
revenue of only $500 a year. It's going to be difficult getting the space program off the ground at that rate.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.480
Let's leave the plight of Cliffordonia behind for a moment and talk about the real world.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.120
Specifically, let's talk about the United States,
since it has the largest debt

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.220
-- hooray, America #1!

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.400
[LIBERTAGE]

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:41.200
So how big is the debt right now? $18,236,176,274,963 -- no, wait, $18,236,176,188 -- it's hard to keep up with,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.580
but it's a little over 18 trillion dollars.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.820
So the number sounds really, really high.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.740
I have a hard enough time wrapping my head around millions and billions, not to mention trillions.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.880
The debt seems especially high when you look at the trend over time.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.940
First we need to adjust that trend for inflation because dollars today are not the same as dollars in the past.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.060
Remember, we try to keep it real around here.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.860
Second, we really should be looking at debt as a percent of GDP.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.840
Why? Well suppose I owe $200 bucks, and a 6 year old owes $100.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.380
Which of us will have a harder time paying it off?

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.660
Well, probably the 6 year old, because even though my actual debt number

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.160
is larger, I have a job. I have two jobs.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.700
What's your allowance, you unemployed 6 year old?

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.480
In the same way, our GDP grows every year, due to population growth and productivity increases. And our ability to sustain debt grows along with our income.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.700
So here is the US federal government debt as a percent of GDP.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.760
As you can see, it's risen over the past several years, so, is that a bad thing?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.400
Well, there's a couple ways to look at it.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.700
First, compare the US to other developed nations.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.400
The US has a higher debt-to-GDP than other countries,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.760
but several other countries have a much higher ratio.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.400
Some of these are in crisis, like Greece and Italy, but there are also countries that are stable, like Japan and France, that have much higher levels of debt than the US.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.840
Second, most economists aren't concerned about the borrowing the US has done already, because they're too worried about the borrowing they're gonna do.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.100
A lot of politicians and pundits have freaked out about this, while economists are focused on this.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.300
All right, what we need to figure out is what's driving those huge deficits in coming decades.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.120
Deficits are the difference between
federal spending and revenue.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.980
So let's look at those as a percent of GDP.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.660
The problem isn't a drop off in tax revenue.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.120
What economists are worried about is spending.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.980
So let's look at where the government
actually spends its money.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.040
Conservatives might complain, "It's obvious, handouts!"
Liberals will say, "It's obvious, defense!"

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.560
Well, they're both wrong.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.960
So who's the biggest recipient of federal dollars?

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.300
Grandma and Grandpa.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:43.200
The government spends about a quarter of the budget on Social Security, and another quarter on healthcare programs. A lot of that goes to retired people on Medicare.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.280
They deserve it! They worked hard. And those are the programs that are expected to grow as Baby Boomers retire and live longer.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.840
Defense and other discretionary programs are actually projected to shrink slightly as a percent of GDP.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.680
We'll be making another video on these specific topics
later, because we love making videos, but one thing is

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.400
for sure: US policy makers will be forced to make some hard decisions about these future unfunded liabilities.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400
So the answer is obviously to just keep borrowing more and more money, right?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
Well, not necessarily.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.440
First, to borrow, you need lenders -- people who have decided to save money and loan it out, rather than spend it on something else.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.160
But there's a finite amount of money savers can lend,  and most of that savings is borrowed by the private sector,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.860
which is consumers that take out car loans, and businesses that pay for things like factories and computers.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.160
Now, when the government runs a budget deficit, it borrows from that same pool of savings.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.600
If the government continues to borrow, many economists worry that there'll be fewer loans available for businesses,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.580
and that it'll hurt the long run growth of the economy.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.020
The second worry is the Greece scenario. A country's debt could grow so large that savers, individuals,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.080
and businesses in other continents
might fear they'll never get paid back.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.400
They could stop lending money entirely, or they can lend at higher interest rates.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.920
Higher interest rates would make it harder to pay back the loan, which could likely lead to more debt,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.620
and eventually the government would
simply be unable to pay its bills.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.000
That's called "default," and it's basically terrible for everyone - the investors who loaned the government

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.860
money lose billions, and the government loses all credibility, and it causes a massive recession.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.120
That's what happened to Greece a few years ago, what happened to Argentina in 2001, Russia in 1998, and many other countries throughout history.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.920
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Fortunately, the US
has something called "the debt ceiling,"

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.000
which is a cap on how much debt the
US Treasury can issue.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The US will never ever ever be able to borrow more than the ceiling, so debt can never get out of control!

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.260
Hmmm, no

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.200
Remember that debt comes from repeated deficits.
Deficits come from spending higher than revenues.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.940
The debt ceiling does nothing to cut spending or raise revenue.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.820
It just gets politicians into a big fight every few months.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:45.080
Basically, trying to cut the debt without raising revenue or cutting spending is like trying to lose weight by buying smaller clothes

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.560
instead of with diet or exercise. It doesn't work.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.120
But there is good news for the US. First, both American and foreign lenders charge the US government extremely low interest on its loans.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.100
That tells us they're confident in the government's ability to pay them back,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.900
and the low interest rates actually make it easier for the government to pay.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.220
Second, there are signs that the growth and healthcare costs could actually be slowing.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.700
Now, it's too early to tell if this is true, but if it is, the long-run budget picture will be much better than what we've shown.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:19.060
In fact, the projections for long run deficits and debt have already been revised downward. Go us!

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.700
So is all this debt going to destroy the
American way of life?

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.140
Like most things in economics, and in Crash Course, the answer is complicated, and it depends a lot on what

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.480
you're looking at, as well as your political point of view.
Looking at debt from the past or even the present is a

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.560
good way to have political arguments, but it may
not be a great way to think about the future.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:44.740
Right now healthcare spending is driving the debt higher, but if a massive pandemic kills off half the world, or there's a zombie apocalypse,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.200
after an initial spike, those healthcare
costs are gonna fall.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.240
And frankly, in that case, the national debt and deficit spending will be the least of our worries.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.560
On that cheery note, we've gotta stop. Thanks for watching; see ya next time.
