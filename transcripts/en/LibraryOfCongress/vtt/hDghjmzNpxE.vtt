&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Good afternoon.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.800
I'm Gail Shirazi of the
Israel and Judaica section

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.860
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.290
Welcome to the Library,
and today's program,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.400
"Shores Beyond Shores,"
with author Irene Butter,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.310
and co-authors, John
Bidwell and Kris Holloway.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.580
This event commemorates the 80th
anniversary of Kristallnacht,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.290
the night of the broken glass,
November 9th to 10th, 1938,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.140
a crucial event in the
run-up to the Holocaust.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.760
And we have books.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.510
Irene's books will be for sale,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.910
and she'll be signing
them after the event.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.550
I want to thank you, Mary
Bisby-Beck [assumed spelling].

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.210
I want to thank Walter --
Professor Walter Reich,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850
Michel Wingfield
[assumed spellings],

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.450
and the special events office,
and our two co-authors also.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.360
And I would like to
acknowledge, if they're here,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.370
some of the distinguished
guests.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.970
Is Debbie Dingell,
Congresswoman Dingell here?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.780
Congressman Joe Kennedy
and Jim McGovern --

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.740
they said they would stop by if
nothing else pulled them away,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.480
and since it is the
new Congress,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.220
they may have been
pulled away [laughter].

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.260
We have representatives for
the Embassy of the Netherlands.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.340
Thank you for coming.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.290
Sam Adams, the former mayor
of Portland, Oregon right

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
over there, and Anthony
Fowler, the deputy chair

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.940
of the Federal Holocaust
Remembrance Committee,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.950
right back there.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.510
A crucial way to honor the
memory of those who perished

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.850
in the Holocaust, and ensure
they are not forgotten,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.590
is to preserve historical
documents and artifacts.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.060
To that end, the Library

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.240
of Congress offers rich
resources to the public.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.860
LC has more than 158
million items, including more

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.970
than 36 million books --

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.040
-- and printed material
in 460 languages.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.590
Across the Library's
vast holdings,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.910
there are Holocaust-related
material

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.230
in many languages and formats.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.030
Written resources can
include Ytzkor books,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.580
which are memorial
volumes, personal memoirs,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.800
eyewitnesses' accounts,
and scholarly works.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.070
They're all found
throughout the Library.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.520
Moving image section
has newsreels and films,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.950
such as these two
donated by Irene today.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.200
Genealogy resources are
in our local history

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.690
and genealogy reading room,
photographs in our prints

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.620
and photographs division,
maps in our geography

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.190
and map division, sound
recordings and sheet music

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.630
in our music division.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.630
Periodicals and government
documents in our serials

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.990
and government publications
division, oral histories

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.530
from soldiers who liberated
the concentration camps

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.700
in our veterans'
history project.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.230
We have digital resources
and many, many others.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.830
There are experts in
each of these divisions

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.440
to assist the public, so
please get a reader's card

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.760
and use our extraordinary
collections.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.240
Now, I would like to ask
survivors, hidden children,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.580
and children and
grandchildren of the Holocaust

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.970
to rise and be recognized.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.230
Thank you.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.290
It impacts many generations,
not just the generation

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.640
that was in the Holocaust.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.450
Our greatest resources are our
survivors and their witnesses.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.510
Their stories must be
recorded and passed on.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.280
Irene, Kris, and John
are doing just that.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.920
It's a privilege to
have them here today.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.780
And now, a bit about Irene.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.510
Professor Butter holds a B.A.
from Queens College in New York.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.110
She was one of the first
women to receive a Ph.D.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.100
in economics from Duke.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.240
She is professor emeritus of
health management and policy

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.110
of the University of Michigan
School of Public Health.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.440
She is founder of the
Raoul Wallenberg --

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.720
and lecture series at the
University of Michigan,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.590
and cofounder of Zeitouna,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.270
an Arab-Jewish women's
dialogue group.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.780
Now, our presentation,
and afterwards,

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.030
we'll have a questions
and answer period.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.330
Thank you for coming.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:27.570
[ Applause ]

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.160
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg
Butter: Good afternoon.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.410
Do you hear me?

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.720
Thank you all so much for
coming, and thank you, Gail,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.460
for the opportunity to
present our book at the Library

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.620
of Congress, "Shores Beyond
Shores, From Holocaust to Hope,"

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.350
with my wonderful co-authors,
John Bidwell and Kris Holloway,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.940
who -- together, we worked on
this book for a long, long time.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.610
And I'm so appreciative that
our presentation is linked

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.070
to the Library of
Congress's commemoration

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.600
of the 80th anniversary
of Kristallnacht,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.120
which is a crucial event that
should never be forgotten.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:27.550
So when we started writing
this book, our primary aim was

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.980
to describe the experiences of
a child during the Holocaust,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.940
and to revive the voice of
the child as she saw things,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.990
heard things, and felt things
that were going on around her.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.840
The aim was that this
should never be forgotten,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.090
but unfortunately,
today, we see echoes

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.780
of actions during the
Holocaust all around the world,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.790
and even in our own country.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.750
So in a way, the
book is a bridge

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.240
from the past to the present.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.910
Now, what we'll do today is,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.250
we're going to read
from the book.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:26.610
First Kris Bidwell -- Kris
Holloway will read a section

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.390
that takes place in Amsterdam
about the loss of freedoms

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:37.750
for the Jews, and then I will
follow, reading a section

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.830
of an event in Westerbork, which
was the first concentration camp

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.770
that my family and
I were sent to.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.640
And then, John will read
a passage of a happening

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.670
in Bergen-Belsen, which was
the second concentration camp

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.580
that my family and
myself experienced.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.330
And after our readings,
we will have a closing.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.070
We'll have a session
of kind of wrapping up,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:15.290
and that will be talking
about some themes of the book,

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:20.210
and also linkages from
the past to the present,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.540
and some of what we're
experiencing today.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.030
&gt;&gt; Kris Holloway: Great.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.930
Hello, everyone.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.230
Can you hear me?

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.530
Is this on?

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:37.050
Great. So when we set out to
write this story with Irene,

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.530
a lot of people have asked
about what was that like,

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:46.000
having two co-authors working
with a Holocaust survivor

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.760
to write the book, and how

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.540
in the world did
you get to know her?

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.010
And so, I wanted to say

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.600
that Irene was my
graduate school advisor

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.550
at the University of Michigan.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.030
I did not know that she
was a Holocaust survivor.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.740
She was my advisor, but I
got pregnant really fast.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.590
I thought it would
take a couple years.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.700
I got pregnant with my first
child my first semester

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.760
in grad school, and
I didn't know

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.170
if I could actually pull it off.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.650
The University of
Michigan is a hard school.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:22.230
I know GW is too, got some
students here [laughter].

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.420
And so, I really thought that
I might not make it through,

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.720
and Irene supported me.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.290
She said, "You're studying
maternal and child health.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.590
Stay [laughter].

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.890
I will help you.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.920
I'll take care of Aiden [assumed
spelling] during these meetings"

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.220
-- my little boy.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.210
And really, without her
support, I don't know

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.160
if I would've made
it through that time.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.980
She gave me such support,
and obviously John as well.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.060
And then, she was the
second person after John

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.570
to hold our second son
at his birth at our home

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.200
in Ann Arbor 21 years ago.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.520
So we have stayed really
close friends, and it has been

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.830
such a privilege to
have this time to work

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.410
with her on the memoir.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.600
I was about five years in
the writing, and just came

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.070
out this past January.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.510
So one of my -- because I
feel like I connect with Irene

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.980
through our children, and she
has such spark and such love

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.500
for children, one
of my favorite parts

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.930
of writing the book was really
those early years of Irene's.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.610
And so, Irene was born
in 1930 in Berlin.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.240
Her family fled, and they
unfortunately did not flee

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.540
far enough.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.230
Her father was able to
get a job in Amsterdam

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.160
with the American
Express company,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.720
and thought that was far
enough away from the Nazis,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.140
which we know now, it wasn't.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.130
And so, the scene that I
want to read to you is set --

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.940
they moved to Amsterdam in 1938.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.870
This is the summer of 1941.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.640
So Irene has been
there for three years.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.610
She's 11 years old, and it's
a scene with her best friend,

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.580
Vera, her brother, Werner --
her older brother, Werner,

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:14.460
whose son, John, is here with us
as well, and a boy named Rudy,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.640
who Irene had her
first crush on.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.160
And Irene, in the
book, is called Rini,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.630
which was her nickname.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.730
"With summer's start,
the sun strengthened,

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.390
stretching out its warm light
farther into the evening.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.770
It was June, 1941,
and Vera, Werner,

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.130
and I stayed outside
as long as possible.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.790
Along the nearby canal,
we gathered on our bikes

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.570
to ride along the water's edge.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.590
My metal horse and
Vera's were fast friends,

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.960
as they flew along
at a full gallop.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.700
We grasped the looping
handlebars,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.610
and steered the big
wheels ahead.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.370
Go. At night, the brick
paths along the canals were

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.980
smooth trails.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.900
We barely felt the jiggling
space between the bricks

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.320
as our fat tires
traveled over them.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.090
The two young families were
at home, and people roamed --

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.080
the young families were at home,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.360
and people roamed
leisurely in twos.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.680
We sped along, heady with
the early night smells

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.430
of pollen and full leaves.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.830
Werner was strongest, and could
fly up the bridges and back

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.990
down long before we could,
up, and down, and around.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.120
My ears jumped between the
sounds of birds setting

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.210
in for the night, bugs
waking up, water lapping

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.190
at the canal walls, a
far-off barrel organ,

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.750
and our chains' rhythmic
straining against gears.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.390
We picked up Rudy from his home.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:57.030
He was almost as fast as
Werner, and twice as graceful.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.640
His long legs and arms
moved like a dancer's.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.950
We took over a street, and rode
side by side, all four of us.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.490
Evening lights slowly
turned on here and there,

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.380
reflections shining up from
the water in shimmering light.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.430
We came upon a small park
in the middle of a square

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:22.480
with winding brick paths around
small shrubs and statues.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.150
Rudy pedaled up, wound
between the blackened shrubs,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.860
and disappeared.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.910
Werner came to a halt at the
entrance, and held up his hand

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.760
for Vera and me to stop.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.570
We backpedaled on the brakes,
both of us sliding into the back

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.630
of his bike with a crack.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.860
Tacked up on a tree was a sign,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.730
[foreign language],
Jews forbidden.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:55.640
In the lower-right corner
was an official police seal.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.120
'Rudy, come back!'

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.830
Werner yelled, fear
edging into his voice.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.060
'Rudy!' I called.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.650
I looked at the deserted
streets, and whispered

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.740
to the night to let him
come back before anyone saw.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.610
He flew back around the corner
just then, almost knocking

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.020
into us, his eyes wide,
and filled with light.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.340
Werner pointed to the sign.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.450
Rudy stopped smiling.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.150
All of our bikes,
like eager steeds,

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.850
strained to go on,
but we turned back.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:34.640
Our horses had turned
into just bicycles."

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg Butter:
So I am reading a conversation

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.850
between my brother, Werner,
two years older than I was

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.380
at that time, and he had a job

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.110
in Camp Westerbork
as a messenger.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.600
And he knew a lot
more than I did

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:12.280
about what was going
on in the camp.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.850
"Werner had been looking for my
friend Rudy, a boy from my class

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.410
that I had a crush on.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:27.830
He and his family had been
deported before our turn came,

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:34.120
and I was hoping to find
him again in Westerbork.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.510
Westerbork was a camp
that was divided in half

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:44.530
by a railway track, and
every Saturday afternoon,

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:49.630
the long cattle car
train arrived.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:54.220
It stood there all of
Saturday, all of Sunday,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.970
and all of Monday,
and it was this long,

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.050
long car with empty
-- empty car --

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:07.370
empty railroad car,
empty and hungry.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:12.000
No matter where I went during
those days, whether I went

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.060
to dinner, whether I went to
see friends in other barracks,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.890
or I went to hang up
laundry on the laundry lines,

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:25.180
I couldn't avoid
this ominous train.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:32.760
Now, that evening, at dinner,
Werner was less talkative

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.610
than usual about what
he had been hearing,

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.930
what was going on in the camp.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.490
His excitement about
his job had faded,

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.860
and his lips were tightened.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.060
And he was biting his nails.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.360
'What is it?'

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:59.560
I asked him, as we sat on
the steps of our barracks.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.220
'Nothing,' he replied.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.750
'Leave me alone.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.490
Don't hassle me about
your Rudy.'

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.820
'He's not my Rudy,' I said.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.720
Werner didn't make a
comeback, nor did he tease me

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.100
about hassling him as
much as I usually did.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:24.610
'Rini,' he said,
picking at his cuticles,

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.170
'you know this is a
transit camp, right?

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:34.160
It is a camp that sends
people to other places.'

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.780
'Yeah. Tell me something
new,' I said.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.230
'You know,' he said, 'I have
been looking for Rudy high

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:48.960
and low, as you have, but his
family boarded the train a few

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.500
weeks before we arrived here.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.800
He's gone.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.890
I found out yesterday.'

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.130
'Why didn't you tell
me immediately?'

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.480
I said. He paused.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.940
Then he said, 'Because I
heard other things as well,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:09.620
and I wanted to check them out
and make sure that they're true.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:15.050
Rudy left for that
camp some time ago.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.500
The camp he left
for is Auschwitz.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.990
Auschwitz is worse
than this camp.'

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.270
So I said to him, 'How could
it be worse than this camp?

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.180
We've been taken
away from our home.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.000
Who knows who has all the
stuff that we left behind?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.620
We're bored here, and
doing stupid work.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.560
All the food we brought
with us is gone,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.820
and the camp only has
gross soup and stale bread.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.160
And we have to use
bathrooms without doors.'

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.480
I felt panic rising
in my throat.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.870
'Rini, you don't
understand,' he said.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.170
'I understand.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.580
I understand that you
didn't tell me about Rudy

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.400
when you found out
that he had left.'

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.790
'They don't just bore
you, or even starve you

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.440
at Auschwitz,' said Werner.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.980
'They kill you.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.900
I had to hear it a lot of
times before I believed it.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.770
They kill people at
camps like Auschwitz.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.030
They kill Jews like
us, and like Rudy.'

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:38.490
His voice rose, and he
choked on his last words."

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.770
&gt;&gt; John Bidwell: The family
had been in Westerbork

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.440
for about 10 months before
they were finally deported

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.440
to Bergen-Belsen, and this
scene is late spring 1944.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.460
They've been in Bergen-Belsen
for about four months,

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.020
and there's been an influx
of prisoners at that time.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.210
The Nazis were just beginning
to really lose the war,

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.100
and rather than liberate
prisoners,

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.610
they would be sending
them to other camps.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.490
Many of them ended up
going to Bergen-Belsen.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.800
Bergen-Belsen, at this
point, was swelling in size

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.490
with the number of prisoners,

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.160
and there were harsher
conditions.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.390
It was more cramped,
and there was less food.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.340
And that's where we
pick up at this scene.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:32.080
"At first, hunger was a pesky
neighbor, sometimes noisy

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.910
at night, interrupting sleep.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.060
Then, it was a nagging
visitor who came rapping

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.090
on the door more and more.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.400
Finally, it had the keys.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.810
Hunger marched in, and
hunger settled down.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.720
As the spring months dragged
on, and the cold raced

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.970
across the camp through every
crevice, under every blanket,

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.190
hunger went from a
distant stranger,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:04.410
to an annoying acquaintance,
to a constant companion.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:09.280
There was no place to
escape, no room to retire to.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:15.140
It became an ever-present
day-after-day rumbling.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.250
As mothers, fathers, and
relatives started returning

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.160
from work in the
late afternoons,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.670
I left my job watching kids
to get our daily rations.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:29.340
I waited in the long line with
other kids and some adults.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.810
With food becoming
increasingly scarce,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.680
adults started pushing kids
out of the way to get ahead.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.550
I watched carefully.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:42.280
It always paid to be
attentive when it came to food.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.700
If needed, I would be more
commanding, and ask the servers

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.360
for more vegetables,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.800
and I always measured the
size of the hunk of bread.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.750
Again, I would protest
if needed.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.230
I wasn't loud, but I was quick.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.670
Then I returned to our
bunks, and I waited.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:07.150
I put my -- I sat on my bunk,
arms around our pail of food,

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.200
pulling what warmth I could,
and inhaling the smell.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.580
Hunger sat beside me, whispering
in my ear, 'Eat it all.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.050
It would be so easy.'

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.740
It wasn't much, and for the
first time in almost a year,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.520
I would be able to sleep
with a full stomach.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.610
I slid my finger around the
inside edge of the pail,

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.890
feeling the moisture
build to drops.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.930
When nobody was looking, I put
a shaking finger to my tongue.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:43.120
My senses bounced between
the all-absorbing taste,

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.990
and listening for my family's
approaching footfalls,

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:53.400
my mother's delicate gait and
my father's longer shuffle.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.060
The barracks darkened
with the evening.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.100
The food cooled.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.280
Every minutes, I
collected drops of soup,

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.900
telling myself it
would've evaporated anyhow.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.360
I couldn't wait anymore.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.980
With careful measure,
I took my portion

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.740
of food, and I devoured it.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.050
But instead of feeling better,
I found myself more ravenous.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:20.010
I dipped my spoon with my
shaking hand into the pail,

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.880
and a few more times,
and I picked off

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.320
and ate the uneven bread ends.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.610
As the food hit my lips,
my body wanted to slurp

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:31.280
down every last drop, and
chew down every last crumb.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.950
I kept thinking I
heard my family,

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.290
only to realize I was wrong.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.810
Then there was no mistake.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.330
I was terrified that
they would say something

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.360
about the portions, or read my
guilt, but I was also relieved

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.210
that I was free of
further temptation.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.400
They said nothing.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.850
Poppy sat.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.620
My father took off
his worn-out shoes,

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.850
lay down, and closed his eyes.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.040
I looked over at my
mother, who stayed upright,

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.990
but leaned her head against
the frame of the bunk.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.130
'Okay, Rini, do you have
anything hearty for us?'

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.190
My father asked after
a few minutes.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:12.110
In the past, he might've added
something like he was starving.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.430
'Of course,' I said,
and took the brown pot

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.280
from under my blanket.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.750
'Have you seen your brother?'

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.440
My mother asked.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.660
I shook my head.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.490
She took a deep breath,
looking around.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.800
Poppy, my father,
moved to her side,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.400
resting his hand
on her bony leg.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.660
They both looked
at me and nodded.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.220
They refused to eat until I did.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.880
'I -- I already had
mine,' I said.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.930
'Do you need more?'

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.690
Poppy asked.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.300
'No, I'm fine.'

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.690
'Take more, Rini,'
my mother said.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.120
'I'm not hungry.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.750
I'm fine. My belly doesn't
feel well today,' I lied,

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.880
and then seeing their
concern, added, 'but it's not

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.470
that bad -- my belly, I mean.'

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.180
And so they passed the
brown pot and the bread,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.940
saving more than
Werner's share for him."

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.490
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg Butter:
Well, now to some themes

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.620
and closing of our presentation.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.490
I want to first talk
about something positive,

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:23.450
and that refers to the
opportunities we had

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:31.680
when we immigrated to the
United States in 1945 and 1946.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.680
My brother -- my mother, my
brother, and I were separated,

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.650
and so we -- I came first.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:44.820
I was -- I spent one year in
a refugee camp in Algiers,

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:52.180
in Phillipville, and I was
not allowed to be reunited

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.540
with my mother and brother,
who were in Switzerland.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.610
They had been hospitalized
immediately

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:02.090
when we arrived there,
after a prisoner exchange

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.620
that took place between
people from Bergen-Belsen

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:11.650
who had passports of South
and Central American countries

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.230
and German citizens who were

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.230
in internment camps
in the United States.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.390
So when we arrived here as
a family, we were penniless,

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:26.260
because the Nazis had taken
everything away that we had.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.850
We were homeless, naturally.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.580
We didn't have a home,
and we were stateless.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.940
And I think this is a feature
that is not often mentioned,

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.870
and not well understood.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:44.400
But in 1935, Hitler deprived
all German Jews of citizenship,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.050
and that's what statelessness
means, that it is a person

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.680
who doesn't have
citizenship in any country,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.900
and therefore has no right to
be admitted to any country.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.260
So on the other hand,
every country can refuse

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.090
to admit people who
are stateless.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.940
And I recently read that
there are 20 million stateless

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.420
refugees in the world today.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.720
What's going to happen to them?

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.300
Despite the fact -- well, I
would just say that when I came

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.610
to America, one of the
first actions I took is

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.880
to apply for citizenship.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.620
And at that time,
it took five years.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.160
First you had to apply for first
papers, and two years later,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.730
you applied for second papers.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.520
Then, usually, the fifth year,
you would get citizenship,

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.160
and I don't remember any
immigrants that I knew

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.170
who were denied citizenship
in this country.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:49.470
So from 1935 to 1950,
I was stateless,

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.200
and I have great sympathy

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.890
for all those 20 million
stateless people in this world.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.260
We don't know what's
going to happen to them.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.520
Now, we arrived here penniless.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.060
My mother had never
worked before.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.670
My brother and I had
not had any education

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.910
for three and a half years.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.700
I was very eager to go to
school, finished high school

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.170
in two and a half years, and
then went to a city college

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:21.810
in New York City which
was tuition-free.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:26.760
It was an excellent eduction
that I received there,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.260
and who can imagine sending
kids to college these days

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.750
that are free of tuition?

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.490
And I'm forever grateful
for that.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:41.530
From -- after my graduation
from Queens College,

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:47.850
I attended Duke University with
scholarships and assistantships,

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.540
and that's how I received
my Ph.D. in economics.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.370
The job market then
was favorable.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.610
Even my mother, who had
never worked before,

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.070
was able to find a --

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.620
not skilled jobs,
but unskilled jobs.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.560
And so, the three of us
worked to pay the bills,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.390
and that was possible
in those days.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.420
I wish this were possible

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:19.610
for immigrants coming
to our country today.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.440
Unfortunately, we see the echoes

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.350
of actions taken
during the Holocaust

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.830
in the -- at the present time.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.850
We see it all over the world,

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:34.590
and we also see it
in our own country.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.540
Ethnic cleansing,
white supremacy,

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:45.450
deportation of certain groups,
dehumanization, the deprivation

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:50.020
of basic human rights --
all of that, we see today.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.360
It's different groups now,

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.000
because we saw a horrendous
anti-Semitic incident recently

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.020
in Pittsburgh, a murderous
incident at a synagogue.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.900
But Jews don't compose
the only group

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:11.430
that is targeted at
the present time.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.840
People from Africa,
African-Americans, Muslims,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:24.430
people from Latin America -- all
are mistreated in various ways,

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:30.560
and it is very painful to see
that our democratic values --

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.770
some of them, anyway --
appear to be eroding.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.940
So my wish for the
future would be

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.640
that all the targeted
groups would come together,

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:49.560
form an alliance, and revive
the basic traditions --

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:55.120
American traditions and values,
such as liberty, freedom,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.690
and equal opportunity for all.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:02.360
And I'd like to quote one
of my favorite heroes,

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:08.820
Martin Luther King, who
said, "The arc of moral --

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:16.080
the arc of the moral
universe is long,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.880
but it bends towards justice."

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:25.230
And it is my belief that justice
is everybody's responsibility.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.030
Thank you.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:39.230
[ Applause ]

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.790
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Have some time
from questions and answers.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.360
Is there anyone that
has a question?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.940
Yes?

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.580
&gt;&gt; Microphone -- come up here?

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.800
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: No, he's
coming with the microphone.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.100
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.980
Irene, I know in my
family, we had people

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.820
who immigrated earlier, and
helped bring other people in.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:07.040
Did you -- you know, from
Algeria, did you have relatives

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.430
in Queens, or in New York
or whatever that helped you?

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg
Butter: Yes, that's correct.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:17.840
At that time, one
needed affidavits.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.650
You couldn't get a visa
without affidavits,

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:25.460
and those were statements -- we
had family that they promised

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.930
that they would take care of you
if you were not self-sufficient.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.620
They had to prove that
they had a bank account,

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.960
and that they had savings.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.290
They would be able to do
that, and so our family here

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.330
in the United States -- in New
York provided these affidavits.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.190
It still took a long time.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.850
It took one year before --

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.990
almost one year before I was
able to get a visa in Algiers,

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.940
and it took even longer
for my mother and brother,

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.560
who were still in Switzerland.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.430
And I might just mention

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:05.180
that the relatives we had had
only come to America recently.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.560
You know, they were only
a few years ahead of us,

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.120
maybe four years, and they
had also been deprived

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.550
of all their possessions.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:18.450
So for them, it was difficult to
make a living, but they managed.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.840
But they didn't have
a whole lot to spare.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.870
Nevertheless, they took us
in with great generosity.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:30.060
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:35.840
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you for
a wonderful presentation.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:43.860
I would like to ask whether in
reflecting on your experience,

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.040
you have any views about
the periodic madness

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.800
that seems to sweep humankind.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.060
There have been genocides
of many sorts in many places

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.330
as long as I've been observing,

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:02.590
and whether you have any
thoughts about humankind moving

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.290
to avoid these forms of
genocides and madness.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:11.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg Butter:
Well, that is a big question.

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.480
You know, we have
used the phrase

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.700
"never again" for
50, 60 years now.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.820
It has been repeated
numerous times,

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.210
but saying it is not
going to make it happen.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.070
And so, there needs
to be more action,

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:38.690
action of interrupting hatred,
of people who are targeted

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:44.560
by hatred to come
together and fight

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.920
for what is legal
and what is just.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.340
And I think we all
have a responsibility

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:57.920
to protect each other, and
not see another group being

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:03.240
discriminated against,
or being persecuted,

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.140
or being put in tent camps.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.200
We all need to be active,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:13.120
and I think too often we think
the problems are so large,

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.430
and each individual is so small
that we can't do anything.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.370
But that is not true.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:25.490
Every little step really helps,
and we can form alliances.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:32.160
And I wish that people in our
Congress would object more

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:37.170
to the things that are not
just, and that do not correspond

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:42.100
to American traditions,
and that are illegal.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.850
There's too much silence.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.750
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi:
Another question?

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.840
Yes?

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.150
I am immigrated twice, so I
know where you're coming from.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:36:00.560
I escaped from Egypt, then I
left France and came to America.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:05.590
And I salute the flag every
day, which is in my living room.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:06.890
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi:
And your question?

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.540
&gt;&gt; And my question is,
what is the seminal event

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:15.380
that propelled you
to write the book?

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg
Butter: Well,

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.980
thank you for that question.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.360
There are several, but I will
mention that, first of all,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.260
there were four decades
of silence.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.370
And my family and myself never
talked about the Holocaust,

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.900
but then there was an awakening.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:39.310
And one person responsible for
the awakening is Elie Wiesel,

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:43.260
who talked a lot to
Holocaust survivors,

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.200
and assigned the
responsibility to witness,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.870
to provide testimony,
and to tell the stories.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:56.580
And I have a quote in my book I
heard him say once to survivors.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.430
"If you were in the camps,
if you smelled the air,

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:04.530
if you heard the
silence of the dead,

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.580
then you must be a witness.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.550
You must provide
testimony, for if you don't,

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.730
the dead will die twice."

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:18.480
And that made a very
deep impression on me,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.420
and I started talking.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:24.210
Another incident was, my
daughter, when she was

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.980
in middle school -- she took
a course in public speaking,

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.580
and at the end of the course,

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.810
she had to do a one-hour
speech to the class.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:37.260
And she chose the following
topic, "Anti-Semitism,

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.990
Hitler's Conquest of Europe,
and the Concentration Camps."

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:45.790
And she came home,
and she said, "Mom,

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.680
will you be my visual aid?"

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.990
[Laughter] And even though
I was petrified to do that,

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:56.150
because I had been
silent for four decades,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.290
I couldn't turn her down.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.020
So I have been speaking
in schools for more

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:06.510
than 35 years now, and
it's enriched my life,

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.220
because whenever I talk in
a school, I ask the teachers

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.240
to have the students send
something to me afterward --

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.870
a question, a thought, how
it changed their thinking,

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.120
or just a picture,
whatever it is.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.650
I have an enormous
archive of gifts,

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.040
of really beautiful gifts,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.220
and I know that someday I
won't be able to go to schools

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.490
and speak to them, speak
to the students anymore.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.740
So that is also a reason
for writing the book.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.870
At least, then, the
book will be available.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.240
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Yes?

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Butter, thank you so
much for being here today,

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:56.560
and thank you for your words.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.780
My name is Nathan, and
I'm a college student here

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.200
in the Washington, D.C. area.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:09.860
For several years -- for several
years -- for several years,

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.400
since I was in elementary
school,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.070
I've been deeply interested
in learning about memories

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.830
and experiences from
the Holocaust.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.920
So it has been essentially
a lifelong interest for me.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.630
Professionally, I'm seriously
considering working in a --

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.960
working in Holocaust
education, and my question is,

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.060
what do you think is
particularly important

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.820
for young people such as myself
to know and to understand?

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg
Butter: Very good question.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:47.220
You know, I tell students
that during the Holocaust,

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:53.510
there were the perpetrators,
and then there were the victims.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:56.250
But what about the bystanders?

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.760
So many people may not
have agreed with Nazism,

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:08.090
and with whatever happened to
the Jews, but what did they do?

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:12.970
Would Hitler have been
able to be so successful,

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:17.460
and kill six million Jews
and six million other people,

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:24.300
if people hadn't been passive,
and hadn't objected, opposed,

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.630
interrupted, demonstrated,
and all those things?

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.470
I know there were
rules against it.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:36.540
I know there was risk in
objecting the Nazi regime,

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.670
but still, we have to be active.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.750
We have to be vigilant, and so,

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:47.660
one of the documentaries I
think that's here is called

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.450
"Never A Bystander."

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:55.210
And that is the concept
I try to submit --

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.440
transmit to the students.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:03.150
&gt;&gt; I'm Tony Fowler with the
U.S. Department of Education.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.240
I'm so grateful to
be here today.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.310
I wanted to ask you, from
your experience with --

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:13.260
in academia, but also -- you
just spoke about speaking

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.230
to students across the country.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:19.780
What hope do you draw
from your experiences

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.610
with younger generations today?

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.960
Some of us see reports all the
time coming across our desk,

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.940
and it doesn't look
like there's any hope.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.280
But I'd love to hear your
perspective on the hope

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.930
that you see in the upcoming
generations in the United States

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.230
and elsewhere, where
you have had experience.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg Butter:
Thank you for that question.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.550
Well, that's what
I'm talking about.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.270
The letters and the
poems, the verses

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:51.090
and the drawings I receive
from students are amazing,

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:55.590
and actually, I wanted to write
a book that would include all

00:41:55.590 --> 00:42:00.320
of these beautiful gifts,
because they are so hopeful.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:05.060
I mean, students will tell
me, "It is the responsibility

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:10.820
of my generation to eliminate
genocide from this planet."

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:17.070
Or they will say, "I'm no
longer going to be a bystander.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:19.460
I want to help poor people,

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:24.070
and I want to interrupt
bullying on the playground."

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.450
Now, that's another one

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:30.680
where often students watch
another child being bullied,

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.220
and I recommend that they don't
do that, that they intervene.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.780
They could be an ally to the
child that's being bullied.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.470
They can confront the bullier.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:47.080
They can ask for help, and
if they're the first one,

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.670
then maybe there'd
be a following,

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:52.220
and many people will
object to the bullying.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:58.850
And there's so many letters I
have that are so touching, of --

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:03.220
some students will say,
"You've changed my life.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.060
You've changed my
thinking about the world.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.490
You've changed who
I am, who I am going

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.520
to be, who I want to be."

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:18.230
So the favorite student
population

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.720
that I have are middle
school kids,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.950
because they're not
so well-informed.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:30.610
They are uninhibited
[laughter], and they come

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.470
up with beautiful statements.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:34.300
Now, I don't know
what I would find

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.930
if I could see the same
students 10 years from now,

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:41.970
but I hope that I have
had an impact on them.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.310
And they're very compassionate,
and very understanding,

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:52.870
and I think, in a way, ready --
ready to hear about that part

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:59.160
of history from someone
who experienced it.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.910
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi:
Another question?

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:03.300
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Lorrie Gilbert
[assumed spelling],

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.050
and the daughter of a survivor.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:12.430
And my mom was friends and
camp companions with Irene.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:18.830
Irene, I've always wondered
how HIAS came into the role

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:23.520
when you were immigrating to
the U.S., H-I-A-S, and what role

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.390
that played, and how the group
helped you, and helped my mom

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:32.040
and her family when
they came to the U.S.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.560
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg
Butter: Well, I don't have

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.650
such a clear memory, but I know
that HIAS was the organization,

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:42.710
sort of the middle
person between the people

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:46.610
who were sponsoring
immigrants and the immigrants,

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.130
or the displaced
persons where they were.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.050
And I think they played a role

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:56.850
in having my relatives
provide the affidavit,

00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:00.680
and then following up
so we could get visas.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:05.180
It took a long time, but I
think that they monitored this,

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:11.220
and also promoted
it at every step.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.710
And I don't know if it
would've been possible

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:17.120
without an organization
like HIAS.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.460
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi:
Another question?

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.990
I've got one.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:28.490
To the co-authors, I'd like
to know how much you knew

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.730
about the Holocaust
before you met Irene.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.150
Is it something you've studied?

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.600
Was it on your radar at all?

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.310
&gt;&gt; John Bidwell: There have
been a few incidents in my life

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:41.720
where I've been truly
shocked, in terms of knowledge.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.500
And I was in eighth grade when
the Holocaust TV series came on,

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.770
and we did a section on
it in social studies.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:51.030
And I was just emotionally
floored,

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.100
because I just couldn't imagine
that anybody would do this

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.200
to other people, much less
in such a methodical way.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.450
So it's something that I've been
very aware of, and very moved

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.000
about since eighth grade.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.440
So, yeah, that's my
background on this.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.850
&gt;&gt; Kris Holloway: I was
aware more from a health

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:14.960
and human rights standpoint,
but not the details.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.880
So I think it was
getting into the details,

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:23.090
and understanding the
system, and how many people,

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.380
and its place in
history, and the political

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.030
and social atmosphere of the
time that I learned a lot about.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:33.020
&gt;&gt; John Bidwell: The only
other thing I would add is

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.060
that I've had quite a few
family serve in the military.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.360
I had two uncles.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.510
One was in Normandy, and
the other was in Okinawa.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.710
And both were deeply
influenced by their time

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:45.490
in the Pacific theater
and in Europe.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.790
And when they came back,

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:49.880
a big topic in my family
was the hardship of war,

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.600
how it was a dedication,
something you really --

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.580
it was important to serve,
but at the same time,

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.320
there was a huge price
that needed to be paid.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.130
And I -- that was something
that also made me very aware

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.920
and very acutely
aware of the need

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.570
to remember what
happened during this --

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:07.320
especially the Second World War.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.000
So getting to know Irene
has been a true honor,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.950
and to help tell her story is
something that has been one

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:17.480
of the most meaningful and
moving things of my life.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.220
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi:
Any other questions?

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.300
&gt;&gt; I have one last question.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.600
My father --

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.940
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Wait
for the mike [laughter].

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:33.560
Just one second.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.350
&gt;&gt; -- so my father, who
was a World War II veteran,

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:47.790
who's passed, was increasingly
infuriated by the deniers,

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.950
the people who have
the audacity to claim

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:54.030
that the Holocaust
didn't take place.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.110
So my question is,
what do you do,

00:47:57.110 --> 00:48:00.050
or how do you maintain
your composure when

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:05.930
and if you encounter
what I apparently see

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.360
as an increasing
number of these people

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.070
who choose to rewrite history?

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:14.250
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg Butter:
That's a good question, too.

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:18.590
I had an incident not long
ago, when I was speaking

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.190
at public library in Ann Arbor,

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.820
and a Holocaust denier
entered the room,

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.970
and was in the back row.

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:31.180
And he started talking --
all of this is nonsense,

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.380
and a few other sentences.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:39.090
And then he said, "Even Elie
Wiesel admits there were no gas

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:41.420
chambers in Auschwitz."

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.770
So people were getting
pretty upset,

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:50.060
and I think the library staff
was about to call the police.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.420
But, you know, I said to him
that -- I said, "You are a liar,

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.580
and you'd better
not repeat this."

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.120
And then he left [laughter].

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.760
&gt;&gt; Kris Holloway:
Call it like it was.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.930
Got it. Call it like it is.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.230
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi:
I have just one --

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:09.840
if there are no other questions,
I have just one more little one.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.350
Could you speak about
your encounter --

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.530
could you please speak about
your encounter with Anne Frank?

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.820
I found that particularly
moving,

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.920
what happened afterwards.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.580
Could you say a few
words about that?

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Irene Hasenberg Butter:
Well, the Frank family had sort

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:27.770
of a very similar background.

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.420
They came from Frankfurt.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.160
They immigrated to
The Netherlands.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.820
The Franks and my family
lived in the same neighborhood

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.940
in Amsterdam, but Anne was
about two years older than I,

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.100
and we didn't go
to the same school.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:46.500
And I didn't know her
well, but I had a friend

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.170
who was in Anne's class.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:50.300
And she was a neighbor
and a friend,

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.130
and she often told me
stories about Anne.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:55.920
And there were many
stories about her,

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.650
because she was naughty
[laughter].

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:05.870
And so, then our paths
crossed in Bergen-Belsen,

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:10.440
because as some of you probably
know, the family went to hiding.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.640
They were betrayed,
sent to Auschwitz.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.120
The mother did not survive.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:22.210
The -- Anne and Margot
were sent to Bergen-Belsen

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.960
when the Russians
entered Poland,

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.540
and Auschwitz was closed up.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:33.470
The father was the only one who
survived of the Frank family,

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:38.330
and so I was in the same
barrack in Bergen-Belsen

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:40.610
as another friend of Anne's.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:43.420
And one night, she
went to the fence --

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:47.680
we were separated from the women
from Auschwitz by barbed wire,

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.010
and we weren't allowed
to go near there.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:52.280
But it was dark, and she went.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.940
And she heard some
people speak Dutch,

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.240
and so she inquired whether
Anne Frank was there.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.170
And they said yes,
and they fetched her,

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.420
and brought her to the fence.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.230
And Hanna Lee [assumed spelling]
said she was very thin,

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:11.170
and she said, "Can I
do anything for you?"

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:13.370
And she said, "If you
could get me some clothes,"

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.410
because Anne didn't
have any clothes.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:19.060
She just had a gray
blanket wrapped around her.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:23.120
And Hanna Lee said, "Yes,
I'll come back tomorrow,

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.900
same time, same place."

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.260
And then she came to the
barrack and told me about it,

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.620
and together, we gathered
a bundle of clothing,

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:36.650
because they had never taken
our clothes away from us.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:41.620
Now, of course, after almost two
years in camps, they were rags,

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:47.510
but we had more than we needed
-- more rags than we needed.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:51.540
So we made a bundle, and
so Hanna Lee and I went

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.810
to the fence the next evening.

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:59.610
And Anne came, and we threw
the bundle over the fence.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:04.620
And another woman came, picked
it up, and ran off with it.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:09.500
So that was the last --
then a few days after that,

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.780
my family was included
in a prisoner exchange,

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.640
so we left Bergen-Belsen.

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:21.560
And many years later, I met
with Hanna Lee in Jerusalem,

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.430
and she told me that she had
thrown over another bundle

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:28.840
over the fence, and that
time, Anne did get it.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:36.700
But both Anne and her sister,
Margot, had typhus eventually,

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.830
and they died in the camp.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:45.290
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi:
Any other questions?

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:47.460
Well, I want to thank
our panelists.

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:51.430
Irene, you're amazing, and
to come out with such hope,

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.840
and such determination --
you deserve a lot of credit.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.470
And thank you for
helping her record

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.000
and document her
very special history.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.050
&gt;&gt; John Bidwell: I'd just
like to add one last thing.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.150
Before you clap, which
is well-deserved,

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:08.620
if you're interested in more,
you can go to irenebutter.com,

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.430
irenebutter.com, the website,

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.360
and there's a lot more
information there.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.930
There's also teaching guides,
if any of you are teachers,

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:16.980
photographs and video.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.280
Just wanted to add that.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.580
Thank you.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.240
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Is it all
downloadable and free access?

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.000
&gt;&gt; John Bidwell: It's all free,
but feel free to pay [laughter].

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.520
It's all --

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.510
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Well,
I want to thank you.

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:40.790
