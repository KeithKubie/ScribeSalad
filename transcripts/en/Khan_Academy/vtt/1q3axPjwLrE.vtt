00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.830
- Y is equal to 3x, X is equal to 3y.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.300
"Consider the system of equations above.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.450
"How many solutions
does this system have?"

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.620
Well when I think about
solutions and systems

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.430
I always imagine each of
the equations in our system

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.320
is kind of describing a line.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.290
And if the two lines
intersect you're going

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.030
to have one solution.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.590
And if they don't intersect,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.330
you're going to have no solutions.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.960
And if they end up being the same line,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.220
so if they end up being the same line

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.360
you have an infinite number of solutions.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.150
So let's see, and so who
can immediately rule out,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.890
cause these are linear,
these are linear equations.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.060
Two solutions.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.890
The only way you're
gonna have two solutions

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.420
is if one of these lines at
least one of them curves.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.460
So if one of them did something like this,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.060
then you could have two solutions

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.330
right there and right there.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.150
But these are both linear equations,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.700
so we could rule out having two solutions.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.290
But let's just think about these up here.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.490
Well what I like to do is I like

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.270
to solve them both explicitly for Y.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.100
That's at least how I
like to visualize lines.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.060
This first one up here is already written

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.700
explicitly in terms of Y.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.210
This second one over here, let's
divide both sides by three.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.950
And we get Y is equal to x over three.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.930
So this first one is Y is equal to 3x.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.630
The second one is Y is
equal to x over three

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.870
or we could say 1/3, 1/3x.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.820
And so these lines, they
don't have the same slope.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.620
They don't have the same slope.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.380
So they're not going to be parallel

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.290
and they're not going to be the same line.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.030
So these are going to intersect.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.494
These are going to have one solution,

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:40.060
exactly one solution.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.560
And if you wanted to visualize
this on the coordinate axis

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.589
I'll do it really fast.

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:47.350
If that's our Y axis this is our X axis.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.420
X, Y.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.620
This first line right over here,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.390
this is gonna have a slope of three.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.350
So it's gonna be a pretty steep line.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.078
It's gonna look something like this.

00:01:57.078 --> 00:01:59.630
And then the second line right over here

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.520
is going to have a slope of 1/3.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.550
So it's going to look something like this.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.260
These two clearly intersect.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.430
And actually now that I look it

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.050
one way to realize that you're gonna have

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.930
at least one solution and you'll see it.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.810
I mean you even see it where they're

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.590
intersecting right over here.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.530
The solution is when X and
Y both are equal to zero.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.560
But since you wanna rule out that hey,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.620
maybe it has a infinitely
many solutions is look.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.350
Just think about what
these lines represent.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.320
This first one, very steep
line right over here.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.760
The second one, a much less deep line.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.530
But they're different lines
so they're not the same line.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.730
And they don't have the same slope,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.290
so they're not going to be parallel.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.990
So they're going to intersect
in exactly one point.
