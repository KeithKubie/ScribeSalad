00:00:14.703 --> 00:00:15.901
Let me guess,

00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.346
you've got Facebook albums full of photos.

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.532
You have photos on your computer desktop,

00:00:20.532 --> 00:00:21.706
on your mobile phone,

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:23.524
on your bedroom wall.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.227
You see photos in magazines and newspapers,

00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:27.481
on the side of buses,

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:30.372
and of course, in your family albums.

00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:33.701
We take photos for granted in a major way.

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:34.870
But, creating a picture

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.976
that looked exactly like the person or thing

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:39.941
that you were photographing wasn't always obvious.

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:44.824
In fact, in the past, it was a big mystery.

00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:46.281
How could you, in essence,

00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:48.327
take your reflection in the mirror

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:50.662
and freeze it in there?

00:00:50.662 --> 00:00:52.287
In the 9th century,

00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:54.529
the Arab scientist Alhazen

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:56.249
had come up with the idea

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.302
of using the camera obscura,

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:00.667
which was literally a dark room, or box,

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:04.767
with a single, small hole in one side that let light through.

00:01:04.782 --> 00:01:09.145
This would project the image outside into the wall inside.

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:10.107
During the Renaissance,

00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:13.233
artists like Leonardo DaVinci used this method

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:17.362
to introduce 3-D scenes onto a flat plane

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:19.113
so that they could copy things,

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:21.569
like perspective, more easily.

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.065
In 1724, Johann Heinrich Schultz discovered

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:27.913
that exposing certain silver compounds to light

00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:29.548
altered their appearance

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:32.376
and left marks wherever the light touched.

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:34.885
Essentially, Schultz found a way to record the images

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:37.304
that Alhazen was able to project,

00:01:37.304 --> 00:01:39.508
but only for a little while.

00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:43.268
Schultz's images disappeared soon after he had made them.

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:46.027
It wasn't until 1839 that people figured out

00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:48.786
how to project images onto light-sensitive surfaces

00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:51.444
that would retain the image after exposure,

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.482
and thus, photography was born.

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.316
At that point, it was mostly two inventors

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.070
who fought for the best way to make photos.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.655
One was British scientist Henry Fox Talbot,

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:04.462
whose calotype process used paper

00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:06.016
and allowed many copies to be made

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:07.806
from a single negative.

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.207
The other inventor, Louis Daguerre,

00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:12.839
was an artist and chemist in France.

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.610
He developed something called a daguerreotype,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.643
which used a silvered plate

00:02:17.643 --> 00:02:20.387
and which produced a sharper image.

00:02:20.387 --> 00:02:23.177
But the daguerreotype could only make positive images

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:26.854
so copies had to be made by taking another photo.

00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:29.805
In the end, the daguerreotype won out

00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:32.859
as the first commercially successful photographic process

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.650
mostly because the government made it freely available to the public.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.526
So now that photography was available,

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:42.495
getting a picture of yourself would be a snap, right?

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.240
Well, not exactly!

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.832
This process still required a whole dark room

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.587
at the location of the photograph,

00:02:48.587 --> 00:02:50.788
which was a big hassle.

00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:53.416
Picture the early photographers lugging

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:55.299
enormous trailers with all their equipment

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.964
wherever they wanted to take a picture.

00:02:57.964 --> 00:03:00.770
Not only that, but the early processes

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.467
had extremely long exposure times.

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:06.341
To get a good photo, you would have to stand perfectly still

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.305
for up to two minutes!

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:11.017
This led to development of inventions like

00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:12.140
the head holder,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.520
a wire frame that would hide behind you

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.550
while supporting your head.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.191
It's also why you don't see people smiling

00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:20.858
in early photographs.

00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:23.304
It's not that life was that bad,

00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:25.614
it was just hard to keep a steady grin

00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:27.124
for more than a few seconds,

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:31.232
so people opted for a straight-faced look.

00:03:31.232 --> 00:03:33.810
And then George Eastman came along.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.226
Eastman believed that everyone

00:03:35.226 --> 00:03:37.226
should have access to photography,

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:38.710
and he spent many late nights

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.101
mixing chemicals in his mother's kitchen

00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:45.097
to try to achieve a dry plate photographic process.

00:03:45.097 --> 00:03:46.968
This would allow exposed negatives

00:03:46.968 --> 00:03:48.677
to be stored and developed later

00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:50.564
at a more convenient place

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.347
instead of carting those dark rooms,

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:55.099
necessary for wet plates, around.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.479
After starting a business,

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.437
which initially made dry plates,

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:01.721
Eastman eventually discovered plastic roll film

00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:05.777
that would fit in hand-held, inexpensive cameras.

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:09.070
These cameras sold by the millions under the tag line,

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.741
"You push the button,

00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:12.575
we do the rest."

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:14.449
While Eastman was largely responsible

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.369
for making photography a universal pastime,

00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:19.916
even he could not have dreamed of the ways

00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:22.551
photography had since shaped the world.

00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:27.306
It's now estimated that over 380 billion photographs

00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:29.155
are taken each year.

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:31.793
That's more photographs each day

00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:34.965
than were taken in the first hundred years

00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:37.180
after photography was invented.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.272
Say cheese!
