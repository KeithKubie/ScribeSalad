00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.395
- [Instructor] So,
we've got a Riemann sum.

00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:04.925
We're gonna take the limit
as N approaches infinity

00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:06.157
and the goal of this video

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:08.137
is to see if we can rewrite this

00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:09.756
as a definite integral.

00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:11.176
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:14.775
and see if you can work
through it on your own.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:16.054
So, let's remind ourselves

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:20.428
how a definite integral can
relate to a Riemann sum.

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:24.345
So, if I have the definite
integral from A to B

00:00:27.287 --> 00:00:29.120
of F of X, F of X, DX,

00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:36.391
we have seen in other videos

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:38.900
this is going to be the limit

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.067
as N approaches infinity
of the sum, capital sigma,

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:47.076
going from I equals one to N

00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:49.566
and so, essentially
we're gonna sum the areas

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.720
of a bunch of rectangles

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.093
where the width of each
of those rectangles

00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:57.260
we can write as a delta X,

00:00:58.142 --> 00:01:00.916
so your width is going to be delta X

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.777
of each of those rectangles

00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:03.736
and then your height

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:06.292
is going to be the value of the function

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:08.434
evaluated some place in that delta X.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.128
If we're doing a right Riemann sum

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:12.799
we would do the right
end of that rectangle

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.412
or of that sub interval

00:01:14.412 --> 00:01:18.580
and so, we would start
at our lower bound A

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.747
and we would add as many delta
Xs as our index specifies.

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:25.198
So, if I is equal to one,

00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:26.942
we add one delta X,

00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:28.962
so we would be at the right
of the first rectangle.

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.356
If I is equal two, we add two delta Xs.

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:34.630
So, this is going to be delta X

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.963
times our index.

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:38.623
So, this is the general form

00:01:38.623 --> 00:01:40.649
that we have seen before

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.383
and so, one possibility, you
could even do a little bit

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:44.373
of pattern matching right here,

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:47.406
our function looks like
the natural log function,

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.129
so that looks like our func F of X,

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:51.952
it's the natural log function,

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:53.330
so I could write that,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.830
so F of X looks like the natural log of X.

00:01:58.463 --> 00:02:00.079
What else do we see?

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.496
Well, A, that looks like two.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:05.575
A is equal to two.

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:08.110
What would our delta X be?

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.572
Well, you can see this right over here,

00:02:10.572 --> 00:02:12.368
this thing that we're multiplying

00:02:12.368 --> 00:02:14.572
that just is divided by N

00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:17.191
and it's not multiplying by an I,

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.582
this looks like our delta X

00:02:19.582 --> 00:02:22.798
and this right over here
looks like delta X times I.

00:02:22.798 --> 00:02:26.965
So, it looks like our delta
X is equal to five over N.

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.816
So, what can we tell so far?

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.469
Well, we could say that,
okay, this thing up here,

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.660
up the original thing
is going to be equal to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.109
the definite integral,

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.089
we know our lower bound is going from two

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.148
to we haven't figured
out our upper bound yet,

00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:45.077
we haven't figured out our B yet

00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:48.638
but our function is the natural log

00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:52.138
of X and then I will just write a DX here.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.199
So, in order to complete writing

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.205
this definite integral

00:02:56.205 --> 00:02:58.887
I need to be able to write the upper bound

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.553
and the way to figure out the upper bound

00:03:00.553 --> 00:03:03.189
is by looking at our delta X

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.943
because the way that we
would figure out a delta X

00:03:05.943 --> 00:03:08.481
for this Riemann sum here,

00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:12.178
we would say that delta X
is equal to the difference

00:03:12.178 --> 00:03:15.304
between our bounds divided
by how many sections

00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:17.614
we want to divide it in, divided by N.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.031
So, it's equals to B minus A,

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:23.891
B minus A over N, over N

00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:31.102
and so, you can pattern match here.

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:34.391
If this is delta X is
equal to B minus A over N.

00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.520
Let me write this down.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.437
So, this is going to be equal to B,

00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:41.614
B minus our A which is two,

00:03:43.137 --> 00:03:44.720
all of that over N,

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:47.012
so B minus two

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.523
is equal to five

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:55.754
which would make B equal to seven.

00:03:55.754 --> 00:03:57.861
B is equal to seven.

00:03:57.861 --> 00:03:58.699
So, there you have it.

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.449
We have our original
limit, our Riemann limit

00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:05.551
or our limit of our Riemann sum

00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:08.654
being rewritten as a definite integral.

00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:09.623
And once again, I want to emphasize

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:11.205
why this makes sense.

00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:13.182
If we wanted to draw this

00:04:13.182 --> 00:04:14.582
it would look something like this,

00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:19.356
I'm gonna try to hand draw
the natural log function,

00:04:19.356 --> 00:04:21.689
it looks something like this

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:30.258
and this right over here would be one

00:04:30.258 --> 00:04:33.211
and so, let's say this is two

00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:35.664
and so going from two to seven,

00:04:35.664 --> 00:04:37.664
this isn't exactly right

00:04:38.582 --> 00:04:42.932
and so, our definite integral
is concerned with the area

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:46.571
under the curve from two until seven

00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.154
and so, this Riemann sum you can view

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:51.505
as an approximation when N
isn't approaching infinity

00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:52.538
but what you're saying is look,

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:55.085
when I is equal to one,

00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:59.054
your first one is going to
be of width five over N,

00:04:59.054 --> 00:05:01.573
so this is essentially
saying our difference

00:05:01.573 --> 00:05:02.654
between two and seven,

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:04.273
we're taking that distance five,

00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:06.319
dividing it into N rectangles,

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:11.104
and so, this first one is
going to have a width of five

00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:14.172
over N and then what's
the height gonna be?

00:05:14.172 --> 00:05:16.270
Well, it's a right Riemann sum,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.966
so we're using the value of
the function right over there,

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:22.298
write it two plus five over N.

00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:24.638
So, this value right over here.

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:26.788
This is the natural log,

00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:30.121
the natural log of two plus five over N,

00:05:32.158 --> 00:05:33.996
and since this is the first rectangle

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:35.746
times one, times one.

00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:38.564
Now we could keep going.

00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:40.310
This one right over here

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.320
the width is the same, five over N

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.218
but what's the height?

00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:47.988
Well, the height here,
this height right over here

00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:49.561
is going to be the natural log

00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:53.311
of two plus five over
N times two, times two.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.650
This is for I is equal to two.

00:05:58.484 --> 00:06:00.800
This is I is equal to one.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.725
And so, hopefully you are
seeing that this makes sense.

00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:04.879
The area of this first rectangle

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.866
is going to be natural log of two

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.038
plus five over N times one

00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:10.455
times five over N

00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:13.555
and the second one over here,

00:06:13.555 --> 00:06:17.305
natural log of two plus
five over N times two

00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:20.322
times five over N

00:06:21.498 --> 00:06:23.414
and so, this is calculating the sum

00:06:23.414 --> 00:06:25.384
of the areas of these rectangles

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:28.263
but then it's taking the
limit as N approaches infinity

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.046
so we get better and better approximations

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:33.129
going all the way to the exact area.
