00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.160
JORDAN: Well, we're
gonna get started.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.280
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.172
Really appreciate it.

00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:20.787
I don't know about the majority
of you, but raise your hands

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:25.380
if you have investment property.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.615
Raise your hands if you don't
have investment property.

00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:30.030
All right.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.530
OK.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.571
So about a year ago,
I decided I wanted

00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:35.490
to get involved in
investment property,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.810
but the only thing that
I could find online

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.913
were a lot of
salesmen websites that

00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:46.364
were trying to sell me a product
or go to Donald Trump's school

00:00:46.364 --> 00:00:49.660
for $40,000, which is, in
fact, money I don't have.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.850
So I went online and
checked Wikipedia,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.502
looked for numerous websites to
educate myself on real estate,

00:00:56.502 --> 00:00:59.820
and I eventually came
across BiggerPockets.com.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.950
And by using the website,
what was amazing is

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.120
they have a community based
upon real estate investment

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.140
with investors who come from
all different walks of life,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.550
from people who are full-time
real estate investors to people

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.447
who real estate as a hobby.

00:01:16.447 --> 00:01:19.310
I do real estate
investment as a hobby.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.045
So by using that website, I
was able to educate myself

00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:25.810
and eventually find that
first investment property.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.040
So we're lucky to
have Josh Dorkin, who

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.515
is the CEO of BiggerPockets.

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:36.160
And we also have Brandon Turner,
who is the VP of marketing.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.371
They're going to come
down here and tell

00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.870
you guys about real estate and
how you guys can get involved

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.190
in it while working
a full-time job.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.758
So let's hear it for
Brandon and Josh.

00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:49.174
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:51.226
JOSH: Thank you, Jordan.

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:54.890
Another BiggerPockets
success story, right there.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.840
All right, so as Jordan
introduced, my name is Josh.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.352
I am the founder
BiggerPockets.com.

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:03.890
And really quickly, as
Jordan was talking about,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.580
he was out there
looking for information,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.680
and he kept coming across
these kind of shady characters

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.640
who dominated the space.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.140
So when I started almost 10
years ago as a real estate

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.476
investor, I was dealing
with the exact same thing.

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:21.100
I'm a New Yorker,
and as I like to say,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.700
my BS-o-meter is
pretty finely attuned.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.350
And when I came across these
guys I said, this is crazy.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.970
There's got to be another
way to get information.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.280
And so I set out to kind
of democratize real estate

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.120
investing information,
because I was in need of it,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.340
and I realized that other
people would be as well.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.120
So that is the birth
of BiggerPockets.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.620
But we're not here to teach you
to be real estate investors.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.828
You're not going to learn
how to become a real estate

00:02:48.828 --> 00:02:49.660
investor today.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.451
You're not going to go
out tomorrow and get

00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:53.190
rich from anything that we say.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.600
But hopefully we give you
guys some fundamentals,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.660
some basics, that
will help you maybe

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.640
get a better understanding
of what's out there,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.010
and hopefully will point you
to some tools and possibilities

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.770
that will get you on your way.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.630
So that's me.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.880
And next to me is
the big guy, clearly.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.180
He's quite large.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.979
And this is Brandon Turner.

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.020
BRANDON: Hello, everyone.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.830
Yeah my name is
Brandon, as he said,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.640
and Jordan said, and I just
want to say again, thank you,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.000
Jordan, for having us out here.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.840
So I started in real estate
investing at 21 years old.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.140
I'm 28 right now.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.160
Bought my first property at 21.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.660
I live in an area that's a lot
cheaper than you guys live in

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.370
up here.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.447
So I was able to buy
probably more properties

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:34.780
faster than a lot of people can.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.090
So by the time I was 25, I was
able to quit my job and retire,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.450
so to speak, as much
as you can retire

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.100
when you own a lot
of rental property.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.683
I quickly figured
out that that wasn't

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.730
very fun to be "retired."

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.702
So I ended up starting a blog,
helping out Josh Dorkin here,

00:03:51.702 --> 00:03:52.910
and ended up coming on board.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.410
So that's how I got here.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.764
I started real estate
investing in a similar way,

00:03:56.764 --> 00:03:58.180
as I didn't know
what I was doing.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.430
I wanted to be in real estate.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.610
I wanted to get involved.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.910
I called up my dad and
I said, "All right, Dad!

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.240
I know what I'm gonna
do for a living now!

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.781
I'm gonna be a real
estate investor!"

00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:07.586
And he said, "You're an idiot."

00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:08.960
Essentially was
the word he said.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.040
He said you're
gonna go homeless,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.520
you're gonna go
broke, your tenants

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.340
are not going to pay rent, and
you're gonna lose everything."

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.170
So I'm like crap,
like, that's, what's

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.940
going to happen to my life.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.279
You're right.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.470
All right.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.740
Well, I'll go back
to law school,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.259
or go work at
Google or something.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.020
So I decided instead--
I went online

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.630
and I typed in "what to do
when tenants don't pay rent."

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.210
And what I discovered was, first
of all, BiggerPockets that's

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.670
how I first found them, and
what I discovered was-- they

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.320
were were a community of people.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.100
There's real estate
investors out there

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.940
who like to share
what they know.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.730
And that's exactly
what we're about today.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.200
We want to share what we've
learned, mistakes we've made,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.450
and what we've done right,
kind of help each other out

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.200
so you don't have to
pay money to do that.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.886
So with that, why don't we get
started talking about the seven

00:04:48.886 --> 00:04:50.260
steps to get
started in investing

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.750
real estate-- with
jokes, hopefully.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.290
So feel free-- we want to
have a good time doing this,

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.271
so pretend to laugh--
even if we're not funny.

00:04:59.271 --> 00:04:59.770
See?

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.530
All right.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.310
All right, first of all,
before we get into it,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.799
let's talk about why
real estate investing.

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:06.340
I'm going to start out just by
talking about diversification.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.125
It's a big word.

00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.750
Basically it means we don't want
all of our eggs in one basket.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.350
A lot of you guys probably
have stocks or whatever.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.360
If you have all your
stuff in one basket,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.057
you're setting yourself
up for a lot greater risk.

00:05:18.057 --> 00:05:19.640
JOSH: All right, so
we've got control.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.160
One of the nice things
about real estate

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.650
is you actually
have more control

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.307
than with a stock or a
bond or things like that.

00:05:25.307 --> 00:05:26.890
The stock you're
buying, you're hoping

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.900
that the CEO of the company
is doing the right thing,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.358
the employees are
doing their jobs,

00:05:30.358 --> 00:05:31.900
and everything's
going to go well.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.140
In terms of real
estate, you can actually

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.760
control a lot of what happens.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.782
So you can manage
purchase price,

00:05:39.782 --> 00:05:41.240
you can manage the
maintenance, you

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.870
can manage who you put in there.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.510
So having that control gives
you a little more power

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.440
over your investment.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.730
BRANDON: All right, leverage.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.410
How many of you guys went
to summer camp as a kid?

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.330
Nobody at summer camp?

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.280
OK, a few people.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.238
All right, so one of my
memories of summer camp

00:05:56.238 --> 00:05:58.250
was the teeter-totter,
or do you say see-saw?

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.096
JOSH: See-saw.

00:05:59.096 --> 00:05:59.720
It's a see-saw.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.260
BRANDON: Well, whatever.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.170
Teeter-totter, see-saw,
you know the thing, right?

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.335
Or, for the science
people, we're

00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:05.120
talking about, like, a
fulcrum-- is that the word?

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.060
Right, so leverage is the
idea of moving large objects

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.820
with small amount.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.240
I remember I was like-- I
was the big fat kid at camp.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.920
And so you could,
depending on where

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.410
you sat on the teeter-totter,
you could move large objects.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.791
So that's the idea with
real estate investing.

00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:19.290
With a small amount
of money you can

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.880
move a large amount
of property, which

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.414
is one of my favorite
things about it.

00:06:23.414 --> 00:06:24.080
JOSH: All right.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.355
And of course the most important
thing is financial freedom.

00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:27.980
We're all here.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.750
We're working we're doing
these things to support

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.050
our friends, our families,
well, hopefully you're

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.370
not supporting your
friends, but you're

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.547
supporting your families.

00:06:34.547 --> 00:06:37.890
And the ultimate end-all
be-all American Dream

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.450
is financial freedom, right?

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.770
So real estate is
definitely another means

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.247
to an end to get there.

00:06:43.247 --> 00:06:47.820
You may end up getting to a
point with your real estate

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.917
career where Google doesn't
work for you anymore,

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:52.250
and you're working for yourself.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.890
I don't know that the big
guy wants to hear that,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.120
but that might happen.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.880
And that's, again, that's
the goal, because in the end

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.630
you're going to take
that money and you're

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.780
going to do what with it?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.480
You're going to give
it to your family,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.729
and you're going to do all
the things are looking for.

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.440
So real estate
investing, we get into it

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.850
because ultimately we're
trying to have a better

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.807
life for ourselves
and our families.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.390
BRANDON: All right,
let's get started.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.770
If you guys are writing
this down or taking notes

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.110
on your computer, I'm just
going to go through--- well,

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.860
we're going to go
through all seven steps.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.240
So step number one is
it to get educated.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.790
Now when a lot of people
think of getting educated,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.100
just as Jordan said
earlier, they think of this.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.520
So.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.410
Oh!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.060
There it is!

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.559
All right.

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:36.280
So, we got the
snake oil salesmen

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.382
who's always advertising
how you can get rich.

00:07:39.382 --> 00:07:40.840
You can get the
girl in the bikini,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.570
and you can get the
red convertible.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.010
For some reason
those three things

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.840
always go together on the
late night TV infomercials.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.660
That's not what we're
talking about today.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.350
So try to get that out
of your mind, please.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.960
JOSH: All right.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.370
There are other ways to go.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.200
You don't have to
spend-- ultimately,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.280
what these guys do is there's
this kind of dominance

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.000
over the information space that
they've kind of projected out

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.499
there.

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:06.340
You hear it on the commercials,
you see it at these seminars.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.960
They have these funnels
where, come to this free event

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.710
and you're going to learn all
about real estate investing.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.680
Well these free events
are really lead funnels

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.690
to get you to spend $997,
to get you to spend $19,000,

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.150
to get you to spend $50,000.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.858
The next thing you
know you've given them

00:08:19.858 --> 00:08:21.780
all your money and
you've got nothing.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.960
There are other ways you can go.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.990
You've got books, you've
got blogs, mentors, forums,

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.410
podcasts, YouTube.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.290
There is enough information out
on the web, as you guys know

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.620
who own the web, that
you can pretty much learn

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.490
the entire business online,
or at the library, things

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:39.990
like that.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.450
But you don't have to
depend on these guys.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.909
Ultimately, with
education, the key

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.570
is you want to know what
you're getting into here, OK?

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.610
If you go.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.317
I'll give an example of myself.

00:08:49.317 --> 00:08:50.650
I started real estate investing.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.640
I was a smart guy--
not quite a Googler,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.270
but I was fairly intelligent.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.019
And I thought I could do it all.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:57.810
Somebody, my brother
said to me, hey, Josh,

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.760
you should buy some real estate.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.370
I said, great.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.737
I went, I bought some real
estate not knowing anything.

00:09:01.737 --> 00:09:03.653
So I'm like I'm smart
enough to figure it out.

00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:05.736
Well, very quickly realized
I was not smart enough

00:09:05.736 --> 00:09:07.520
to figure it out on my own.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.530
I ended up, over a period of
time, losing about $100,000

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.609
off of the first investments
that I got involved in.

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:16.400
It was because I didn't
have the education.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.990
I didn't have the
full understanding

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.366
of what I needed to do.

00:09:19.366 --> 00:09:20.740
And again, that
kind of goes back

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.460
to the origins of this
website, BiggerPockets,

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.890
was because ultimately
I needed the answers.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.140
I needed a place to go.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.090
The nice thing
about the mentors,

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.530
and a nice thing about
groups like our site,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.320
or other groups,
clubs, things like that

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.800
where you can get
educated, is you

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.860
can count on the support of
other people to help you out.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.640
And it really is
important in real estate

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.412
to have that support net
to help you get going.

00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:48.370
BRANDON: Right you are.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.260
Step number two is to choose
your niche and your strategy.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.010
This is the way that
I like to explain it,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.810
because real estate investing
can be really overwhelming

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.880
because it's so broad.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.510
Let me explain what
I mean by that.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.820
First of all, there's
niches and there's

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.214
strategies when
you're investing.

00:10:04.214 --> 00:10:04.805
Oh!

00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:05.930
We're not up there anymore.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.520
Well, all right,
well I'll just talk.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.110
Basically there are niches and
there are strategies, right?

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.260
So niches would be like
the actual property

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.530
types you're buying.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.440
For example, you got single
family, multi-family,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.800
commercial, notes, raw
land, anything like that.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.964
It's actually like
property types.

00:10:23.964 --> 00:10:25.380
On the other side
of the equation,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.710
you have different
strategies that you can use.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.992
So, for example, you might
want to flip a house.

00:10:29.992 --> 00:10:31.700
So you guys ever seen
the flipping shows?

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.400
How many of you have
seen flipping shows?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.441
The TV-- yeah, all right.

00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:37.934
So that's a strategy, not
necessarily-- another strategy

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:38.850
would be buy and hold.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.590
That's where you buy
something hold onto it.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.800
Other could be live-in
investments, things like that,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.820
that you hold onto while
you're living inside of it.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.361
For example, if you
live in a duplex,

00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:48.590
you live in half of it,
that's also strategy.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.690
So the problem with
real estate investing

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.180
is that it gets really,
really overwhelming for a lot

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.972
of people, because they
see all this stuff,

00:10:54.972 --> 00:10:56.346
and all these
people say, no, you

00:10:56.346 --> 00:10:58.240
should do this and
this and this and this.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.680
What we recommend is just
choose one niche and just

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.610
choose one strategy.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.100
So for example, you might want
to flip single family houses.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.630
Great.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.630
So learn about flipping
single family houses.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.975
You might want to buy and
hold commercial properties.

00:11:11.975 --> 00:11:12.600
That's OK, too.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.820
You might want to do a
live-in multi-family property.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.320
So you don't need
to know everything

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.590
in the world to get
started in real estate.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.720
Just pick one thing, get
good at that one thing,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.090
and then move on from there.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.450
So with that, we're gonna
move onto the next slide here.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.900
All right.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.910
So we're going to have
a jobs person investing.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.386
I'll let Josh take that one.

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:33.885
JOSH: Sure.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.650
All right, I'll talk about
active versus passive.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.594
So with real estate, there's
really two ways to go.

00:11:47.594 --> 00:11:50.260
You can say hey, I'm going to be
an active real estate investor,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.530
or I'm going to be a passive
real estate investor.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.660
House-flipping shows that
Brandon had talked about,

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.243
you're an active
real estate investor.

00:11:56.243 --> 00:11:56.952
You're out there.

00:11:56.952 --> 00:11:58.118
You're finding the property.

00:11:58.118 --> 00:11:59.250
You're picking the color.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.360
You're dealing with
the contractors,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.700
dealing with the headaches.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.260
It's a job.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.760
Don't let anyone
tell you otherwise.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.780
Flipping houses is a job.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.340
Passive is really, it's
more like-- passive

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.620
is where-- it's
what it says, right?

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.990
Passive is like buying
a stock essentially,

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.740
but a little bit more work.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.180
You purchase, you sit
back, and you kind of

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.780
wait for things to happen.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.900
In passive-- for
example, buy and hold--

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.430
you're going to be depending
upon a property manager who's

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.810
going to watch the property
and do most of the work.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.660
And we'll talk a little bit
more about that later on.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.000
But ultimately, there is
not one right way to invest,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.770
as Brandon had said earlier.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.610
However, we definitely
recommend that you

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.360
choose that one niche
and that one strategy.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.580
It may not be the right one,
but pick one and go with it,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.679
because if you're worried about
every other strategy that's

00:12:56.679 --> 00:12:58.720
out there, or every other
niche that's out there,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.940
you're going to get
really, it's going

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.510
to cause you to kind
of get confused,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.694
and ultimately in the end,
people will never act.

00:13:04.694 --> 00:13:06.360
That's one of the
biggest things that we

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.600
see with new real
estate investors is

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.730
they fail to act because there's
just so much information out

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.730
there, and they don't
really know where to go.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.649
Which leads us to the
development of your plan.

00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:17.440
BRANDON: All right.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.010
So number three-- we talked
about number one and two.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.593
Number three is going
to be to develop

00:13:20.593 --> 00:13:23.710
your plan I like to
explain it like this.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.070
I'm from the Seattle area.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.290
I would not generally
get in my car

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.220
and go and drive 3,500 miles
to Mexico City just knowing

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.410
that it's south, right?

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.480
Anybody work on the Google
Maps department here?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.130
I don't know if
you guys do that?

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.520
So, thankfully, we have maps,
things like Google Maps,

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.342
that we can get our car
and drive and follow

00:13:41.342 --> 00:13:42.633
somebody who's already done it.

00:13:42.633 --> 00:13:44.258
So that's what
developing your plan is.

00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:45.810
It's about getting
a starting point

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.190
and ending point and knowing
where you're ending up at.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.591
So we're going to explain just
a couple sample plans, because I

00:13:51.591 --> 00:13:53.090
don't like to be
always theoretical.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.444
Let's get actually
realistic here.

00:13:55.444 --> 00:13:56.860
So first plan I
want to talk about

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.030
is buying single family houses.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.735
Again these are just samples,
so bear with me on this example.

00:14:02.735 --> 00:14:04.193
You might buy single
family houses,

00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:05.651
and you might say,
OK, well, I want

00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:07.540
to buy a single
family house that

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.230
provides $200 per month
in passive cash flow.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.735
So every month I have $200
left over after all the bills,

00:14:13.735 --> 00:14:15.860
including property management,
whatever I paid for.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.790
I want $200 left.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.760
And I only want to
put down $20,000.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.800
OK, so that's the
beginning of our plan.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.316
Then you're going
to say, well, I'm

00:14:22.316 --> 00:14:23.950
going to buy one
property in year one.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.470
I need the math people here
to listen closely here.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.960
One in year one, two in year
two, three in year three,

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.810
and so on, all the
way up to year 10.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.100
Any geniuses in here know
how many, after year ten,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.674
how many you'd have?

00:14:36.674 --> 00:14:38.090
Anybody?

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.820
Anybody?

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.320
55!

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.290
Smart guy there!

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.700
All right, so you've got
55 houses and 11 hundred

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.820
per month--

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.800
JOSH: Thousand.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.852
BRANDON: $11,000 per month
in passive cash flow.

00:14:48.852 --> 00:14:51.060
Which gives you a nice, in
10 years, a nice addition.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.710
And that's building
real slowly, right?

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.912
Just one in year
one, two in year two.

00:14:54.912 --> 00:14:56.120
It's all about a plan, right?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.634
So that's just one sample
plan you might look into.

00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:01.050
JOSH: Another
sample plan might be

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.490
to start with small,
multi-family properties that

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.800
provide a 15% return
on investment.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.090
Again, buy one
property per year.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.757
So, say you start with
a duplex, for example.

00:15:10.757 --> 00:15:12.090
Maybe you decide, you know what?

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.920
I'm going to live
in half the duplex.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.824
I want to get the experience to
manage my tenants, my toilets,

00:15:17.824 --> 00:15:19.490
and all the headaches
that come with it,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.530
but I want to see
and feel that, right?

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.850
So I get in there, I buy this
duplex, I live in half of it,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.135
pretty much have my mortgage
paid for by the other folks who

00:15:29.135 --> 00:15:30.460
are living on the property.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.179
And then, after a year
or two, I decide OK, I'm

00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:34.470
going to move up to a fourplex.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.010
And so I buy a fourplex
and then I move up,

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.170
and so on and so forth.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.461
So you save all the cash flow
for future down payments.

00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:41.180
You trade up to
larger unit numbers

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.850
as more income comes
in, and in time you

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.470
buy the 30 unit, the 50
unit, if you are so inclined

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.360
to continue going.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.160
Or you just stop where
you need to stop.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.380
Ultimately you want to set what
your expectations are up front.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.090
You want to really
look at where are you,

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.310
where are you in life, what's
your end-all, be-all goal.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.320
Do you want to be a full-time
real estate investor?

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.486
Do you want to be part time?

00:16:00.486 --> 00:16:03.240
Do you just need
enough to get by?

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.990
We're doing pretty good now.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.630
We just want to make a couple
of thousand bucks a month extra.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.410
Well, reverse
engineer it, right?

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.110
Think about how
much you need, build

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.060
a plan that builds that
into it, and figure out

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.869
how do you get there.

00:16:15.869 --> 00:16:16.660
BRANDON: All right.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.580
So step number four in the
plan that we're talking about

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.065
is finding your property.

00:16:21.065 --> 00:16:22.940
Because we already talked
about the education

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.250
we already talked about
picking what you want to do.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.360
Next we want to talk about
finding which property.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.870
And there's a lot of different
ways you can do that.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.370
We're just going to run
through them real quickly, just

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.300
some of the common techniques.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.700
First of all, there is the MLS.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.770
If you've ever bought
or sold a house,

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.500
chances are you bought
and sold one off the MLS,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.130
meaning a real estate
agent listed it

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.254
and you went and bought it.

00:16:42.254 --> 00:16:43.754
In a competitive
market-- especially

00:16:43.754 --> 00:16:45.628
the competitive market
around here I've heard

00:16:45.628 --> 00:16:47.460
is ridiculous--
it's very, very hard

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.165
to find good deals on there,
but they can be found.

00:16:50.165 --> 00:16:51.540
JOSH: Then you've
got networking.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.039
So networking,
you've got events.

00:16:53.039 --> 00:16:54.830
You've got, I mean,
you guys have a campus.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.130
This is college campus right?

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.310
Google Campus, right?

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.520
I mean Jordan's an investor.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.090
There's 30 people in here.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.420
Why don't you guys start
a real estate club?

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.020
The Google Real Estate
Club would be a great idea.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.839
You guys can work
together, network.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.540
You guys can find deals
together, work on projects,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.050
finance things like that.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.109
Networking is an amazing way
to build up your investments

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:14.790
in your base.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.750
And just a real
quick plug-- tonight

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.400
we're actually doing a meet-up
in San Francisco of real estate

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.682
investors in town.

00:17:20.682 --> 00:17:23.140
If any of you guys want to
come, you're welcome to join us.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.778
Jordan's got the information.

00:17:24.778 --> 00:17:26.569
But there's like a
hundred something people

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.460
who are getting together
to talk about real estate.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.043
No pitchiness.

00:17:29.043 --> 00:17:32.312
It's just people hanging out
and trying to figure it out.

00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:34.312
BRANDON: Another way that
a lot of investors use

00:17:34.312 --> 00:17:35.646
is marketing to find good deals.

00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:37.020
This gets a little
more advanced,

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.620
and I'm not suggesting everyone
goes out and does right away.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.180
But by marketing,
meaning anything

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.990
from billboards to an ad in
newspaper, an ad on Craigslist,

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.097
Google AdWords-- I've
used that to find deals.

00:17:47.097 --> 00:17:48.430
Anything like that is marketing.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.720
It's going on the offensive,
and go and get a good deal

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.397
instead of just waiting
for it to come to you.

00:17:54.397 --> 00:17:56.730
JOSH: Then, if you're looking
for commercial properties,

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.080
you've got sites like
LoopNet, CoStar-- you guys

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.640
might want to write these down.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.309
There's these portals where
you can go out and find

00:18:04.309 --> 00:18:06.100
the listings for the
commercial properties.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.990
You may not find the
best deals, but if you

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.420
start searching, start
looking at these properties

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.680
and these platforms,
you could at least

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.096
start to see what
the numbers are.

00:18:13.096 --> 00:18:15.480
You guys are all mostly number
crunchers, I'm guessing.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.220
So you can figure out
kind of what works,

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.155
what doesn't work by starting
to experience what's out there.

00:18:22.155 --> 00:18:23.530
BRANDON: All right,
and finally I

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.321
just want to throw out
there, BiggerPockets

00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:27.000
which is where we
spend our time.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.020
People come on there
and sell, give away,

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.040
trade, whatever deals.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.670
Moving on, next one, number five
is to pay for your investment.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.462
It's not free.

00:18:38.462 --> 00:18:40.420
I mean, there's no such
thing as a free lunch--

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.535
unless you work at Google.

00:18:43.535 --> 00:18:44.076
There you go!

00:18:44.076 --> 00:18:44.520
All right!

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:44.920
JOSH: First laugh!

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.419
Yeah!

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:46.252
First laugh!

00:18:46.252 --> 00:18:47.140
BRANDON: Give that man a drink!

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.640
All right.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.910
So you've got to pay
for your investment.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.540
The best way-- I mean there's
a lot of different ways--

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.340
I'm not going to
say the best way.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.565
But we're going to run through
probably, I don't know,

00:18:54.565 --> 00:18:55.898
six or seven of them real quick.

00:18:55.898 --> 00:18:59.269
First of all number one
probably, maybe most common way

00:18:59.269 --> 00:19:00.810
to pay for an
investment is all cash.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.710
If you are rich or if you're
investing in a cheap area,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.840
you can write a nice big check,
great, cash is always good.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.755
People-- sellers love cash.

00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:10.380
So if you can offer
cash, that's great.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.595
But it's not feasible.

00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:12.845
I've never done it.

00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:13.790
So let's move on.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.873
JOSH: Well, and the advantage
really quick of cash

00:19:15.873 --> 00:19:17.950
is that a seller's
going to look at you

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.220
and say, all right, this
guy can close quickly right?

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.553
So it's you versus the guy
who's getting the financing--

00:19:22.553 --> 00:19:24.274
conventional loans for example.

00:19:24.274 --> 00:19:25.690
You've got cash,
you come up, they

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.080
know that you don't have
to wait for the bank

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.800
to approve the loan.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.424
They know that you
can walk in and take

00:19:29.424 --> 00:19:30.690
this property off their hands.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.110
So they're more
likely than not going

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.720
to lean towards your offer,
even if it's potentially even

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.980
less, because it's
more secure offer.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.040
Conventional loans
are pretty much what

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.600
you guys have probably
all bought your properties

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.860
if you own house.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.160
A conventional loan, your
Wells Fargo, your Citibank,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.110
things like that.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.970
And conventional, you're
putting down 20% up

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.687
to potentially 30%
on your property,

00:19:55.687 --> 00:19:57.270
and they're going
to finance the rest.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.105
So that's a conventional loan.

00:19:59.105 --> 00:20:01.730
BRANDON: All right, next I want
to talk about government loans.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.730
How many of you guys
actually own your own home?

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.679
Can I ask that?

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:05.470
Quite a few people.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.840
Did anybody use an FHA
loan when they did it?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.760
All right, so let me explain.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.702
FHA-- there's also VA
and USDA-- we're not

00:20:13.702 --> 00:20:16.160
going to do that-- FHA is a
loan program the government has

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.080
which insures your loan, which
means you can get a cheaper

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.630
down payment.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.190
Right now it's at 3.5%.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.650
So if you're buying a $100,000
property, which, I know,

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.108
is cheap, but if you were buying
$100,000 for easy numbers,

00:20:28.108 --> 00:20:30.060
$3,500 is what you
would need down.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.540
Now granted, you have to
live in that property--

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.720
I think it's for a year.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.504
But it could be a duplex,
triplex, or fourplex.

00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:38.670
My favorite strategy in all
of real estate investing

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.327
is to find a multi-family
property like that,

00:20:41.327 --> 00:20:43.410
live in one of the units,
rent the other ones out.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.140
Move out later.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.310
And you've got that
nice fixed rate,

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.221
low down payment multi-family
property that just provides

00:20:49.221 --> 00:20:50.720
cash flow for the
rest of your life.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.719
I did that actually with
a duplex that I bought.

00:20:52.719 --> 00:20:54.430
Ended it up,
interesting, it ended up

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.930
that duplex we found
out years later

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.761
was Kurt Cobain's very first
house, which is interesting.

00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:01.510
We found out because
some Swedish tourists

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.350
were knocking on the door trying
to take pictures of the inside.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.850
Yeah.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.210
Fun side story.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.880
JOSH: And now he owns two
of Kurt Cobain's houses.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.530
It's true.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.894
If anyone wants one,
any Nirvana fans?

00:21:11.894 --> 00:21:12.935
Does anyone like Nirvana?

00:21:12.935 --> 00:21:14.550
There's an investment
house for sale.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.049
Anyone?

00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:16.150
Anyone?

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.680
Bueller?

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.770
All right.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:19.680
Portfolio loans.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.860
Portfolio loans
are loans that are

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.430
owned by the lender themselves.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.859
So you guys remember the
housing crisis where everybody's

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:29.150
talking about slicing and
dicing loans and selling them

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.240
and things like that.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.370
Portfolio loans are where a
banking, a lending institution,

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.170
is going to own the loan.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.580
They're not going
to sell it off.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.390
The nice thing about
portfolio lenders

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.770
are they love
investors, and they're

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.990
pretty easy to work
with, generally.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.901
If you've got good
deals, they want them.

00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:48.650
So they're going to
want to work with you.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.040
They're not gonna-- especially
if you start to learn how

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.550
to deal with lenders, and
you can present yourself

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.690
in a professional way, and give
them your loan package and say,

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.430
hey, here's a property,
here's all the details,

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.844
and you do well by it,
they're going to love you.

00:22:02.844 --> 00:22:04.760
They're going to want
you to keep coming back.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.090
And portfolio lenders are
definitely a preferred source

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.689
of money for most
sophisticated investors.

00:22:11.689 --> 00:22:12.480
BRANDON: All right.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.820
The next type of loan
that's pretty popular

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.730
is a commercial loan.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.870
If you're gonna buy a property
like a large multi-family

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.411
five units and up,
or if you're going

00:22:18.411 --> 00:22:20.934
to buy an office building,
trailer park, whatever,

00:22:20.934 --> 00:22:22.850
you're going to want to
use a commercial loan.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.369
They're very similar to
portfolio in that any bank can

00:22:25.369 --> 00:22:26.660
generally do a commercial loan.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.201
They usually require a little
bit higher down payment-- maybe

00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:30.750
25%, 30%.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.610
But it can finance--
I mean, if you can--

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.610
Here's a cool example of
something you could do.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.570
Let's say you get 10 guys
together, all throw in $50,000.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.871
You've got $500,000.

00:22:38.871 --> 00:22:40.620
You go to a bank and
get a commercial loan

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.990
on a $10 million property.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.090
Use the 10 guys you
gathered together

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.380
as a down payment on the
commercial loan and the rest.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.485
There's a lot of
fun games you can

00:22:48.485 --> 00:22:50.340
play with that when
you go commercial.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.550
So if you guys decide
to go commercial,

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.005
yeah, look into that and find
a good commercial lender.

00:22:56.005 --> 00:22:58.865
JOSH: And find a good
real estate attorney.

00:22:58.865 --> 00:23:01.240
Don't just like, hey, we're
going to throw money together

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.240
and we're gonna do this!

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.980
Like you want to, again,
about the education.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.140
I know Brandon uses it,
and it's a good example,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.870
but truth be told, don't
go out there and do stuff

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:13.035
unless you've made
sure that it's legit

00:23:13.035 --> 00:23:15.986
and it's kosher, because there's
a lot of bad information--

00:23:15.986 --> 00:23:17.610
I'm not saying his
information is bad--

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.568
but there's a lot of bad
information out there,

00:23:19.568 --> 00:23:22.180
and you really do have
to be careful of that.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.620
So I really do recommend--
and we don't talk about team

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.670
at all on this, but part
of your investing team

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.540
absolutely should be a
real estate attorney.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.350
It's one most important people.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.140
[RANDOM AUDIO OUTBURST]

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.690
JOSH: And thank you very much.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.600
All right so we've got
hard money lenders.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.069
Hard money lenders are
kind of the loan sharks.

00:23:42.069 --> 00:23:43.860
A lot of people think--
if you hear of them

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.276
and they think
loan sharks, right?

00:23:45.276 --> 00:23:48.820
These are guys who actually
loan money for short term--

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.944
and it's pretty expensive.

00:23:49.944 --> 00:23:52.110
They're going to-- you're
going to pay points on it.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.371
You might be paying 12%,
15% on a hard money loan.

00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:57.370
But it's going to be a
loan for six months, nine

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.580
months, something like that.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.390
This is one of the preferred
loans for flippers.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.680
House flippers love
hard money loans,

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.749
because they're generally,
the hard-money lenders

00:24:05.749 --> 00:24:07.790
have an understanding of
what flippers are doing.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.248
They can look at
a property and say

00:24:09.248 --> 00:24:11.310
this is going to be a good deal.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.060
You're going to be
able turn it over fast.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.720
You have the resources.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.730
I'm going to give you the
money, make my money fast,

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:17.063
and we're all going to be happy.

00:24:17.063 --> 00:24:19.109
Hard money loans.

00:24:19.109 --> 00:24:20.650
BRANDON: All right,
we're almost done

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:21.370
with the different
financing things.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.260
But there's also
private money, which

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.570
would be things like
family, or friends.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.316
If you borrow money from
somebody that you know,

00:24:28.316 --> 00:24:29.964
dangerous to do that.

00:24:29.964 --> 00:24:31.630
Not necessarily that
you know like well,

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.924
but if you borrow money from
people that you might network

00:24:34.924 --> 00:24:36.340
with, that's called
private money.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.106
Usually a little bit cheaper.

00:24:38.106 --> 00:24:39.480
For example,
there's a guy I know

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.749
in Portland who just lent
me $100,000 to go buy

00:24:41.749 --> 00:24:44.040
an investment property and
then I'm gonna refinance it.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.539
Worked out really great for me,
it worked out great for him,

00:24:46.539 --> 00:24:50.130
and that's a perfect
private money deal.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.970
So I recommend looking into that
if you're looking for financing

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.320
and can't get it from a bank.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.830
JOSH: So that was private money.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.750
Partners-- and on
private money, you

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.760
want to be really
sure the person you're

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.680
working with-- you
are in bed with them.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.332
So make sure you're
comfortable with the folks

00:25:07.332 --> 00:25:08.290
that you're doing that.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.680
The same goes for partners.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.115
So partners would be, you know,
you and your buddy say hey,

00:25:14.115 --> 00:25:15.460
we want to get into the game.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.630
I'm going to put up
50%, and you put up 50%,

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.480
and let's get in
this deal together.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.070
Or he may put up all the
money, you may do all the work,

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.900
things like that.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.920
But if you work with folks, you
can come up with creative ways

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.200
to potentially even do
deals with no cash out

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.489
of your own pocket.

00:25:30.489 --> 00:25:33.030
But again, you want to make sure
you're very careful with who

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.149
you're working with
which leads us to--

00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.940
BRANDON: All right.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.460
The last one I want to
talk about real quick

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.620
is just seller financing.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.080
What seller financing is
is when you buy a property

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.150
from the person who owns
it, and they actually

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.677
carry the mortgage.

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.510
So instead of you paying
a bank every month,

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.801
you pay the seller every month.

00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:51.380
That's actually how I bought
my 24 unit apartment building.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.190
There was an older couple
who went to my church.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.712
I mentioned one
day, hey, you know,

00:25:54.712 --> 00:25:56.295
I'd love to buy an
apartment building.

00:25:56.295 --> 00:25:57.650
And they said, huh, interesting.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.760
We actually have one.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.020
And it worked out perfect.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.970
That's that networking thing
we talked about earlier.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.220
Well, what we ended
up doing is they

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.762
ended up carrying
the contract on it,

00:26:04.762 --> 00:26:06.219
which is they
carried the mortgage.

00:26:06.219 --> 00:26:07.210
I pay them every month.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.084
They're this cute old
couple who drive around

00:26:09.084 --> 00:26:10.660
the country in their
motor home now.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.326
And like, that's their
entire retirement

00:26:12.326 --> 00:26:13.650
is what I pay them every month.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.900
It works out amazing for them.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.280
Worked out great for me.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.035
And it's a really,
really great way

00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:20.535
to buy real estate
if you can do it.

00:26:20.535 --> 00:26:21.936
JOSH: It's like an annuity.

00:26:21.936 --> 00:26:24.287
BRANDON: Yeah, yeah
it's really nice.

00:26:24.287 --> 00:26:26.120
With that, let's move
on to step number six.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.040
JOSH: All right.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.460
Step number six--
self management

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.250
versus property management.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.700
We're not really talking about
flipping houses here, now.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.720
We're talking about
investment properties,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.180
buy and hold things--
buy and hold properties.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.360
So self managing
is pretty obvious.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.700
You buy a property, you're
taking care of the toilets,

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.830
you're taking care
of the tenants,

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:44.990
you're taking care
of the maintenance,

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.490
you're taking care
of the headaches,

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.430
and yes, you will
deal with all of that.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.950
Self managing is-- it
can be very challenging.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.560
It could be very fulfilling.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.260
In the end, it could
be very time-consuming.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.220
That said, if you're
going to become a landlord

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.170
and end up having
somebody outside do it

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.110
for you, definitely, definitely
recommend self managing

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.520
first versus
property management.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.649
Property management, you're
gonna hire a company,

00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:12.440
they're going to take
care of the property.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.780
Now that said, when I told
you that I had a hard time

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.780
and lost a lot of money.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.080
Well, I did that
primarily because I

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.470
hired the wrong
property management.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.250
I went out there.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.791
I didn't know what
I was looking for.

00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:25.222
I didn't know what to do.

00:27:25.222 --> 00:27:26.930
So I went and I hired
a property manager.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.960
All right, great!

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.230
Property manager screwed me.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.530
Hired another property manager.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.050
Property manager screwed me.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.330
Hired another one.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.585
And it was this dirty
trail of tears for me.

00:27:36.585 --> 00:27:41.220
And ultimately-- so you have
to know, a passive investment,

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.224
you're not necessarily-- when
you've got these property

00:27:44.224 --> 00:27:46.140
managers, you want to
know how to screen them.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.130
You want to know
what to look for.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.213
And you want to make sure
they're doing their job.

00:27:49.213 --> 00:27:51.730
So there is the active part
of the passive investment.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.020
But in the end, again,
professional property managers

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.020
are going to do the job.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.686
They're going to take
care of the asset.

00:27:56.686 --> 00:27:58.890
And they may even help
you find additional deals.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.550
BRANDON: All right.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.815
Step number seven.

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.981
We're going to close this
thing up here in a minute.

00:28:05.981 --> 00:28:08.000
And that is planning
your exit strategy.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.690
We talked about, earlier,
the map, driving from Seattle

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.090
all the way down to Mexico City.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.820
You have to know
where Mexico City's at

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.736
in order to get there.

00:28:14.736 --> 00:28:16.950
So you have to know where
your destination is.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.230
You may change throughout your
life where that destination is,

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.880
but it's still important
to kind of plan for that.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.505
So we're going to
talk about just a few

00:28:22.505 --> 00:28:24.027
of the more common
exit strategies

00:28:24.027 --> 00:28:25.985
a person might have in
their investment career.

00:28:25.985 --> 00:28:28.470
So the first one would be
holding onto a property

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.370
forever.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.826
What I mean by that is
indefinitely, right?

00:28:31.826 --> 00:28:33.700
So you might buy a bunch
of rental properties

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.455
with no real plan
to get rid of them.

00:28:35.455 --> 00:28:39.040
And that's probably OK, as long
as you do your asset protection

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.006
well, so when you
die your kids will

00:28:41.006 --> 00:28:42.130
get the property correctly.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.805
So there are people
who do hold forever,

00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:47.116
and that is a valid
exit strategy.

00:28:47.116 --> 00:28:48.240
JOSH: Sell it and cash out.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.230
So you buy a property.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.730
You sell it.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.890
Maybe you're flipping house.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.973
So you buy it, short term.

00:28:52.973 --> 00:28:53.830
You sell it.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.570
Flip it.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.571
Get another property.

00:28:55.571 --> 00:28:56.070
Sell it.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.860
Flip it.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.380
Keep going, keep
going, keep going.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.210
Again, that's a
really active activity

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.670
that you're going to be doing.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:06.600
But if you buy these properties
at a good value, good price,

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.310
you can potentially make
a lot of money doing this.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.090
Again, you have to
be educated to know

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:14.130
how to buy the properties,
what a good price is,

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.410
how to evaluate it.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.080
That education
component comes in

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.260
to make sure that you
don't make a mistake.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.550
With real estate
investments, you really

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.700
make your money on the purchase.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.617
So don't think, hey,
I'm going to make money

00:29:25.617 --> 00:29:27.200
because there's going
be appreciation.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.910
If you are buying, betting on
appreciation, you're gambling.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.450
You might as well be the
casino and throw all your money

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.620
on black.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.786
If you want to actually
purchase and be smart about it,

00:29:36.786 --> 00:29:38.160
you're going to
analyze the deal,

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.285
you're going to analyze
the fundamentals, the area,

00:29:40.285 --> 00:29:42.520
everything that's going
on, and you're not

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.880
going to bet on appreciation.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.502
Think of appreciation
as a bonus.

00:29:47.502 --> 00:29:49.210
BRANDON: All right,
another strategy ties

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.370
into what I talked about
earlier, and that's

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.000
a lot of investors choose
to sell via seller financing

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.690
eventually.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.927
So you get old and tired
of doing real estate.

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:57.510
You decide to sell
all your properties

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.065
to another investor who's then
going to take care of them,

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:01.692
just like the older
couple did for me.

00:30:01.692 --> 00:30:03.150
It can work out
really well, and it

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.727
can carry you 20, 30
years into retirement.

00:30:06.727 --> 00:30:07.810
JOSH: And keep trading-up.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.476
I think we had talked
about that earlier

00:30:09.476 --> 00:30:11.310
with the multi-family plan.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.449
You buy the multi-family,
you hold onto it

00:30:14.449 --> 00:30:15.240
for a couple years.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.840
Collect the cash flow.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.050
You're paying down
these mortgages.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.180
You sell that thing.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.490
Trade up to the next one.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.070
There's things that are
called 1031 exchanges.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.470
You can actually defer
taxes on the purchase

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.130
of the next property.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.240
So trading-up is a
pretty good strategy.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.840
I think it's one of the
more preferred strategies

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.680
of the longer-term
real estate investors.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.539
And it's a great way to go.

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:39.330
BRANDON: All right.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:40.600
Well, we're just going
to wrap it up now,

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.375
and we're going to open
up for some questions.

00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:44.530
But first of all, if you
guys want to learn more,

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.496
we talked about it earlier,
don't pay tens of thousands,

00:30:48.496 --> 00:30:50.370
or hundreds of thousands
of dollars to learn.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.880
And like I said, focus on the
books, the blogs, the mentors,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.450
the forums, podcasts,
things like YouTube.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.040
And there is so much free
information out there.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.770
Information has been
democratized in the real estate

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:03.140
investing world-- I mean in
any world, but especially

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:03.640
real estate.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.267
There's so much information
out there for free or for cheap

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:09.150
that I can't recommend that
enough, is don't throw away

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.124
hundreds of thousands
of dollars on education.

00:31:12.124 --> 00:31:14.540
If you guys want to know more
exactly what we talked about

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.309
today, we are the co-authors
of a book called "The Ultimate

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:19.100
Beginner's Guide to
Real Estate Investing."

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.590
It is free, which is helpful.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.510
It's online.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:27.810
It's at biggerpockets.com/UBG
And with that,

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.560
we're just going to
open up for questions.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.094
So if anybody has any questions
at all, we're open books, so.

00:31:33.094 --> 00:31:34.260
AUDIENCE: Uh, two questions.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.257
First of all, is the slide deck
that you didn't show available

00:31:37.257 --> 00:31:39.542
on the site?

00:31:39.542 --> 00:31:41.500
BRANDON: It can be, yes,
I can put it up there.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.360
JOSH: Yeah, we can put this up.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.080
MALE SPEAKER: Can you
repeat the question?

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.135
BRANDON: Sure.

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:46.460
The question was, is the slide--
is the slide deck going to be--

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.668
can we put it up on the site?

00:31:47.668 --> 00:31:48.280
Yeah, we can.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.870
And I can get copies.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.420
Basically, the slide deck
was just simple two words

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.345
of what we had read
out loud, I guess, just

00:31:55.345 --> 00:31:57.040
to kind of keep
focus, but yeah we

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.320
can throw that out there, too.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.736
AUDIENCE: And the
second question.

00:31:59.736 --> 00:32:02.852
Many years ago I read
this guy Kiyosaki.

00:32:02.852 --> 00:32:05.120
Which category do
you put him in?

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.840
BRANDON: Oh, like
Robert Kiyosaki?

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.990
"Poor Dad, Rich Dad."

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.980
BRANDON: Yeah, he wrote
"Rich Dad, Poor Dad, "

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.729
which was probably the
most foundational--

00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:14.740
he was asking about Robert
Kiyosaki, where I put him.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.310
I mean "Rich Dad, Poor
Dad," I would say,

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.160
is the number one
most foundational book

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.390
that most real estate
investors read.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.570
I recommend reading the book.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.717
Rich Dad organization
has a lot more stuff.

00:32:25.717 --> 00:32:27.800
You can analyze that,
figure out if it's something

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.870
you want to do.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.210
It can be very expensive.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.965
But "Rich Dad, Poor
Dad," the book, I'd

00:32:31.965 --> 00:32:34.495
say if you're going to read
one book, start with that one.

00:32:34.495 --> 00:32:35.390
JOSH: It's a good motivator.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.470
BRANDON: It's a
very good motivator.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:37.340
JOSH: It's one of those books
that you're gonna open up--

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.396
BRANDON: It's not a how-to
book, but it's a good motivator.

00:32:40.396 --> 00:32:41.950
AUDIENCE: What's the slash URL?

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.190
JOSH: UBG.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.837
UBG.

00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:45.420
BRANDON: Yeah.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.956
Ultimate Beginner's Guide.

00:32:47.956 --> 00:32:49.580
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple of questions.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.947
What are your thoughts on
short-term furnished rentals--

00:32:52.947 --> 00:32:54.530
BRANDON: Short-term
furnished rentals?

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.005
AUDIENCE: Short-term
furnished rentals [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.460
JOSH: Talking like
Airbnb, VRBO stuff.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.324
AUDIENCE: And my other
question is, do you

00:33:04.324 --> 00:33:06.654
recommend getting a
Realtor [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.110
BRANDON: Good questions.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.610
All right.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.029
So his questions
were, first of all,

00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:14.820
what do you think about
short-term rentals,

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.080
like vacation rentals,
Airbnb, or VRBO, those sites.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.955
The second question--
well, I'll get to that.

00:33:19.955 --> 00:33:21.910
So the first one is,
I don't personally

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:22.910
have a need for them.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.220
I think they're a
good idea potentially,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.004
but I think a lot of people get
emotion involved when you're

00:33:28.004 --> 00:33:29.420
doing it, because
you're like, oh,

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.772
I could buy a house
in Puerto Vallarta,

00:33:31.772 --> 00:33:32.980
and it's going to be amazing!

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.610
I could rent it
out all year round!

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.540
It's very, very expensive to
manage that kind of thing.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.220
So especially local, I mean,
I would love to buy something

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.827
in my area that was local
that people could rent,

00:33:42.827 --> 00:33:44.660
because there can be a
lot of money in that.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.760
A second half of
that, though, is

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.325
if you guys looked at
the paper the other day,

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.700
it was on the
front page of paper

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.580
was landlords are now
being sued because they're

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.340
breaking the law.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.839
In a lot of areas
you can't actually

00:33:53.839 --> 00:33:55.390
have short-term
vacation rentals.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.180
And in the past
it's kind of been,

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.990
the government has kind
of turned the other way

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.080
and not really cared.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.200
But now they're starting
to go after landlords

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.380
who are doing this.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.850
JOSH: Yeah, like in New
York they're actually,

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:10.420
I think it's the AG is
suing Airbnb to get access--

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.449
to get access to
the land-- the folks

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:16.820
who are renting their
properties out via Airbnb,

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.800
because the hotel lobby's not
happy about that business.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.020
I know San Francisco, I think,
is also not happy about it.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.949
So I think with
vacation rentals,

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:29.024
a lot of people-- we
know folks, plenty

00:34:29.024 --> 00:34:30.690
of folks who are
making very good money.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:35.370
In fact I know a person who
was a long-term landlord who

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.280
basically waited till leases
were up, got his tenants out

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.850
and used-- transformed his
property to short-term rentals.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.820
And the amount of
money he's making

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.500
is considerably more
with short-term rentals.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.330
But you really have to focus.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.420
There's a lot of
energy to put it in.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.025
Your second question was--

00:34:53.025 --> 00:34:54.150
BRANDON: Real estate agent.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:54.609
JOSH: Oh, real estate agent.

00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:56.060
You know, it's interesting.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.090
That's one of the
biggest debates

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:01.090
that we see on our
site, on BiggerPockets.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:06.260
I think the negative
to it is that you're

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.050
beholding to follow
the rules, so to speak.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.450
I don't see that as a negative.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.410
The best thing about
a real estate license

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:14.660
is you have access to the MLS.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.620
You have access to
deals as they come up.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.370
You can write contracts,
and presumably you're

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.470
educated about what
needs to be done

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.710
on the transactional
side of things.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.870
So everybody that-- we do
a podcast, and everybody

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:32.350
that we've interviewed on the
podcast who has a real estate

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.186
license has said it's
absolutely worth doing.

00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:35.810
Think about it.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:37.750
If you're a house
flipper, you pay,

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.960
you pay-- you don't pay
anything on the purchase,

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.540
but on the sale you got to pay
the 6%, or 8%, approximately.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.399
So you're paying 6% in
commissions every time

00:35:46.399 --> 00:35:47.690
you do it, over and over again.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:51.635
Well if you're the agent,
you're collecting at least half

00:35:51.635 --> 00:35:52.260
of that, right?

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.470
So you're saving a lot
of money in the long term

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.370
by being a real estate
agent and, again, you

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.180
have quicker access to
deals as they come up--

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.307
at least on the MLS.

00:36:02.307 --> 00:36:04.390
BRANDON: And I do not have
my real estate license.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.385
And I've taken the
class to do it,

00:36:06.385 --> 00:36:07.760
and then when it
came down to it,

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:12.240
I decided, personally, I
decided I didn't want to do it.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.240
I don't really know why.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.364
I mean it was a couple
thousand a year at the time,

00:36:15.364 --> 00:36:18.150
and I thought, well, I'm
not really buying that much.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.780
When I look back, I regret
not doing it at the time.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.197
And now I could
go back and do it,

00:36:22.197 --> 00:36:23.821
but it's another
hundred hours of work.

00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:25.010
So I probably will do it.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.344
And I guess if I had to say,
yes, I do recommend getting it

00:36:28.344 --> 00:36:29.510
even though I don't have it.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:34.302
So do what I say, not what
I do Any other questions?

00:36:34.302 --> 00:36:35.760
AUDIENCE: There's
a question on DC.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.959
BRANDON: Oh, cool.

00:36:37.959 --> 00:36:40.857
AUDIENCE: Uh, so, [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:43.755 --> 00:36:48.102
But with democratization
of information,

00:36:48.102 --> 00:36:50.928
like, why are there deals
still to be had, right?

00:36:50.928 --> 00:36:55.388
So the back of my mind says
that [INAUDIBLE] a lot of money?

00:36:55.388 --> 00:36:55.888
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.824
Why is it still possible to do?

00:37:03.824 --> 00:37:05.312
Why isn't [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:05.312 --> 00:37:06.330
Does that make sense?

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.020
JOSH: Yeah.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.490
So how many people do we have
here in the United States?

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.990
What?

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.980
330 million?

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.540
I mean, people die.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.840
People go bankrupt.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.320
People have divorces.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.590
People have
situations where they

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.850
are in a distressed
situation, right?

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:25.810
You may get hired by an
investment bank in New York,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.280
and you've got to
get up and move,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.950
and you've got to
get up and move fast.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:29.575
So what do you?

00:37:29.575 --> 00:37:31.908
You've gotta dump it, you've
gotta unload your property,

00:37:31.908 --> 00:37:32.800
you gotta get out.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.279
So in the end, if
that ever stops,

00:37:37.279 --> 00:37:38.320
then the deals will stop.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.963
But it's never going to happen.

00:37:39.963 --> 00:37:41.421
AUDIENCE: But why
hasn't the number

00:37:41.421 --> 00:37:44.885
of investors risen to
meet that demand, right?

00:37:44.885 --> 00:37:51.617
[INAUDIBLE] dropped to pick
up those hundred dollar

00:37:51.617 --> 00:37:52.810
bills lying on the sidewalk.

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.060
JOSH: I think you're
gonna got me started

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.268
on a political discussion
about our education system.

00:37:56.268 --> 00:37:58.608
And that's going to be
a really bad discussion.

00:37:58.608 --> 00:38:00.072
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:00.072 --> 00:38:02.674
And the second question-- where
does the name BiggerPockets

00:38:02.674 --> 00:38:03.179
come from?

00:38:03.179 --> 00:38:05.220
JOSH: Where did the name
BiggerPockets come from?

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.000
Good question!

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.700
So BiggerPockets came
from-- here we go.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.850
I used to be in the
entertainment business.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.090
BiggerPockets, the name,
was actually originally

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.840
born out of that.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.130
I have a buddy who was in
this really cheesy indie film,

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.350
and he played this drug dealer.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:24.280
And he's sitting there
with this drink in one hand

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.980
and a wad of cash
that he's trying

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.550
to get out of his pocket.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.627
And he's just struggling
and struggling,

00:38:29.627 --> 00:38:31.627
and he finally gets it
out, and he's like, "Man,

00:38:31.627 --> 00:38:33.820
I gotta get bigger pockets!"

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.840
And I was like, brilliant!

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.140
That name is amazing.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.536
I can do anything with that.

00:38:38.536 --> 00:38:41.160
I can build a real estate site,
I could build any kind of site,

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.542
because it could kind of
talk about really anything.

00:38:43.542 --> 00:38:45.250
So that's pretty much
where it came from.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.540
AUDIENCE: You had mentioned
that for commercial real estate,

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:56.270
one strategy is to get 10 people
together and buy [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:00.565
Are there smart ways of doing
that for smaller properties?

00:39:00.565 --> 00:39:04.030
So, for example, if I want
to buy a million dollar home,

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.505
but I only have a
hundred thousand,

00:39:06.505 --> 00:39:11.455
are there resources where I
can find nine other people?

00:39:11.455 --> 00:39:13.930
I don't have nine friends or
nine people who I can trust.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.920
Are there safe ways to kind of
go in on real estate that way?

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.690
BRANDON: Sure.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.190
I mean, there's a
few ways to do it.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.770
One of, I think, the best
ways that we talked about

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.972
is networking, right?

00:39:24.972 --> 00:39:26.430
So if you go to a
real estate club,

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.250
every major city has
real estate clubs,

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.625
and some you have to be really
careful about, because all

00:39:30.625 --> 00:39:33.680
they are is just pitch-fest,
and buy this product.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.130
But if you can find a
good-- even at the bad ones,

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.020
I mean if you can
find people who

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.645
are interested in
doing deals together,

00:39:38.645 --> 00:39:39.951
they're all one mind, right?

00:39:39.951 --> 00:39:41.200
We want to buy deals together.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.104
So that's a good way.

00:39:42.104 --> 00:39:43.020
There is crowdfunding.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.159
It's kind of a new, it's
been coming out lately.

00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:47.200
It's like Kickstarter,
right, but for real estate

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.650
investments.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.720
People pool their money-- you
don't even know who they are,

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.720
just lots of people are
throwing their money in.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.582
That's kind of a new-- exciting
new twist on the real estate

00:39:54.582 --> 00:39:55.290
investment world.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.498
And we didn't really get a
chance to talk about a lot

00:39:57.498 --> 00:40:00.070
today, because personally I've
never invested in one of them.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.860
But that is a way
to do it as well.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.830
I would never go and
put up an advertisement

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.413
in the newspaper that says, hey,
I'm looking for five partners

00:40:07.413 --> 00:40:08.480
to go and buy a property.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.146
That just seems like
you're calling down

00:40:10.146 --> 00:40:12.080
trouble from the
government on-- there's

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.202
a lot of interesting
laws and stuff

00:40:14.202 --> 00:40:16.410
you have to deal when you
get into that so I wouldn't

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.260
publicly do it.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.080
JOSH: So, really quick
to extend on that.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.230
So the SEC.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.330
The SEC is, has--

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.604
MALE SPEAKER: Microphone!

00:40:25.604 --> 00:40:26.270
JOSH: Oh, sorry.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.770
Thank you.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:27.490
Thank you.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.480
Sorry.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.350
So the SEC has a lot
of rules about what

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.160
you can do with raising money
for-- whether it be a company

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.930
or for real estate, public
offerings, things like that.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.930
I'm not going to even try
and explain any of it.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.110
I'm not a lawyer.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:41.160
Don't pretend to be.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.580
But when you go in and
bring people together,

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.810
you really need your
real estate attorney

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.110
to make sure that
you're doing it kosher.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.620
If it's you and your brother,
and your five closest

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.740
friends, fine.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.960
But once you start kind of
dealing with people that

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.320
are outside of your-- even
people in your circle--

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.250
you want to talk to a
lawyer and structure it,

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.930
because there's a lot of
intricacies with the law.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.310
So you want to make sure
you're doing it the right way.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.580
And on the crowdfunding
thing, really quickly.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.360
So a lot of these sites have
come out of the JOBS Act, where

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.930
funding is kind of-- I guess
the SEC's kind of loosened

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.150
up about what's allowed.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.700
But it's not like
Kickstarter, right?

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.520
Kickstarter, you go and
you're donating cash, right?

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.020
You're donating
money for a project,

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.374
and you get a prize in
return for that donation.

00:41:27.374 --> 00:41:28.790
With crowdfunding,
you're actually

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:29.940
investing in the property.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.420
So the government is
pretty hardcore in their--

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:36.970
this is a very nascent
way to finance property.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:41.470
And so, personally, I would
not get into a deal that way.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:42.970
I want to watch and
see what's going

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.010
to happen before I
would jump into that.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.420
So, anyone else?

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.920
AUDIENCE: Was
wondering if you could

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.824
say a bit more about property
management [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:58.000
what to watch out for, what
can go wrong, [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.500
JOSH: All right, so the question
was on property management,

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.010
how to find them,
what to look for.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.570
This is not a shameless
plug, but we-- years ago,

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:08.160
when I was dealing with all
the chaos of my own property

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.770
management, I put together
a list of questions.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.810
And it was, I don't
remember them now

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.980
off the top of my
head, but we can

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.780
find a way to get
it to you guys.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.610
But ultimately,
you want to know do

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.260
you want a property manager who
manages their own properties?

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.530
Are they competing?

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.180
Are they going to take
tenants and put their tenants

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.550
in their own properties
before they put them

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:31.560
in your properties.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.549
So you want to interview them.

00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:34.340
What's their style?

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.798
What they do with
tenant screening?

00:42:35.798 --> 00:42:38.050
How careful are they
in looking for tenants?

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.780
What's their policy
on late rents?

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.720
What's their policy
on contractors?

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.820
How do they manage
broken toilets?

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.670
You need to-- there's
a thousand questions

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.130
that we can go through.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.379
Ultimately, the key is not
just picking the first property

00:42:53.379 --> 00:42:54.420
manager that's out there.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.135
You literally want
to go out there.

00:42:56.135 --> 00:42:57.970
And the same goes for real
estate agents, and pretty

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.386
much anybody else that you're
dealing with in real estate.

00:43:00.386 --> 00:43:02.590
You want to interview
multiple people,

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:05.210
and you want to find out
what their policies are.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.310
Ask the same questions.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:09.384
Find out what their
answers are, and rinse

00:43:09.384 --> 00:43:10.800
and repeat until
you find somebody

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.670
who fits the bill that
you're looking for.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.714
I don't know if that
answers it, but.

00:43:14.714 --> 00:43:17.130
BRANDON: I do want to throw
in one more suggestion, is get

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.460
recommendations from other
real estate investors.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.514
I mean, like, anybody you
can find who does this.

00:43:21.514 --> 00:43:22.930
And it's fairly
easy to find them,

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:24.830
like I said, at the real
estate clubs or whatever.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:25.810
Get recommendations.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.851
The hands-down the best
way to know if somebody's

00:43:27.851 --> 00:43:30.827
going to be good is to
know if they've been good.

00:43:30.827 --> 00:43:32.160
The best way is just reputation.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.660
What have they been to other
people that are similar to you?

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.450
So if you can find that
question out, get referrals.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.917
If you ask me, there's five
property managers in my town--

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:42.000
companies in my town--
I'll tell you four of them,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.070
do not go near.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.460
There's one that I would use.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:46.270
I don't use them yet, but
I will use them someday.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.811
But the other four,
I won't use them.

00:43:47.811 --> 00:43:50.228
I'm happy to tell you that,
because I want you to succeed.

00:43:50.228 --> 00:43:52.144
Real estate investors
love to help each other.

00:43:52.144 --> 00:43:54.660
It's not that competitive of
a business as you might think

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.451
Everyone I've ever
known has been open very

00:43:56.451 --> 00:43:59.170
open to share and to say,
here, do this, don't do this.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:02.390
JOSH: And actually, on that
subject of competition,

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.850
a lot of new investors will
come out and say, oh, well,

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.558
you know, I'm competing--
it kind of goes

00:44:06.558 --> 00:44:09.214
to the question about all these
investors jumping on deals.

00:44:09.214 --> 00:44:10.630
I'm competing with
all these guys.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.320
Well, people who've been
investing for more than one

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.220
or two deals typically
look at their competitors

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.840
as collaborators.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.685
You may say, hey Brandon--
you may go and find a deal.

00:44:20.685 --> 00:44:22.540
You may do marketing,
send out letters

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.670
to people who are in
distressed situations,

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.990
and come up with
people, somebody

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:29.780
who's mom just died and needs
to get rid of her property.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.530
And you know what?

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.650
You don't have
cash at this point,

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.740
because you just bought
another property, right?

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.050
So three days later, after
you bought a property,

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:37.800
a phenomenal deal comes in.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.500
Well, you know Brandon's looking
for a similar-type property.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.280
Well, I'm going to work with
Brandon to get the deal done.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.910
I'm not going to make as much
as I might have made otherwise.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:47.610
But at least I can
make some money,

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.520
or at least I can
give it over to him.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.480
He can make some money,
and, you know, payback,

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.440
scratchy-scratchy.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.200
So investors like
to work together.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.330
And if you can
collaborate and not

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.670
think of the other investors
in your area as competitors,

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:03.280
you're going to do way
better than the folks who do

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.106
think that way.

00:45:05.106 --> 00:45:07.559
BRANDON: Any other questions?

00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:08.475
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:14.406 --> 00:45:15.780
I can't hear you
guys by the way,

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.488
so if someone's asking
a question earlier

00:45:17.488 --> 00:45:19.459
I have no idea.

00:45:19.459 --> 00:45:23.403
So my question is, so you said
it's really expensive up front

00:45:23.403 --> 00:45:26.361
to invest in the Bay
Area for real estate.

00:45:26.361 --> 00:45:28.826
Would you recommend for
a first-time investor

00:45:28.826 --> 00:45:31.537
to invest locally,
or is it a good idea

00:45:31.537 --> 00:45:34.197
to invest in another, less
expensive market at first?

00:45:34.197 --> 00:45:34.780
BRANDON: Sure.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.930
This is a really-- this question
comes up all the time, right?

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.250
You guys live in a
very expensive area.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.340
People, when we're talking,
they say, well, I live in LA,

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.220
I live in San Francisco, I live
in New York, I can't invest.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.630
My belief is that within a
hundred miles of any location

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.100
there is good places to invest.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.570
Within a two-hour drive or so
you can get to a good location.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.774
I mean I know like Jordan
bought a property nearby

00:45:57.774 --> 00:45:59.190
that actually makes
sense for him.

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.070
So I mean, there's
places nearby.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.870
That's probably what
I would recommend.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.940
And again it goes back to
the niche and strategy thing

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.440
too, right?

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.584
So some niches might be very
difficult in some areas.

00:46:08.584 --> 00:46:10.250
Some strategies might
be very difficult.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.930
Like, I'm not-- flipping doesn't
work real well in my area

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.550
because prices are really low.

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:15.758
They can't really shoot high.

00:46:15.758 --> 00:46:17.679
But around here people,
make millions a year

00:46:17.679 --> 00:46:18.470
on flipping houses.

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.340
I'm not saying go out and flip
houses, but certain strategies,

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.020
certain areas.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.950
So that would be
my thought on that.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.700
Don't know if you
have anything to add.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.200
JOSH: No.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.304
I mean ultimately,
again, you can find deals

00:46:30.304 --> 00:46:32.220
whether you're in New
York City, you're in LA,

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.090
you're in San Francisco.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:36.920
Jordan, your property's
out in Sacramento, right?

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.680
So what's that?

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.942
Two, two plus hours?

00:46:38.942 --> 00:46:40.400
I mean, within a
couple hours drive

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.320
you can find good deals from
any city in the country.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.440
Now that said, from my
own personal experience,

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.210
the first properties I
bought were 2,000 miles away.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:50.660
Do not do that.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.050
Seriously, don't do that.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.993
Because you can't just get
in your car and get there.

00:46:54.993 --> 00:46:57.350
And I can't tell
you how important

00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:00.180
that is, at least when
you're starting and learning

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.247
about all these things,
and dealing with fires,

00:47:02.247 --> 00:47:04.580
because you're going to deal
with fires, no matter what,

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.020
in the beginning.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.620
And to be able to get to
those properties, drive by,

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:13.260
see that it's still-- hasn't
been burning down, or whatever.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.340
You want to be able to have
a quick and easy access.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.997
And other questions?

00:47:17.997 --> 00:47:18.580
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:22.556 --> 00:47:25.538
My question is [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:32.496 --> 00:47:38.460
I buy another property to live
in that I can then convert it.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.933
But now, each time I do that,
the lenders [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.522
Each company has to get smaller
and smaller. [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.850
BRANDON: That's a
really good question.

00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:58.650
MALE SPEAKER: Could you
repeat the question?

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.816
BRANDON: Yeah, I'll repeat
that question real quick.

00:48:00.816 --> 00:48:03.719
He basically said, his
first property he bought,

00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:04.760
he lived in the property.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.769
Then he moved and
bought another house.

00:48:06.769 --> 00:48:08.060
So he rented the first one out.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:08.820
Then he did that again.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.270
And you can do that a few times.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.750
But every time you
do it, when you

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:13.580
go to a bank to
try to get a loan,

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.895
they're going to only count
part of the income that comes in

00:48:16.895 --> 00:48:17.520
towards income.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.061
The bank is going
to say, well, we're

00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:21.750
only to give you 75%
of what comes in.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.445
So the more you buy,
the harder it gets.

00:48:23.445 --> 00:48:25.570
And this is one of the
really frustrating questions

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.250
a lot of investors
have, is pretty soon,

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.234
the banks start saying
no, very quickly.

00:48:29.234 --> 00:48:31.400
I mean, I got to, I think--
and there's also limits.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.100
Like, a lot of banks say you
cannot have more than four.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.610
We're going to cap you at four.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.506
And so these two
problems, right, I

00:48:37.506 --> 00:48:39.130
mean like they're
both kind of related.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:40.870
Banks will just
have a flat ceiling.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:42.120
You can't have more than four.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.897
Or your debt to
income it's called,

00:48:43.897 --> 00:48:45.480
which is getting a
little complicated,

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.950
but your ratios don't work out.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:48.360
Sorry, you're denied.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.769
What I say is,
for somebody who's

00:48:50.769 --> 00:48:53.227
got a little bit of creativity,
and you can work around it.

00:48:53.227 --> 00:48:54.950
But my favorite
method of doing this--

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.700
this is what I've done
a number of times--

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.940
is I work with a partner.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.981
We talked about partners.

00:48:58.981 --> 00:48:59.940
This is why I do it.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.690
So what I'll do is
I'll find a partner who

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:04.525
has great credit, great income,
he can qualify for a loan.

00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:05.900
He can go into a
bank, he doesn't

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.320
own any rental property, really.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.285
But he likes what I do, and
he's got what I don't have,

00:49:10.285 --> 00:49:11.910
is the ability to
get another mortgage.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:14.300
We say, OK, let's
do this together.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.350
We'll use your
income and credit.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:18.306
I'll find a deal, put
the thing together,

00:49:18.306 --> 00:49:20.264
and we'll just split
everything 50/50 later on.

00:49:20.264 --> 00:49:21.240
Doesn't have to be 50/50.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.948
You can get what you
need, and negotiate.

00:49:22.948 --> 00:49:25.146
But what that
enables is, the bank

00:49:25.146 --> 00:49:26.270
doesn't look at me anymore.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:27.282
They're looking at him.

00:49:27.282 --> 00:49:29.240
Even though I'm still on
title on the property,

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.323
it's just a nice way to
use somebody else's income

00:49:31.323 --> 00:49:32.454
and work together.

00:49:32.454 --> 00:49:34.370
You have to find the
right partner to do that,

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:35.490
but that's one way.

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:37.899
Otherwise we can talk
about portfolio loans.

00:49:37.899 --> 00:49:39.940
Portfolio loans are how
a lot of investors do it.

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.990
I got a portfolio
lender right now, just

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.129
a local bank in my area.

00:49:44.129 --> 00:49:45.920
And they've flat-out
told me like, oh yeah,

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.110
you can get as many
loans as you want.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:47.610
It's OK.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:50.270
We don't have a max, because
we keep them in-house.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:53.200
We're not selling them up to
big Fannie Mae Freddie Mac

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.650
institutions that cap
you at a certain number.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.529
As long as the deal
looks OK, we're

00:49:57.529 --> 00:49:59.445
going to keep doing them
for you all day long.

00:49:59.445 --> 00:50:02.410
JOSH: Yeah and the
portfolio lenders

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:04.060
is-- they're going
to look at the deal.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:04.870
They're going to
look at the person,

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:05.550
they're going to
look at the deal,

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.980
they're going to look
at the experience.

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.220
They're going to say,
you know what, Brandon,

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:09.939
you've been doing
this for awhile.

00:50:09.939 --> 00:50:10.730
I like the numbers.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.090
You're paying on time.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:14.110
This next property that
you've got looks great.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:14.610
Great.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:15.359
Here's your money.

00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:21.240
I mean you'll text your
agent and pick up a deal,

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.350
and then you basically send
it over, e-mail it over,

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.350
and so next thing you
know you've got the money.

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:31.280
I mean, it really becomes that
easy as you get the experience

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.950
if you're working with somebody
who sees what you're doing,

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:37.180
sees that-- but it's not going
to happen when you first start.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.750
But you want to definitely
search out portfolio lenders.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.050
They're definitely going
to be a great asset.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.310
BRANDON: And to find them,
in case you're wondering,

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:44.600
if anybody wants to know
how to find portfolio

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.315
lenders-- easiest
way, pick up the phone

00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:47.130
and just start calling.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.250
I mean I would
estimate-- I don't

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.240
know with these
numbers, numbers,

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.930
but I'd estimate 20%
to 30% of all banks

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:52.264
out there are portfolio lenders.

00:50:52.264 --> 00:50:53.638
That might be
high, I don't know.

00:50:53.638 --> 00:50:55.510
But if you call enough,
like, we interviewed

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.840
a guy a couple weeks ago,
he said he called 50 people

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.382
and he got one or
two of them to say,

00:50:59.382 --> 00:51:00.673
yeah we'll do a loan like that.

00:51:00.673 --> 00:51:01.790
We're portfolio lenders.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.300
Not all of them
use that language.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.841
They might not say
portfolio lenders.

00:51:04.841 --> 00:51:07.454
But the idea is, do you
keep your loans in-house,

00:51:07.454 --> 00:51:09.370
or do you sell them to
Fannie Mae Freddie Mac.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:11.078
That's what we define
a portfolio lender.

00:51:11.078 --> 00:51:12.480
So just call on all of them.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.975
Steer clear of the big banks.

00:51:13.975 --> 00:51:16.820
I mean anything that's national
or goes to different states,

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.820
those ones aren't going
to be portfolio lenders.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.650
It's the small community banks,
the credit unions, the ones

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:24.090
that you kind of see
in your neighborhood.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:26.120
They got a dozen,
two dozen branches.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.344
Those are the ones
you want to focus on.

00:51:28.344 --> 00:51:29.385
JOSH: You had a question.

00:51:29.385 --> 00:51:30.301
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.499
JOSH: Can you repeat that?

00:51:34.499 --> 00:51:36.290
BRANDON: Yeah he's
asking, do you recommend

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.020
holding your
properties in an LLC?

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:42.030
I can tell you I personally
do hold them in an LLC,

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.734
but I can't say that
that's necessarily

00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:44.900
the best thing for everyone.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.270
There are a lot of
different things.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.140
So we have to, you know,
use the disclaimer,

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.640
talk to your lawyer, find
out what works for them.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.160
But my lawyer told
me an LLC works well.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.110
JOSH: And I'm again not
going to tell you what to do.

00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:00.190
But some people will hold
single properties in an LLC.

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:03.630
Some people will take an LLC
for all their A-type properties,

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:05.310
take another LLC for
all their B-type,

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.810
another LLC per partnership.

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.770
Or they'll do-- I mean,
there's a million things

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:11.982
that you really can do.

00:52:11.982 --> 00:52:13.815
But again, you want to
talk to your attorney

00:52:13.815 --> 00:52:15.270
and your accountant
to figure out

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:18.930
what the best structure
for yourself is.

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:20.390
Anyone else?

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:21.580
That's it?

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:21.945
BRANDON: We'll be
around afterwards

00:52:21.945 --> 00:52:23.380
if you guys wanna
talk at all, too.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:23.770
JOSH: Yeah.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.103
Well, thank you guys for coming.

00:52:25.103 --> 00:52:26.260
We really appreciate it.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.301
BRANDON: Yeah, thank you.

00:52:27.301 --> 00:52:29.010
[APPLAUSE]
