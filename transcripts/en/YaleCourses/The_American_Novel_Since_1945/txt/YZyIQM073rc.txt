Speaker 1:          00:01          I want to start my lecture today. Looking back to that handout I gave you but didn't give you a, uh, a discussion of a couple of days ago. Um, from that essay, good readers and good writers that I quoted at the very beginning of class. Uh, this term, if you took the time to read that, what you saw is novakof meditating on how reader and writers meat.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33          And so I just want to read to you a little bit, uh, from that, if you still have it, you can get it out. The real writer, the fellow who sends planets spinning and models, Amanda Sleep and eagerly tampers with the sleepers rib, that kind of author has no given values at his disposal. He must create them himself. The Art of writing is a very few tile business. If it does not imply, first of all, the art of seeing the world as the potentiality of fiction. The material of this world may be real enough as far as reality goes. But it does not exist at all as an excepted entirety. It is chaos. And to this chaos, the author says, go allowing the world to flicker and to fuse. It is now recombined and it's very, Adam's not merely in it's visible and superficial parts. The writer is the first man to map it and to name the natural objects it contains.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Those berries are edible. That speckled creature that bolted across my path might be tamed. That lake between those trees will be called Lake Opal or more artistically dishwater lake. That mist is a mountain and that mountain must be conquered up a track list. Slope climbs the master artist and at the top on a windy ridge, whom do you think he meets? The panting and happy reader and they spontaneously embrace and are linked forever if the book lasts forever. So this is Nabar coughs, beautiful advocation of how writer and reader meet at the summit of this misty mountain of the imagination. But I've been suggesting to you over the course of the lecture so far this term that this is for many books, a totally idealized sense of how reader encounters it. And no book demonstrates that in quite the same way on our syllabus as Lolita itself.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Um, it's true that black boy was censored even after it, it was published in its abbreviated form, um, in the 80s. It was censored from high school libraries, but Lolita was censored at the very start in a different way and completely, um, if you read, as I asked you to do the essay at the back on a book and titled Lolita, you'll see as Novakof describes, he circulated it to American publishers, four of them, and it was turned down by everybody finally published in France by the Olympia press, which had also publish to other controversial books like naked lunch. Um, and Lady Chatterley's lover,

Speaker 2:          03:33          MMM Nabar

Speaker 1:          03:36          cough cannot meet his reader in on the misty mountain because somebody has to agree to publish this book first. It has to exist in the world before that reader can meet it. And the very fact of censorship. So the book was published by the Olympia pressed, and then it was banned in France and in Britain. It was imported into the United States. And several years later, uh, uh, an American publication was made and it rocketed to the bestseller lists. So it was a very popular book in the u s but it did have this history of being banned in Europe and it was certainly controversial here. Therefore, the mark of censorship is actually still on this book. The essay that you read was produced at the behest of his French publisher. They wanted him to write something that would make people feel better about the book that would give some account of its origin and give some defense for its publication and its content. And so we have it bound with the book always now. And so in a way you can say that although it's Nabar coughs voice and it's adding to the novel, nothing was taken away from the novel in the way that half of black boy was removed before it was published. It's still deformed in a certain way or influenced by the history of that censorship.

Speaker 2:          05:08          Now

Speaker 1:          05:10          I think it's worth thinking about what he says in that essay. And I'm especially interested in, um, this passage on three 13 about the genre fiction of, of pornography. So this is three 13, if you'll turn to it.

Speaker 2:          05:29          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          05:35          In modern type times, the term pornography, keynotes, mediocrity, commercialism, and certain strict rules of narration, obscenity must be mated with banality because every kind of aesthetic enjoyment has to be entirely replaced by simple sexual stimulation, which demands the traditional word for direct action upon the old rigid rules must be followed by the pornographer in order to have his patient feel the same security of satisfaction as, for example, fans of detective stories feel stories where if you do not watch out, the real murderer may turn out to be to the fans discussed artistic originality, who for instance, would want a detective story without a single dialogue in it. Thus, in pornographic novels, action has to be limited to the copulation of cliches.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Artistic originality turns out to be the murderer to the fans discussed. Artistic originality here is likened to the murderer of convention. It's originality that destroys convention. And here it's given that free saw of being a criminal to, he's suggesting the criminality of real artistic innovation. And by doing that, by using that language to describe artistic originality, he allies artistic originality with the figure of Humbert. So there's, there's, there are multiple ways at multiple levels that Novakof is defending his work in this. Afterward, he, for one thing, he insults the publishers. He suggested that they didn't finish the manuscript because when his, his manuscript turned out not to be pornographic genre fiction, they stopped reading because that's what they wanted. And they said, this is a terrible, put it down. So he insults the people who turned down the book in the United States. He ally's originality with criminality and he suggests that it is the, but now attention to convention that is in fact what needs to be censored, what needs to be done away with.

Speaker 2:          08:05          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:05          He also gives us few notice his little secret map of Lolita or so it seems as it's presented to us, his secret map of the scenes that delight him in his own novel. And this is on three 16

Speaker 2:          08:25          okay.

Speaker 1:          08:32          I find it Lolita to be a delightful presence. Now that it quietly hangs about the house like a summer day, which one knows to be bright behind the haze there, he's playing with the name Hayes and when I lost, think of Lolita. I off out seem always to pick out for special delectation such images as Mr Tech Sovich or that list of Ramsdale school or Charlotte seeing waterproof or Lolita in slow motion advancing towards Humberto gifts or the pictures decorating. The stylized Garret of Gastrin will go down, or the Kas Been Barber who cost me a month of work or Lolita playing tennis or the hospital at Elphinstone or Pale pregnant beloved irretrievable Dolly Schiller dying in gray star, the capital town of the book or the tinkling sounds of the valley town coming up. The mountain trail on which I caught the first known female of listed as sub love sub livens.

Speaker 1:          09:34          My, my Latin is bad [inaudible]. These are the nerves of the novel. These are the secret points. The subliminal coordinates by means of which the book is plotted. Although I realize very clearly that these and other scenes will be skimmed over and not noticed. We're never even reached by those who begin reading the book under the impression that is something along the lines of memoirs of a woman of pleasure. He says these are the scenes and I want you to keep those scenes in mind. Some of them we've already talked about, Andrew talked about the class list and gave you some ways of understanding those pictures in Gusto Guitars, um, apartment. So we've talked about those today. I'm going to pick up on some of those other scenes that he mentions as his secret points of delight in the novel. What kind of novel do we see if we attend to those scenes? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that essay, the product of censorship, the response to censorship, and I'm going to use it to read back into the novel. And I want to work with you to see what we can see if we use those scenes as our points of reference.

Speaker 1:          10:53          And so our task today will be to think about that second road trip in the novel. So this was your reading for today to begin at that second road trip that Lolita initiates and think about what happens to the novel from there to the end. Now the most conspicuous things that happen are an increase in the violence of the novel. He hits her, he pushes her, he rapes her repeatedly. We see more of those scenes in the second half of the novel. His style becomes more manic. It gets even funnier.

Speaker 1:          11:42          There are many passages of outright comedy in this second half, especially the shooting of quilty, um, this sort of parody of the climax of a crime movie. So there are all kinds of flourishes in the style, and Humbert presents himself as more and more of a hapless madman. You can see it in his perceptions. You can see it in his language. You can see it in the behavior. He reports as when he, uh, he vomits at the resort in Colorado when he thinks that Lolita has gone away. And then he sees her playing with the dog and he thinks, Oh, if only she would play with me. She's playing with a damn dog and then he, he, he's sickened by this idea. You see more of that kind of physical deterioration. He drinks more so he's getting very desperate. Lowly on the other hand becomes more calculating and it's this that I want to focus in on today. What becomes of Lolita in this second part, and I want to suggest if we turn to page two of seven in the beginning of that trip, I want to suggest that in the second half Lolita takes on the role of the artist.

Speaker 2:          13:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:11          If you'll recall.

Speaker 2:          13:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:15          The two of them have a fight over her participation in the play because he suspects her of deceiving him somehow either with boys or somehow with someone associated with the play. He doesn't quite suspect the truth yet that she has met a quilty through that play. So they have this big fight. It's raining. She rides her bicycle way into the rain. When the neighbor calls to complain about they're yelling at each other. So this is on two oh six two oh seven.

Speaker 2:          13:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:57          In front of the first drug store I saw with what? Melody of Relief Lolita's fair bicycle waiting for her. I pushed instead of pulling, pulled, pushed, pulled and entered. Okay. There he is struggling with the door. There's that physical comedy and I'll suggest to you that in that sentence, the pushing and pulling, you're seeing part of Nabar coughs, verbal play. It's not just sort of physical comedy translated into prose, but there are a host of other moments in the novel we're pushing in polling figure darkly. In one of the rape scenes, he pushes her into her room. Um, less darkly at the drugstore, the soda jerk pulling on the Levers of the dispenser. Look out some 10 paces away. Lolita threw a glass of a telephone booth. Membranous God's still with us, cupping the to confidentially hunched over it, slit her on at me, turned away with her treasure heartedly hang up and walked out with a flourish.

Speaker 1:          15:00          So here now we moved from Humberto verbal flourish to Lolita's physical one tried to reach you at home. She said brightly. A great decision. Has been made, but first, buy me a drink dead. She watched the listless Pale Fountain girl put in the ice, pour in the coke ad the Cherry Syrup, and my heart was bursting with love. Ache. That childish wrist. My lovely child. You have a lovely child, Mr Humbert. We always admire her as she passes by Mr Pim watches pip us suck the concoction she [inaudible] admitted. Hey Luca or moan does, who beamed Dubois. And in the meantime, the rain had become a voluptuous shower. So here's his verbal ecstasy as he watches her look, she said as she rode the bike beside me, one foot scraping the darkly glistening sidewalk. Look, I've decided something. I want to leave school. I hate that school. I hate the play.

Speaker 1:          15:57          I really do never go back. Find another leave at once. Go for a long trip again. But this time we'll go wherever I want, won't we? I nodded my Lolita. I choose sales tone do. She said Womblay wobbling a little beside me. Used French only when she was a very good little girl. Okay, I'll tell him to do now. How Popup Lenore or you'll get soaked. A storm of sobs was filling my chest. She bared her teeth and after her adorable schoolgirl fashioned, lean forward and a way she sped my bird, Miss Lester's finally groomed hand, held a porch door open for a waddling old dog keep hunting salt. Tom Lowe was waiting for me near the ghostly birch tree. I'm drenched. She declared at the top of her voice. Are you glad to hell with the play? See what I mean, and invisible hags clause slammed down and upper floor window in our hallway ablaze with welcoming lights.

Speaker 1:          16:55          My Lolita peeled off her sweater, shook her jammed hair stretched towards me to bear arms, raised one knee, carry me upstairs please. I feel sort of romantic tonight. She's juicing him in this scene, so the flourish passes from his prose. It's not gone from his prose, but in this scene very clearly it passes from his prose into her acting and Humbert reflects that her work in the play has trained her into certain affectations. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't exactly spot this one. She now is using the cliches of romance to seduce him into following her map for their second journey. Starting out on this second journey by calling forth all his mad love for her so that he will be in a sense blinded by that and not see her machinations. You see it again on two oh nine little later in this, uh, in this scene. His suspicion is, is aroused when a car pulls up next to them as they're heading out of town.

Speaker 1:          18:27          It's Dusa gold driving up next to them and he's asking who, who was it exactly that, uh, had been impressed by Lolita's acting, um, and Lolita takes him to mean who was the person in the car next to them, not who was the person that the person in the car was referring to. I was not referring to her. Who exactly concocted that play. Oh yes, of course. Some old woman, Claire something. I guess there was quite crowd of them there. So she complimented, you complimented my eye. She kissed me on my pure brow and my darling emitted that new Yelp of Merryman, which perhaps in connection with her theatrical mannerisms she had lately begun to effect.

Speaker 2:          19:16          Okay,

Speaker 1:          19:16          and I just want to skip down to the bottom of that paragraph. He gives her a kind of warning, which I'm going to talk about in a little while, but at the very end he says,

Speaker 2:          19:26          mmm,

Speaker 1:          19:29          the tour of your thigh, you know, should not exceed 17 and a half inches. She, he's warning her not to grow up essentially more. Might be fatal. I was kidding. Of course, we are now setting out on a long happy journey. I remember, and then look at the paragraph break there. I remember as a child, now this is not in quotes. I remember as a child in Europe gloating over a map of North America that have had Appalachian Mountains bolding, run boldly running from Alabama up to new Brunswick so that the whole region they spend Tennessee, the Virginia's Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine appeared to my imagination as a gigantic Switzerland or even to bet all mountain glorious diamond peak upon peak. This is the realm of that mountain of imagination that I was showing you in the, um, passage from good readers and good writers.

Speaker 1:          20:23          This is hummingbirds meditation on looking at a map and seeing a range in which imagination can have pure play. Now, as it turns out, and you, if you keep reading there, he's disappointed to find what the Appalachian mountains actually look like in the United States. He finds them much less romantic, uh, kind of garbage dump, a very seedy stretch of the world. Um, but what I wanted to note is how that chapter break brings us from Lolita's first efforts at motivating the romantic cliches. Her first efforts immediately pay off in transporting him into that mountainous imagination. This is how we know that she's got him. She's got him in the imagination. He, she's not just seduced his last full body. She has him fully under her power at this point and it's that chapter break that you can see demonstrating the fact. Now I want to look at page two 31 to 32 this is one of those passages that novakof points out as being special to him. This is Lolita playing tennis actually. So two 31

Speaker 2:          22:04          okay,

Speaker 1:          22:05          my Lolita, this is near the bottom of the page. How to way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second of vital web of balance between toed foot, pristine armpit, burnished arm and far back flung racket as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the small globe, suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean, resounding crack of her golden whip. It had that serve of her as beauty directness, youth, a classical purity of trajectory, and was despite its spanking pace, fairly easy to return having as it did no twist or sting to its long elegant hop.

Speaker 2:          22:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:58          And then a little further down the page, she who was so cruel and crafting everyday life revealed and innocence of frankness, a kindness of ball playing that permitted a second rate but determined player no matter how uncouth and incompetent to poke and cut his way to victory.

Speaker 2:          23:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:17          That pose the pose of tennis service, the raised foot, it's the same pose she uses to seduce him in that scene. I just read after their fight, I feel sort of romantic tonight. She is acting out a form in the first case, the form of, of, of romantic fiction, the heroine who swoons back in this scene, the form of the game, the perfect form of tennis. And he says she did a perfect imitation of top, not tennis. This is on two 31 her for was indeed an absolutely perfect imitation of absolutely top notch tennis without any utilitarian results. It's perfect tennis but she never wins and he reflects on two 32 had not something within her been broken by me, not that I realized it then she would have had on top of her perfect form the will to win and would have become a real girl champion. He reads the Non Utilitarian quality of her form as the evidence of her broken nature, but I would like to suggest that it's precisely that non utilitarian quality that is the mark of her wholeness in a certain way.

Speaker 1:          24:46          If aesthetic bliss is what novakof confesses his, his ultimate aim for art in the essay on a book and titled Lolita, something like that is what Lolita gives us in her perfect tennis form without the will to win the frankness, beauty, kindness, lack of deception and in that sense it is also a version of play of children's play, not competitive play, which is a different kind of thing but pure play and this gets us back again to that image of the chest problem that I was talking about in my first lecture. The chest problem is not in the middle of a game. It's a puzzle, but it has verts delight, a kind of solitary quality, both of the composer and of the solver of the chest problem. So it's not in the course of competitive play. And although he uses the language of competition to describe the relationship between the composer and the solver, it's not in that sense a competitive game as chess would be white against black.

Speaker 1:          26:08          This kind of self absorbed autonomous play of Lolita's tennis form is the kind of play that children have. It doesn't have a point. It's all process and form. If the threat to the work of art to the novel is something like convention, I want to think hard about what the threat to this kind of play is in the novel. And I want to suggest that the threat to this kind of play is parallel to the threat to children. The threat to children in the novel multiplies. It is not just Lolita who is threatened, but all sorts of children. So let's begin with another of those scenes on to 13 that novakof points out to us. The Kas Been Barbara, why did it take him a month to come up with the Caspian Barber? What's going on in this tiny snippet that's so important? So here it is in Caz beam.

Speaker 1:          27:15          A very old Barbara gave me a very mediocre haircut. He babbled of a baseball playing son of his and at every exploding spat into my neck and every now and then wiped his glasses on my sheet rep or interrupted his tremulous scissor work to produce faded newspaper clippings. And so in attentive was I that it came as a shock to realize as he pointed to an easel photograph among the ancient gray lotions that the mustached young ball player had been dead for the last 30 years. So the barber is speaking about his son in such a way that he seems alive, but in fact he's dead. So here is one dead child playing baseball or the memory of him playing baseball is alive with his father. If you look down at the very bottom of that page, you see a young woman far gone in the family way, had seated a wrapped baby on a swing and was rocking it gently while a jealous boy of two or three was making a nuisance of himself by trying to push or pull.

Speaker 1:          28:24          There's that wordplay again coming back to us, the swing board. He finally succeeded in getting himself knocked down by it and bawled loudly as he lays Hoopla supine on the grass while his mother continued to smile gently at neither of her present children. And if you skip over to two 15 this image comes back of this mother. All cars had disappeared except in station wagon. His pregnant young wife was now getting into it with her baby and the other more or less canceled child. So here are at least three examples of canceled children and you can use that phrase I think to characterize Lolita. She is a canceled child. Her childhood is stolen from her by Humbert.

Speaker 1:          29:15          In this scene. It is the mother's imaginative preoccupation in a sense that cancels her children. And you can ask whether she is preoccupied with the idea of the new child within her. You get that sense of pregnancy being an inner meaning or an inner significance, and perhaps it's a figure for what preoccupies her for the world of imagination and possibility. But she has that kind of distance, distant ETR, internal smile. This is the same kind of smile that Lolita is said to have this beautiful passage where he Humbert remembers Lolita's famous smile. That range is around the room, but doesn't seem to engage anyone. It says f her smile is the response to an internal imagined life. One that's inaccessible to Humbert. He says of her, he does not know what regions there were in her mind, what dim, adorable regions there were in her mind that he would never know, that he was denied access to as he raped her.

Speaker 2:          30:30          Okay?

Speaker 1:          30:32          And so children which have this potential to play are consistently canceled over and over again.

Speaker 2:          30:44          Okay?

Speaker 1:          30:44          There are other examples. Um, on two 23 we find out that Mona Lolita's friend from the play, her baby sibling were not told whether it's boy or girl dies. And we see it in one of those parents. Pheta acles two 23 this is Mona's letter.

Speaker 2:          31:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:05          Now that everything is over school play the Roy mass mother's confinement. Our baby alas did not live. It all seems a long time ago though practically I still bear traces of the paint again, that parent theoretical a aligns the death of the child. We're reminded in this scene of the death of Lolita's little brother. I remember Charlotte Hayes speaks in her letter of a lost son who died at the age of two. The bodies of children pile up, but other things happen to children to remember when Lolita and Humbert are partially discovered having sex in a field by a mother and her children gathering flowers. They're described as carved blue stone children.

Speaker 2:          32:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:02          And think about the name of that town, Elphinstone of which novakof again is proud Elphinstone, a little child of stone, a small figure of stone and the Elf like um, image is something that he applies to Lolita over and over. So what you see is children, Dad, children turn to stone and this is the dark side of that fairy tale quality that we see in other parts of the novel that's been coming back in our lectures. These are children turn to stone.

Speaker 2:          32:44          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:44          And it suggests if you go back now to that scene on two oh seven, two oh eight, as they set out for the second trip in the, in the middle of the, um, in the middle of the page.

Speaker 2:          33:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:06          Actually a little too, a little above actually, I was toying with the idea of gently trickling across the Mexican border. I was braver now than last year and they're deciding what to do with my little concubine who was now 60 inches tall and weighed 90 pounds. The threat against Lolita is growing with her body as she gets bigger, bigger. So he becomes murderous towards her. And this is a lied with his desire in a sense to crystallize what he has taken from her. And here in the middle of the page a little ways down my loves striped black and white cotton frock Jaunty, blue cap, white sox and Brown moccasins. We're not quite in keeping with the large beautifully cut aqua marine on a silver chain lit, which jammed her throat a spring rain gift from me. He has taken summer rain that the page before we are told jammed her hair, shook her gem tear stretched towards me to bear arms, raised one knee, her jammed hair takes that rain and ossified eyes. It makes it Lapidary, turns it to stone in the aqua marine and puts it on a chain lit and the diminutive let at the end of the chain doesn't really cover up. The chain itself doesn't really mitigate against the confinement he has perpetrated on Lolita. She is in chains and just because it's ornamented, just because it has the diminutive doesn't mean that it's not a chain, it's around her throat. That vulnerable place.

Speaker 2:          35:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:03          So if art as play is something like performance, something like an embodied art, the art of the tennis service or even the art of theater or film, there's another kind of art that is gem like hard cold, equally formal but dead blue stone children.

Speaker 2:          35:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:30          So this is the other form that the aesthetic can take. And I think that Nabar is consistently concerned about these two valence as of what the aesthetic can look like. So if it can look like the gem, it can last forever as Humbert dreams. At the very end of the novel he says, I am thinking of our oxen angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share my Lolita. He thinks of his account as that kind of enduring stonelike object and it may give him mortality, but it traps her there in, in mortality with him. He is as I'm as immortal as she is in the pages of this screed.

Speaker 2:          36:37          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:39          And so like the chain lit, it takes that stonelike distillation of life turning rain to stone, turning life to the representation by your tormentor. It turns into something durable that will outlast them. So the problem with art is in a sense that it is the immortal, that's the problem.

Speaker 2:          37:09          If

Speaker 1:          37:10          life is threatened over and over again in this novel by mortality,

Speaker 1:          37:18          dead children, Lolita, growing up inevitably painfully putting her at risk, her body grows. She can't do anything about it. That's mortality. The passage of time, this difference between the art that's lapidary and the art that's living is that the art that's living by very virtue of being alive can also die. So this is the problem with the autonomous work of art. If your dream as a writer is to make an autonomous work of art that has, as we say, in a very colloquial way, a life of its own. The book has a life of its own. We kind of, we'll say that about a great book or a great painting it lives on after its author's death. We use that metaphor. But the problem is that there's something about life that's dependent on the possibility of its negation. That's why on Valentine's Day you might give your lover real flowers rather than plastic ones. It's the very potential to decay that makes them beautiful.

Speaker 1:          38:31          And so the problem here is that novakof dreams of an art that's living something like the butterflies that he was so in chanted with in his life and work outside of fiction and the butterfly does appear in just one moment and it's during the tennis scene as Humbert and Lolita play, there's one butterfly that flits between them. It's a mark of very quality as artists in that moment. The Butterfly is the perfect work of art because it is both a representation and alive. It has eyes on its wings. It looks like a leaf. It is nature in its aesthetic form as imitation of itself, life as an imitation of life.

Speaker 2:          39:27          Okay?

Speaker 1:          39:29          Can you make a novel as he says in the essay that will sprout wings and grow clause in secret in his mind, that's an image taken from the metamorphosis of the butterfly within the Chrysalis. He wants his novel to be like that living butterfly. But the threat is always that it will be more like the aqua marine. And I want to suggest to you that the aqua marine has an even darker personal significance to him. When his family fled Russia, the only things of value that they brought with them where some of his mother's jewels, these jewels were hidden in a canister of talcum powder later buried in the yard under a tree in Europe as they move from place to place in their exile. And they were gradually sold off one by one to fund their life. Those jewels, I would suggest to you, carried with them the sense that they were the ossified remains of a radiant Russian life. And so the image of the jewel is a kind of dead childhood even for him as a writer. So where is newbark off in here? I think that's one of the places where Nebach off is

Speaker 1:          40:59          it's novakof meditating on this problem. I want to read that last, um, passage on three Oh eight that he mentions in the essay. Actually it starts three Oh seven. This is Humbert standing on the lip of our ravine by the side of the road listening to the sounds of a small town rising up to him. And Soon I realized that all these sounds were of one that no other sounds, but these came from the streets of the transparent town with the women at home and the Mentawais reader. What I heard was, but the melody of children at play, nothing but that. And so limpid was the air that within this vapor of blended voices, majestic and my newt remote and magically near frank and divinely enigmatic one could hear now and then as if released an almost inarticulate spurt of vivid laughter or the crack of a bat or the clatter of a toy wagon.

Speaker 1:          42:07          But it was all really too far for the eye to distinguish any movement in the lightly etched streets. Ice Did. Listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of demure murmur for background. And then I knew that hope that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita's absence from my side, but the absence of her voice from that Concord. This then is my story. I have reread it. It has bits of marrow sticking to it and blood and beautiful, bright green flies. The living voice is missing. What you get instead is the corpse of the novel with marrow and blood and flies.

Speaker 1:          42:57          Dolly Schiller aptly named of course for the German romantic philosopher who advocated play as a mode of the aesthetic German romanticism of the 19th century. Dolly takes on that identity as the romantic figure and she dies giving birth to a girl, to a baby girl. She dies in child bed. Remember I asked you from the preface, John raised preface to figure out who Dolly Schiller is, who dies in child bed. Well, by now you should know that's Lolita, so she dies giving birth to a child. She has taken on the mantle of romantic artist, but she dies giving birth to a live person, to modes of creativity, embodied and Lolita in that one act, and in that name she's giving birth to a real live thing, not a creation that is more like stone, but an actual person. And so what you see is not just the paradox of wanting your work of art to be a living work of art, to be personified in that way or made animate that then exposes it to mortality. The Woolworth's workers who don't read it and who think no one in the world ever reads it, that kind of risk.

Speaker 1:          44:37          Your book cannot live if it has no reader to meet it at the top of that mountain, but Dolly embodies that other kind of creativeness, human creativity of the literal kind giving birth to a child. I think it's telling that this kind of creation is a failure. It cannot succeed in the confines of this novel. Nebach off had a way of making an absence at a point of his utmost investment. For instance, in his autobiography, he notes the date and the phone call, the date of, and the phone call that tells his mother that his father has been assassinated. But he doesn't tell you until many pages later what, what it was that happened on that date. He says on whatever the date was, I think it's March 22nd when my mother received a phone call and then it just goes on about something else. It doesn't tell you what that phone call was. It was his father's assassination. Like those absences in other parts of his writing. I think this absence, this failure of any birth, it marks a sort of vanishing point of art that art somehow can't quite compete with the real inventiveness of nature and of human persons. He's going to try, he's going to try to give us a living prose, but this is the end against which it finds itself pressed.

Speaker 1:          46:25          Next week we're going to, or next time we're turning to a very different kind of writing, uh, writing equally preoccupied with its relationship to the world to life, but very differently approaching that problem. So try to think about that as you turn to on the road.
