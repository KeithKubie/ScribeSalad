00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.010
So I was recently at the
Google Zeitgeist conference,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.250
and I was riveted by a talk on
the power of female education.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.130
And the speaker says--
interesting line--

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.960
if you change the prospects
of an adolescent girl

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.730
on a big enough scale, you
will transform societies.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.250
In this hyper-connected
world, we cannot lose sight

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.655
of the feminine force that
graces our planet and lives

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.530
beyond the Earth in
the stratosphere.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.920
Throughout history, women
have broken boundaries

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.530
and transformed societies--
Rosa Parks, Marie Curie,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470
Indira Gandhi, Mother Teresa.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.230
Where would we be
if these women had

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.240
been denied their basic
right to education?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.260
When you educate a girl,
you educate a nation.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.340
Malala captivated
our hearts and minds

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.910
when she bravely stood up
for her right to education.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.130
But little girls should not have
to risk their life for this.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.250
The cost of excluding
girls is high.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.350
In Uganda, for
example, 85% of girls

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.680
leave school early,
resulting in $10 billion

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.240
in lost potential earnings.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.650
But by delaying child marriage
and early birth for girls,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.940
countries like Bangladesh could
potentially add $60 billion

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.599
to the national income over
these girls' lifetimes.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.640
Investing in young girls
can accelerate the fight

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.400
against poverty, inequality,
and gender discrimination.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.690
There's overwhelming evidence,
overwhelming evidence

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.840
that girls' education is
the most consistent driver

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.030
of development goals.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.040
Business as usual is not enough.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.850
And so on this day, as we
celebrate International Girls

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.950
Day, let us put
out that message,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.200
empower women, educate
women, connect women.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.380
Leverage emerging technologies,
bring them together

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.080
to create a network where
the sacred feminine can bring

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.852
that voice to cause a ripple
in the global conversation.

00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:53.920
The next time you see
a little girl, just

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.620
think, she could
be the next person

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.020
to change the course of history.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:35.178
