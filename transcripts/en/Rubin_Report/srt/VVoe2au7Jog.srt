1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,290
[inaudible] joining me today is the host
of pseudo intellectual on blaze TV and

2
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:12,020
the artist formerly known as
roaming millennial. Lauren. Chad,

3
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:13,040
welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,470
Thank you so much for having me.

5
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:18,640
I am so stoked to be here in person to
see things in real life. It's unreal.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,190
This is very bizarre because somehow
we have never met in person before and

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:27,600
people freak when they see you tubers
on the street and now we're to youtube

8
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:28,800
people meeting for the first.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,320
I know. I, I feel really weird seeing you
in three dimensions. It's just unnatural.

10
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:35,720
I feel like I need some sort
of glass between us. Yeah,

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,880
bring me back to my comfort
zone, but it's, it's great.

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,170
I,

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,760
I poked you in the shoulder before just
to make sure you're real because people

14
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:43,580
always want to touch me to be, if
I'm real and we are real. Okay.

15
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,860
There's a ton I want to talk to you about.
Technically.

16
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:48,920
You have done the Rubin report one time.
Yeah,

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,050
a little less than three years ago.

18
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,070
We did a youtube week where I was just
sort of reaching out to interesting

19
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:57,680
youtubers that I thought were
doing something kind of cool.

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,130
And you had a small channel I think
you probably had like, no, no,

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,150
maybe you figured out for
me like certainly thousand.

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,590
Yeah, I remember definitely before I had
passed 100,000. So it was the early days.

23
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,350
I remember I was so
nervous about that call.

24
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:11,970
I had to like put my
dog in the other room.

25
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:16,110
I was in my living room on my like
dinky little laptop and it was, I mean,

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,070
anytime,

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,270
I hope you realize you help
small youtubers so much
when you do those types of

28
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:23,430
videos because it makes a huge
difference in our following.

29
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,530
Yeah. Cool. Well I'm glad to do it and
many people helped me before that. So, uh,

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,980
so I had you on and you were sort of just,

31
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,090
when we went through the list basically
of who we are going to put on, uh,

32
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:35,380
your name came up a couple of times.

33
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:38,110
People had recommended you and I
watched some of your videos. I thought,

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,260
here is this young woman who's actually
making sense saying some politically

35
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:47,680
incorrect things and, uh,
actually doing something good.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,880
So how did that happen? What got
you into this crazy world? Thank

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
you. I appreciate that. Yeah. Um,

38
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,940
and I think I started off the way a lot
of youtubers nowadays are starting off

39
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:59,950
kind of just as a hobby,

40
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:04,300
something to do for fun because for
all that we rag on social media,

41
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:08,710
I think it has kind of created this
atmosphere where people feel like their

42
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,890
opinion matters and they want to chip
in and they want to contribute even if

43
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:14,220
they're not getting a lot of
recognition for it or money for.

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,250
So it was really just a way for me to feel
like I was participating in, you know,

45
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:21,700
the crazy amount of discourse
we were having. And so this was,

46
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:24,070
it'll be three years ago
in May that I started, um,

47
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:27,310
my first few videos for awhile actually,

48
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:31,720
we're just like those slideshow
presentations. My face wasn't in it. Um,

49
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,850
and my first ever video I think
was about transgenderism. Uh,

50
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,060
the whole idea of like transgender
versus transgender, you know,

51
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,950
the idea of many genders I think.
Um,

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,550
and for awhile I kind of put out a
video or two or a month just for fun.

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,000
And then eventually I started
getting more and more subscribers.

54
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,980
And after it wasn't even that long,

55
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:55,981
maybe eight or so months I was able to
make youtube my fulltime job through

56
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:58,560
things like crowd funding. And it was, uh,

57
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,200
it's been a pretty crazy ride ever since.
And you've watched,

58
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:06,430
you mature and I'm watching your ideas
sort of come together as totally been a

59
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,800
joy to watch. Truly.
Yeah. Um, so you went,

60
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,880
so first your name was roaming millennial.

61
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,630
Did you just feel that you needed to
have a moniker and not go by real name to

62
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,940
the biggest introvert
you could ever imagine?

63
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:23,110
Like I'm the person in class who
never really spoke up and less a,

64
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,660
the teacher specifically
called on me or you know,

65
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,720
attendance was part of the grade cause
I wanted to get the good grade. Um,

66
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,970
so I wanted to contribute,

67
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,610
but I think for a lot of
people who are maybe more shy,

68
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,710
not to mention the amount that certain
opinions get demonized nowadays. Uh,

69
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,430
you know, I felt like kind of being
anonymous at first it was safer.

70
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,690
I was less embarrassing. People wouldn't
really like attribute stuff to me.

71
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,100
I wasn't necessarily worried about
blowback specifically until like I got a

72
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,880
little bit bigger and then I was like, oh,
maybe it is a good thing that, you know,

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,210
my real name isn't attached to it. But um,
you know, roaming millennial come from,

74
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,250
I just totally made it up.
It was just like,

75
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,390
cause I've moved a lot and I was doing
some like HR research at the time from my

76
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,051
main job.

77
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:10,051
And so I was very entrenched in the
whole like generational separations.

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,600
Um, you know, millennials versus like
baby boomers, Gen Xers, whatever.

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,590
So had I known, I would end up
going by that for like two years.

80
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,670
I maybe would have put a little
bit more thought into it, but yeah,

81
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:24,160
people still call me roaming and
I'm fine with that. You know,

82
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,960
you can call me Romy or whatever.
I don't mind.

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,800
Definitely not the worst thing I'm being
called right now. Thank God. Listen,

84
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,250
I'm making this up, but I don't think I
am. I don't think I even knew your name.

85
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,190
Was Lauren until way
after I interviewed you.

86
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:39,220
I called you roaming and you just went
by roaming and I was like, all right,

87
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,600
look all around.
You know what's funny?

88
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:45,280
I feel like people who spend a lot of
time online or kind of social media

89
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,100
circles, that doesn't really
bother us. Cause I, I don't know.

90
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:51,970
You've had Rocka Rocka Alia on your show
and you know, I'm a fan of his love,

91
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:54,520
his stuff.
He's funny and a really smart guy.

92
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,980
I think people who may be just know
him for his music don't realize.

93
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,800
But then I realized the other day
like, wait, what is his real name?

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,160
I just call him Rocca. Well,
I truly do this very moment.

95
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,130
I cannot remember what his
first name that I'm fine with.

96
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,550
[inaudible] I don't feel like I know
him less as a content creator because of

97
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:13,960
that. But, uh, you know, I started doing
more like in person events and kind of,

98
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,360
you know, I was on Fox News and stuff
and that's when I was kind of like,

99
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,430
for people who aren't
in the youtube sphere,

100
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,960
it is kind of weird to just
go buy a moniker. Yeah.

101
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,320
So were you always interested in politics?
Did that, was it always saying that?

102
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,670
I mean you're, you're a fellow political
science graduate and political.

103
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,420
Yeah. So yeah, there's three
people that are doing it, right.

104
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,120
Shapiro was also political science,
Matt Christiansen as well.

105
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,400
So there's four of us that actually our
degree in your face. Everybody. Yeah.

106
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:47,350
I'm using my poly psy degree.
Uh, yeah, I've always been
interested in it. Um, I'm,

107
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,860
I'm not exactly sure what it is,
but I'm just interested in,

108
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,520
I guess the way society functions and I
think it may be stems from a desire to

109
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:59,060
want to improve things. And
uh, I feel like, you know,

110
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,650
every,
every job,

111
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,440
every profession out there is valid
and is making our lives better.

112
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,030
I just happened to be
interested in, you know, kind
of systems, governments, family,

113
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,840
stuff like that.

114
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,380
Yeah.

115
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,570
So tell me a little bit more about just
growing up before you were a youtuber

116
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,670
and somewhat public person.
You are half Asian.

117
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,940
I'd been treating you as a full white
person here. I hope that's okay.

118
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,790
You know, I have been noticing
that there's been some
microaggressions. Yeah. Yes.

119
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,760
Tell me all about your Asian privilege.

120
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,220
I am half Chinese. My father is from
Hong Kong. I was born in Canada,

121
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,620
but I,
when I was only a few months old,

122
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:35,740
moved to Hong Kong and that's really
where I grew up. Aside from that,

123
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:38,920
I've also lived in, uh,
Shanghai, Singapore in London,

124
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,410
and then I came to the
states for university.

125
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,750
So I've had a pretty like Kametra
politan mixed background. Um,

126
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
in addition to my like,
racial heritage.

127
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,030
And I think coming on to an American
campus for the first time was the first

128
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,930
time I was really made aware
of my race in a very real way.

129
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,550
Because growing up,

130
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,380
you're Asian in like Asian expat
circles is actually not that uncommon.

131
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:06,730
I'm not gonna say that
there's a lot of us,

132
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:09,730
but you don't have like quite a few mixed
kids in the schools that I was going

133
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:12,770
to like the American,
like kind of foreign ex schools.

134
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,260
So I never really thought about it.

135
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:18,190
I had friends of all different races
growing up and we got along fine. I mean,

136
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,650
I'm not gonna say that I was colorblind
because I knew like, oh yeah,

137
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:22,770
this person's Indian,
this person's white. Uh,

138
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,640
but it was never a point of
contention or anything like that. But,

139
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,050
you know, going on to an American college
campus, it was a whole different story.

140
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:32,920
And I think

141
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,600
that's maybe that, like when you
first noticed that difference,

142
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,820
it was a little bit strange because I
remember I was really excited to go to,

143
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,320
I'd never lived in America before.

144
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,750
I had been going to American
schools all my life. And you know,

145
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:47,780
I had so many friends that were American,
but I never lived in America before.

146
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,540
And I was really excited about it,
uh,

147
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,430
because in schools I learned
American history and stuff like that,

148
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,820
but never lived there.
So when I started college,

149
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:59,190
I was really excited to get the American
experience because it was almost like a,

150
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,611
you know,
it was the,

151
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:03,800
the place that movies took place in
when we're celebrities were from where

152
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,600
everything I read about in books happen.
So I,

153
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,870
I really like built it up in my head and
I was excited to get that experience.

154
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,730
But it's funny when I got there
and I saw my dorm room assignment,

155
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,600
um, USC, which is where I did my freshman
year, they have this thing where they,

156
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,640
they kind of segregate dorms a little
bit. Um, there's like a gay floor,

157
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,920
there is a black floor, there's
like a Muslim housing thing. Um,

158
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,210
and I went to look at my room assignments
and every single other person that was

159
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,190
in my dorm also had an Asian last name.

160
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,690
So I was in essentially the Asian ghetto.
Wow.

161
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,930
So that was kind of like the first
time where I was like, wait, what?

162
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,190
Because I had never,

163
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,780
I'd never really experienced
being stereotyped in such
an obvious way for that.

164
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,550
And maybe it maybe was just an accident,

165
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:52,100
but I all I know is that I never
volunteered. Like, Hey, Yep,

166
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,070
put me with all the other agents.
Um, I actually was an accident can,

167
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,530
right, right. Yeah. There's not
that many Asians at USC. Uh,

168
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:04,050
that it just like literally every
other person in that suite, uh,

169
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,070
there's like a thing, maybe
like 15 other people. Um,

170
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:12,690
so I applied for a room transfer because I
was like, well, I mean, no offense, like,

171
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,120
I'm sure you're lovely people,
but I,

172
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,880
I didn't come here to just live among
other agents. I want a, you know,

173
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:21,600
just a general mixed American,
whatever experience. Um,

174
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:25,920
and so that was like the first instance.
And then, you know, uh, aside from that,

175
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:29,070
I had, I was approached a lot by
people to join, like, you know,

176
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,890
the Asians in film club or
the Asians in this club.

177
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:35,100
And that's when I started to
notice that race was a lot,

178
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,450
a much bigger deal in America than it
was for me growing up in Hong Kong or

179
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,284
Canada.

180
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,690
So, I know you talk about
identity politics a lot now,

181
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,250
but what were your politics like before
you realize that this whole thing was

182
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:48,730
happening?

183
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,810
Well, I mean, I was conservative
going into college. I went to college,

184
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:56,380
Republican you, sorry, I college
republicans meetings when I was 17,

185
00:09:56,381 --> 00:10:00,070
so I didn't have really a moment where
I was liberal then became conservative.

186
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:03,610
But I, in terms of the race
issue, if it's even an issue,

187
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,790
I just wasn't thinking about it. Right.
I was just for like, you know, uh,

188
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:11,560
economic responsibility, lower the
budget, et Cetera, et cetera. Um,

189
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,300
I, I think it kind of,
it made me feel in a way,

190
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,330
I don't want to sound like an SJW,

191
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:24,010
but marginalize the way that they were
constantly bringing up my, my Asianess.

192
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:28,600
And I think that's what
made me more interested in
cultural issues as opposed to

193
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:31,660
just governmental issues
because I was seeing how,

194
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,400
how much of their philosophy was affecting
me in my everyday life. And I mean,

195
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,410
I have people who, you know,
on my channel, they say,

196
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:40,300
you're always talking about
culture and social stuff.

197
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:45,280
Why don't you talk about more policy.
And I mean, frankly my viewership,

198
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,570
I think it's 75% under the age of 35 and
for a lot of these college students or

199
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:50,770
people who have just graduated,

200
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,050
this is stuff that affects them
every day of their life. Like they,

201
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,230
they are bombarded in like social media,

202
00:10:56,231 --> 00:11:00,640
pop culture with your races this versus
uh, you know, your race did this,

203
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:04,030
you can't talk about this because
of your race. So for these people,

204
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:07,120
and for me at the time, that was the
biggest thing that was affecting us.

205
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,970
When you started doing the videos
then were you like, holy cow,

206
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:14,390
there is a world of people talking
about this? Because I mean that's,

207
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,950
even though I did come from the left,
so I wasn't always let's say on this side,

208
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:21,410
whatever that means. Like when I
started talking about these things,

209
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:24,950
I suddenly was like, Oh, I'm not the
only one. There are that many yet.

210
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,070
And now they're kind of growing.
But yeah,

211
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,090
pretty nice feeling to know
some other people out there.

212
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,230
It was, and actually, you know, I
grew up, well, I grew up from college,

213
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:36,380
like late teens onwards, watching
people like Steven Crowder, uh,

214
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:39,370
how the world works. Ellie Dorian, he
doesn't really make videos anymore.

215
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,090
By the time he was one of my favorites,

216
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:45,400
he did sort of the whole political like
debunking commentary thing. Um, and I,

217
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,620
I still appreciated that because
for so long when I was in college,

218
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:51,830
I felt like I was in a bubble
and I was the crazy one.

219
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:55,270
I was the only one with my, of opinions
and everyone else thought the same way.

220
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,740
So in making my videos, I did kind of hope
that maybe for someone else out there,

221
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,860
I could be that lifeline that
was like, hey, you're not crazy.

222
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:06,670
Someone else also believes this. You're
not losing your mind. You're not a racist.

223
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,710
You're not a sexist just
for thinking differently.

224
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,050
Yeah. What about, um,

225
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,930
just generally what it's like to be
a young person that's a conservative?

226
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,620
It's not the easiest thing. Uh,
and I think in conservatives,
especially right now,

227
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,540
we're so against the idea
of like victim hood culture,

228
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,020
but I don't think it's playing into
victimhood culture to say that it is,

229
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,880
it is difficult.
And you know,

230
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,420
not only am I younger but also
being someone who's half Asian.

231
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:35,460
And you experienced this because you're
gay and I have watched your Prager, uh,

232
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,340
Prager u show with Kennesaw and it's like
she experiences it because she's black.

233
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:44,341
But when you are not even conservative
but just not far left and uh,

234
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,990
you know, one of these
protected groups, uh,

235
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:50,170
that doesn't like fit the mold of who they
think should be disagreeing with them,

236
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:53,440
you get even more of an attack.
Right? Because then you're called,

237
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,180
I'm called things like an uncle
Chan, um, you know, kind of so on.

238
00:12:57,181 --> 00:12:59,000
This is called really terrible things,
you know.

239
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,730
Well, what is it that they want you to
believe as as a person with some Asian

240
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,950
heritage?
What is it that they want you to believe?

241
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,670
Cause it's a little bit different than
they were. They can say to gay people,

242
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,770
Assay,
we are the ones who got you right.

243
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,400
So you better bow to us forever or black
people, we're giving you this or that.

244
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:18,750
What does it cause Asians have been by
and large, extremely successful. Yes.

245
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,370
Due to hard work and family
and all those things. Yeah.

246
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,750
So what is it that they want you to be?

247
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,940
They want us to believe that white people
don't accept us. Still see us as other,

248
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,410
uh, I've had, you know,

249
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:32,400
progressive's tell me that the only
reason that conservatives watch me is

250
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:36,480
because they think I'm white or that
I'm trying to be white or that they're

251
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:39,720
tokenizing me and you know, they're
propping me up as a way to say, see,

252
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:40,441
I'm not racist,

253
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:44,220
which is really what are the most racist
things that I've ever heard. And that's,

254
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,020
that is hard. And I think we
see like with this, like our,

255
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,310
our oppression hierarchy, um, you know,

256
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:52,440
they still like to claim
Asians as their own,

257
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:56,400
but at the same time progressive's right
now we're happy to throw Asians under

258
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:59,040
the bus when it comes to something
like affirmative action, which it's,

259
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,490
it's been documented actually
harms Asians and it's,

260
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,080
it's really frustrating. Especially I
did a re a video recently on colorism,

261
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,030
which if you're, yeah, it's the
idea that it's not just race,

262
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,710
sorry, wait, okay.

263
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,940
Racism is like prejudice against different
races plus systemic power according

264
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,680
to them.
And then colorism is like,

265
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:22,890
we're talking more about skin tone so
it can even apply to people within the

266
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:27,780
same race. Um, so I did a video about
that and you know, frankly, I didn't,

267
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:30,870
I didn't even disagree with the idea
that colorism exists and that there are

268
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,530
some people out there who might prefer
like a lighter skinned person to a darker

269
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:38,370
skinned person because I don't think
either of us would say that individual

270
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,970
sexism or racism or whatever
type of prejudice exist, right.

271
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:46,950
Because people are jerks and
bad people. Yeah, exactly. Be,

272
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,720
um,
but pretty much my video,

273
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,760
I said that I don't think there's enough
evidence to say that colorism affects

274
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,230
something like prison sentencing,

275
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,480
which is what the MTV video that
I was responding to. Sad. And, um,

276
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,640
also that I'm darker skinned black
people get longer prison sentences than

277
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:09,210
lighter skin black people because of their
race. Right. I'm not just like there,

278
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,640
sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm pretty much,

279
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:16,400
I was just saying I don't think there's
really evidence to back this up.

280
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:20,150
And I think the conversations
around colorism,

281
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:23,060
just like the conversation
surrounding racism,

282
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,400
it's not so much a fight for a quality
anymore as it is to try and bring down

283
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,990
the oppressors or those
more privileged, right. It,

284
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,520
so the conversations surrounding
race I think has evolved too,

285
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,880
unfortunately,
demonize white people in a lot of ways.

286
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:41,400
And what we're seeing in the conversation
with colorism is that lighter skin

287
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:44,780
minorities are kind of being
demonized in the same way.

288
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:47,180
And that that's what my video is about.
Uh,

289
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:50,420
and I got a lot of people
quite upset that they weren't,

290
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:51,860
they weren't happy with
that. Uh, you know,

291
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:56,450
I was told to shut up because my opinion
doesn't matter because I'm not dark

292
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:59,840
skinned and so I wouldn't know what
it's like to be experienced colorism,

293
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:03,790
which is nice little bit of irony there
that apparently they didn't get. And I,

294
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,910
yeah, I was just, uh, attacked
for being, you know, uh,

295
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
uncle Chan equivalent,

296
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:14,780
just a puppet used by white people to
try and tear down darker skin minorities.

297
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:17,360
And it's just, I mean, I've
been watching your stuff.

298
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:19,550
I don't know if you're feeling like
this a little bit lately, but I'm,

299
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,830
I'm getting really pretty fed up about it,

300
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,860
fed up of being told that I'm not special
enough in terms of diversity points to

301
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,440
have my opinion, man. Yeah. Yeah.

302
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,410
Well, it's funny because I
think you know, this about me,

303
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:35,000
my general disposition is I'm fairly
agreeable and I try to be respectful and

304
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,760
all those things. But there are
these moments where I'm like,

305
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,710
this thing is so dangerous.

306
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:43,160
It's so out of control that there are
these moments where I just want to like

307
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,020
unleash hell on these people. Really
like take them down. I'm doing it.

308
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,310
I guess in a, maybe a
more casual, slower. Yeah,

309
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,630
I completely understand.

310
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:55,740
And it's funny when I started making
my videos I was so under the impression

311
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:58,700
where it's like, yeah, other people
face controversy and backlash, but I'm,

312
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,730
I'm so variable and like I'm going to
explain it in a way where they can't

313
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,600
misunderstand me,

314
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:07,080
where it's like obvious that I'm arguing
for more quality and stuff like that.

315
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,330
Clearly not the case.
And I'm still not a provocateur.

316
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,680
My goal is never to upset
people and I really do.

317
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,410
I'm speaking out about these issues
because I want more equality,

318
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,000
but I am at the point now
where it's like, yeah, there,

319
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:23,820
there are some people who are just
bitter and they're raging ideologues.

320
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:26,100
They don't want to listen.
They don't care what you say.

321
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:29,940
They're just going to demonize you based
on who they think you are and use your

322
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:33,210
identity to, you know, call you a
whole bunch of slurs. It's quite awful.

323
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,170
It is quite awful.
So I know we could,

324
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,080
we could sit here all day long and talk
about what's going on with the left and

325
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:40,960
how, you know, the, the oppression
Olympics and that whole thing.

326
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,650
Do you see any things on the
right that you're worried about?

327
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,130
Yeah, well I think, you know, politics,

328
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,160
it's almost a game of like back and forth
reaction and then action and then et

329
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:56,250
Cetera, et cetera. And so on the right,

330
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,640
I'm just worried that there are people
on the right who are getting so fed up

331
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,630
like I am where they're actually seeing
it for the example in the issue of

332
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,280
identity where they're
saying like, yeah, let's,

333
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:07,770
let's have our own identitarian politics,

334
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,130
which is completely the other way
of where I think we should be going.

335
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,070
And Jordan Peterson speaks out about
this too, where it's like if you,

336
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,290
if you don't like a game
that someone's playing,

337
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,380
you don't respond by playing at
yourself. You Stop, you stop the game.

338
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,730
And I think there are some people on the
right that right now are happy to start

339
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:27,540
to, you know, buy into it. It's like
maybe, yeah, we have like a black club.

340
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,390
We have a Hispanic club. Why not a
white club where it's like, you know,

341
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:33,930
you have most reasonable
people. It's like, Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, let's, let's calm down.

342
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:36,480
Let's, let's stop this. Um, so that,

343
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:40,620
that's something I'm worrying about
on on the right. And just in general,

344
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,190
there are people that are so entrenched
in the culture where right now I got

345
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,540
people mad at me.

346
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,541
I lost subscribers because I said that
the captain marvel movie was pretty good.

347
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,210
That's all I said was pretty good.
My brother said he was pretty good too.

348
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,083
I was like,

349
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,770
I was sort of wanting to boycott or
just because of that stupid comment,

350
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,410
but I know it's going to fit right in.
I know.

351
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,350
That's why I want to know
what happens. Uh, yeah.

352
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,770
So I said it was pretty good
and new people freaked out
and I just hope with all

353
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,990
of this stuff that we don't lose sight of.

354
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,220
The reason why we oppose the
authoritarian identity. Marion's, right.

355
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,290
We keep things in perspective.
It's not,

356
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,350
so we can have our own group that does
the same thing to other people. If so,

357
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:23,310
we can move past this and try to maybe
like calm things down where we can

358
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:27,570
actually talk about issues and policies
rather than calling everyone else and

359
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:31,740
not see or like, uh, I dunno,
whatever type of fascist.

360
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,310
So interesting to me because you can
watch videos that I was doing before the

361
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:38,090
election where I kept saying,
if you guys on the left,

362
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:39,600
and when I was saying it was,
that's right. I was like,

363
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:43,650
if we don't stop calling your rotor racist
and stop calling Trump a Nazi and the

364
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:46,380
rest of it,
we're going to create this on the road.

365
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,440
And it's almost like in a weird way,
that's almost what they want to do,

366
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,290
which makes people like us our job. I
guess that was more important. Right.

367
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:53,910
And I'm,

368
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,840
the only hope that I have really is that
the loud voices that you hear online

369
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,810
are not representative of
the average person, which I
don't think they are. Right.

370
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:04,940
You have that vocal minority. And I
think most people who are just, you know,

371
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,970
living their everyday lives,

372
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,120
maybe they have a Twitter account to
follow people they actually know in real

373
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:09,451
life,

374
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:12,870
not just like this whole political world
that we're wrapped up and they look at

375
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:17,190
both of these sides and they just think,
wow, you guys are insane. You're crazy.

376
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,900
Never stops.
Right?

377
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:23,901
Like every morning there's
another headline about some
gender related thing or

378
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,500
you know, this reverse reverse racism,
just like any old idiotic thing.

379
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:31,680
And every day I'm like,
Oh, here's another, here's
another. And then it's like,

380
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,940
all right, should we stop fighting
it and just let it be or yeah,

381
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:39,480
and you have to fight it. I get people
who say that all the time, like,

382
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:42,060
why are you still out
talking about like x issue?

383
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:46,140
How about you harped on this enough? And
I mean, on one hand I say like, yeah,

384
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:48,400
I like,
this is 15 video that I've made about it,

385
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:51,270
but on the other they're still
doing these things. So I,

386
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:55,480
I'm personally not even sure what
the best way to combat it anymore is.

387
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:56,470
Do we ignore it?
Pretend,

388
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,350
pretend it's not happening anymore
to not drive more attention to it,

389
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,280
but would that just kind of be being
complacent and letting them do whatever

390
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:04,870
they want?
It's a hard balance to strike.

391
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,810
Yeah. So you mentioned the culture
portion of this before. Yeah.

392
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,800
Tagline for your show is,
it's like your culture,

393
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,490
the intersection of culture
and politics, politics. Um,

394
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,940
I find that I'm not that
interested in politics anymore.

395
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:21,780
That the culture thing has become much
more interesting to me because the

396
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:26,010
politics thing is after.
Yeah. Well everyone says it's
downstream, right? That was,

397
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:30,540
I guess Breitbart's line. It's the
politics of masters from culture. Um,

398
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,730
but everything has become this,

399
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,830
right? Yeah. And it's, it's
funny because, um, you know,

400
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:37,180
I will have people who will ask me,

401
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:41,260
what do you think about this bill or this
policy? Why don't you talk more about,

402
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,340
um, something like foreign
aid? And you know, my,

403
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:46,360
my background is in political science.

404
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:48,910
I was a researcher for my
professors when I was in school,

405
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:53,650
so I am really interested in policy.
Uh, it's not that I'm not, but I,

406
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,450
I think that right now what's happening
happening culturally, this is,

407
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,420
we can't even begin to talk about what,
for example,

408
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,990
presidential candidates think about that.
I don't know,

409
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:09,370
domestic spending when everyone's being
called a racist or a sexual Predator or

410
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,570
you know, it, it's just,

411
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,790
it's hard to get too political talking
points when you first have to debunk that

412
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,230
you're a white supremacist.
Right.

413
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:20,110
And I really want to get to the point
where we can talk about those issues,

414
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:23,650
but right now we have this huge block in
front of us and I think especially when

415
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:25,000
we're talking about younger voters,

416
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,700
which are becoming a bigger and
bigger influence in elections,

417
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,920
so much of what younger voters,
you know,

418
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,780
what they choose to support is based
on things like cultural aspects.

419
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,090
So I don't think we can ignore that.

420
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,870
[inaudible] do you get a lot of emails
or tweets from sort of young lefties?

421
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,770
Cause I think every,
by default most people are lefties.

422
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,580
It's just when they're young.
Yeah, it's media and it's uh,

423
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,710
it's Hollywood.
It's the whole thing.

424
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,660
Sort of the default position
is your left and right.

425
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,420
I'm sure you're getting some 16,
17,

426
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:59,170
18 year olds that are watching your
videos and going, Whoa, maybe I'm not

427
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,970
okay. Yeah, well I'm actually
a pretty good it does.

428
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:06,260
And at any time because you probably
get the burnout too sometimes where it's

429
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:09,710
like, oh gosh, I've said something
and now people are [inaudible]. Um,

430
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,280
it is really encouraging to get someone
who says, Hey, I love your videos.

431
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,110
I used to be really this way,

432
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:18,350
but you've kind of opened my mind to
things and I don't think identify the same

433
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:21,860
way that I used to or even, and maybe
not even that, but just someone who says,

434
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,870
Hey, I'm, I'm a liberal, I'm on the left.

435
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,540
But I still enjoy watching your
videos for a different perspective.

436
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,960
And that to me is what's so encouraging
and why I keep making videos.

437
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,940
Yeah. Yeah. So what are some of the
issues that are on your mind right now?

438
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:35,970
So I've seen you do a lot
about the gender stuff, Austin,

439
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,320
where are you at with the whole
transgender movement at the moment?

440
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,790
Well, it's, it's funny because, uh, as
far as I know, I am no way a transpo.

441
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,160
I would never treat someone differently
or withhold human rights from them based

442
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,390
on how, on how they identify
or anything like that.

443
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:54,650
That's really clear about this.
So when they click this video,

444
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:59,120
so you don't have an irrational
fear of trans? No, no, no. I don't.

445
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:03,260
To be bigoted towards them. Were
prejudicial towards, no, no I don't. Um,

446
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,370
but I think the whole conversation
around gender right now,

447
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:10,610
it's coming to a point where we're
not just saying, hey, you know,

448
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,830
these are people with, uh, you know, this,

449
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,780
this medical condition
which had been diagnosed.

450
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:18,800
Like let's try to support them in whatever
way doctors think our best, you know,

451
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:22,470
let's make sure they don't feel
alienated. It's gone from that to, um,

452
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,050
not only is gender not a real thing, but
biological sex is also not a real thing.

453
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,990
And also lets a,
it's okay to give hormones to kids.

454
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,610
So the conversation has really,
really derailed from where it was,

455
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:37,820
I think even just five years
ago, which is, is scary to me.

456
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:40,140
And we do a lot of videos on the show,

457
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:44,240
pseudo intellectual about how the
stuff is affecting young kids.

458
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:45,620
Because I think a lot of people,

459
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:49,940
they may watch a video that I've done
about transgender issues or whatever,

460
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:52,880
and think, why do you care? Why
does it matter to you? Like this?

461
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,300
Stop butting into other people's lives.
And you know,

462
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:59,360
I on a person to person level,
like, I don't care what you do,

463
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:02,900
your body or however you
prefer to your life, go for it.

464
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,590
But this matters because of
systemic issues, right? It's, it's,

465
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:09,740
it's gotten a lot bigger than that.
We have, um, laws like in Canada,

466
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,490
they'll see 16 that may criminalize
speech if you don't use someone's correct

467
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:14,324
pronoun.
Um,

468
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,770
we actually have cases now where parents
are having to go to court because they

469
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:22,490
don't want their children
to be given hormones. Um,

470
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,700
so this isn't just,
this isn't just affecting individuals.

471
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:29,930
And this isn't just me being a jerk and
not wanting to use this pronoun for you.

472
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,560
Um, you know, I'm talking about this
issue because it's affecting I think,

473
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:37,310
individual freedoms and parental rights
and mainly parental rights because we

474
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:39,350
see this coming down
into the school systems.

475
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,540
So for someone that is
paying attention to this,

476
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,870
that's doing a lot of videos on
these topics for that very reason,

477
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,560
are you shocked how much trans

478
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,590
stuff is the only way I can put it?
Yeah. He's just constantly out there.

479
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,330
Like it seems so disproportionately
focused on it is absolutely

480
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,260
disproportionately what
you're saying. Yeah, no, it is
completely disproportionate.

481
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,480
And uh, you know, we did a video about
rapid onset gender dysphoria, um,

482
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,120
because a lot of us kind of
just observing might think, wow,

483
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:15,530
it seems like there are a lot more
trans identifying people than before.

484
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,580
Maybe we're crazy. No, actually that's
correct. Numbers have really skyrocketed,

485
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:22,280
especially among young, younger
generations. Um, so they,

486
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,940
they've begun to do studies and they
found that gender dysphoria actually

487
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:30,470
manifests itself, especially among
young girls in social clusters.

488
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,191
Right.

489
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:36,191
If there's a teenage or maybe
early twenties girl who's
now identifying as maybe

490
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:39,140
not a girl,
she believes she's trans,

491
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,590
it's actually quite likely that in her
social group there is another person

492
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:43,470
that's doing as well.

493
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:47,700
So this study I was actually looking
at whether it's possible that gender

494
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:51,930
dysphoria could be somewhat of a social
contagion there. Their phrase not mine.

495
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,380
Um, similar to things like bulemia
anorexia and things like that.

496
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:58,710
And they actually did found that yet
there's a strong correlation. Um,

497
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,250
what that means is that the
people who are saying, hey,

498
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:06,420
maybe we shouldn't be teaching this at
such young age or maybe we shouldn't be,

499
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,111
um,
you know,

500
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:10,290
glamorizing it as this like new
trend because it might affect people.

501
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:14,290
Maybe we are right. Maybe we're not just
being crazy and bigoted and again, why,

502
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,860
what's the big deal?
So they identify as a different person.

503
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,040
A lot of people might be
asking, um, well, you know,

504
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,100
becoming whatever you want
when it involves things like
hormones and potentially

505
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:30,690
surgeries, it, this is a big deal. This
isn't something we should be minimizing.

506
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,700
Yeah. Have you found it's hard to find
people on the left to talk to these issues

507
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:36,510
about

508
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:41,490
yes, yes. It's, it's very hard and the
response that I've been met with is that,

509
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:45,390
you know, you hate me, you're denying
my humanity, uh, you want to erase me,

510
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,373
et Cetera,
et cetera.

511
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,640
It's frustrating because that's no matter
what someone may call themselves at

512
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:52,530
the end of the day,
they're another person and I,

513
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,790
I would never wish them harm or
want them to be deprived of life,

514
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,290
liberty or property or anything like that.

515
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:01,770
And I would like to think I would also
want to be kind to them too. So it's,

516
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,580
it is, it is hurtful. I like having
all those doors close in your face.

517
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,720
Yeah. Are you as a sort of hopeful,
would I, for what I would call it,

518
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,490
sort of the new center,
right?

519
00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:13,820
That I think is sort of
conservatives like yourself.

520
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:16,580
Like there's just a younger breed of
conservatives that I think are a little

521
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:20,240
more tolerant on some of the social
stuff than the libertarian saved.

522
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,240
A classical liberal is the x lefties
that there really is something growing

523
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:25,910
right now. They're, for all the
reasons that everything feels crazy,

524
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,550
it's actually something really
nice taking root right now.

525
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,160
If you could just sort of step away
from the craziness for a minute.

526
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,340
Yeah, I think so. Um, you know,

527
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:38,341
it's very encouraging to see how youtube
as a platform has kind of played its

528
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:43,840
own role in furthering political
and cultural conversations
among younger people.

529
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,010
Wait, so it's not making everyone part of
the, Oh, no, no. Were you on that thing,

530
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:48,250
by the way?
I was on that thing,

531
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:51,670
that alternative and alternative
influence networks, which have no,

532
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,000
this is from data and society.
I mean everyone watching
this thing, but you know,

533
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:58,980
there was no scientific basis for
that study. All they did, I've been,

534
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,510
I'm sure you know. Yeah. We'll just
draw pictures to all of our names.

535
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:05,080
So you've been on my show. I've been on
Rogan show Rogan, talk to Sam Harris.

536
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,380
They drew all this picture and then the,
the study basically said we're,

537
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,880
we're turning people on
the far right. Yeah. Uh,

538
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,890
but there's been subsequent actual
studies where people have shown that we've

539
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:18,880
actually d radicalized a lot of
people in ways. So just bananas. Yeah.

540
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:22,330
And actually a temple. I know. I was
honored to be on the chart with you.

541
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,500
Thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah, I'm Tim
Pool for, I know you've spoken to about,

542
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,330
he was like,
yeah,

543
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,830
my connections weren't even real.

544
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:30,500
I didn't even appear on shows
with these people. And you know,

545
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:33,980
I didn't even bother to check my
little connections. What are they like,

546
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,350
they're not gonna care
if I was or if I wasn't.

547
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,070
I know that I'm not radicalizing
people, so it's like, Eh, whatever.

548
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,190
Um,
what are you worried that when things

549
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,500
like that come out and
then they put you on that,

550
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,490
that then we see the way these things
get escalated where then it's like, oh,

551
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,560
Lauren talked to this person who's in
a accused white supremacists and now

552
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:56,500
Facebook says you can't be a white
supremacist and be on Facebook,

553
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:58,410
but now you're that much closer to them.
Yeah.

554
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,700
And Ruben talked to this one
and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

555
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,450
So I know you've talked about, you spoke
about social media censorship before,

556
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,380
which I appreciate because I feel like
more people need to be talking about this

557
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,400
and the reaction that I get from some
people is that like you're paranoid.

558
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,610
Like you're just, you know, you're
seeing a boogeyman where there's not,

559
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:19,400
if people aren't watching your videos,
because I don't want to watch it.

560
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:23,570
Like people maybe just don't care to
engage with your tweets, whatever. Um,

561
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,180
you do get called paranoid when
you talk about these things,

562
00:30:26,181 --> 00:30:28,050
but then you have these lists,
right?

563
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,660
There's a list literally linking you to
actual white supremacists and then you

564
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:35,660
know, someone like youtube comes out
and say, they outright say, yeah,

565
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:40,340
we are going to be, I'm not recommending
extremist or conspiracy content.

566
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:44,630
And you're kind of like, well, I'm on
that list. Does that mean I'm mixed?

567
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,410
Like I don't think this is just
paranoia. Yeah. To worry about this. Um,

568
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,510
and you know, part of me, like I said,

569
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,660
they're going to say what they're going
to say. The other part of me is like,

570
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,690
wait, this does matter because
this affects who can see my videos,

571
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:59,690
my ability to get my message
out there and never mind that.

572
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,440
I don't want someone who doesn't know who,
who I am,

573
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
whatever being told that I'm a Nazi so
they shouldn't watch my videos and just

574
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:07,940
write me off entirely.
That's not a good, yeah.

575
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,910
Right. And you could also brush a lot
of it off your shoulder, but you know,

576
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,690
we're still people too. And it's like
when you go to get a slice of pizza,

577
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:17,180
if there's someone standing there that's
looking at you and they heard that

578
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:19,580
you're a white supremacist,
that's, that's no fun.

579
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,580
No, no, for sure.

580
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:24,960
And I think people who fling
these words at people online,

581
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:27,330
and I don't know if they
really believe it, if they,

582
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,360
if they're actually people out there
who believe that I am a Nazi and a white

583
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:34,140
supremacist or if they're just trying to
be, you know, hurtful and inflammatory,

584
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:38,900
but I don't think they realize how much
damage that does. Like not just to a,

585
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,800
you know, a platform or a career.
But just like personally, like you,

586
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:46,350
you kind of have to defend to people who
maybe know you in real life. Like, hey,

587
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:48,480
why people saying that about you?
Because again,

588
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:50,640
for people who aren't in
our crazy online world,

589
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,420
maybe they don't know that Nazi is just
another word for disagrees with you.

590
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,650
Right. Because I mean, if you told me
10 years ago that so and so was a Nazi,

591
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,520
I'll probably been like,

592
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,640
oh my gosh. Oh, now it's the
boy who cried wolf. Yeah.

593
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,680
And now every time they say that
about somebody or one of those things,

594
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,720
I start having to really,
I'd now,

595
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,930
even lately I've been thinking about some
of the people over the years that were

596
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,120
really called this or
that, and I'm like, man,

597
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:17,900
did I really not understand
what the actual truth was?

598
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,640
And the answer probably is yes.

599
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,590
Yeah.
And that's,

600
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:24,180
that's a scary place to be in if when
we're kids have lost their meaning,

601
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,610
because I mean,
I'm sure you feel the same way.

602
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,900
I actually do think being a Nazi as a bad
thing, like being a racist or a record.

603
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:35,880
Yeah. Like full disclosure, not
pro Nazi-ism, not pro sexism,

604
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:39,980
not I'm, I'm pro good things,
anti bad things. Uh, so like it,

605
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,750
it's hard when people kind of just muddy
the waters and it's like words don't

606
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:45,740
mean anything anymore.

607
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,100
And you were called the worst
things imaginable on a daily basis.

608
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,990
Yeah. So how has been working for,
uh, for Glen over at the blaze?

609
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,000
Cause that's,
that's all part of this conversation.

610
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,810
It's like here's a guy who was I think
unfairly demonized for a long time and

611
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,570
who has also said that,
you know,

612
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:06,380
he was part of the sort of cable news
problem in the outreach thing. Yeah.

613
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,980
But he's kind of head is mia culpa about
it and he's trying to build bridges now

614
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:13,130
and it's like I give that guy a lot
of credit. No, no one's perfect.

615
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:15,260
And we've all done things in our
past that we're not proud of.

616
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,420
Yeah, for sure. And I mean,
the thing with blaze TV,

617
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:23,421
what I love about them is that they
give us so much freedom and just control

618
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:28,110
over our product. So you know,
anything you see on our show,

619
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:31,110
which all the videos are up on
youtube now, which is another thing,

620
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,100
I'm happy for them there.

621
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,410
They've given us the freedom to just give
our content to the general public. Um,

622
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,380
is that we from start to finish
control what we want to say.

623
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:44,010
I have never been fed a line. Okay,
you have to take this position on,

624
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,490
on this topic and you can't say this,
don't like don't talk to this person.

625
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,770
I've not been told that. Where, I mean,

626
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,450
and if you're familiar with
how like bigger networks
operate, that's really rare.

627
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:57,210
That doesn't happen all the time.
And I don't think people understand that.

628
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,250
And I still get people all the time who
come to me. I'll be tagged like, hey,

629
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:05,580
like this person who's also on
[inaudible] said this and this.

630
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:07,770
How could you work with
someone that blah, blah, blah.

631
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:11,160
Or did you see what x person said is
like, I don't know what they say. Like,

632
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:14,160
and they can say whatever they want.
I'm going to say what I say.

633
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:18,120
And I think there are some people who are
so into purity testing that they can't

634
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:22,650
even imagine a network or a, you know,
a platform where that doesn't happen.

635
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,010
We're not, everybody needs to tow
the same line about the same issue.

636
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:28,260
And I think that like
it boggles their minds.

637
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,770
Yeah.

638
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,770
Do you hold any positions that are sort
of outside of what general conservatives

639
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,860
or cause I think of you a little
bit more as a libertarian generally.

640
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:42,390
I, I actually did go through my
libertarian phase in college. Um,

641
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,600
I used to call myself
a conservatory and um,

642
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:48,780
but now like with issues like the,
the border,

643
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:51,900
which I know is kind of even among
libertarians themselves are not really

644
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,950
together on. So like I, I generally just
call myself a conservative right now.

645
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,690
I don't know if there are issues.
Oh, I got one. The environment. Um,

646
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,890
I think there are definitely people
on the right who don't believe climate

647
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:09,210
change exists at all. I am
not one of those people. Um,

648
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,140
and then,
you know,

649
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,810
going even further that there are some
people on the right who do you believe

650
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:16,380
that climate change is an issue but they
don't think that government should be

651
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:20,710
involved? Um, I wouldn't be against, um,

652
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,171
I don't know.

653
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:24,360
I'm trying to think of like a green
initiative that I would support,

654
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:29,100
but just in general, I am sort of public
private combination. Yeah, exactly.

655
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:30,750
Because I don't want the green new deal.

656
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:34,220
That would be one of the worst
things that could happen just for,

657
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:35,940
for many reasons.
I think

658
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,100
that a freshman senator
never done anything

659
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,450
other than win reelection could write
a document that would reorganize the

660
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:45,820
entire economy is introduce
ubi as like a footnote now.

661
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,290
And you don't have to work in cow farts.
Yeah. You don't think that's a good idea.

662
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,221
Um,
but yeah,

663
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:53,100
that is what I would say that I'm more
environmentally conscious than maybe

664
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:56,970
other people on the right. Um,
what else? Also a, the issue,

665
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,180
I don't know if people on the
right are against prison reform.

666
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:03,960
I don't think they're against it, but I
think we don't talk about it enough. Um,

667
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,520
so I, I think maybe I put more importance
on that than other people along on the

668
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:12,880
right. Do we make this a Trump
guy ever do this again? Yeah,

669
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,750
I think I, I think I saw him on a tweet
or something. You can, um, the tweeter.

670
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,540
Yeah.

671
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,360
So I'm one of those people
who never thought that Trump
would win and I was like

672
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,210
unimaginable to me. Um,
but now that he has,

673
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:28,620
I think he's done a lot of good for
conservative values and I am someone who

674
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,280
will never defend what comes out of his
mouth in terms of what he said about

675
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:36,540
Rosie O'donnell or, uh, who was that? Who
is Horseface again? Which one was that?

676
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,760
Someone was worse face. Stormy
Daniels. Yeah. It's like,

677
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,710
I'm not on board with that,
but in terms of,

678
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,530
I guess what his administration
has implemented, I mean,

679
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:51,390
right now in terms of the economy,
black people, Hispanic people,

680
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:54,810
women, their unemployment
rates are at record lows.

681
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,760
I think that's something that everybody,

682
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,320
regardless of how you feel about Donald
Trump as a person should be happy for.

683
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:00,510
Yeah.

684
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,240
For some reason the
congressional Democrats couldn't
applaud that at the state

685
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,750
of the weird, yeah, that
was, that was strange.

686
00:37:05,751 --> 00:37:07,080
It's like I thought you were for that.
And you know,

687
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,290
never mind like black entrepreneurship
is also at an all time high.

688
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:14,670
And something that frustrates me is that
I get called like anti black a lot and

689
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:17,550
it's like, well, policies that
I support have led to this,

690
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,510
led to these people having jobs,
being able to start their own businesses.

691
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:24,900
Like that to me is the most pro
black you could possibly be.

692
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,960
Empowering these people to,
you know,

693
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,600
take control of their own lives and be
able to be successful based on their own

694
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:34,490
merit, which they absolutely have.
Have you figured out any tricks to,

695
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,140
to win over those young
people who are on the fence?

696
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,250
Like just the story that you can
tell or just a tactic that you have?

697
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,880
I think overall just being willing to
really understand what your proponent is

698
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:51,270
saying does go a long
way with some people. Um,

699
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:55,740
because I've had people comment that
I'm glad you don't try to oversimplify

700
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:56,730
things or you know,

701
00:37:56,731 --> 00:38:00,270
shy away from issues that maybe don't
make your side look good. Um, and again,

702
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:02,100
like I'll,
I'll bring about the environment.

703
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:05,600
I'm not saying that I absolutely do
not believe that the government, uh,

704
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,330
should be just putting all the money
into solar and wind in the hopes that

705
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:12,270
something happens. Um, but
I'm, I going to deny that.

706
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:17,100
I think we should be talking about the
issue of the environment. No, I'm not.

707
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,970
And I think just being able to have
that goes a long way for some people.

708
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:22,590
And then, I mean, of
course there are these,

709
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,010
these ideologues who you're never
going to connect with and I,

710
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,670
that's something that I've had to come
to terms with that some people just don't

711
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:32,430
want to listen and there's nothing you
can say that was going to change their

712
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:36,460
mind. But for a lot of people, I think
they understand when someone's being,

713
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,820
or at least trying to be
rational and reasonable.

714
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,641
Yeah.
So,

715
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,760
even though you've bounced around the
world and you've done your roaming thing,

716
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:44,500
you're,
you're based in Canada now.

717
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Is it weird to you sometimes to think
how much of what you think about and talk

718
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:54,430
about and focus on is actually
all coming from another country?

719
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,591
Well,
it's funny,

720
00:38:55,591 --> 00:38:59,790
I have people all the time we say like
why you always talking about American

721
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,460
politics? I don't really talk
about politics that much.

722
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,010
I'm kind of like you go to the culture.
Yeah.

723
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:07,320
I goes to the culture and I had someone,

724
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,640
I made a comment about the Hashtag my
white privilege thing that was going

725
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:15,070
around and I was told to stay
out of American politics in my,

726
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,710
my sponsor was like, how is
this American politics? Um,

727
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,100
cause these cultural issues,

728
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:23,490
they don't end at borders because the
internet doesn't end up borders, right?

729
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:26,160
This online presence
doesn't end at borders.

730
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:30,960
So especially when I'm talking
about issues like a gender
or race, where we have,

731
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:33,960
are extremely liberal government
that's actually putting these kinds of

732
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:35,130
ideologies into law.

733
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,700
I think I'm absolutely talking about
something that applies to my country.

734
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:40,350
And I think it's something that,

735
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,250
it's funny like maybe some of these
Americans who are on the left,

736
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:48,630
they're trying to tell me to butt out. Um,
if I were perhaps, I mean this is like,

737
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:51,900
it's all, all conversation, but if I
were perhaps an undocumented immigrant,

738
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,190
they maybe were, it wouldn't be so, uh,
like anti foreign. Um, but also I just,

739
00:39:56,191 --> 00:40:00,960
I think that some people need
to recognize that culture is,

740
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,040
it doesn't stop at borders.
And so like these issues affect Canadians.

741
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:09,120
These issues affect Brits and my,
my breakdown of who watches my show,

742
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:13,440
it's like about 60% Americans. Um, but
then I had like a good 10% Canadians,

743
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:17,490
10% of Brits, and you know, the rest
of the angles sphere, the Australian.

744
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:19,350
So these really are global issues.

745
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,480
So basically you're in
California right now.

746
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,620
If we could get you to overstay
your visa or something. Not Easy.

747
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,070
You're just busy visiting.
Yeah.

748
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,610
We just get you to cancel your
return flight and then just,

749
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,580
you just hide out here.
We'll make you an illegal immigrant.

750
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:37,180
And then you could argue as an illegal
and then maybe they will listen to me.

751
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,620
You'll see how quickly they turn against.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That will be,

752
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,450
I have thought about that before, but
now I'm just, I'm just kidding. Yeah.

753
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:47,380
That will, that will not go over well.
Yeah. Um, what are some of the other, oh,

754
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:50,680
so you mentioned that my white
privilege Hashtag that was going around.

755
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,770
So for people that have no idea for the
people that are saying enough not to be

756
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:57,380
on Twitter,
why those people by white privilege,

757
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,440
this Hashtag that was started on
Twitter and it ended up trending. Um,

758
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,190
and it was metaphor,

759
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:07,080
just white people to check their privilege
to mention instances or maybe trends

760
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:10,200
they've noticed that are
due to their whiteness,

761
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,650
a privilege that they know that a
non white person would not get. Yeah.

762
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,820
And the thing is like,
I don't deny the idea of privilege exists.

763
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:22,200
Like I coming from a two parent household,
I've lived a lot of places.

764
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:23,070
I've gone to good schools.

765
00:41:23,071 --> 00:41:26,160
I absolutely acknowledge that I've had
privileges that a lot of people haven't

766
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:27,420
had. You know, that's,

767
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,290
is that privilege or is that just life
experience? You've had a life experience.

768
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,110
They're

769
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,330
kind of, they're kind interchangeable.
Like I don't have systemic privilege,

770
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,250
but I've had,
you know,

771
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:40,490
things that afforded to me in my life
that other people haven't had and life's

772
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:44,630
not fair and I don't think anyone
would dispute that life isn't fair. Um,

773
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,880
and that's that. But I think, you know,

774
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:50,030
the idea when other people
mentioned white privilege,

775
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,690
they're talking about the idea that
for white people, um, you know,

776
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:58,040
their skin color affords them certain
privileges that non white people don't

777
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:01,790
have. Um, and I think that's a very,
very toxic mentality. And if you,

778
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,720
I was reading some of those tweets and
just like blood pressure just raising

779
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:09,950
through the roof as painful to read some
of them. It really is self flagellation.

780
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,050
Yeah. Oh my gosh. It's like the,

781
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,860
you can kind of like almost imagine these
like white progressive's like on their

782
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:18,900
knees trying to grovel down before
they're non white friends and like,

783
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:21,200
apologize for the whiteness
of their skin. It's, it's,

784
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,750
it's depressing and embarrassing to watch,
I think. And you know, they talk about,

785
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:30,650
they like I got pulled over by a cop and
then he didn't give me a ticket Hashtag

786
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:35,630
my white privilege. And it's like, well, I
mean sometimes cops, like I personally, I,

787
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,300
I've never been pulled
over and knock on a ticket.

788
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:42,200
I've only gotten a ticket ones, but it's
like I've never been given that kind of,

789
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,850
you know, leeway a, you know,

790
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:47,810
I've had teachers maybe who were
a little more lenient for me.

791
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:51,050
Is that because I'm white or is it because
of my female or was it because I'm a

792
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:51,860
good student?

793
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,540
There's where we are so keen to attribute
motive to people and like it just

794
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,160
reinforces this idea that yeah,

795
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:02,630
white people are privileged and it's
annoying because now merely denying the

796
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:05,630
existence of white privilege
makes you a racist and a bigot.

797
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,190
Do you think it's fair to say that
these people are the new racist?

798
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,320
Like if I was to really pick like,

799
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:14,750
I don't like doing this because you
said something before you don't want to

800
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:16,520
become yeah.
While you're fighting against.

801
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,060
So I don't want to start walking
around and, and labeling these people,

802
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:23,600
read racists and all of the things that
they have no problem labeling the rest

803
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:28,190
of us. But if you were to ask me where
does racism come from in America today,

804
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:33,110
it is coming from the left. If were
to sexism come from in America today,

805
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,910
all CIS gendered White Christian men or
this or white people are this, these are,

806
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:42,590
these are leftist ideas that aren't
just like ephemeral things happening on

807
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:44,030
Twitter.
These are things that they're,

808
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:47,720
that the lefty politicians are talking
about, the presidential candidates for,

809
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:51,650
the Democrats are talking about. Yeah.
So that's why it's so dangerous to me.

810
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,900
Yeah. And I agree with
that. And I wouldn't know.

811
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,580
I have friends who are on the
left and progressive, um, who are,

812
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,220
who I do think at the end
of the day want to quality.

813
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,460
I think we have different ideas about
how to get there. Um, so, you know,

814
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:06,760
I wouldn't just base on someone being
a progressive, call them racist.

815
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:07,900
But I think if you,

816
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,760
if you are someone who thinks that
because of the color of their skin,

817
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:17,761
someone is not entitled to have an opinion
about a certain issue that is racist.

818
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:20,470
If you, if you are someone
who thinks that you know,

819
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,650
this person because of their skin color
is entitled to either more or less of a,

820
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:30,640
of a starting point or a advantage or
disadvantage, then you are a racist.

821
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:35,250
And I think historically generally kind
of been the agreed upon definition of

822
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:38,340
racist. So yeah, like there's
no reverse racism. It's just

823
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,850
racism. Yes. Racism. I was talking
to somebody of a progressive, uh,

824
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,870
who's a family friend and we
were getting into it and I said,

825
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:48,270
are you for affirmative
action that she said, yes,

826
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:50,880
we have to help minorities
get more jobs on that. I said,

827
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:55,140
are you for discriminating
against white people? And she
said, no. And I said, well,

828
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:59,610
how do you do? How do you negotiate?
How do you reconcile those two things?

829
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,580
And I said, well, what about your
kids? You, she has three kids. I said,

830
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:05,850
well what about your kids? Do you
think your kids happened to be white?

831
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,850
Do you think that everything being equal,

832
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:12,780
if they're going up against the minority,
they should not get the job.

833
00:45:12,781 --> 00:45:13,710
And she was like,
well no,

834
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,170
because then you have to take it on
a case by case basis. And I said,

835
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:21,171
well you just made different
first argument but they
can't quite get over that

836
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,600
sort of disconnect. And that's what
I think we have to keep doing to,

837
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,453
to get them there,

838
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,920
to make them realize. I think,
I think you're absolutely right.

839
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,970
And I think for a lot of progressives
they do think that they're doing the right

840
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:37,180
thing. Almost, maybe even a little
bit of a white savior complex.

841
00:45:37,181 --> 00:45:40,390
I would say they need to come
in and rescue them. But, um,

842
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,390
when it comes to like
affirmative action specifically,

843
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,630
it frustrates me that so many people on
the left are keen to conflate class with

844
00:45:49,151 --> 00:45:51,910
race. Um, you know, cause they'll
say like, oh well, you know,

845
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:55,000
for black kids they don't have the
same resources growing up in schools.

846
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:57,280
And it's like, well, hang
on. I went to good schools,

847
00:45:57,281 --> 00:46:00,910
we had some black kids
that were definitely richer
than my family or you know,

848
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,660
like vice versa and it's like sellout.
Yeah.

849
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,540
It's like if you want to
have a conversation about
class in school funding,

850
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,310
then let's have that.
Which I actually, you know,

851
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:13,720
I think one of the privileges that is
kind of undeniable is that some kids are

852
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:16,980
afforded more luxuries in their schools
or whatever than other kids, you know,

853
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:19,540
in an inner city kid is not going to
have the same education or whatever.

854
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,290
So let's try to address that and say how
we can improve the inner city schools

855
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:26,790
and stuff. That's where you'd have
the conversation. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

856
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,790
Mentoree school in Beverly Hills.
Guess what?

857
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:30,860
It's way more funded
than the average school.

858
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,830
The teachers have different
classifications. So how do
you deal with that? Okay,

859
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:37,920
yeah. Then that's a good starting spot.
But unfortunately that's not this. No,

860
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,840
because then they want to
make it all about race.

861
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:43,290
And it's like that distinction matters
because how we see the problem affects

862
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:45,500
how we assault, how we
solve the problem. Um,

863
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,390
so it's like you and I can't just kind of
go to them and it's like, Hey, here are,

864
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,660
you know, proposals for like,
uh, budgets or you know,

865
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:53,220
how to deal with teacher's unions,
whatever.

866
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:56,730
For the schools when they see
the problem as systemic racism,

867
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,280
like you're not gonna get anywhere
with people like that. And it's,

868
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:03,530
it's frustrating because like
that whole narrative and I,

869
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,800
I get flack, I get accused of like, oh,
you don't really care about, you know,

870
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:09,990
the black community or whatever.
You're just kind of like, you're,

871
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,650
you just like to say whatever racist
stuff you want. And it's like, no,

872
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:17,580
I am trying to [inaudible] I make videos
trying to talk about, you know, the,

873
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,280
the importance of fathers and families,
you know,

874
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:23,640
how important it is to have economic
freedoms that really allow people to

875
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:24,600
succeed.
It's like,

876
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:29,380
that actually is what I think would be
most useful to vulnerable communities of

877
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:34,060
whatever color. There's a ton of evidence
that supports that. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

878
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:34,900
But it's like they don't,

879
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,890
because it doesn't feed into the
narrative of systemic racism.

880
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,130
They don't even want to hear it. And they,
they accuse you of not wanting to help.

881
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,180
How much of this

882
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,420
do you think is just for
young people especially? Um,

883
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,920
it's just the excesses
of the West that we have.

884
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,570
Things have gone so well for us now
for so long. If you live in America,

885
00:47:55,571 --> 00:48:00,460
you're basically free. You are free,
you may have problems, but you are free.

886
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,440
You live in the freest society ever.

887
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:07,690
And that young people now who can play
fort night all day long or watch porn or

888
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:10,420
whatever the hell else there is to
do or play video games or whatever,

889
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,110
it's like they now have to
find problems with everything.

890
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:16,240
And what's the easiest thing to
do once you find the problem?

891
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,350
It's just to burn the whole system down,
not to actually acknowledge that, Whoa,

892
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:23,140
this took a lot of blood, sweat,
and tears of generations before you.

893
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,280
Yeah.
That's such a good point.

894
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:28,810
And not only are people free in the u s
they are economically prosperous by any

895
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:29,300
metric.

896
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,830
You take someone who's living in poverty
in the United States and you compare it

897
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:36,460
to a global level is still doing
pretty dang well. You know,

898
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,950
someone who grew up in Southeast Asia,
you know,

899
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:41,140
Hong Kong and Singapore are
very prosperous countries,

900
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:44,230
but I visited to places like Indonesia
and Thailand where they're like,

901
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:47,230
that actually is structural
poverty. So, you know,

902
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,990
I'm able to recognize how privileged
we are just to be in the west. Um,

903
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,640
and I think a lot of millennials now,

904
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,490
they been painted a picture
where capitalism has failed,

905
00:48:57,491 --> 00:49:00,850
the American dream is dead.
AOC says that all the time.

906
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:03,670
Like we're living in of like, you know,
all the billionaires have all the money,

907
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:07,540
the working class, we're screwed. We
don't have anything that's not true.

908
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,490
And that's not to say that issues like
high tuition don't exist and stuff. Yeah,

909
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,680
absolutely they do.
We should talk about it.

910
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:19,860
But overall we are living in such
tremendous affluence and prosperity and

911
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,120
equality that the fact that there
are people, you know, saying, no,

912
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,940
this is so broken, we need to start
all over and tear it all down.

913
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:31,930
It like freaks me out.
Can you move to New York,

914
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,600
run against AOC and what do I,
what do I have to do to him?

915
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,110
I don't think the fund has some
campaign finance. What are we talking?

916
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:41,320
It would take a lot of campaign finance
to get me to New York. I tell you that.

917
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,790
Not my favorite city,

918
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:47,320
but I mean I think even
people are starting to wake
up to the fact like we had

919
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:51,340
the whole Amazon Toboco right? Um,
and at the end of the day, like, yeah,

920
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:54,340
people love the sort of like socialist,
populous rhetoric,

921
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,610
but you know what else they love is
just actual jobs. And so when, you know,

922
00:49:57,611 --> 00:49:59,890
when we had Amazon being chased away,
we did have like,

923
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:04,780
angry New Yorkers being like,
okay, but wait, 25,000 jobs. Yeah.

924
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:08,470
Like I, everyone loves Amazon.
It's actually gets there fast.

925
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,790
Even if you don't work for Amazon,

926
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,900
you get to be part of like the growing
economy surrounding and providing support

927
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:18,790
to that, to that business. Uh, I think
people are, at the end of the day,

928
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:22,120
what they want more than
anything else is jobs. And like,

929
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:25,790
not necessarily the promise that I don't
think is even possible to provide of

930
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,620
like, oh, just all the, all
this free stuff. At least
that's what I'm hoping for a,

931
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:35,240
but it is, it is really, I don't
know, depressing, frustrating,

932
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,070
sad,
whatever negative.

933
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:41,120
Where do you want to use a to
see a generation of millennials,

934
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,390
socialists or communists, whatever. Um,

935
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,100
completely misrepresent the environment
that we are living in now and not

936
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:50,330
recognize how lucky they are.

937
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,320
Yeah,
we got to wake these people up,

938
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:54,150
but I guess I guess you're
doing a pretty good job.

939
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,871
Well, I, you know,

940
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:58,140
I've read people suggest we should have
some sort of like internships study

941
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:00,360
abroad program where we just send people,
you know,

942
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:02,490
these progressive mainly white,

943
00:51:02,491 --> 00:51:05,700
rich millennials to places like
Venezuela or just like, you know,

944
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:09,810
foreign places where they can maybe see
a little bit more of the outside world

945
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:12,060
beyond their bubbles or what
they've been fed to really,

946
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:16,380
really see how the u s stands or the West
in general compared to other countries.

947
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,140
W what do you make of
the free college thing?

948
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,450
I suspect you're not for
free college generally,

949
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:25,250
but what about just college
as an institution because
of the brainwashing that's

950
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:28,730
going on or you even for young
people going to college at this?

951
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,100
I have so many feet cause you know,
I'm someone who I really,

952
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:35,970
I worked my butt off when I was in
high school to kind of get to the best

953
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:39,120
college that I could. Um, I, I
took it really, really seriously.

954
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:42,480
When I was in college. I worked
for my professors. Uh, you know,

955
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:44,580
all my friends were in academia.
Uh,

956
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:48,090
it was kind of like assumed because I
was in that world that I would go on and

957
00:51:48,091 --> 00:51:52,440
have my master's and stuff. And I have
a lot of respect for academia. Um,

958
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,950
but at the state, and I would
never say that college is useless,

959
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:57,600
but at the same time,

960
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,440
I think we're reaching
a point now where a,

961
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,370
so, so much of what colleges do
now is not really instruction,

962
00:52:05,371 --> 00:52:10,080
but it's indoctrination and be
the return on a college degree.

963
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:15,081
Especially if you're taking something
like a gender studies or feminist theories

964
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,790
degree or whatever it may be.
The, the return is not worth it.

965
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,860
Can I get a job with
lesbian badminton degree?

966
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,270
I mean,
as buzzfeed hiring,

967
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,870
that's essentially the only place that
I would know what it would look at it.

968
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:28,120
But I think we,

969
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,180
we need to kind of reevaluate how
we see college because you know,

970
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,930
other countries they have really,

971
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:38,620
they have things like a trade schools
and things like that where, you know,

972
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:42,340
it's not anti-education cause I'm not
anti-education I'm always pro education.

973
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:46,720
More knowledge is always good, but college
is not the only way to get education.

974
00:52:46,721 --> 00:52:49,630
And I think colleges, if you look
at where they're spending money on,

975
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:52,030
they've really inflated the number
of administrators they have.

976
00:52:52,031 --> 00:52:54,910
You have entire diversity boards
and things now. It's like,

977
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,970
where did you come from? Who's paying
your salary while the students are,

978
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,950
and I don't think it's
worth it. I, you know,

979
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:03,610
president Trump is actually taking
measures now to try and enforce freedom of

980
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:06,970
speech on canvases, which I
think is really important. Um,

981
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,230
but I am against the idea that
everybody needs to go to college.

982
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:14,770
The only way to be successful is
to go to college. And I think by,

983
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,870
by doing now we've kind of like,

984
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,900
we've made the leftist in academia and
touchable because they have like wave

985
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:24,220
after wave of student who's,
you know,

986
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:28,260
willing to pay to get in so
they can be indoctrinated.

987
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,000
What is it that sort of the brilliance
of it when you hear burns, sorry,

988
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:33,700
Burns like, okay, free college
for everybody. So what can we do?

989
00:53:33,701 --> 00:53:35,680
We're going to send them for free,
which obviously is not free.

990
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:39,580
There'll be indoctrinated into these ideas
even further and then what does he do

991
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:42,520
when you get out? Well now you're
going to be guaranteed a federal job.

992
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,080
Yeah,
that sounds horrible.

993
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,430
Can you imagine anything that sounds
worse now and it's like you can never get

994
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:51,940
out and you're going to be some pencil
pusher doing nothing. That's not for you.

995
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,670
A cog in the system essentially.
And what I think,

996
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:59,260
I really haven't seen many people who
are suggesting free tuition I talk about

997
00:53:59,261 --> 00:54:03,730
is okay, if it's all government
subsidized, fine, but like
how do we lower costs?

998
00:54:03,731 --> 00:54:06,640
Because it shouldn't just be about who
pays it, but how much they're paying.

999
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:07,391
And you know,

1000
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:11,560
costs in the United States have risen
so much faster than inflation when it

1001
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:14,680
comes to college. And there are a lot
of different factors. I, you know,

1002
00:54:14,681 --> 00:54:15,610
like the student loans,

1003
00:54:15,611 --> 00:54:18,670
the way that you can't get rid of a
student loan debt with bankruptcy.

1004
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:19,840
There's a whole bunch of things,

1005
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:23,740
but I don't see enough people talking
about how to lower those costs back down

1006
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:27,340
to what, what they used to be. Because
I mean, you have people who, if you,

1007
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:32,110
if you go to some, somewhere like USC, uh,
it's going to be like, what, 60 k a year.

1008
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,720
So that's like 240,000 by the
time you're done. And it's like,

1009
00:54:34,721 --> 00:54:37,590
it's ridiculous and it shouldn't,
it shouldn't cost that.

1010
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,920
I don't think I made $240,000 in all of
my twenties if I took all of the money.

1011
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:45,050
Yeah, I'm sure I did all those
years of struggling comedy at,

1012
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:46,630
it's like that's what you're
paying to go to college.

1013
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:51,390
It, nevermind the interest on that,
right? Yeah. So no, it's a like, you know,

1014
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,050
I on the right and kind of like syndromes,

1015
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:58,140
we make fun of those people with $240,000
of worth of debt for their useless

1016
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:01,320
arts degree. Um, but I mean
are they, I do think like,

1017
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,600
I'm not going to deny that there's
a problem with college costs,

1018
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:07,680
it's just that I don't think the answer
is okay. So just full on socialism.

1019
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,480
Government pays everything for it.

1020
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:12,600
I think we need to have a conversation
about how to lower those costs again.

1021
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,290
And uh,

1022
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:17,670
I think right now students are paying
for a lot of diversity and administrative

1023
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:21,870
faculty. They're paying for
a lot of research done by
their professors, which is,

1024
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:25,380
I mean, kind of great because American
universities are really at the forefront

1025
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:27,840
worldwide of any type of research,
but at the same time,

1026
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:31,350
it's like at what cost it's
costing the American students.

1027
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:34,710
And I think community college is
a great alternative. Uh, you know,

1028
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:37,500
cause obviously it's, it's a lot
more affordable and heck, if you,

1029
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,460
if you still want that, that, you
know, whatever name brand, university,

1030
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:43,080
Harvard or the Yale or whatever,

1031
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:45,340
you can always transfer after
you get your associates.

1032
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,670
Yeah. All right. A couple more for
you. Sure. Let me ask you some,

1033
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,270
I'll turn identity politics
on you. Uh, which would be,

1034
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:56,710
why aren't there more women in this space?
You're one of the few alleys, Stuckey.

1035
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,700
There's a couple, um, book, but I
wish there were more women, not,

1036
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:03,040
not for identity politics purposes,

1037
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,220
partly just a little bit
for the optics of it.

1038
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:09,430
So that when we're all getting
attacked for all this stuff, it's like,

1039
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:13,180
here's this, here's the low resolution
part of this. Here's more women. Yeah.

1040
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,000
Even though it has nothing to do
with your ideas and everything else,

1041
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,830
which is really what matters of course.

1042
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:21,420
I think the reason why there aren't more
women in this fear is kind of why there

1043
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,230
aren't more women in politics in general,

1044
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:27,650
is that this is a very aggressive
sphere. It really is. And I think for,

1045
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,570
for me even it's, it can be overwhelming
for a lot of people who, you know,

1046
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:31,931
aren't you,

1047
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:34,960
you put your ideas out there and then
you're going to just get attacked like

1048
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:39,880
ruthlessly. So, and I'm not saying that
men don't as well, but I think maybe,

1049
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:45,150
uh, as, as a, as a female identifying
person, whatever the PC, you know,

1050
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:49,550
it for a, for a lot of women it might be
a little bit harder to just say, okay,

1051
00:56:49,551 --> 00:56:52,150
like, let me brush that off,
move on and forget about it.

1052
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,250
And especially if you are a woman who's
speaking out against progressive ideas,

1053
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,510
you're going to get even more attention
than maybe a white male that's doing so.

1054
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,250
Because I think a lot of
people figure, oh, oh,

1055
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,190
another white guy who hates feminism,
who cares? But if you're a woman,

1056
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,550
then it's like you're,
you're going against the grain.

1057
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:13,120
It's like error in the system and they
really feel the need to double down.

1058
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,970
I mean, regardless of what you
think about the Trump family,

1059
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:18,370
the way that Melania and
Ivanka Trump are treated,

1060
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:21,100
I think most of us would agree
is completely vile, sexist,

1061
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:21,651
the things that they are,

1062
00:57:21,651 --> 00:57:25,750
they are called and it's a unfortunately
kind of par for the course for

1063
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:27,130
conservative women or you know,

1064
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:30,400
someone who is gay and speaking
out against the left or black,

1065
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:32,560
you get that much more pushback.

1066
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:37,000
So I think that alone unfortunately
is enough for a lot of people to say,

1067
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,160
I don't know about this.
I don't know if it's for me.

1068
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,530
So are you hopeful for the future?
Ooh,

1069
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,550
um, uh, you know what? I think my,

1070
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:51,340
my answer kind of goes back and forth
for that. There are some days, you know,

1071
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,840
um, when, for example,

1072
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:56,360
I see people speaking out against
maybe the Gillette ad and not,

1073
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,780
not being like totally irrational and,
you know,

1074
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:00,820
wanting to burn cars
down over a commercial.

1075
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:02,830
Cause that's all it is at the end of
the day. But kind of saying like, okay,

1076
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:06,910
this is stupid. You don't need to do
this to sell razor blades. Uh, you know,

1077
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:08,560
it stays like that where I think,
okay good.

1078
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:13,561
Most people have kind of wanted to leave
all of this identity politics in the,

1079
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:16,480
in the trash. Great. And then
there are other days like I,

1080
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:19,690
I knew during the Cavenaugh
hearing where I'm like, okay,

1081
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,880
nevermind just this was a
mistake. Asteroid, just, we're
ready, we're ready. So I,

1082
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:27,820
I go back and forth, but I think you've
looking at Gen z, they're one of the

1083
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,340
generations most ready to like reject
this whole like far left thing and that

1084
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:36,880
we've seen in a while. So I don't know
about how hopeful I am from millennials,

1085
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:39,550
but I think maybe the,
the next generation a little bit more.

1086
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,450
Yeah, that's actually exactly
where I was going to end this.

1087
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,360
Then suddenly there's this now bursts
of younger people. You're going to be,

1088
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,720
you're going to be old to these people.
I hate to tell you,

1089
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,020
but that are now coming out and going,
Whoa,

1090
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:56,000
we've seen the last five years of abject
hysteria or lunacy and now they are

1091
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:58,370
becoming more conservative.

1092
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,150
And maybe that is the
silver lining out of all.

1093
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,980
Yeah. Well, cause I think and people make
fun of this mean, but it's kind of true.

1094
00:59:04,981 --> 00:59:08,370
Or it's like conservatism is
almost counterculture right now.

1095
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:11,040
And a lot of people on the left laugh
about that. But I mean, think about it.

1096
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:16,050
If you are a young person who's in school
right now, like all of your teachers,

1097
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:18,770
you know, all of the media
that you watch, the, the,

1098
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,860
the school books you're being
given to that are given to you,

1099
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:24,320
they all push this progressive agenda.

1100
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,050
So what do you do if you want to rebel
against that? Because let's face it,

1101
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:27,651
young people,

1102
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,980
if there's like tales all this time
is that young people like to rebel.

1103
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:32,750
We like to be different.
We like to like,

1104
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,670
I'm doing my own thing and we've
all been teenagers. Yeah. Um,

1105
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,030
so how does a young person
do that right now? Well,

1106
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,050
it's not by kind of committing yourself
to PC life and culture. That's not,

1107
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,030
that's not edgy. That's not against
the grain. It's by saying no. Like,

1108
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:51,050
I'm gonna listen to this offensive
comedian. I'm going to listen to like,

1109
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:53,000
you know, one of the, the people who I,

1110
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:56,630
I hear my professors or my
parents or whatever telling
me not to watch, you know,

1111
00:59:56,631 --> 01:00:00,620
like the Jordan Peterson is the Dave
Rubin's the real scandalous spicy one.

1112
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,870
Yeah. Um, and you know,

1113
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:07,871
I don't want conservatism to just become
something people do to or believe in to

1114
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:10,280
get back at other people,
but I'm hoping, you know,

1115
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:14,330
if maybe there's that little
bit of like tantalizing, um,

1116
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,290
forced to get them there.
Then once they start watching the videos,

1117
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:20,300
they'll see that, oh, this
does make the most sense.

1118
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:25,301
So I'm not only doing this to get back
at my teachers or my parents or whatever,

1119
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:27,800
but this actually does
seem like an ideology,

1120
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:32,360
a belief system that can help people
succeed by themselves and can promote a

1121
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:33,010
quality.

1122
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:33,641
Yeah.
Well,

1123
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:36,760
I just want to say that I think what
you're doing is awesome and the fact that

1124
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,650
you've grown so much in the two and a
half years since we did that little thank

1125
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,650
you two week thing. I mean, you're, you're
becoming a star in this space and it's,

1126
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:46,890
it's great. We need people like
you, and as homer Simpson said,

1127
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,360
you're a person like you.
Right?

1128
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,300
I am a person like me. I thank you. And,

1129
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,320
and you're just back at you
watching you and Dr. Peterson go on,

1130
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:55,790
go on your tour and everything.
It's,

1131
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,620
it's great because it's almost like
this is becoming mainstream, right?

1132
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:03,920
It's not some like little internet
niche to disagree with these people.

1133
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:07,820
Like there are real people and all of
these cities who are attracted to these,

1134
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,670
these ideas in this movement,
and it's really encouraging.

1135
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:14,450
All right, let's keep going
then. Yeah. For more on. Lauren,
