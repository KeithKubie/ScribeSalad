00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.380
I'm Carol Kushner. I'm from California. And I'm

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.320
here representing being identified with the BRCA2 mutation.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.930
&gt;&gt; And I want to, I want to before we

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.700
get into the BRCA2 mutation, I want to know a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.590
little bit more about you. I mean, you, you

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.460
live in California now. Where, where you from originally?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.816
&gt;&gt; Well I was born in New York, raised in New Jersey, and went to college in

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:32.520
New York and got married out east, and we moved to California in the late 70s.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.880
&gt;&gt; Okay. Wow, so you've been in California for a while now.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.490
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.950
&gt;&gt; And what do you, what do you do for

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.550
fun? What do you, what do you do in California?

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.830
&gt;&gt; Well, I do pulaties, I bike, I hike.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.280
And I'm very interested in

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.380
genealogy and family history.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.060
&gt;&gt; And do you know much about

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.890
your family's background and where your family's from?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.920
&gt;&gt; Well, I know about up to as far as my grandparents. Eastern Europeans.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.650
And I've also worked on my daughter-in-law's

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.780
family and they go back to the Mayflower.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.000
&gt;&gt; Oh wow. Wow you were able to trace back that far.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.670
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's, that's pretty cool. and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.590
have you ever visited, do you feel special

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.438
connection with family history? Have you visited

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.710
Eastern Europe? and is that meaningful to you?

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.510
&gt;&gt; Well actually it's on my list of places to go. we've

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.330
been, we've traveled a lot, but we haven't been to eastern Europe.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.910
&gt;&gt; I see. Well, let's come back to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.750
this BCRA2 mutation. tell, can you tell us a little bit

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.510
more what, what is the BRCA2 mutation that you have? And what does it mean?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.910
&gt;&gt; Well, I have the one mutation is that was

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.440
tested and reported is

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.350
6174 dell T. And it is a pretty common mutation in

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.630
Ashkenazi Jewish people. And an uncle of mine is

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.770
also has the same mutation. And my cousin, his daughter.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.650
&gt;&gt; I see. So this appears to be a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.085
familial mutation that seems to be in other family members.

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:21.130
&gt;&gt; Right, it is a familial mutation, but as

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.910
I mentioned, it is common in Ashkenazi Jewish background.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.390
&gt;&gt; And what does having this mutation mean? Well, actually, maybe we

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.810
should ask this in order. when did you find out you had the mutation?

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.980
&gt;&gt; I found out in early 2010.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.530
&gt;&gt; And it was a surprise. I did the 23andMe

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.940
genetic testing and the results came back and it was surprising.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.310
&gt;&gt; And what did they tell you it means? what,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.270
like you have this mutation, what does it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.370
mean what is for you? For an individual?

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.990
&gt;&gt; Well, the risk of breast cancer is increased, compared

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.470
to the general population. And the risk of ovarian cancer is increased.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.810
&gt;&gt; And do you know what those

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.140
increased risks were, what those percentages were?

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.540
&gt;&gt; Well, for the breast cancer risk, it's between

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.990
20 and 50% risk. Although I saw a higher number earlier when I looked

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.460
recently. It seems like the risk, the number I saw change. And for

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.340
ovarian cancer, the risk is much lower but the risk is higher than in the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.990
general population. Now you can also calculate the risk based on age.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.960
So compared to the general population the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.182
risk for breast cancer at my age of 70 is four,

00:03:56.182 --> 00:04:01.371
about 4.5 out of 100 compared to about 2.5 out

00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:06.630
of 100 for not, a woman at age 70, who does not have the BRCA2 mutation.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.890
&gt;&gt; I see. And what did you think about this whole, sort of probability issue?

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.580
You know, the idea of a percentage, I mean,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.550
I think a lot of people think genetics is going to

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.069
tell them, oh, I am or I am not going

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.204
to have this trait. What was running through your mind?

00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:24.730
&gt;&gt; A lot.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.627
[LAUGH]

00:04:26.627 --> 00:04:32.440
I am married to a physicist who understands statistics,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.350
and he must have explained this to me half a dozen times, and all I could focus

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.360
on was the high number. But of course as you get older,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.560
the risk it changes, it varies.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.090
Assuming that there are 100 people, 100 women

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.990
with the BRCA mutation, and 50 have already, 50 out

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.860
of 100 have already had breast cancer

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.610
then, the statistics changed. That I can't really explain it but

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.660
it is daunting to think that there's, you know, double

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.900
the risk of someone else my age, even if it is a low number. Sure,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.830
I mean I can imagine it sounds like you

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.580
discovered that okay there's a lot of math, there's a

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.780
lot of research behind the numbers. But the numbers

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.590
are still the numbers, and I imagine, you know, it

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.900
has sort of an anxiety effect on, on an

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.640
individual. Did you feel anxious or worried? And what did

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.421
you end up doing? Did you, did you, did it

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:41.060
change anything for you and did you take an action?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.070
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.040
I was very anxious. And I called my doctor, he was away. I called

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.950
another doctor and he was away. And I called a friend who works at one of the

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:02.900
local hospitals. And I said, this is the situation. What do you recommend I do?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.270
And she gave me the name of a doctor. And it was confirmed. By the time

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.220
I had that information, it was confirmed. By the doctor who had returned. So I

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.760
went to see a breast oncologist and at a very

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.620
large medical center. And at the same time

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.680
she scheduled me to see a genetic counselor which

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.440
is recommended when you, when you get this information it's recommended

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.550
that you. speak to someone, and see someone who

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.420
understands the genetics. so I did see this person, and

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.880
the physician and the genetic counselor on the same day and she

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.770
was, gave me a very thorough exam, and a very thorough explanation, there was no

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.340
rush. And I was advised

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.580
to consider strongly having my ovaries removed and

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.380
to have twice a year breast exam and

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.730
one time a year. A breast MRI and a breast

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:22.350
mammogram. And I've followed up, I've already followed up two times.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.920
I see her twice a year and I've had the MRI and breast exam twice.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.266
&gt;&gt; Wow. You took a lot of action.

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:30.892
&gt;&gt; I did.

00:07:30.892 --> 00:07:36.440
&gt;&gt; And this was all based on the advise and the the I should say the,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.930
the medical advise of a genetic counselor and your clinician?

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.120
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. And the genetic counselor took a history of everyone

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.330
in the family. mother, mothers, fathers,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:56.050
grandfathers and. It was interesting to,

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.587
to find out my grand, my maternal grandmother died when my

00:08:01.587 --> 00:08:04.550
mother was five. So we're talking about 1920s.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.470
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.250
&gt;&gt; And like I was always told my grandmother died of stomach

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:16.130
cancer, and the genetic counselor brought up the possibility that she had

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.490
had ovarian cancer. Course, we wouldn't know, and this was the 1920s. And that

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:28.180
was what we, we heard. That she died of stomach cancer.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.160
But it could've been ovarian cancer.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.409
&gt;&gt; Wow. What what did this effect have on your

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:39.590
anxiety about the information, about your sort of medical future.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:46.712
&gt;&gt; Oh, it made me very anxious. but I keep busy. I

00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:53.589
work. So, it's, it's something that's in the back of my mind, it's not

00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:00.340
invisible, but I took action. I had my ovaries removed, and

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.750
it was a pretty simple procedure. everything they completely

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:13.190
analyze all the slides and everything was clear so.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:18.630
For that, I am grateful, and I'm following up on the mammograms and exams.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.590
&gt;&gt; And so far,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.270
it's all good news.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.600
&gt;&gt; So far, so good.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.166
&gt;&gt; I'm glad to hear that. in this process, was it

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:28.366
just a personal decision for you, or did you include family

00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:31.502
members in, in discussing it and trying to figure out what

00:09:31.502 --> 00:09:37.090
to do as well? Well I'll be married 50 years in.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.160
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.880
&gt;&gt; 2014. I'm very close with my husband and he and I discussed

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.800
this and it just seemed like it was the right thing to do. Of course I read a

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.594
lot. and I had family members who

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:59.759
had breast cancer and ovarian cancer. And

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:05.540
none of them are BRCA2 or any BRCA, for that matter.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.120
So, it wasn't as if I knew anybody that had this,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.550
was in this situation. Do you even can you tell us

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.660
that, it sounds like you, you did a lot of reading and

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.420
researching yourself, trying to learn about it. Do you know what

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.520
the, the BRCA genes do in a cell or in the body?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.660
&gt;&gt; Well, if you have, you have a BRCA gene, and if you

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:35.610
have a normal gene which regulates the,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:43.540
have a non-cancer cells will be working, then you wouldn't

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:50.320
be subject to the risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer. Based on just

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.810
that BRCA gene. However, if you have the mutation, there is, as far as I

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:02.605
understand it. There's, in my particular case, I'm missing

00:11:02.605 --> 00:11:04.093
the T.

00:11:04.093 --> 00:11:05.585
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:14.250
&gt;&gt; And the whole, Gene shifts, the BRCA gene is shifting and there's

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:20.220
a mutation. And so it's not operating correctly, is my best understanding.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.230
&gt;&gt; That's a pretty good understanding however the,

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.700
the mutation in the resulting protein that doesn't work

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:33.590
so well. it doesn't seem to lead to completely breast cancer,

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.122
ovarian cancer in all people who have it, as you mentioned. what are some of

00:11:38.122 --> 00:11:41.986
the environmental things that a, that a clinician or genetic counselor talked to

00:11:41.986 --> 00:11:45.660
you about? The environmental components that, that may play a part in this?

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.100
&gt;&gt; Well I was asked how much alcohol I

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.420
drink and I said well I live in California. You

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:59.000
know, I often have a glass of wine with dinner. And so its, they

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.210
don't know, its not for certain but they're recommending not

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.120
drinking too much alcohol. And as far as the environment

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.540
goes, there was really nothing much to. That they

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:19.410
discussed, but I, we eat healthy and

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.515
I moderate my wine drinking.

00:12:21.515 --> 00:12:22.515
&gt;&gt;

00:12:21.515 --> 00:12:21.730
[LAUGH]

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.710
It sounds like you lead a pretty healthy lifestyle, so that's good.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.360
I'm, I'm actually curious, I'm curious to know

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.610
sort of there's this sort of personal feeling. And an

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.110
idea of, you know, when you find out.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:39.130
Did anyone in your family have anxiety for you,

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.540
as well. Or did, were other family members

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.800
concerned? And did they interpret it the same

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.520
way you did? Did they only listen to

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.650
you for information? Did they look in other places?

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.030
&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of people in my family.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.240
Took the 23andMe test. our sons, our two sons, my

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.510
husband, because his mother had breast cancer, he took the test.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.800
our daughter-in-laws took the test. We asked an

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.640
Uncle my paternal Uncle, to take the test and he was BRCA2

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.910
and his daughter took the test and she's BRCA2. So

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:26.170
one of our son's is BRAC2. So they all, my sister took

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:31.400
the test and she was negative. Forgot about my sister. And

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:39.460
another cousin on my mother's side took the test. And she was negative also,

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:45.210
but she found out she had some hearing loss. A,

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:51.550
a gene that affected hearing, could affect hearing. She isn't affected,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:57.960
but her grandson, she found because of that, they identified that the grandson

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.400
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:58.780
&gt;&gt; Who had

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:05.060
some hearing issues had the same mutation. So

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:10.230
everybody was supportive and understanding. But I'm pretty open person

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.180
so, they just took it, and they took my lead.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.180
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that one of your sons

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.670
has the BRCA2, but the other son does not?

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.310
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.810
&gt;&gt; It's great that you were able to be sort of an example and a leader for

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.940
your family in sort of how to tackle information like this.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.744
Did anyone else? Wa, was, in general, was everyone else's reaction

00:14:32.744 --> 00:14:35.310
the same. You mentioned that you had female relatives who may

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.310
be younger than you who also had the mutation. Did they,

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:43.760
&gt;&gt; Well, my one cousin is in the process right now.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.140
&gt;&gt; I see. I see.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.810
&gt;&gt; Of scheduling an appointment for surgical

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.550
removal of her ovaries, oophorectomy.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.820
&gt;&gt; I see. So it sounds like, you

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.300
know, there's, everyone's sort of going to talk

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.630
to their doctor and make these decisions about

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.550
what's the best action to take for themselves.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.400
&gt;&gt; And she saw a genetic counselor as well.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.680
&gt;&gt; So I'm also curious to know what else you found out from your genetic

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:14.710
report. You said you went to 23 in the end. Was, was the BRCA2 mutation,

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.140
the only surprise you found?

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.408
&gt;&gt; Well, I found out that I had a little risk

00:15:19.408 --> 00:15:24.400
for Alzheimer's disease, but I'm not so sure that was accurate.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.400
&gt;&gt;

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.100
[LAUGH]

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.654
&gt;&gt; I also found that and I have the

00:15:29.654 --> 00:15:35.806
Tay-sachs mutation. And Tay-sachs is another

00:15:35.806 --> 00:15:41.132
Ashkenazi Jewish genetic mutation and

00:15:41.132 --> 00:15:45.756
Since I'm not having any children and my

00:15:45.756 --> 00:15:50.652
husband wasn't a carrier, then I didn't

00:15:50.652 --> 00:15:55.559
really worry about it but I was surprised.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.800
if you have a pregnancy, and you're

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.958
baby's identified as having Tay-Sachs, the result of

00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.410
a Tay-Sachs baby is they die within a couple of years of

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.720
birth. And it's a lipid storage.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.020
Disease where

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:25.920
the baby is missing an enzyme that metabolizes a lipid, and this lipid, norm,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.500
is normally metabolized, but when you have

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.739
the mutation where when you have Tay-Sachs disease.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.820
the lipid accumulates in the brain.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.565
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.070
&gt;&gt; And, the baby dies.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:45.280
&gt;&gt; Wow. So, although you knew about your, your ancestry, and you knew

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.360
you were, you know, part of this Ashkenazi Jewish population and, or lineage,

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.650
and and, you know, there were maybe certained. certain variants that you may

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.980
carry. You didn't know which ones and this was, you know, news to you,

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:00.490
to be a carrier was.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.920
&gt;&gt; Right, right. It was.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.599
&gt;&gt; do you know if your sons are also carriers?

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:09.380
&gt;&gt; I don't remember. It was more

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.650
the BRCA2. I also have Gaucher's disease.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:19.810
And that's another lipid storage disease in Ashkenazi

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.930
Jews, but not limited to Ashkenazi Jews.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.185
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:17:26.185 --> 00:17:30.775
&gt;&gt; And that's, and they're both carriers because I

00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:34.885
have the disease. You mentioned you're a carrier of

00:17:34.885 --> 00:17:37.790
Tay-Sachs and you don't, not sure if your sons

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.530
have the mutation as well. And they could be carriers.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.950
would it effect, if you hadn't had kids yet, you were planning

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.450
your life. Would, is this something that would be important to you,

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:55.350
making sure before, you know, you had children with a particular mate,

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.308
making sure that person was not a carrier of Tay Sachs as well?

00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:02.950
&gt;&gt; Well with the information we have today,

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:08.260
I certainly would inquire and have my husband tested.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:14.140
And take action if there. I would want to make sure

00:18:15.164 --> 00:18:21.240
that we were tested and if I were to get pregnant

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.380
I'd want to know if the baby I was carrying had Tay Sachs or not.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.360
&gt;&gt; You said your sons are carriers. And have

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.600
your sons have, have they had any biological children yet?

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.330
&gt;&gt; yes, they each have two sons.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.850
&gt;&gt; They each have two sons.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.960
&gt;&gt; Right, one son is, does not have BRCA2 mutation.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's right.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.090
&gt;&gt; One son does. And they both have two sons.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.370
&gt;&gt; I see, so this, I was just wondering if there's any,

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.560
anxiety. I mean the fact that you're a carrier and one son is a

00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:01.120
carrier for the BRCA2 mutation, I guess it manifests more in females than males,

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.370
&gt;&gt; Right. But there is a risk for male breast cancer and, and

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.410
they believe there may be a link to prostate cancer. And

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:16.820
the they don't seem. The one son just seems to be taking

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.450
it in stride. And not focusing on it right now.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:26.240
&gt;&gt; You know, there're a lot of people in the general population. Who, some who

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.910
don't know very much about genetics. And

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.999
as this information becomes more widespread. And they

00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:32.823
discover, like you, that they have a

00:19:32.823 --> 00:19:36.560
BRCA2 or BRCA1 mutation. females in particular who

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.930
don't know very much. if you had any advice to tell somebody who just found

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.590
out that they have a BRCA1 one or BRCA2 mutation. Is there anything you think

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.010
is important for them to know, or any

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.150
particular advice or message you would give them?

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:55.460
&gt;&gt; Well, if someone does inquire, and finds out,

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.960
I certainly think they should get genetic counseling and

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:07.170
see a physician who is a specialist in breast oncology

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:13.960
who is aware of the the latest and greatest research. we're

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.960
fortunate to live in an area where there are wonderful hospitals

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.580
and research centers. And so I strongly advise

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.786
people to take action and do what's best

00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:33.470
for them. I know age is a factor. If you find out you're

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:39.640
in your 20s or 30s and you haven't started a family or had children yet,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.456
what's recommended might be entirely different than what was recommended for me.

00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:46.950
&gt;&gt; Great. Carol, thank you so much for being here.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you for exploring this topic.
