Committee for physics and you have just

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190
Committee for physics and you have just
 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.450
Committee for physics and you have just
awarded the discovery of the expansion

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460
awarded the discovery of the expansion
 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.120
awarded the discovery of the expansion
of the universe which is going faster

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130
of the universe which is going faster
 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.639
of the universe which is going faster
and faster what exactly is expanding oh

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:23.649
and faster what exactly is expanding oh
 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.579
and faster what exactly is expanding oh
this is a fantastic discovery what is

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589
this is a fantastic discovery what is
 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.210
this is a fantastic discovery what is
expanding is the fabric of space-time

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220
expanding is the fabric of space-time
 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.010
expanding is the fabric of space-time
itself so the universe is amounts to the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020
itself so the universe is amounts to the
 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.980
itself so the universe is amounts to the
content of space-time and the whole

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990
content of space-time and the whole
 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.700
content of space-time and the whole
thing is expanding so even the universe

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710
thing is expanding so even the universe
 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.070
thing is expanding so even the universe
in this room like we are receding from

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080
in this room like we are receding from
 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.090
in this room like we are receding from
each other well every point in the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100
each other well every point in the
 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.760
each other well every point in the
universe is receding from every other

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770
universe is receding from every other
 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.400
universe is receding from every other
point however this room is very small so

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410
point however this room is very small so
 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.180
point however this room is very small so
the expansion is my nude however if we

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190
the expansion is my nude however if we
 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.680
the expansion is my nude however if we
look at the galaxy which is some

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690
look at the galaxy which is some
 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.630
look at the galaxy which is some
distance away then the expansion is

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640
distance away then the expansion is
 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.329
distance away then the expansion is
measurable and if you look at objects

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339
measurable and if you look at objects
 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.830
measurable and if you look at objects
which are really far away like the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840
which are really far away like the
 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.889
which are really far away like the
supernovae which are about half way back

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899
supernovae which are about half way back
 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.980
supernovae which are about half way back
to Big Bang then they're really receding

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
to Big Bang then they're really receding
 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.789
to Big Bang then they're really receding
from us at fantastic speeds so how big

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799
from us at fantastic speeds so how big
 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.260
from us at fantastic speeds so how big
is this expansion well the universe has

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270
is this expansion well the universe has
 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.559
is this expansion well the universe has
about doubled in size over the past five

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569
about doubled in size over the past five
 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.569
about doubled in size over the past five
billion years which is since the

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579
billion years which is since the
 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.700
billion years which is since the
beginning of our solar system our solar

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710
beginning of our solar system our solar
 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.580
beginning of our solar system our solar
system was born about 5,000 five billion

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590
system was born about 5,000 five billion
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.620
system was born about 5,000 five billion
years ago where is this discovery is so

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630
years ago where is this discovery is so
 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.050
years ago where is this discovery is so
perplexing well before the expansion was

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060
perplexing well before the expansion was
 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.899
perplexing well before the expansion was
the accelerating expansion was

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909
the accelerating expansion was
 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.609
the accelerating expansion was
discovered one believed that the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619
discovered one believed that the
 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.370
discovered one believed that the
universe was dominated by matter by

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380
universe was dominated by matter by
 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.859
universe was dominated by matter by
objects like ourselves like the stars

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869
objects like ourselves like the stars
 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.949
objects like ourselves like the stars
and Suns like planets and a universe

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959
and Suns like planets and a universe
 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.589
and Suns like planets and a universe
which is dominated by matter will be

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599
which is dominated by matter will be
 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.169
which is dominated by matter will be
expected to slow down due to the pool of

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179
expected to slow down due to the pool of
 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.390
expected to slow down due to the pool of
gravity

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400
gravity
 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.630
gravity
and so the two groups of researchers set

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640
and so the two groups of researchers set
 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.510
and so the two groups of researchers set
out to measure this deceleration as it

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520
out to measure this deceleration as it
 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.160
out to measure this deceleration as it
it's called the slowing down of the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170
it's called the slowing down of the
 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.490
it's called the slowing down of the
universe and to everyone's amazement and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500
universe and to everyone's amazement and
 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.260
universe and to everyone's amazement and
they wouldn't believe what they saw they

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270
they wouldn't believe what they saw they
 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.750
they wouldn't believe what they saw they
realized that the universe was not

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
realized that the universe was not
 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.190
realized that the universe was not
decelerating it was actually

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200
decelerating it was actually
 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.910
decelerating it was actually
accelerating totally amazing you said

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
accelerating totally amazing you said
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.670
accelerating totally amazing you said
earlier that was like pushing the break

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
earlier that was like pushing the break
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.820
earlier that was like pushing the break
in the car what happens well you push

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830
in the car what happens well you push
 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.620
in the car what happens well you push
the break in the car and you expect the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630
the break in the car and you expect the
 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.920
the break in the car and you expect the
car to slow down and stop eventually but

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930
car to slow down and stop eventually but
 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.890
car to slow down and stop eventually but
if you discover that your car instead of

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
if you discover that your car instead of
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.240
if you discover that your car instead of
accelerated oh my god something is

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
accelerated oh my god something is
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.130
accelerated oh my god something is
happening which is you know not what I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140
happening which is you know not what I
 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.990
happening which is you know not what I
expected and that was the feeling they

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000
expected and that was the feeling they
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.650
expected and that was the feeling they
got something totally unexpected so

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660
got something totally unexpected so
 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.230
got something totally unexpected so
somehow the universe was born for in Big

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240
somehow the universe was born for in Big
 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.980
somehow the universe was born for in Big
Bang for 14 billion years ago and then

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990
Bang for 14 billion years ago and then
 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.530
Bang for 14 billion years ago and then
it was decelerating slowing down the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540
it was decelerating slowing down the
 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.210
it was decelerating slowing down the
expansion and then it began somehow to

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
expansion and then it began somehow to
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.400
expansion and then it began somehow to
expand faster and faster when they did

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410
expand faster and faster when they did
 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.220
expand faster and faster when they did
happen well it happened at about the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
happen well it happened at about the
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.710
happen well it happened at about the
time when the solar system was born

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
time when the solar system was born
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.560
time when the solar system was born
actually when it depends on the balance

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570
actually when it depends on the balance
 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.440
actually when it depends on the balance
of various components of energy within

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450
of various components of energy within
 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.720
of various components of energy within
the universe and I Shan has taught us

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
the universe and I Shan has taught us
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.160
the universe and I Shan has taught us
that e equals MC squared so matter a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170
that e equals MC squared so matter a
 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.759
that e equals MC squared so matter a
mass is equivalent to energy and the

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769
mass is equivalent to energy and the
 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.650
mass is equivalent to energy and the
balance between buyers forms of energy

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660
balance between buyers forms of energy
 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.990
balance between buyers forms of energy
between matter between radiation and

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000
between matter between radiation and
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.940
between matter between radiation and
other forms of energy is what determines

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950
other forms of energy is what determines
 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.820
other forms of energy is what determines
how the expansion's varies with time and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830
how the expansion's varies with time and
 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.979
how the expansion's varies with time and
the bath at the time when the solar

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989
the bath at the time when the solar
 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.100
the bath at the time when the solar
system was born this unknown form of

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110
system was born this unknown form of
 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.390
system was born this unknown form of
energy which we called dark energy

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400
energy which we called dark energy
 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.850
energy which we called dark energy
started dominating over matting the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860
started dominating over matting the
 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.490
started dominating over matting the
component was largest over some and

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500
component was largest over some and
 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.930
component was largest over some and
since then the universe is accelerating

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940
since then the universe is accelerating
 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.350
since then the universe is accelerating
how actually how was the discovery done

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360
how actually how was the discovery done
 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.810
how actually how was the discovery done
how can you see the accelerating

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820
how can you see the accelerating
 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.380
how can you see the accelerating
expansion well to see the accelerating

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390
expansion well to see the accelerating
 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.780
expansion well to see the accelerating
expansion you need two things one is

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790
expansion you need two things one is
 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.790
expansion you need two things one is
that you need something which is called

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800
that you need something which is called
 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.790
that you need something which is called
standard candles you need some object in

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800
standard candles you need some object in
 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.240
standard candles you need some object in
the universe which you see at very far

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250
the universe which you see at very far
 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.880
the universe which you see at very far
distances and this was the supernova

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890
distances and this was the supernova
 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.070
distances and this was the supernova
which can be observed at cosmological

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080
which can be observed at cosmological
 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.470
which can be observed at cosmological
distances so you go back to the birth of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
distances so you go back to the birth of
 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.460
distances so you go back to the birth of
the universe many billion years ago and

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470
the universe many billion years ago and
 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.470
the universe many billion years ago and
then you need the cosmological model and

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480
then you need the cosmological model and
 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.750
then you need the cosmological model and
to obtain a cosmological model you need

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760
to obtain a cosmological model you need
 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.780
to obtain a cosmological model you need
to rely on Einstein theory of relativity

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790
to rely on Einstein theory of relativity
 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.140
to rely on Einstein theory of relativity
and on his general theory of relativity

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
and on his general theory of relativity
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.120
and on his general theory of relativity
and then comparing the expectation of

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130
and then comparing the expectation of
 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.730
and then comparing the expectation of
this model with what you observe how

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740
this model with what you observe how
 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.740
this model with what you observe how
