00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.190
On any given page, like this one, you can open the con

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.970
developer tools by clicking on the shortcut listed in tools, developer tools.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.580
As you can see, Chrome def tools provides a series of tabs that allow you to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.730
debug and inspect your web apps. For example

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.690
you can select any element on the page by

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.360
right clicking the element and selecting inspect element

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.230
or as I'll do here you can click

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.770
on the magnifying glass and hover over the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.980
area that you would like to inspect. Let's take

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.260
a look at the un-ordered list of floor selectors.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.300
Let's change the text in one of the floor selectors. We can do that by

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.630
simply expanding the element that contains it

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.579
and then editing it live on the page.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.680
You can also make live edits to the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.130
CSS. Let's take a look at changing the selected

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.740
floor class. Here, I can set the background

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.440
color to whatever I want. For example, blanched almond

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.380
because who doesn't like blanched almonds. Because the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.320
background color is now pretty light, we may also

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.330
want to change the text color. Chrome Depth Tools

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.760
provides a handy color picker for that. We can

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.093
pick any color we want. [SOUND]

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:28.720
Shift + clicking the color picker, allows you to cycle through

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.780
the different color schemes. RGB HSL, and so on. If we scroll a little bit

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.550
further, so our floor selector class, we can play around with the different

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.490
settings there. You can use the scroll

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.760
wheel to cycle through the different sizes.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.680
And we can set the border width in a similar fashion. As you can see, Chrome Dev

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.660
Tools provides with rich functionality to edit and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.430
inspect your pages. And than was just one tab.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.830
We'll be diving deeper into the Network, Timeline,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.610
and Profiles tabs with Colt McAnlis in the performance

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.370
lesson, and we'll cover the Resources tab in

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.070
more detail in the lesson about offline and storage.
