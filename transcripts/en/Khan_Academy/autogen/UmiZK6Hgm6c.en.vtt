00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.140
 In this video I want to use some of the results from 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.960
 the previous few video lessons to do a few very arranged things. 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.000
 Let's say this is a circle and we have a record 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.130
 equilateral triangle in it. 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 All the tops of this triangle lie on 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.825
 circle. 

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:24.170
 I will try to make an equilateral triangle. 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.960
 I think that's about the best I can do. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.620
 And by saying equilateral, that means all of them 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.910
 countries are of equal length. 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.060
 If this is the length of the side 'a', then it is the length 'a' 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.610
 and this is also a length 'a'. 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.010
 Let us know that the radius of the circle is 2. 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.925
 I just choose a number to make the decision. 

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:49.600
 Let's say the radius of this circle is 2. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.700
 From the center to every point 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.910
 this distance, the radius, is equal to 2. 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.780
 Now, what I want is to use some of the results from 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.020
 the last few video lessons and a little basic 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.940
 trigonometry ... if the word "trigonometry" scares you, 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.570
 you only need the first two or three video lessons 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.710
 in the trigonometry list so you can understand 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.840
 what am I doing here? 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.830
 What I want to do here is to find the faces in the figures inside 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.080
 in the circle and outside the triangle. 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.690
 I want to calculate this small area, that 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.940
 area and these areas together. 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.490
 The obvious way to do it is to say I can 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.670
 to calculate the face of the circle very easily. 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.215
 The face of the circle. 

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:43.740
 And this will be equal to πr ^ 2. 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 Or π by 2 per square, which is equal to 4π. 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.040
 And I can get out of the face of the triangle. 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.450
 So I have to find the face of the triangle. 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.900
 What is the face of the triangle? 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.260
 In several previous video lessons, I showed you the Heron formula, 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.720
 where if you know the length of the sides of a triangle, 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.070
 you can find the face. 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.180
 But we still do not know the lengths of the parties. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.560
 Once we find them, we'll calculate the face. 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.740
 Let's apply the Heron formula without knowing it. 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.950
 Let's say the lengths of this equilateral triangle ... 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.760
 the lengths of the sides are 'a'. 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.450
 Applying the Gheron formula, we first define our variable 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.220
 s to be equal to (a + a + a) / 2. 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.070
 Or it is the same as 3a / 2. 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.380
 And then the face of this triangle, expressed through 'a' ... 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.910
 The face will be equal to the square root of s, 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.310
 which is 3a / 2, in (s - a). 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.820
 This is the same as 3a / 2 - a. 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.060
 Or I can just write 2a / 2. 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.970
 Correct? but is the same as 2a / 2. 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.740
 You can shorten these and get a. 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.170
 And then I'll do it three times. 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.000
 And instead of just multiplying this three times for each of the parties, 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.640
 according to the Genoa formula I can just say 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.700
 third degree. 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.000
 How will this be equal? 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.050
 This will be equal to a square root of 3a / 2. 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.070
 And then it will be equal here 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.810
 of 3a - 2a, which is 'a'. 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.010
 So a / 2 of third degree. 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.860
 And this will be equal to ... arbitrarily will 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.490
 changing colors. 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.560
 We have 3a of a ^ 3, which is 3a ^ 4, 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.170
 on 2 by 2 ^ 3. 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.400
 Well, that's 2 ^ 4, or 16. 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.680
 Correct? 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.100
 2 by 2 ^ 3 is 2 ^ 4. 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.890
 That's 16. 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.660
 And if we take the square root of the numerator and the denominator, 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.150
 this will be equal to the square root of 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.690
 a ^ 4, which is a ^ 2. 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.390
 a ^ 2 on ... will write only a square root of 3, 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.860
 on a square root of the numerator, which is exactly 4. 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.130
 So, if we know, using the GERON formula we find the face 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.720
 of this equilateral triangle. 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.080
 How can we find 'a'? 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.770
 What else do we know about the equilateral triangles? 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.690
 We know that all these angles are equal. 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.720
 And since their sum is 180 degrees, they are 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.210
 should be 60 degrees. 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.890
 It's 60 degrees, it's 60 degrees 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.090
 this is 60 degrees. 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.980
 Now let's see if we can use the latest video where I talked about 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.720
 the relationship between the entered angle 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.800
 and a central angle. 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.560
 This is the entry corner here. 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.620
 Its tip lies on the circle. 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:20.470
 So he cuts the rainbow here. 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.000
 And the central angle that cuts the same arc 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.850
 is here. 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.740
 The central corner, cutting the same arc, 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.960
 is here. 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.170
 Based on what we saw in the last video, the central corner, 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.980
 which cuts the same arc, is twice 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.040
 the entered angle. 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.230
 So this angle will be 120 degrees. 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.860
 Let me put an arrow there. 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.860
 120 degrees. 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.440
 It's twice that. 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.110
 Now if I lower the bisector on this corner here, 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.140
 I divide that corner and I only want to 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.260
 he dropped down like this. 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.310
 What are these two corners? 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.440
 Well, they are 60 degrees. 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.760
 I divide this corner at two. 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.480
 It's 60 degrees and it's 60 degrees right here. 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.450
 And we know that I'm dividing this country in two. 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.080
 This is an isosceles triangle. 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.040
 This is a radius here. 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.030
 The radius r is equal to 2. 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.530
 This is a radius of r = 2. 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.090
 This whole triangle is symmetrical. 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.540
 If I go straight down to the middle, this length 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.100
 here is this country divided into two. 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.280
 This country there is this country divided into two. 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.240
 Let me draw this here. 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.890
 Just by taking an isosceles triangle, each isosceles triangle, 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.850
 on which this country is equal to that country. 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.300
 These are our radii in this example. 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.530
 And this angle is equal to that angle. 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.790
 If I lower the bisector on this corner here, 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.260
 will split this opposite side into two. 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.880
 So these two lengths will be equal. 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.120
 In this case, if the whole is a, each of these 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.140
 will be a / 2. 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.420
 Now let's see how we can use this and a little bit of it 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.620
 trigonometry to find the relationship between a and r. 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.050
 Because if we can find 'a' using r, then we can 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.640
 to substitute this value for 'a' here and get the face 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.690
 of our triangle. 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.600
 And then we can get out of his face 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.070
 circle and end. 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.050
 We'll solve the problem. 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.610
 Let's see we can do it. 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.340
 We have a 60 degree angle here. 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.050
 Half of this central corner here. 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.890
 If this angle is 60 degrees, we have a / 2, which is 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.380
 opposed to this angle. 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:43.480
 So we have a counterpart that is equal to a / 2. 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.860
 We also have hypotenuse. 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.040
 Correct? 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.870
 This is a rectangular triangle here. 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.830
 You go straight down and you divide 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.840
 the opposite side. 

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.640
 It is a rectangular triangle. 

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.000
 We can apply a little trigonometry. 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.550
 Our counterpart is a / 2, the hypotenuse equals r. 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.020
 Here is the hypotenuse of our rectangular triangle. 

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.360
 Therefore, this is equal to 2. 

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.440
 What trigonometric attitude is the attitude of the opposite 

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.920
 the corner of the hypotenuse? 

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.910
 Maybe he is already tired of being constantly doing it, 

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.030
 but SinusCosinusTangens ... 

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:27.070
 the sine of the corner is equal to the opposite 

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.620
 on the hypnotheus. 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.580
 Let's roll a little down. 

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.270
 It ends my place. 

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:38.700
 The sinus of the corner here, the sinus at 60 degrees, is 

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.070
 equal to the opposite side, which is 

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.800
 equal to a / 2, on the hypotenuse, which is 

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.140
 our radius divided by 2. 

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.510
 Which is equal to a / 2 divided by 2 is a / 4. 

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.880
 How much is a 60 degree sinus? 

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.720
 And if the word "sinus" seems completely unknown to you, 

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.150
 watch the first few video lessons from the section by trigonometry, 

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.240
 it's not too scary. 

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.310
 A 60 degree sinus can be remembered by 

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.680
 triangles with angles 30-60-90. 

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.210
 Let me draw one here. 

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.705
 This is triangle 30-60-90. 

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:21.540
 If that's 60 degrees, that's 30 degrees, that's 90 degrees. 

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.660
 You can remember that this is a length of 1, it is 

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.520
 with a length of 1/2 and a length of 

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.370
 square root of 3/2. 

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.300
 The 60-degree sinus is the opposite side to the hypotenuse. 

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.770
 Square root of 3/2 on 1. 

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.940
 Sine of 60 degrees. 

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.840
 If you do not have a calculator, you can just use this ... 

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.930
 is a square root of 3 on 2. 

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.890
 This here is a square root of 3 on 2. 

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.280
 Now we can find 'a'. 

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.920
 A square root of 3 on 2 is equal to a / 4. 

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.610
 To multiply both sides by 4. 

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.640
 So these 4 are shortened. 

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.445
 You multiply 4 here. 

00:10:03.445 --> 00:10:04.480
 Here comes 2. 

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.660
 This is 1. 

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.250
 You get a = 2 per square root of 3. 

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.000
 We're almost at the finish. 

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.420
 We have just found the lengths of all sides. 

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.460
 We used the Gheron formula to calculate the face of 

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.080
 triangle at these lengths. 

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.110
 We simply derive this value from 'a' there, 

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.670
 to get our face. 

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:30.380
 The face of our triangle is equal to a ^ 2. 

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.690
 How much is a ^ 2? 

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:37.780
 It is 2 by square root of 3, the whole square, 

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.710
 by square root of 3 on 4. 

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.470
 We just decided a ^ 2 per square root of 3/4. 

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:51.950
 This will be equal to 4 by 3 

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.930
 square root of 3, on 4. 

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.350
 These fours are shortening. 

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.360
 The face of our triangle we received is 

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.770
 3 by square root of 3. 

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.160
 The face here is 3 square root of 3. 

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.480
 This is the face of this entire triangle. 

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.810
 Now to get back to the original question. 

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.970
 The face of this orange area outside the triangle 

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.530
 and within the circle. 

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.460
 The face of our circle is 4p. 

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.340
 From this we take out the face of the triangle, 

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.170
 3 square root of 3. 

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.390
 And we're done. 

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.670
 This is our answer. 

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:35.270
 This is the face of this orange part here. 

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.800
 Anyway, I hope you find it fun.
