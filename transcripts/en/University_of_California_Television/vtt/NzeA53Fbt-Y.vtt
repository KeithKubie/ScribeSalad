00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:04.208
(mid-tempo reserved music)

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.820
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.970
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.380
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.560
Our guest today is Sir
Michael Marmot, who is head of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.980
the Department of
Epidemiology and Public Health

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.230
and Director of the International Center

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.610
for Health and Society at
University College, London.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.550
He is the 2002 Hitchcock
Lecturer on the Berkeley campus.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
Dr. Marmot, welcome back to Berkeley.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.807
- Thank you very much.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.940
- Where were you born and raised?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.530
- I was born in North London,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.920
but at age 4 1/2 I went
to Sydney, Australia,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.301
and so I was raised in Sydney.

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:12.410
- Do you remember the
place that you were born,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.680
or just you were too young?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.840
- Well, I now live about five
miles from where I was born.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.673
- [Harry] (laughs) oh, I see.

00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:22.180
- So I have dim memories
which I charged up again

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.080
by going back to visit it.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.930
- Looking back, how do you think

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.253
your parents shaped your character?

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.000
- Well, my parents, the family
image, the family tradition,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
was my parents were poor
immigrants into East London,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.040
and that they thought that
education was vitally important.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.483
But they both left school at 14.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.730
And so I grew up with the idea that,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.490
but for the opportunity,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.680
my parents would have been educated.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.010
And they were giving me this opportunity,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.960
and by golly, I better
take advantage of it.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560
So that was one thing, the
importance of education,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.530
and I suppose the
importance of opportunity

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.777
to allow you to receive that education.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.760
I think the second thing was that,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.020
again, the family image,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.780
and I can't give you pounds,
shillings, and pence,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.710
or dollars and cents,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.410
but the family image was
that however much or little

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.573
my father earned, some part
of it was always for charity.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.186
And the image in the family was that

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:32.480
that was really very important.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.820
You didn't earn money just for yourself,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.060
it was important that some
part of that went to charity.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.480
And both my parents
were very much involved

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.500
in communal activities, so
that I grew up with a notion

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.580
that education was important,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.030
that individual earnings should be shared,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.452
and that communal activities
were vitally important.

00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:59.300
- And what was conversation
like at the dinner table,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.770
all of the above or something else?

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.210
- No, I don't think it was
very intellectual, in a way.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.740
You know, so this wasn't spelt out.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.123
It was very argumentative,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.320
particularly as my two
brothers and I got older,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.950
and particularly when
I went to university,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.140
and then, of course,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.200
questioned everything
my parents believed in.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.770
And so we had really quite
vigorous argumentation

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.640
at the dinner table about everything.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.510
And I thought that it was like

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.600
the Mark Twain view of your father,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.887
you know that's what I
thought about my parents.

00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:37.190
- Do you remember any books that you read

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.293
as a young person that
really made an impression?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.250
- Well, there were books in our household,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.850
but I wouldn't say that I
had the image of it being

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.320
a very intellectual, cultural household.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.400
But my parents always had books on the go,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.723
there were books in the household,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.250
but I couldn't say that
my parents gave us this

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.640
and inculcated a
particular way of thinking.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.000
But I suppose one part
that I can't ignore was

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.290
that after school three afternoons a week,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.180
and Sunday morning, I
went to Hebrew school,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.020
so that whatever else was going on,

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.420
I was doing all that extra.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.390
So my playing of cricket
and rugby in the street was

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.500
before or after, well,
usually after, Hebrew school

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.700
'cause I had school and
I had Hebrew school.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.130
- Did any teachers, either at
Hebrew school or public school

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.953
that had an influence
on you at a young age?

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.483
- Not teachers so much, in a way.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.760
They were okay, nobody
particularly outstanding.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.113
But one or two friends that
were really rather important.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.860
One friend, particularly,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.860
whose father was a professor
of organic chemistry.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.920
And somehow, almost by default,
through his father and him,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.080
he introduced me to the idea

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.813
that one ought to think a
little bit more intellectually.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.670
- Where and when did you
do your undergraduate work?

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.850
- So I did, in the Australian
system at that time,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.655
you went straight from
school to medical school.

00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:25.488
- [Harry] I see.

00:05:25.488 --> 00:05:27.083
- And there wasn't a general
undergraduate degree.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:27.916
- [Harry] Okay.

00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:30.933
- So I went to medical school
at the University of Sydney.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.350
And I had one, for me,
very important year there.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.770
It was a rather conventional
medical undergraduate training,

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.170
there was nothing particularly
remarkable about it,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.560
but you had the opportunity to do

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.210
a so-called intercalated BSc,
a Bachelor of Science Medical,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.210
which was a year spent in
a lab, which was wonderful.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.583
It was the most enjoyable
part of my university.

00:05:58.751 --> 00:06:00.030
Firstly, I could do some research

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.760
and you could follow your nose a bit,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.280
you had a bit of time to read literature,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.430
think about things.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.560
But certainly, I met
people outside medicine.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.000
So, for example, during that year,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.743
I attended lectures in English literature,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.890
and I met friends who were involved

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.310
in political science and sociology.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.860
And so until that point,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.580
I'd been a very conventional
medical student,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.420
and suddenly my eyes were open.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.400
So I could do research,
I could follow my nose,

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.840
and there was a whole world out there.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.290
- And so with the medical
degree, then, do you have,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.500
did you practice medicine actually or?

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.960
- Well, I did a couple of
years, I did my house jobs.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.550
And in fact, during my first house job,

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.040
I knew I had to get something extra,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.930
so despite working a hundred hours a week,

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.030
I went off and finished
first year English.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.010
So I used to go with my
bleeper to English lectures

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.050
and while on-call, waiting to be called--

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.120
- So, almost a separate degree

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.340
in English literature, is that?

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.280
- Well, I just did the
first year, I did one year,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.810
but it was great fun.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.690
It was enormously interesting to do that,

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.510
to get this extra dimension.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.240
And then my second year, again,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.160
I didn't want to do just
straight house jobs,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.260
and so I did a clinical research year.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.330
And that, again, was
really rather important.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.400
I was working in thoracic
medicine, asthma.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.180
But the fact that I was
looking after patients,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.180
but I was starting to pursue
my own interests in research.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
And in a way, that's what's convinced me

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.710
to go into epidemiology, public health.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.660
I mean the one very important
person was a chest physician

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.983
in Sydney at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.103
I mean I really wasn't terribly
intellectual, in a way.

00:08:00.103 --> 00:08:01.620
I was not well read,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.410
but I used to walk
around the hospital wards

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.423
and I'd say we saw this
chap three months ago.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.448
He came in in acute cardiac
failure, we treated him,

00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:15.630
or chronic respiratory
failure, we treated him.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.537
Sent him home, here he is back again.

00:08:18.537 --> 00:08:20.560
And I used to think you know, medicine

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.020
and particularly surgery
is just failed prevention.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.010
If we could treat these
people quote, properly,

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.070
and particularly, if we could
do something about prevention,

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.920
we could empty the hospital wards.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.730
That's probably false, but
that's what I used to think.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.623
And this chest physician,
a man named Peter Harvey,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.440
I guess he was interested
in the idea that I had

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.519
some of the thoughts to me

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:51.940
other than just straight
clinical medicine.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.430
And he went off,

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.720
he had a friend named
Ian Prior in New Zealand,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.880
and they used to do studies

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.910
of blood pressure in Polynesian islanders,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.820
looking at different
prevalence of blood pressure

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.143
in different Polynesian island groups.

00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:08.520
And Ian Prior had a meeting in New Zealand

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.030
that Peter Harvey went to,

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.147
and he came back from
this meeting, he said,

00:09:12.147 --> 00:09:15.886
"I've got just the thing for
you, it's called epidemiology."

00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:16.719
I said what's that?

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:17.552
(Harry laughs)

00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:20.120
And he said, well, these guys,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.030
they're doctors and anthropologists

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.970
and statisticians and biologists,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.560
and they all work together
to try and understand

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.400
why disease varies in different places.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.730
And he said I met these
two terrific people there.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.550
One was named Len Syme,

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.150
who was a professor of
epidemiology in Berkeley,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.050
and the other was named John Cassel,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.013
who was professor of
epidemiology at Chapel Hill,

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:42.290
University of North Carolina.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.920
And he said, "Would you
like me to write to them?"

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.340
So I said, yeah, please.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.080
So he wrote, and they
both wrote back, and said,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.020
you know, we'd like to
see your CV, and right.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.330
I found not long ago the letters

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.677
I'd written at the time,

00:09:57.677 --> 00:09:59.958
and it was slightly embarrassing, really.

00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.825
(Harry laughs)

00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:03.010
It was embarrassing for two ways.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.810
One, this sort of naivete of a young man,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.680
but secondly, that my
ideas haven't changed much,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.440
that I actually said in these letters

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.160
that I thought that
health was a manifestation

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.935
of the way we organize society.

00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:18.090
And that by asking
about health in society,

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.541
we're asking about society itself.

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.091
And where I got that idea
from, I haven't a clue,

00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:24.980
but that's what I've been
doing for the last 30 years.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.820
Well, I'd had never heard of Chapel Hill,

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.280
and I had heard of Berkeley,
so I came to Berkeley.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.150
- So in looking back now,

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.960
do you have any better sense

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.960
of the roots of that broader picture,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.590
that need for locating what you were doing

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.903
in a larger social context,
or was it just curiosity?

00:10:48.903 --> 00:10:50.490
- I think it was curiosity.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.490
I think it came from one
or two fellow students.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.238
I suppose I had read a little
bit more than I'll admit.

00:10:58.238 --> 00:11:02.920
But I can't honestly say it came

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.218
from my medical teachers in Sydney,

00:11:05.218 --> 00:11:07.293
I don't think it really did.

00:11:07.293 --> 00:11:12.293
And, in fact, when I was
planning to come to Berkeley,

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:16.050
and I remember one particular day

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:21.050
when the deadline for applying
for a residence position,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.235
a training position in internal medicine,

00:11:24.235 --> 00:11:26.570
the deadline was five
o'clock Friday afternoon--

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.510
- [Harry] This would be in Australia?

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.801
- In Australia, yes.

00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:30.790
So the usual thing was

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.600
if you could train in internal medicine,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.433
of course, you would.

00:11:34.433 --> 00:11:35.266
Who wouldn't?

00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:37.670
So if you could get a job at
the premier teaching hospital,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.970
that's obviously what
any sane sensible person

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.460
would want to do.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.880
And five o'clock Friday afternoon came,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.240
and I hadn't put in an application.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.330
And I didn't yet know

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.210
whether I'd be able to go to Berkeley,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.490
but I felt this wonderful
sense of liberation.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.357
And one of the older physicians said,

00:11:54.357 --> 00:11:55.233
"It's a big mistake, you know.

00:11:55.233 --> 00:11:59.417
"You'll get off the ladder and
you may never get back on."

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.840
And it felt wonderful.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.287
So I think it was more a reaction

00:12:04.287 --> 00:12:08.510
to conventional medicine than
it was that I could point

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.713
to a particular teacher who influenced me.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.700
- On the one hand, in
conventional medicine,

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.750
you were able to help
people, be sympathetic,

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.453
but I guess there's also a
lot of rote work in that.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.863
What was at the root of,

00:12:27.776 --> 00:12:29.630
was it that you were dissatisfied,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.020
or was it that you saw something better?

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.380
- I loved clinical medicine,

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.640
I liked dealing with patients,
real people, real problems.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.980
So I loved clinical medicine.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.310
I liked the problem-solving aspect of it,

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.210
and I liked the science of it,

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.220
and I liked the human
warmth and contact of it.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.590
So I really loved it.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.130
Whether I would say that 30 years later,

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.580
after doing it for 30 years,

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.400
I can't say, but I really loved it.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.920
So it wasn't any dissatisfaction

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.770
with the actual practice
of clinical medicine,

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.380
which was very satisfying.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.370
It was much more this feeling

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.385
that this wasn't the
right way to go about it.

00:13:08.385 --> 00:13:11.280
We really needed to think how to stop

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.800
those unfortunate people coming back

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.330
again and again and
again every three months.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.710
It felt to me like we
were putting Band-Aids on.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.370
And I also remember at the
time talking to a friend

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.300
about the experience working in casualty

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.330
and the emergency room.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.200
And the teaching hospital I was at was

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.640
at the inner-city part of Sydney,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.430
and there were a lot of
Italian and Greek immigrants.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.430
And some people, as you might
expect, were slightly rude.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.450
Some of the staff were slightly rude

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.080
about patients coming in

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.640
who couldn't speak English properly,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.690
and it always seemed
to me at the time that

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:58.690
what these patients were
expressing was a problem in living.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.117
When people would come in
with nonspecific problems

00:14:01.117 --> 00:14:06.117
and we never quite got to the
root of a medical diagnosis,

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:06.963
it always seemed to me

00:14:06.963 --> 00:14:09.420
they were expressing problems in living,

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.590
and that one needed to look
at their problems in living,

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.860
and how they manifested
themselves in physical problems.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.360
So to the extent that I understood

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.780
what Len Syme and John Cassel were doing,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.800
that seemed to me exactly
what they were doing.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.610
And that's why I jumped readily, and said,

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.504
yep, that's what I want to do.

00:14:28.504 --> 00:14:33.504
- So how did Berkeley affect and shape

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.253
the directions of your thinking?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.550
- It had an enormous impact, really.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.550
As I've already said, I came
out of a rather conventional,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.420
straight up-and-down,

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.680
high-quality but conventional
medical education.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.930
And I used to say at the time

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.720
when I came to Berkeley
that it seemed to me

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.547
that it was one big
department of social concern.

00:14:55.547 --> 00:14:56.380
(Harry laughs)

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.250
My wife was a graduate student

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.600
in architecture and city planning,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.580
and she was being given
the same books to read

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.580
that I was being given.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.410
You know, we were all
reading Thomas Kuhn's,

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.210
Structure of Scientific Revolutions,

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.120
and we were thinking
about systems analysis.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.510
And so it didn't seem to matter

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.040
which department you were in,

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.350
you were reading the same books

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.840
and thinking the same thoughts.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.420
- In political science too.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.840
- And presumably political science,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.460
it was one big department
of social concern.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.133
The second thing was
that Len Syme said to me,

00:15:28.437 --> 00:15:30.507
"Just 'cause you've
read some medical books

00:15:30.507 --> 00:15:32.847
"doesn't mean you have
any particular insight

00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:35.967
"on the determinants of
health in societies."

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.240
That was pretty shocking.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.650
I thought, I mean, who would know

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.970
about determinants of
health other than doctors?

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.020
I was a doctor, by golly, and
if I didn't know, who would?

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.420
And the idea that sociologists,
economists, psychologists,

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.880
biologists who weren't doctors,

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.040
might all have something to
say about this was shocking,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.750
and illuminating, I
mean just mind-opening.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.990
And you know, the pluses and minuses

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.710
of the American educational system,

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.810
the minuses are you do a lot
that's a bit superficial,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.690
the pluses are you do a lot
that's a bit superficial.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.690
And so, going around
the campus and sampling

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.950
in anthropology, and
sociology, and economics,

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.240
and the philosophy of science,

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.430
I had a wonderful time
in philosophy of science.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.770
And the fact that there were
so many good people around

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.970
really was mind-expanding,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.410
and just changed the way
I thought about research

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.460
and about my subject.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.610
And the other thing, of course,

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.610
is that this was the early '70s,

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.670
and the '60s were not really yet over,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.370
certainly not at Berkeley.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.900
- Before we talk about the '60s,

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.890
so, in a way, what was
fertile and creative

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.770
about Berkeley at that time was

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.140
kind of an interdisciplinary, comparative,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.370
global perspective that
got you out of the box

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:05.950
of the thinking that you were doing.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.250
But you were heading in that direction

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.770
before you came to Berkeley,
you seem to be suggesting.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.870
- Well, I suppose I was,

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.160
which is why I was poised to
take advantage of it here.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.050
I mean if I hadn't been
thinking about that,

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.010
I could have come to Berkeley
and studied epidemiology

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.940
and statistics and health planning,

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.963
and then I could have gone away again.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.390
But so at Berkeley, I was poised,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.760
I mean, it's gene/environment
interactions.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.610
I'm not suggesting my
interest was genetic,

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.780
but you know what I mean,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.133
I had a predisposition, but
there was an environment

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:40.653
that allowed my
predisposition to flourish.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.510
- So how did the '60s affect you,

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.810
being in Berkeley in the '60s?

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.710
- Well, I only came to Berkeley

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.960
at the beginning of the '70s,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.960
but still, Australia was
in the world in the '60s.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.297
- Yeah, so first tell us what happened

00:17:55.297 --> 00:17:57.140
in the '60s in Australia,

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.760
and then how that was reinforced

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.460
when you came here, if at all.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:06.330
- Well, you know, Australia,
I think was influenced

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.220
by this worldwide epidemic of thinking.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.450
And there was a sense
that all the old canons

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.903
were open to question,

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.810
and one didn't necessarily accept things

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.200
just 'cause they'd been accepted before.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.300
Now, within a medical education,

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.150
that didn't change anything very much,

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.763
but within the wider society
and on student campus,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.670
that was all around.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.080
And it was a wonderful
sense, not terribly analytic,

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.780
I have to say, but there
was a wonderful sense

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.944
that anything is possible.

00:18:44.944 --> 00:18:49.180
There was a sense that a focus

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.263
on material goods was inappropriate.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.230
There was a sense that you didn't have

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.760
to follow a conventional route.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.032
And I suppose, in a way,
my going off to Berkeley

00:19:00.032 --> 00:19:03.410
and stepping off the
conventional ladder was

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.320
a manifestation of that
because anything was possible.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.560
More money was being put
into the universities,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.760
things were opening up,
and that affected Sydney,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.360
as it did Berkeley and
London and Berlin and Paris.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.977
And maybe it wasn't quite as
exciting as Paris in 1968,

00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:24.483
but we knew about it, and we
understood it, and we felt it.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.963
- So what does an epidemiologist do?

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.340
- Lots of things.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.903
But essentially, the thing
that distinguishes epidemiology

00:19:36.903 --> 00:19:41.040
is the study of disease in populations.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.410
So to contrast what I did as a clinician,

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.355
in clinical medicine, and
what I do in epidemiology,

00:19:47.355 --> 00:19:51.740
clinicians are trained to
treat individual patients,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.860
that's what they do
first, last, and always,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.780
they treat individual patients.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.690
What I was doing in my own
primitive way in Sydney of asking

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.870
why are these kids getting
asthma again and again?

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.050
Why are they coming back?

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.150
What is it in the environment
in which they live

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.620
that's causing these kids

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.840
to come back and back with asthma?

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.560
It was thinking like an epidemiologist.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.390
It was thinking about causes
out there in the population.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.350
So what epidemiologists do is
study disease in populations,

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.960
and they study the causes
of disease in populations.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.540
Now, my own view is to
do that effectively,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:34.540
they need to do it in collaboration
with other disciplines.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.760
So although epidemiology
has its own set of methods,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.010
we tend to do large population studies,

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.253
we follow large groups
of people, and so on,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.520
but ideally, to try to
understand the problems

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.630
that we're seeking to understand,

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.680
we need to do it in concert with others.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.680
And what are the sources of the paradigms,

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.790
let's use Kuhn's words,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.873
that guide you in the
things that you look at?

00:21:04.244 --> 00:21:08.460
We can move into talking
about the Whitehall Study,

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.540
which is a body of data

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.260
that you've done extensive work with.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:19.200
But what I guess I want to get at is,

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.363
well, what shall we
look at given this data?

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.090
Well, I think one important paradigm,

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.850
one important understanding,

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.490
is that the causes of
individual differences

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.980
in disease may be different

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.730
from the causes of
population rates of disease.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.586
Now, I could generalize it
and say that all disease is

00:21:40.586 --> 00:21:43.950
a combination of genes in the environment.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.383
But let me illustrate.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.120
In England and Wales last year,

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.370
there were about 150,000 deaths
from coronary heart disease,

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.330
and the year before there
were about 150,000 deaths,

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.520
and this year there'll be slightly fewer

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.070
'cause the rate's going down.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.510
But there won't be 100,000
and there won't be 200,000.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:11.510
If it's not 149,400, it will be 149,300.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.900
Now, the people who died last year

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.433
won't die again this year.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.660
So we can ask why did those individuals

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.090
who died last year die, and
other individuals not die?

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.830
That's one sort of question.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.250
Or we can ask why is
the rate such as it is?

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.550
Why do men have a higher rate than women?

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.350
Why is the rate in Hungary
higher than in England?

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.727
Why is the rate in Scotland
higher than in England?

00:22:35.727 --> 00:22:38.620
And why is the rate in
Italy lower than in England?

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.500
And do people who migrate
from Italy to England

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.570
get higher rates when they
migrate from Italy to England?

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.480
And we could know that's the
case without knowing very much

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.853
about any individual Englishman
or Scotsman or Italian,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.860
but we know these general patterns.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.197
Now, it's crucial to know something

00:22:58.197 --> 00:23:01.930
about the individual Englishman,
Scotsman, and Italians,

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.740
or Hungarians to really
understand the problem properly,

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.810
but these determinants of population rates

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.730
of disease are different, potentially,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.860
from the determinants of
individual difference.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.730
Or they may be different,
one should not assume

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.020
that they're the same.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.240
And that's really difficult for somebody

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.900
who's trained in looking
at the individual patient

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.410
to come to grips with initially.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.461
And they say, but if you tell me

00:23:29.461 --> 00:23:31.550
that somebody who migrates from Italy

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.940
to England is subject to
a higher risk of disease

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.690
when he gets to England,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.734
but doesn't it depend on
which individual he is?

00:23:39.734 --> 00:23:42.150
And the answer is, of course it does.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.394
But standing back, and you see
this general pattern relating

00:23:46.394 --> 00:23:48.960
the characteristics of societies

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.360
to those characteristic
societal rates of disease,

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.870
that's terribly important.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.760
And so then when we come to
look at inequalities in health,

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.113
differences between
different social groups,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.200
we don't necessarily
understand why differences

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.500
between different social
groups comes about only

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.083
by studying individuals.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.430
- Now, in a way, one
could say that this is

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.170
a radical perspective, is it not?

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.230
Because when you think about,

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.260
thinking about an individual patient,

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.700
then there is a whole
panoply of organization

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.120
that will provide you with
drugs to treat this individual,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.900
and not go back to the question

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.290
of how did this group of
individuals come to me.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.627
- Yeah, oh, it's quite different.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.580
I mean I had two very important teachers,

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.480
when you were asking
about early influences

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.457
and I was drawing a blank,

00:24:44.457 --> 00:24:45.850
(both laugh)

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.660
but I had two very important teachers,

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.410
Geoffrey Rose in London,

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.130
and before him, Len Syme at Berkeley,

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.740
and they both had a big influence.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.740
And you know, a funny way,

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.050
coming from very different backgrounds

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.530
and very different perspectives

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.270
and really, very different
approaches to the world,

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.003
in a funny way they had a
rather consistent message.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.430
Geoffrey Rose said that
when he started teaching

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:16.430
medical students about
epidemiology and public health,

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.570
he used to say the medical
student should ask the question,

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.963
why did this patient get
this disease at this time?

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.470
And he then later in his life decided that

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.663
that was a rather restricted question.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.190
That was the question
about this individual,

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.840
and that's an appropriate
question for a clinician to ask.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.630
But to ask, why am I seeing
so many more patients

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.890
from this part of the city
than that part of the city

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.560
is a different sort of question.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.210
Why is the rate of disease different is

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.043
a different question.

00:25:53.043 --> 00:25:55.480
The way Len Syme used to put it was

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.240
that there are three
questions one should ask.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.693
If somebody got sick,
what disease would he get?

00:26:03.051 --> 00:26:04.250
The second question is,

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.060
why would one individual
get sick and not another?

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.210
And the third question is,

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.073
why is the rate of disease higher

00:26:10.073 --> 00:26:13.770
under these circumstances and not another?

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.120
And so they were really very
similar perspectives coming

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.640
from very different angles,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.950
but asking the same sort of questions.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.040
So it is quite a radical question.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.530
It's looking at the
determinants of illness,

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.950
and that leads you into looking

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.750
at the societal determinants of illness.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.700
- Now, tell us a little about
what the Whitehall Study is

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.700
and what you found, especially
in the second study.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.840
- Well, the first Whitehall
Study was set up as

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.800
a rather conventional
study of risk factors

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.425
for cardiovascular and
respiratory disease.

00:26:49.425 --> 00:26:52.520
It was in British civil servants.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.693
Why civil servants?

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.240
'Cause there's such a
large number of them,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.680
and there they were easily accessible.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.000
And Professor Donald Reid,
who started the study,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.827
had close connections with
the chief medical advisor

00:27:05.827 --> 00:27:07.410
in the civil service.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.600
So they set up this study,

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.770
and they looked at blood pressure,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.550
and cholesterol, and
smoking, and other things.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.490
And when I arrived in London,
Geoffrey Rose said to me,

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.210
you know, as a matter
of good housekeeping,

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.180
we've just been looking
at what grade men were,

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.380
these were all men,

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.460
at what grade men were
in the civil service,

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.230
where they were in the hierarchy.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.429
And he said, "You're interested

00:27:30.429 --> 00:27:32.226
"in social and psychosocial things.

00:27:32.226 --> 00:27:34.800
"Would you like to look at this?"

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.573
And that's all we had, essentially,

00:27:36.573 --> 00:27:38.370
that was social and psychosocial,

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.450
was just what grade they were.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.057
And so I spent quite a
lot of time looking at it

00:27:42.057 --> 00:27:45.763
in the first Whitehall Study,
and the remarkable finding,

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.460
which ran counter both to
my expectations at the time,

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.580
and I think most other
people's, was firstly,

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.143
just looking at heart disease,

00:27:54.048 --> 00:27:56.450
it was not the case that people

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:01.020
in high stress jobs had a
higher risk of heart attack,

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.897
rather it went exactly the other way.

00:28:02.897 --> 00:28:05.330
People at the bottom of the hierarchy had

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.053
a higher risk of heart attacks.

00:28:08.176 --> 00:28:11.300
Secondly, it was a social gradient.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.730
The lower you were in the
hierarchy, the higher the risk.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.893
So it wasn't top versus
bottom, but it was graded.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.040
And, thirdly, that social gradient applied

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.330
to all the major causes of death.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.845
I'd come out of the model of

00:28:27.845 --> 00:28:29.680
well, if you want to
understand heart disease,

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.910
look for the cause of heart disease.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.120
We know something about
cholesterol and blood pressure

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.050
and overweight and diabetes,

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.020
let's look for these things.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.930
But it applied to all the
major causes of death,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.862
to cardiovascular disease,

00:28:41.862 --> 00:28:43.784
to gastrointestinal disease,

00:28:43.784 --> 00:28:46.350
to renal disease, to stroke,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.410
to accidental and violent deaths,

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.210
to cancers that were
not related to smoking,

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.190
as well as cancers that
were related to smoking,

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.390
all the major causes of death.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.023
And this finding of a gradient,

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.680
not only did it run counter to thinking

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.300
at the time about heart attacks,

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.560
that high-status people were supposed

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.440
to get more heart disease.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.300
But secondly, it ran
counter then and still does

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.160
to the way most people think
about inequalities in health.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.310
So in the United States,
disparities in health.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:23.260
We tend to think of them, the
poor, that have poor health,

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.303
and us, the non-poor,
who have better health.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.620
And most social policy is

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.290
about the underserved or the served,

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.900
the underclass or the rest of us.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.300
It's not about a gradient,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.010
it's not about something
that runs from the top

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.640
all the way to the bottom,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.630
and that health follows
that social gradient.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:50.600
And that's kept me exercised
for the last 25 years,

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.060
trying to understand that, and
its implications for policy.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.300
Now, the first question is

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.663
well, maybe civil servants are atypical.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.210
Maybe a top-grade civil
servant hasn't a clue

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.930
what it means to have a stressful job

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.300
because he's protected and so on.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.750
Well, then when we
looked at national data.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.310
There was, indeed, a shallow gradient

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.580
in mortality in national data in Britain.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.550
It wasn't as steep as in Whitehall,

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.990
and that bothered me a bit.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.200
Why not?

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.753
And one of the answers I gave myself was

00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:22.490
that the civil service was better

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:26.997
at classifying people
than the national data,

00:30:26.997 --> 00:30:29.610
the national social classes.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.930
But in practice over the last 20 years,

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.050
we've seen the social gradient
get steeper and steeper

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.570
in the national data,

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.840
so that it's certainly not the case

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.580
that Whitehall is atypical, it's typical.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.450
And we see similar findings
in the United States,

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.520
in Canada, in Australia, in New Zealand,

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.060
and most European countries
that have looked for it.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.030
So that was first thing,

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.090
it's not 'cause Whitehall is atypical.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.820
Secondly, people say, well, look,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.550
we've gotten rid of the problem
in infectious disease now.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.337
In fact, we haven't,
we have HIV and so on,

00:31:01.337 --> 00:31:03.520
but people would say we've
got rid of the problem

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.440
of infectious disease, we're not dealing

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.993
with dirty water and
poor sewage and so on.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.870
We're now in the age
of lifestyle diseases,

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.743
it's 'cause people behave badly.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.190
So we looked at the usual risk factors,

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.440
the one believes that
are related to lifestyle,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.210
smoking prime among them,
but plasma cholesterol,

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.333
things related in part to fatty diet,

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.260
overweight, sedentary lifestyle.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.410
And we asked how much
of the social gradient

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.710
in coronary disease could
be accounted for by smoking,

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.550
blood pressure, cholesterol,

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.897
overweight, and being sedentary.

00:31:41.897 --> 00:31:43.590
And the answer was, somewhere

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:47.241
between a quarter and a third, no more.

00:31:47.241 --> 00:31:50.091
And people said, oh, you didn't
measure smoking properly.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.570
Well, we looked at never smokers,

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.960
and we found the same
gradient in never smokers

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.993
as we found in smokers.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.858
And I had to reassure people,

00:32:00.858 --> 00:32:03.700
I was not saying that
smoking was unimportant.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.603
Whitehall confirmed how
vitally important smoking is.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.640
It's just that smoking
wasn't the prime cause

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.170
of the social gradient in disease.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.650
It was, for example, a
very important contributor

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.250
to the social gradient in lung cancer.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:25.070
And in fact, asking is
there a social gradient

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.050
in lung cancer in non-smokers
is a non-question,

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.920
'cause almost all the lung
cancers occur in smokers.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.210
So that I was by no means
saying smoking was unimportant.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.430
But I was saying when we
look at coronary disease,

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.010
and accidental and violent deaths,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.550
and gastrointestinal and
renal deaths and so on,

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.990
smoking was only some part of the story,

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.400
but there was a lot else.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.390
And similarly, with cholesterol,
there was no difference

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.640
in cholesterol levels
by grade of employment.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.070
So we published data from
the first Whitehall Study

00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:00.894
and said 2/3, at least, of
this gradient is unexplained.

00:33:00.894 --> 00:33:02.770
And we said at the time

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:06.450
that there were two candidates
for the explanation,

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:10.500
psychosocial factors and
other aspects of nutrition

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.200
apart from dietary fat
related to cholesterol.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.780
And we set up the Whitehall II Study

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.160
to test those hypotheses.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.740
This was a new cohort, we
included women as well as men,

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.223
Whitehall I was only men,

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.320
and so they were not the same
people in the first study.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.950
We set this up in the mid-1980s,

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.520
20 years after the
original Whitehall Study.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.600
And the first finding was
that the social gradient

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.690
in health was as steep as it
had been 20 years previously,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.993
hadn't got any less, and that
fitted with national data.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.935
And then what we saw was there
were clear social gradients

00:33:50.935 --> 00:33:55.160
in smoking and lack of physical activity,

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.753
and so on, as we'd found in Whitehall I,

00:33:57.753 --> 00:34:01.760
but in addition now, we showed
very clear social differences

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.950
in people's experience of the workplace,

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:06.993
how much control they had at work,

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.870
how fairly they were treated at work,

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.220
how interesting their work was.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.695
We found clear social gradients

00:34:14.695 --> 00:34:18.453
in people's participation
in social networks.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.040
We found social gradients

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.320
in psychological
attributes like hostility.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.950
- So in the end, what
you're saying is you don't,

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:30.770
and I'm coming at this as a layman now,

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:35.770
that it's not about eliminating hierarchy

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.790
so much as finding the factors

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.850
that can be changed even if

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.110
the hierarchy might remain the same.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:48.700
So what you're finding is
a gold mine of information

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.410
about possible changes that really

00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:53.150
nobody had been looking at,

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.890
and that were very important

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:58.600
in the different rates of death.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.970
- That's right, 'cause as
I've been thinking about it

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.820
over the years, and more
recently, particularly thinking

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.480
about the Hitchcock Lectures at Berkeley,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.310
and struck by the fact that when you look

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.700
at non-human primates you,
of course, find hierarchies,

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.740
but hierarchies in disease.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.890
The subordinate monkeys in captivity

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.290
or baboons in the wild
appear to get more disease

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:24.203
than the dominant ones.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.603
And so that gives me pause.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.557
If you think about this social hierarchy

00:35:30.557 --> 00:35:32.190
and this relation to disease,

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.610
there are at least two possible
ways of thinking about it.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.083
The first is, we could
abolish hierarchies.

00:35:39.145 --> 00:35:40.500
Well, that doesn't sound very promising.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.333
- [Harry] No (laughs).

00:35:41.333 --> 00:35:44.860
- I mean if the baboons have hierarchies

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.417
and the cynomolgus macaque
monkeys have hierarchies,

00:35:47.417 --> 00:35:49.580
and the civil servants have hierarchies,

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.150
and everywhere we look
there are hierarchies,

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.000
that doesn't sound very promising.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.190
The idea of some egalitarian society,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.440
where everybody is exactly the same,

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.800
doesn't seem to be the way to go.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.380
So then the question is,

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:07.250
what is it about position in the hierarchy

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.960
that determines different
rates of disease?

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.840
And given that, the hierarchy
in disease does change.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.340
All societies may have hierarchies,

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.210
but we know that the social gradient

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.250
in disease is not fixed.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.550
It's bigger in some places than others,

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.770
and it can change over time.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.060
And that could be because the magnitude

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.990
of the hierarchies change, but
there's always hierarchies.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.640
But, more importantly,

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.250
it suggests what is it about

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.260
where you are in the hierarchy
that's related to disease,

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.153
and can we do something about that?

00:36:40.153 --> 00:36:42.173
So you ask, is it money?

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.060
Is it prestige, self-esteem?

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.710
And, in fact, what I think is,

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:49.960
is has much more to do

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.170
with how much control you
have over life circumstances,

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.815
and the degree to which you're
able to participate fully

00:36:56.815 --> 00:37:01.193
in society, what Amartya
Sen calls capabilities.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.560
- So it leads you back
to overall human values

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.200
about how we organize the way we work.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.570
- Well, human values,

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:16.290
but in the end I'm a British empiricist,

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:20.650
so human values, I think,
are absolutely crucial here.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:25.650
But I'm also interested
in empirical demonstration

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.920
of how they translate into pathology,

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.180
'cause in the end people go and get sick,

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.850
and a value sounds like
something rather abstract,

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.220
that it's the mind, where, in fact,

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.910
what happens in the mind
has a crucial impact

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:42.710
on what happens in the rest of the body.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:46.670
The mind is part of our
biological makeup as well.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.130
And so the empirical study is

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:53.410
how do sets of values translate

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:57.110
into people's perception of
reality, and that, in turn,

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.550
changes physiology and
leads to risk of disease.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:01.859
So we're trying to deal

00:38:01.859 --> 00:38:04.890
in a crude way with a mind/body question

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:07.373
of how the one translates into the other.

00:38:08.532 --> 00:38:09.740
- And this is interesting,

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.210
because this is the
new phase of your work,

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.780
trying to find this biological link.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.170
So the output, in a way, is disease,

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:23.170
and the input is this
hierarchy, the social gradient.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.270
And the intervening variable is changes

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.360
in the body basically, over time,

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.700
and the way stress operates on
the hormonal system, is that?

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.750
- Yes, although there are
one or two other intervening,

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.230
so that if we've got
position in the hierarchy,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.810
then we're asking what does that mean

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.880
in terms of relationships
in the workplace,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.880
in the wider society, control
over events and participation.

00:38:50.357 --> 00:38:54.280
And how that, the
satisfaction of those needs,

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.100
or the frustration of those needs

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.960
for control and participation,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.220
how that translates into
physiological changes.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.200
And you used the word stress.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.620
I didn't, although I
think it is a useful word.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.530
The reason I didn't use the
word stress is people say,

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.503
oh, stress, you can't define
it, you can't measure it.

00:39:13.503 --> 00:39:14.406
- You can't do away with it.

00:39:14.406 --> 00:39:15.250
- You can't do away with it.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.300
You know, one person's stress
is another person's happiness.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.230
And all the usual things
around the stress paradigm.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.190
But, in fact, it is a useful
way to think about it.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:29.160
And the way we've approached
the measurement issue is not

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.320
to say is he or she under stress?

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.220
But to ask, let's try and characterize,

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.720
can we characterize
their work circumstances?

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.260
Can we characterize their
social life in measurable ways?

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.880
And then ask is that related
to physiological changes,

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.320
to endocrine changes, and, in turn,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.863
to other bodily changes that we can see,

00:39:51.863 --> 00:39:55.210
that we think are linked
to risk of disease?

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.360
- And this is why actually,
as I listen to you,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:02.360
why your base in empirical
data becomes very important

00:40:02.678 --> 00:40:06.799
because it avoids entering into a realm

00:40:06.799 --> 00:40:11.799
of sort of general
discussion about these issues

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:16.020
without making it very concrete.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:21.020
How does the comparative
perspective enter into this?

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:24.080
I know that you're involved
in studies in Europe,

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.902
you've looked at populations

00:40:25.902 --> 00:40:28.940
from the former Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.326
What does that bring to the table

00:40:32.326 --> 00:40:36.540
in furthering the insights
that you're already making?

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:41.540
- Well, it brings at least
two rather important things.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.960
The first is just a methodological
point, but a crucial one.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.140
When I show, and it's happened

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.280
from the very beginning
of the Whitehall Studies,

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.070
when I show that people rank them

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.410
according to their social position

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.839
and that's linked to their health,

00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:02.560
then one of the early questions,

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.110
I've already mentioned two,

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:05.797
you know, is it 'cause of civil servants?

00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:07.770
And is it 'cause of behaviors?

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.960
The next question people ask is

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.270
yeah, but people aren't randomly allocated

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.420
to their positions in society.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.490
Maybe people who are
genetically predisposed

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:21.360
to be superior end up superior,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.000
and those same genetic predispositions

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.913
to being superior leads to better health.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.110
Or, alternatively, a variant on that is

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.770
that people's health status determines

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.960
where they end up socially,

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.430
it's not where they end up socially

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:37.680
that determines their health.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.730
That I've got the cart before the horse,

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:44.730
and that my whole argument
about social causation collapses

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.810
because it's simply genetic
differences determining health,

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.090
and health determining social position.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.610
And that's not a straw man, by the way.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.320
It doesn't sound very politically correct,

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.740
but there are a lot of people out there

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.340
who believe that to be the case.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.140
Well, there are a number of ways

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.550
of trying to answer to that.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.830
But one is, well, look at what's happened

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:06.680
to Central and Eastern Europe.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.680
Whole societies change
radically, incredibly quickly.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:17.650
If we look at life expectancy
in Central and Eastern Europe,

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:22.670
let's say 1970, so 15 years, sorry,

00:42:23.586 --> 00:42:27.682
25 years after the end of World War II,

00:42:27.682 --> 00:42:29.360
and we look at the countries

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.020
in Central and Eastern Europe compared

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.500
with the countries of Western Europe,

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.250
the democratic countries,

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.360
then life expectancy was
fairly similar, east and west.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.710
It was always a bit lower
in the former Soviet Union,

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:41.610
but fairly similar.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:42.443
And then what happened?

00:42:42.443 --> 00:42:46.340
Over the last two decades
of the Communist period,

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.740
life expectancy for men, particularly,

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.510
actually declined in
Central and Eastern Europe,

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.530
actually got worse, whereas it got better

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.570
year-on-year in the West.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:59.100
So the gap between east
and west increased.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:04.100
And then post-1989, things
changed dramatically.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.280
Life expectancy took a tumble,

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.910
got very much worse,

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.700
very quickly in the former Soviet Union,

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.853
particularly in Belarus, in
the Ukraine, and in Russia.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.060
And life expectancy after
the initial drop started

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.070
to improve in the Czech
Republic, in Poland,

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.140
and then a bit later in Hungary.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.180
So you've got this splaying out.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.590
Now, whole countries don't
get changes like that

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:31.480
because of changes in
genetic predisposition.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.190
I think it's just not
credible that changes

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.810
in health status determined
the changes in the economy

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:41.340
and the economic fortunes
of the former Soviet Union.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.980
It's just ludicrous, it
clearly was not the case.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.350
And so that it doesn't, by itself,

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:52.830
argue that the determinants of
the social gradient in health

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:54.740
within a country can't be genetic

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.430
or can't be determined by health just

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:58.890
because you can't see it.

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:00.370
But given that we think that some

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.402
of the same causes are operating,

00:44:02.402 --> 00:44:04.470
and this is my second point now,

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.526
the first one being the technical one,

00:44:06.526 --> 00:44:09.730
that we do think some of the
same causes might account

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:13.600
for the differences in
health across Europe

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.797
as account for the social gradient

00:44:14.797 --> 00:44:18.020
in health within a country, why?

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.010
Because, in general, those
European countries were all

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.430
above the threshold of
absolute deprivation.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.063
Infant mortality was low.

00:44:26.193 --> 00:44:30.020
There's a prima facie case
that during the '70s and '80s

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.720
they were not suffering from poverty.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.310
We know, for example, the
Czech school children,

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.160
we studied this, their
growth was at least equal

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.920
to Western European school children.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.204
So it looked like the
children were well nourished

00:44:43.204 --> 00:44:45.800
there was investment in children,

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.430
there wasn't absolute poverty.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:51.470
And yet heath suffered,
particularly in middle aged men.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:52.670
And that's what led me to ask

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:55.140
maybe the same set of
factors are going on.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:00.140
And the whole idea that lack
of control over your life,

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:04.840
lack of opportunity to
participate socially

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.240
in a meaningful way,

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.280
could affect whole
societies, not just people,

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280
depending on where they were

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.010
within the gradient within a society,

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.950
was really rather powerful.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.710
And it suggested that
the way we ought to think

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.623
about health policy should change.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:21.974
- Now when you were in that hospital

00:45:21.974 --> 00:45:25.510
as a young medical doctor,
and you saw this person,

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.220
you say hey, he's been here before.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.790
You know, why am I seeing so many people?

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:33.210
That led you in this life's
journey to actually focus

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.230
on the relationships
that the data revealed.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:41.410
But now you're moving really
to another step, which is,

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.240
well, once we know that,

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.900
if we truly know this and it
can be proved scientifically,

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.367
then we can go about changing things.

00:45:49.367 --> 00:45:51.900
What insights have you garnered

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.900
about how this scientific
information can contribute

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.750
to a process of changing society,

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:05.340
its view of public health, and
actually making a difference?

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.880
- Well, the line that I've pursued,

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.570
and this is not necessarily the right way,

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.720
other people can do it different ways,

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.720
is not to use the evidence as a soapbox.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.940
So I didn't think by
standing on volumes of data

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.530
I could then shout louder,
and that would work.

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.900
The line that I've pursed is

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.750
that we need lots of
people to make changes.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.498
We need people who are good
at standing on soapboxes

00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:35.910
and formulating ways
to change politically,

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.090
but we also need the evidence.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:41.010
And given that during the time

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.794
that I've been working in Britain,

00:46:42.794 --> 00:46:45.177
for the first 18 years,

00:46:45.177 --> 00:46:46.820
nearly the first 18 years,

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.570
I went back to England in 1976.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.900
We had an intensely
conservative government,

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.550
from 1979 to 1997.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:47:00.160
And so to bang on about how
health and equalities were

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.160
immoral and unjust would
not have reached much favor.

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:09.070
But to say, this is
what the evidence shows,

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.220
this is what the evidence shows,

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.760
that if we want to do something

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.743
about improving health
for the whole population,

00:47:15.743 --> 00:47:18.120
we need to focus on the people

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.810
whose health is not improving

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:22.060
to the same extent as those who are,

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.350
and ask how can we do something about it,

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:26.470
and this is what the evidence shows.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:30.170
So I've always tried to
stick close to the evidence,

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.940
to say that we need to help the people

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.710
whose business it is to formulate policy,

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.060
we need to help them,

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:40.200
but we need to help them in
the light of our judgment

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.980
of what the evidence shows.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.240
Now it's not simply saying
here are some facts.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.900
Of course, it's trying to achieve

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.220
a synthesis of the evidence

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.315
and present it in a way that
will help the policymakers.

00:47:52.315 --> 00:47:56.190
But I think it's important, in my view,

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.030
to try and present it to governments

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:00.350
of the right as well as the left,

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:03.290
so that when we had a change
of government in Britain

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:05.720
from a Conservative to
a Labour government,

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.530
they were more ready to acknowledge

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:11.310
that inequalities in health existed,

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.370
they were more ready to apply the label

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:15.040
inequalities in health,

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.670
and they were more ready to
try to do something about it.

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:22.780
We could then feed our
evidence into that process.

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.920
And say, in fact, they
set up something called

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.530
the Independent Inquiry
into Inequalities in Health,

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:31.680
under the chairmanship of a
former chief medical officer,

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.200
Sir Donald Acheson.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.230
And I served on that inquiry,

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:38.020
and so the evidence that
people like me and others

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.280
had been accruing over the
years then fed into it.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.390
And we could say here are 39 areas

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:48.710
for policy development that
we think, based on evidence,

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:51.080
we can recommend to you as a government.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.393
And now, in fact, I'm involved

00:48:52.393 --> 00:48:54.760
in another government committee

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.890
that's trying to take
those recommendations

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.760
and formulate specific
policies based on them.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.776
So how did I get involved in the policy?

00:49:03.776 --> 00:49:06.180
By sticking close to the evidence

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.630
and saying this is what I think it shows,

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.140
and this is what I think it means.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.901
- In this odyssey, has your definition

00:49:12.901 --> 00:49:16.373
of public health changed in your own mind?

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:18.633
- Yeah, very much.

00:49:19.558 --> 00:49:21.390
I mean see, when I was a medical student,

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.680
I thought public health
was to do with drains.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.430
- [Harry] What again, I'm sorry.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:26.263
- Drains.

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:27.371
- [Harry] I see.

00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:31.080
- We had lectures from somebody
who'd been very important

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.240
in public health in New Guinea,

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.549
and he drew diagrams of how
you dig a deep pit latrine.

00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:36.382
- [Harry] Okay, oh I see.

00:49:36.382 --> 00:49:37.740
- I'm sure it's very important to know how

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.550
to dig a deep pit latrine in New Guinea,

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:44.550
but that's how public
health was taught to us.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.270
And then when I went a bit further,

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:50.930
I thought well public
health was about preventing

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.403
these individual patients
from coming back,

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.573
and then I started to
think more about society.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.979
So even when I was in Berkeley,

00:50:01.979 --> 00:50:05.210
we were doing studies
of Japanese migrants,

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.760
the fact that when Japanese change

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.600
from one environment to another,

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.858
their health rates changed.

00:50:10.858 --> 00:50:15.858
But I still didn't quite think
about societal organization.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.230
I thought this was to do

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:20.550
with their culture and their behavior.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.430
It was only when I
looked at this gradient,

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:24.970
by grade of employment.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:26.630
As a fairly ignorant person,

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.190
I thought what on earth does this mean?

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:32.360
And it was this simple
finding of the gradient

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.960
that got me to thinking
about what does it mean,

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.570
and set me off on this odyssey

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.500
about the social determinants of health.

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.203
And that, of course,

00:50:44.154 --> 00:50:46.890
you have your own form of a midlife crises

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:51.560
of saying, well, maybe the
purpose of doing this research is

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.390
not to publish one more paper,

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:54.820
important as that is,

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.870
maybe the purpose of the research is

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.520
to try and change things.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.970
And so you would implement it.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.450
- In something that you wrote or said,

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:07.450
you pointed out that where
this all leads you is

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:12.193
to a view of a larger
picture, so that, for example,

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:15.540
the idea of sustainable development

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:20.540
actually comes to have
a public health meaning.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.280
For example, I think you were talking

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.253
about relating transport systems

00:51:24.253 --> 00:51:27.330
to the general health of the public.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.220
Help us understand that.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.650
- Well, this was partly an attempt by me

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:34.130
to bring different bits
of my life together.

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:37.710
I spent six years on Her
Majesty's Royal Commission

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:39.243
on Environmental Pollution.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:44.143
And I didn't know anything
about environmental pollution,

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:49.190
and you know I guess that's the
nature of royal commissions,

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:51.050
that you get people who
know about something,

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.700
and then you ask them to
deliberate on something else.

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.490
And everybody around the
table was expert in something,

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.013
but not necessarily what
we were deliberating on.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.210
But spending six years on this,

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:05.660
I tried to think what did it have to do

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.400
with the things that I was interested in.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.540
And if you think that
sustainable development,

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.951
people criticize it in a bit
the way they criticize stress.

00:52:14.951 --> 00:52:15.784
You know, what is it?

00:52:15.784 --> 00:52:18.071
You can't define it, you
can't measure it, and so on.

00:52:18.071 --> 00:52:20.660
The original Brundtland definition was

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:24.390
that the needs of something like

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:26.800
if the next generation
shouldn't be compromised

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.950
by what the present generation should do.

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:34.070
But if you think that
sustainable development implies

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:36.664
three legs of a three-legged stool,

00:52:36.664 --> 00:52:41.440
economic, social, and environment,

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.300
physical, biological environment,

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.380
then suddenly, that spoke to me.

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.940
I thought ah-ha!

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:50.949
That's the link between
what I do in my day job,

00:52:50.949 --> 00:52:53.030
think about inequalities in health,

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:56.950
and what I do on this very
time-consuming royal commission.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:59.190
And sustainable development
is a way of thinking

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:02.510
about the economic, the
social, and the environmental.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:03.890
Now, I'd like to include,

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.040
although the sustainable development folks

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.240
tend to think of the environmental

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.160
as physical and biological environment,

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.670
I'd like to muddy the waters

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.518
and say well, social and economic,

00:53:13.518 --> 00:53:16.390
well, the environment is
also social and economic.

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:18.223
It's not just physical, but still.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.990
So if you look both the problems,

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:26.550
environmental problems and the solutions,

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:28.993
they clearly have a
social/economic dimension.

00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:34.950
Take the example, should we tax fuel?

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.620
Should we tax fuel?

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.450
In the United States,

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:44.330
you don't quite understand
what taxing fuel means,

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:47.840
you should come to Britain and
see what taxing fuel means,

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.790
how much we pay for a liter of gasoline.

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.450
Should we tax fuel?

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:55.030
Well, there's a case to be made,

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:57.170
and I think the evidence
would probably support it,

00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:59.810
that if you really tax fuel,

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:01.893
you'd have to have a swingeing tax,

00:54:01.893 --> 00:54:04.250
really, to change consumption

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:07.260
because the elasticity demand related

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.810
to the price of fuel is rather shallow,

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:12.050
it's not very elastic.

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:14.180
'cause in the end, if people
need to use their cars,

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.507
they need to use their cars.

00:54:15.507 --> 00:54:17.090
But if you really taxed it

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.390
to the extent that you change behavior,

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:22.490
it's highly likely that richer people

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.400
would change their behavior
less than poorer people.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.750
So there would be a real
equity dimension to this.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.260
By taxing fuel to a really high extent,

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.940
such that it would change behavior,

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.680
you might actually make it much harder

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.040
for poorer people to get about.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.600
So if you've said that moving about is

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.650
a right in our society,

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:46.390
that would be a right that
would be unequally distributed,

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.090
because richer people would be
able to drive their big cars

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.360
and they'd get the riffraff off the road,

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.360
so that they wouldn't
have the roads clogged up

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.360
with all these old bangers.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.270
And the poor people,

00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:58.370
unless you had good public transport,

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.820
would have their mobility restricted.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.660
So doing something for good
environmental reasons has

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.640
a clear equity dimension to it,

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.880
a clear fairness dimension to it.

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.157
And I don't think we should think

00:55:10.157 --> 00:55:13.010
about the one without the other.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:14.980
Take the issue of fuel poverty.

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.410
We know in Britain that
if you define fuel poverty

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.282
as spending something
like 10% of your income

00:55:20.282 --> 00:55:25.282
on home heating, then the estimates vary,

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:30.150
but it may be several hundred
thousand, if not more,

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.483
households are suffering
from fuel poverty.

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.690
Well, as a royal commission,

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.033
we've been recommending a carbon tax.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:43.120
What would be the impact of a carbon tax?

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.530
That poor people would find it

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:47.290
even more difficult to heat their homes

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:49.190
because the price would go up.

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:50.670
And rich people could heat their homes

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:51.820
to their heart's content

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.250
because they'd be less
sensitive to that price rise.

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:57.710
So that thinking about a carbon tax,

00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:00.850
and this is a point I made
in our own discussions

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.160
on the royal commission,

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.990
we need to think about
the equity dimension,

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.610
so we don't make life harder for people.

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:07.460
And, particularly,

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.620
if we didn't think it would
change consumption very much,

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.640
why would you want to belt
poorer people around the head

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.640
and punish them for
being poor even further?

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.810
And so without addressing
their general living standards

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:21.080
through the tax and benefit system,

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.710
I would be most uncomfortable
with a flat tax,

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.710
which is, in the sense,
what a consumption tax is.

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:31.710
So that there are a couple of examples.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.900
Now, broadening it,

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.560
of how sustainable development

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.230
and inequalities in health
come together, broadening it,

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:43.432
we want to look at what
constitutes living environments.

00:56:43.432 --> 00:56:46.740
We were asked by the
World Health Organization

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.400
a few years ago to try
and summarize our work

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.762
on the social determinants of health

00:56:51.762 --> 00:56:55.530
in a way that might be
amenable to policymakers.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:57.690
And as I look at what we came up with,

00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.400
we called it The Solid Facts,

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.490
what we came up with and
what people who were talking

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:05.100
about sustainable
development come up with,

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.000
thinking about sustainable communities

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.560
in which people live and work,

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.815
there's a high degree of overlap,

00:57:10.815 --> 00:57:13.060
that people need to be able to get about,

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.270
they need to have air
that they can breathe,

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:17.980
water that's free of chemical pollution,

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:22.720
and so on, as well as a
habitable social environment.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.640
So I think these two
agendas come together,

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.396
whatever rude words people
say about the imprecision

00:57:28.396 --> 00:57:31.800
of the sustainable development concept.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.990
- Dr. Marmot, on that
note, our time has run out.

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:39.660
Thank you very much for
sharing with us this journey,

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.280
both of your thinking
and of your life's work,

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.920
it's been quite fascinating.

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.753
- Thank you.

00:57:44.753 --> 00:57:46.590
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:49.381
