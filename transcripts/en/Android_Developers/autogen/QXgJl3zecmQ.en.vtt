from the tag event I tried some tricks
 

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.120
from the tag event I tried some tricks
like making a static tag object and

either and it sounds a bit bit like a

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600
either and it sounds a bit bit like a

either and it sounds a bit bit like a
bad piece of engineering as well you

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:17.410
bad piece of engineering as well you
 

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.590
bad piece of engineering as well you
know well there's there's there's the

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600
know well there's there's there's the
 

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.330
know well there's there's there's the
difference between just make this work

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:21.340
difference between just make this work
 

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.940
difference between just make this work
and go to production with it yeah least

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:23.950
and go to production with it yeah least
 

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.930
and go to production with it yeah least
I hope there's a difference so failing

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:27.940
I hope there's a difference so failing
 

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.400
I hope there's a difference so failing
there's the furling a short term

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:29.410
there's the furling a short term

of it then I think the original intent

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:24.970
of it then I think the original intent
 

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.240
of it then I think the original intent
is still there but if the user presses

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:27.250
is still there but if the user presses
 

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.740
is still there but if the user presses
the back button then the activity is

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:28.750
the back button then the activity is
 

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.090
the back button then the activity is
destroyed and I think it's going to take

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.100
destroyed and I think it's going to take
 

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.640

other backup service yes I think what he

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:21.300
other backup service yes I think what he
 

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.730
other backup service yes I think what he
wants to do is does he want to back up

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740
wants to do is does he want to back up
 

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.530
wants to do is does he want to back up

do have a settings page consider

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:12.329
do have a settings page consider
 

00:46:12.329 --> 00:46:13.909
do have a settings page consider
breaking out your settings into like the

00:46:13.909 --> 00:46:13.919
breaking out your settings into like the
 

00:46:13.919 --> 00:46:15.409
breaking out your settings into like the
common core settings and like an

00:46:15.409 --> 00:46:15.419
common core settings and like an
 

00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:17.659
common core settings and like an
advanced section something like that see

00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:17.669
advanced section something like that see
 

00:46:17.669 --> 00:46:20.120
advanced section something like that see
they're not completely overwhelming for

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:20.130
they're not completely overwhelming for
 

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:24.499
they're not completely overwhelming for
more casual users yeah person your

00:46:24.499 --> 00:46:24.509
more casual users yeah person your
 

00:46:24.509 --> 00:46:26.959
more casual users yeah person your
fellow settings where possible yeah yeah

00:46:26.959 --> 00:46:26.969
fellow settings where possible yeah yeah
 

00:46:26.969 --> 00:46:28.759
fellow settings where possible yeah yeah
you should make the right choices on

00:46:28.759 --> 00:46:28.769
you should make the right choices on
 

00:46:28.769 --> 00:46:32.029
you should make the right choices on
their behalf I'm sort of I've been a

00:46:32.029 --> 00:46:32.039

that the difference between a really

00:46:49.159 --> 00:46:49.169
that the difference between a really
 

00:46:49.169 --> 00:46:52.159
that the difference between a really
good system or app and a not-so-good one

00:46:52.159 --> 00:46:52.169
good system or app and a not-so-good one
 

00:46:52.169 --> 00:46:55.459
good system or app and a not-so-good one
is when is when the designers really

00:46:55.459 --> 00:46:55.469
is when is when the designers really
 

00:46:55.469 --> 00:46:57.349
is when is when the designers really
think things all the way through and

00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359
think things all the way through and
 

00:46:57.359 --> 00:46:59.300
think things all the way through and
make the best decision for most

00:46:59.300 --> 00:46:59.310

people um you know at least just like
 

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:04.280
people um you know at least just like
you said an excessively flexible system

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:04.290
you said an excessively flexible system
 

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.470
you said an excessively flexible system
is a chaotic one and just leaves people

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480
is a chaotic one and just leaves people
 

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.340
is a chaotic one and just leaves people
looking bewildered and you can you can

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:10.350
looking bewildered and you can you can
 

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.040
looking bewildered and you can you can
look to for example the major competing
