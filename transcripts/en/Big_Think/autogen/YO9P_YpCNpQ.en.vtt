those two experiences led me to want to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
those two experiences led me to want to
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.699
those two experiences led me to want to
start something that used the principles

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709
start something that used the principles
 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.410
start something that used the principles
that I've learned over the last 15 years

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

distributed information management to
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319
distributed information management to
actually improve the situation so I went

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
actually improve the situation so I went
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.819
actually improve the situation so I went

these emergent systems and he I said

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219
these emergent systems and he I said
 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.349
these emergent systems and he I said
shouldn't we do something about this

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359
shouldn't we do something about this
 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.909
shouldn't we do something about this
shouldn't we you know and he's on the

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:46.919

and he said yeah I've been thinking

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
and he said yeah I've been thinking
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.399
and he said yeah I've been thinking
about this for several years and I just

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
about this for several years and I just
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.559
about this for several years and I just
haven't had a chance to do it so why

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.949
with some Harbor professors and so I
went back to Harvard and I ended up

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959
went back to Harvard and I ended up
 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.290
went back to Harvard and I ended up
talking to the medical people the guys

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300

they said this is a great idea this is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
they said this is a great idea this is
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.729
they said this is a great idea this is
going to happen we don't know what it

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739
going to happen we don't know what it
 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.869
going to happen we don't know what it
looks like but you're probably the guy

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879
looks like but you're probably the guy
 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:15.440
looks like but you're probably the guy
to figure it out

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
to figure it out
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.510
to figure it out
let's let's do this so that's how it all

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
let's let's do this so that's how it all
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.800
let's let's do this so that's how it all
got going and as I've gotten more into

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810
got going and as I've gotten more into
 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.690
got going and as I've gotten more into
it I've really understood the sort of

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700
it I've really understood the sort of
 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.839
it I've really understood the sort of
difficulties of medical service design

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849
difficulties of medical service design
 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.910
difficulties of medical service design
if you will the design of the experience

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
if you will the design of the experience
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.320
if you will the design of the experience
of getting your health care so you can

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330
of getting your health care so you can
 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.210

call a doctor and you have to go through
 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.580
call a doctor and you have to go through
six different you know buttons to try to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
six different you know buttons to try to
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.620
