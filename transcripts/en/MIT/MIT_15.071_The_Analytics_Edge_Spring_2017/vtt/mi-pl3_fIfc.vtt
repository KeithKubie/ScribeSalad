00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.740
We next discuss
interventions suggested

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.850
by the model developed for
the Framingham Heart Study.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.020
The first intervention
has to do with drugs

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.920
to lower blood pressure.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.670
In FDR's time,
hypertension drugs

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.410
were too toxic
for practical use.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.630
But in the 1950s, the diuretic
chlorothiazide was developed,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.520
and the Framingham Heart
Study gave Ed Freis

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.090
the evidence needed to argue
for testing effects for blood

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.630
pressure drugs.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.810
In fact, the Veterans
Administration Trial

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.810
was conducted.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.470
This was a randomized,
double blind clinical trial,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.490
that found decreased risk
of coronary heart disease.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.770
Now, the market for
diuretics worldwide

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.940
is more than a billion dollars.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.260
Another intervention had to do
with-- to lower cholesterol.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.690
Despite the Framingham results,
early cholesterol drugs

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.750
were too toxic
for practical use.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.270
But in the 1970s, the first
statins were developed.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.890
The study of 4,444
patients with CHD

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.900
revealed that statins
cause a 37% risk

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.510
reduction of a
second heart attack.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.470
Furthermore, a study of 6,595
men with high cholesterol

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.420
revealed that statins cause a
32% risk reduction in deaths.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.150
Now, the market for
statins worldwide

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.440
is more than $20 billion.
