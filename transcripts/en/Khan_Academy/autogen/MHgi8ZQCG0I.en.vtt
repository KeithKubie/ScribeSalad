00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:03.984
 Fabiano wants to score at least 6.5 points 

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:06.887
 on an important chess competition. 

00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:10.440
 He gets one point for each game he wins, 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.440
 and 0.5 points for each game that ends in a draw. 

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:18.345
 Write an inequality that shows the number of games, 

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:20.460
 which Fabiano must win, 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.338
 and finish it equally to achieve its goal. 

00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:25.219
 I recommend that you pause the video and see if it is 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:25.904
 you can do it. 

00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:27.900
 Write inequalities in terms of number of games, 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.100
 which he won, marked with mainly "W", 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.900
 and the number of games completed in a row, marked with "D", 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.260
 which presents what he should do, 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.977
 to achieve its goal. 

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:39.276
 Okay, let's do it together. 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.380
 How many points will he get from victories? 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.700
 If he wins in W games 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.409
 and received one point for each of them, 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.036
 there will be one point of play in the number of games. 

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:54.497
 1 on W can write it only as W. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:03.300
 These are the points of the victories. 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.175
 And how many points will he draw from the draw? 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.200
 He will have D draws 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.580
 and will receive 0.5 points for each of them. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:28.120
 0.5 by D will be the points of the games that have ended in a draw. 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.600
 And this here will be his common points, 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.996
 points of victory and draw points. 

00:01:31.996 --> 00:01:34.441
 I assume that he does not get any points at a loss. 

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.280
 As he wants the total number of points he receives, 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.536
 be at least 6.5. 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.940
 He wants this to be greater than or equal to 6.5. 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.580
 If it is said that Fabiano wants to win more than 6.5 points, 

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:53.817
 then it will be greater than. 

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:57.997
 But it is said that Fabiano wants to score at least 6.5 points, 

00:01:57.997 --> 00:02:00.458
 so we have greater than or equal to 6.5. 

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:02.663
 He will be pleased if he scores 6.5 points. 

00:02:02.663 --> 00:02:05.280
 And here we wrote the inequality of the number of games, 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.900
 which he has to win or end in a draw, 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.000
 this inequality must be true, 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.760
 to gain at least 6.5 points 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.990
 of this important chess competition.
