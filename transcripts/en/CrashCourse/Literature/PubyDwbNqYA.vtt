00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
Hi, I'm John Green.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Crash Course Literature and last week we wrapped up our discussion of George Orwell's 1984.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.460
Lately here at Crash Course, we've been a bit preoccupied with dystopias -- which is to say, imagined futures where things have gone horribly wrong.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.160
You know, as opposed to the present.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.500
I've always loved a good dystopia.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:25.200
They can show us the signposts pointing toward disaster, remind us of the resilience of humanity, help us to think through the consequences of social and political change...

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.060
... And also fill us with pure and unadulterated terror, which brings us to Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.020
Atwood said that Orwell's 1984 was a direct model for The Handmaid's Tale, which she began writing in the actual 1984.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.000
In a Guardian article, she explained that she intended to present a dystopia from a female point of view.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.080
Which is to say they've been either the wife in 1984 or the mistress in 1984.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:12.720
Today we're going to discuss the real despotisms that inspired Atwood, introduce you to her red-cloaked and stony-faced protagonist Offred, and explain why the author characterizes her novel as speculative fiction.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.860
If you like, you can even turn on the captions and read along because reading is not illegal... yet.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.260
Margaret Atwood was born in 1939 in Ottawa, Canada.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.820
She's the author of over 40 books of fiction and poetry and essays.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.780
She's also one of Canada's leading literary critics.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:44.200
Her 1972 survey "Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature" investigates what gives Canadian works their distinctive national identity.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.640
She's also really good at Twitter.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.940
Oh, it's already time for the open letter?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.320
An open letter to authors' Twitter accounts.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.580
But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today?

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.460
Oh, it's nothing.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.180
What a crushing disappointment.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.180
Just like most authors' Twitter accounts.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.700
Dear authors' Twitter accounts, oh my gosh, why do you have to ruin it?!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.460
There's such an incredible magic to reading a book that you love and that you're overwhelmed by the beauty of and you think, "I can't believe that this book was written by a person!"

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.920
"That person must be so amazing!"

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.600
And then you go to Twitter and you look up their Twitter account and they're complaining about the wireless at Panera not working, or their flight was delayed, or they're enjoying their vacation in Cape Cod.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.820
And it turns out that they're just, like, a totally regular person (except for Margaret Atwood).

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.780
I almost universally find author Twitter accounts to be a complete disappointment -- and I have to say, mine more than most .

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.840
And yet, somehow, a few authors retain their intimidating and intoxicating brilliance on Twitter, and by "a few", I mostly mean Margaret Atwood.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.820
Best wishes, John Green.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.440
Atwood's childhood was tranquil and somewhat idyllic.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.640
When not being homeschooled by her mother, she trailed her father and entomologists through the backwoods of Quebec, which sounds pretty great, especially if you're into Canadian bugs!

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.500
They're a lot like American bugs, except much more polite, and also they spend half as much money on healthcare, but get better healthcare.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.840
Are we still talking about bugs?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.980
Anyway, given all of this, you might be wondering what Atwood could possibly know of the real despotisms on the scale scene in the Republic of Gilead, the fictional government in The Handmaid's Tale.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.600
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret of the authoring trade.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.700
Not all fiction is autobiographical.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.760
Although my most recent novel sort of is, but anyway a related point -- it's also possible to respond to history that one has experienced from a remove.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.970
Especially if you're a genius and Margaret Atwood really is as for which events crossed Atwoods radar as she wrote in the mid-1980s

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.949
There's a box labeled Handmaid's Tale background in the University of Toronto's rare book library

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.319
It contains her notes for the novel Rebecca Mead of The New Yorker wrote about there were stories of abortion and contraception

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.750
being outlawed in Romania and reports from Canada lamenting its following birth rate and

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:52.459
Articles from the US about Republican attempts to withhold federal funding from clinics that provided abortion services there were reports about the threat to privacy

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.660
Posed by debit cards which were a novelty at the time and accounts of u.s.. Congressional

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.649
hearings devoted to the regulation of toxic industrial emissions in the wake of the deadly gas leak in Bhopal India an Associated Press

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.919
Item reported on a Catholic congregation in New Jersey being taken over by a fundamentalist sect in which wives were called

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.829
Handmaidens a word that atwood had underlined the events that occur in The Handmaid's Tale are based on these reports

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.788
but filtered through an authorial lens that imagined a nightmare of

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.649
Inequality oppression and enforced ignorant. Let's go to the thought-bubble so The Handmaid's Tale is said in the Republic of Gilead an ultraconservative

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.300
Theocracy within former u.s.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.109
Territory much of the land is radioactive or otherwise poisoned by toxic waste the birth rate has fallen

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.839
dramatically aged are infertile women homosexuals

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.139
political dissidents supporters of abortion non-whites and members of religious groups other than the brand of

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.169
Christianity sanctioned by the state are forced to clean up this toxic material women who have been involved in extramarital

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.440
affairs or second marriages prior to the revolution

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.410
But seem capable of reproducing are forced to become

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.690
Handmaids their purpose is to provide healthy babies for commanders of the military class these women are renamed for the commander that they serve Atwoods

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.739
Protagonist is called offred which signifies her status as a possession

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.950
she is of

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.839
Fred the name also suggests that she is an offering she has been

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.609
Offered to reproduce the other classes of women that remain in gilead include wives

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.419
married to commanders econowives married to lower ranking men Martha's servants in the commander's houses and

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.479
Aunts instructors of handmaids and overseers of executions so the most part these women are denied an education

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:39.559
The right to vote and the chance to work for pay most are also forbidden from reading the novel opens in the Rachel and Leah

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.989
re-education Center a former gymnasium where the hand maids are trained for their life of service in

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.880
Mesmerizing and poetic prose the narrator describes the yearnings that haunt that place

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.709
Dances would have been held there the music lingered a palimpsest of unheard sound

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:58.939
style upon style and undercurrent of drums a forlorn wail

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:01.489
Garland's made of tissue paper flowers

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:09.289
cardboard Devils a revolving ball of mirrors powdering the dancers with the snow of light there was old sex in the room and

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:10.979
loneliness and

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.208
Expectation of something without a shape or name I remember that yearning we yearned for the future

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.328
Thanks thought-bubble, so we all know that yearning for the future

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.858
But in gilead this desire and so many desires have been completely

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.428
Perverted and the future that happened is in a word

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.908
horrific handmaids whisper almost without sound to

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:39.708
communicate as the aunts with cattle prods slung on thongs from their leather belts monitor their every move so this future ended up looking a

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.369
Lot like some terrifying

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:48.409
funhouse version of the past in which state sanctioned depression based on gender and race were the norm and that I think gets at something

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.638
Important in the novel in contemporary life we expect progress in the future

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:57.919
We expect that over time human lives will become longer and healthier and happier and richer

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:03.468
But in Atwoods future when we begin to experience regression the response is to seek

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:10.249
Restoration to some glorified past no matter how oppressive it might be this idea to make a fallen nation strong again

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:14.569
Or great again is one that we all feel at times and in The Handmaid's Tale

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:21.378
We are shown one vision of what can happen when the yearning for the future takes the form of grasping for the past

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:25.548
But so back to the plot Offred had been married to Luke a man who was married once before

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:31.999
And after the couple and their daughter are caught trying to escape to Canada offred becomes a handmaid she sent to the home of

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:35.988
a military commander and forced to undergo a horrifying monthly ritual

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:42.289
Modeled on Genesis 30 in which Rachel and Jacob used their made Bilhah as a surrogate

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:45.828
But let's not mince words here the so called the ceremony is state

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:50.959
Sanctioned rape and in the midst of that ordeal ah Fred makes two really powerful insights first

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:52.959
She notices that the commander is quote

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:59.388
Preoccupied like a man humming to himself in the shower without knowing he's humming like a man who has other things on his mind

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.769
It's as if he's somewhere else, and then she observes that the wife Serena joy

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:07.699
Who was present for the so called ceremony continues lying on the bed,

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:13.068
gazing up at the canopy above her stiff and straight as an effigy Offred wonders

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:16.579
Which of us is at worse for her or me, there's two things

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.389
I want to highlight there first off Fred's empathy even amid this horror

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:22.818
She is able to empathize with the commander's wife

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:27.019
And even with the commander that shows that even at the height of the horrors of this

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.969
Dystopia Offred's humanity is not taken away from her and when you contrast that with 1984

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:37.849
I think it offers a different vision about what governments can and cannot do when it comes to reducing people's humanity.

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:42.888
So there are many victims in Gilead, but there are also several heroines offred's heroism is subtle

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:49.309
But I think it's still very real because she refuses to relinquish what Orwell in 1984 called the "ownlife"

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:56.029
She retains her individualism eccentricity and humanity shortly after the so called ceremony of copulating with the commander

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:02.750
Alfred spreads a packet of butter onto her hands and face as long as we do this butter our skin to keep it soft we

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:10.010
Can believe that we will someday get out that we will be touched again in love or desire we have ceremonies of our own

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:14.479
Private ones and although she describes this act as degrading to such devices

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.050
We have descended finding a way to be comfortable in her skin

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:22.549
Helps Offred remember the desires of her past and to stay sane

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:27.169
Sanity is a valuable possession. I hoard it the way people once hoarded money

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.190
I save it

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.539
So I will have enough when the time comes. That sanity is critical to her

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.809
survival as are her tiny moments of ownlife and resistance.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:41.930
Offred's mother is another heroine a second wave feminist who fought for women's rights and before the Revolution

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:48.529
She was a marcher and a sign waiver and a pornography burner, but ah Fred's mother pays a steep toll for being outspoken

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:52.999
She is exiled to the toxic colonies Offred's college friend Moira is similarly

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.620
brazen in her resistance after staging a daring escape from the re-education Center, though

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.100
Moira is captured

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.100
sterilized and forced to become a sex worker

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.159
Offered wants to believe that Moira will also escape this prison

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.550
I'd like to tell a story about how Moira escaped for good this time

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:13.009
Or if I couldn't tell that I'd like to say she blew up Jezebel's with 50 commanders inside it

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.319
I'd like to end with something daring and

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.789
Spectacular some outrage something that would befit her but as far as I know that didn't happen

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.260
I don't know how she ended or even if she did because I never saw her again

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.559
we see here offered trying to take control of the narrative trying to tell a story that is daring in spectacular where the

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.070
Protagonist wins or at least takes a lot of bad guys out with her

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.769
But she can't those traditional narratives of the hero's journey

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.399
Aren't available to her because they aren't true to her experience

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:47.279
We also never learned how offered mother or offered herself end, but we do know that she finds a way to tell her story

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:54.029
And that her story survives but aside from that we can only speculate which makes a kind of sense because The Handmaid's Tale is

00:10:54.100 --> 00:11:00.899
speculative fiction. In a 2005 interview Atwood defined the genre I'd like to make a distinction between science fiction proper and

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.870
speculative fiction

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:08.609
For me the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can't yet do such as going through a wormhole in

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:14.729
Space to another universe and speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand such as DNA

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:21.329
identification and credit cards and that takes place on planet earth as to the point of speculative literature Atwood writes

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:29.130
Literature is an utter or outering of the human imagination it lets the shadowy forms of thought and feeling heaven hell

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.909
Monsters angels and all out into the light where we can take a good look at them and perhaps come to a better understanding

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:41.458
Of who we are and what we want and what the limits of those wants may be

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.550
Understanding the imagination is no longer a pastime

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.700
But a necessity

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:51.479
Because increasingly if we can imagine it we'll be able to do it part of the magic of The Handmaid's Tale

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.480
Is that it feels so

00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:01.349
real. It belies the old-line that it can't happen here and reminds us it can always happen here. In short The Handmaid's Tale

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:07.260
Is speculative and it is fiction, but that doesn't mean it's untrue. Thanks for watching
