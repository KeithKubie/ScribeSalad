00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.330
Now let's discuss malware that
does not require host programs.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.550
The first type that we're
going to discuss is Worms.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.690
Worms are independent
malicious programs and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.450
they typically use network connections
to spread from one system to the other.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.400
Worms represented a major
advance in malware

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.940
in the 1990s coinciding with
the rapid expansion of the internet.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.150
Worms later evolved into
botnets around 2005,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.850
which is still the dominant
form of malware today.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.880
We will cover botnets in a later lesson.
