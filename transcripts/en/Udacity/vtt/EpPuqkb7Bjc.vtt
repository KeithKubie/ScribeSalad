Remember in the beginning of this lesson, we asked you

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.760
to think about your favorite app? Mine was Google Now. So

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.640
take a moment and play with that, your favorite application. And

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.590
take into account all the stuff you learned in lesson one.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.940
And then go to the forum, and share with everyone why

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.550
you love this application. So take the time to think about

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.280
whether the things you love are visual or non-visual. Whether they're

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.440
UI or UX related. So as developers, this is going to

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.800
be an awesome opportunity for you to share your design opinions.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.460
&gt;&gt; And if you see someone else, bad mouthing an application that you're

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.190
passionate about, take this as a opportunity

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.350
to understand that there's many, many different

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.060
types of users out there. And, and really get an understanding of how different

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.740
people feel about applications, and we'll pick up on this in less than two.
