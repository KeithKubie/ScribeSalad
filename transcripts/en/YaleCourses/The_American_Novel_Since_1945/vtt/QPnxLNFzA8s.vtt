1
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.211
Today.

2
00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:07.211
It is my very great privilege and pleasure to introduce Andrew Goldstone,

3
00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:11.780
a TF in this course.
Um,
Andrew is going to provide for you today.

4
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:16.160
The only relief you will get all term from my voice.
So enjoy it.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.473
Um,

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.370
on the syllabus it says that I would be presenting electron censorship in this

7
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:25.910
slot.
Um,
that's been suppressed.
It's been suppressed.
That's right.

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.810
Um,
so I will talk about censorship,
um,
somewhat,

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.250
uh,
in my last lecture on the Lita and in preparation for that for next week,

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.460
I'd like you to finish the novel and then read his essay on a novel entitled

11
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:47.090
Lolita should be bound at the back of your book.
Um,

12
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.340
Andrew is a fourth year student in the Phd Program in English and he is writing

13
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:54.370
a dissertation on,
um,

14
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.610
the autonomy of the work of art and modernism on that as a problem,
um,

15
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.960
on that as a,

16
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.180
I'm subject to be questioned and understood in a deeper way than it has been up

17
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.790
til now.
It's a wonderful dissertation.
Um,

18
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.640
it prepares them very well for the lecture he's going to give you today.

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.890
So Andrew,
thanks Amy.

20
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.520
So on Monday who had three main themes that we're used to introduce this

21
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:23.040
novelty.
You first is the idea that the novel invites ethical questions,

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.070
but also holds them off through parody in the same way that it uses the tropes

23
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:33.630
of Romanticism and romantic love and parodies them.
Secondly,

24
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
we looked at Humberto techniques of rhetorical seduction and related that to a

25
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:43.680
kind of intellectual problem that in a Boca sets himself of trying to make you

26
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:45.510
identify but this villainous character.

27
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.630
And that leads to the third big question we looked at,

28
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.380
which is the place of Novakof in this novel amidst the many layers,

29
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:54.330
whether he crosses them or confuses them.

30
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.620
And that that's the question that I'm mostly gonna focus on today.

31
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.760
I'm going to bracket the ethical question.
Leave that for Monday's lecture.

32
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.800
And the way I want to approach this question of the style and the novel and the

33
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:12.000
question of Aestheticism is by placing a Bokeh in the context of literary

34
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:16.500
modernism.
So I'm going to outline for you a little bit what I mean by that term.

35
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.280
And then I'm going to look at some specific,
uh,

36
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.940
predecessors that in Boca for first two and the way he uses them.

37
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.560
And then at the very end,

38
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.600
I'm going to try to connect that to an [inaudible] exile and the themes of
exile.

39
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.690
So let's start with an example.
Uh,

40
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.350
if you look on page 15,

41
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.630
Humbert describes his adolescence,
uh,
his education.

42
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.560
At first,

43
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.210
I plan to take a degree in psychiatry as many Monquet talents do,

44
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.260
but I was even more among k than that.
A peculiar exhaustion.

45
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.500
I'm so pressed doctor set in and I switched to English literature where so many

46
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:05.980
frustrated poets and as pipe smoking teachers in tweeds.

47
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.970
Well that's why I'm in graduate school.
Uh Huh.
Paris suited me.

48
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.770
I discussed Soviet movies with expatriates.
I sat with Uranus in the Duma ago.

49
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.500
I published torturous essays in obscure journals.

50
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.550
I compose pastiches Humberto poem,
Freud Line,

51
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.120
fun coop may turn her hand upon the DOR.

52
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.320
I will not follow her,
nor fresca nor Batgirl.

53
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.020
So this is a spoof of a poem by Ts Elliot,

54
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:37.960
which I've given you a piece of on your handout.

55
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.730
So let's look at that for a second.

56
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.790
Elliot's 1920 Poem Garanti Ian and Jessica to read a little bit of this so that

57
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:49.180
you have the flavor of the thing of Bokeh is burlesque game.

58
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.650
Here I am an old man in a dry month being read to by a boy waiting for rain.

59
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.570
I was neither at the hot gates nor fought in the warm rain nor knee.

60
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:05.560
Deep in the salt marsh,
heaving a cutlass bitten by flies,

61
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.210
fought my house is a decade house.
And the poem goes on.
And this is,

62
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.060
this is the tone of a poem.
It's a poem of crisis,

63
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.480
a poem of a kind of hollow speaker,

64
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.180
someone who emerges is more or less buried alive.

65
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.620
And this is supposed to reflect both personal crisis and the historical crisis.

66
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.680
Uh,
and it comes to a moment where,
uh,

67
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.810
the possibility of rejuvenation is described as devoured by series of,

68
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.990
uh,
characatures of Europeans.
And that's the second part on your handout.

69
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.740
The people that devour a rejuvenation,
uh,

70
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.770
so by Haka gala bowing among the Titians by madame to torn fist in the dark

71
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:51.220
room,
shifting the candles.
Freud line,
fun coop.
There she is.

72
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.020
Who turned in the hall one hand on the door.
They can shuttles.
We've the wind.

73
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.460
I have no ghosts and old man in the drafty house under a windy knob.

74
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.350
What in Elliot is crisis in Boca.

75
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.060
F is just a joke.
In other words,

76
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.800
these terrifying figures in Elliot Freud line phone call are just some of

77
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.660
Humberto name phets Freud lines,

78
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:21.250
just a young woman fresca another Elliot character,
the fresh woman,
right?

79
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:25.510
A young woman again,
so I called this a burlesque of Elliot's modernism.

80
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:30.511
It takes something meant to be really serious and turns it into a dirty joke and

81
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:35.710
that's the first way in Boca for will relate to literary modernism.

82
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.090
That's quite interesting that he takes this approach because Elliot in some ways

83
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:45.091
comes very close to the kind of ideas about art that in a book of himself holds.

84
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.820
Elliot says poems should be autotelic.

85
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.590
That means they should be an end unto themselves and in Boca full say in that

86
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.591
afterwards you're going to read the novel has only purpose to afford aesthetic

87
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:02.900
bliss.
So the parodies of something very close to home,

88
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.240
and this poem that I've given you will come comeback,
uh,
on page one 34.

89
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.780
You don't have to turn to that now,
but you should think about that return.

90
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:15.650
It's much more serious and strange.
Okay,

91
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.840
so that's enough on Elliot.

92
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.620
Now I want to really clarify for you what I mean by this term.
Modernism.

93
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.200
It just means the art,
uh,
and literature of the early 20th century,

94
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.610
especially the high art,
although its roots are definitely in the 19th century,

95
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.900
especially the French 19th century fiction and poetry in English.

96
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.230
It begins with the late novels of Henry James Around 1900 and poetry with Elliot

97
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.300
and with Ezra pound,
uh,
in,
in prose.

98
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.590
It's main exemplars in English would be James Joyce,
Virginia Woolf,

99
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.240
and you should know about this movement that it had very rapid success.

100
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.000
So although it's first centers or London and Paris,

101
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.080
it's already taught as classic literature in American universities before the

102
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:07.280
war,
they already classic.
So now here's a,

103
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:08.330
I'm just a list for you.

104
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.040
Eight features of literary modernism that are all important to in a Boca eight

105
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:18.041
features of literary modernism and obsession with the idea of arts autonomy.

106
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.400
The idea that art is its own law,
that it responds to no other laws,

107
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.850
that it has no other purpose than its own purposes.
In other words,

108
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.690
art for Art's sake,
that's Elliot's autotelic poem.

109
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.530
The only purpose of the work of artists who afford aesthetic bliss.

110
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.100
Second,
a sense of crisis,

111
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.200
a radical break in culture and overturning of conventional artistic forms that

112
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:46.550
goes with a sense that civilized civilization itself is being overturned.

113
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.620
Third,

114
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.450
the idea that the paradigm of experience is artistic experience.

115
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.510
That the norms for everyone should be artistic norms of careful perception.

116
00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.300
Uh,

117
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.300
deep reflection that the idea that culture itself is the saving most important

118
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:08.930
activity that people can engage in.
Fourth,
and this goes along with that.

119
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:13.430
A rejection of convention,
especially sexual conventions,
sexual morality,

120
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.470
that's obvious connection to this book,
the very deep roots of modernism.
However,

121
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:21.770
at the same time,
there's an idea that the artist is a kind of technician,

122
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.600
someone whose values are craft,
form and style rather than message,

123
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.000
personal expression of wisdom of any kind.
Six.
Uh,

124
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.730
this is a term from the critic,
Josef Frank spacial form,

125
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.750
spatial form.
The idea that in place of a linear narrative,

126
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.850
you have a system of cross references and repeated motifs that give the

127
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:48.050
structure of works in place that is only visible,
in other words,

128
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:50.420
on rereading,
only visible on rereading.

129
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.590
And then this is anticipates my last points.

130
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.800
Modernism is self consciously international.
Uh,
in other words,

131
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:02.910
it will look to international tradition and it has as its ambition to be a

132
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.310
culture and not just for one nation,
but for many,
maybe for all,
uh,

133
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.350
going along with this eighth characteristic that's important.

134
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.100
The artist is seen as a kind of spiritual exile.

135
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.030
Someone who is alienated from a home society and home culture,

136
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.570
whether or not he or she is actually left it as [inaudible] did.

137
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.420
So this is what I mean by international high modernism.
Uh,

138
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.110
you should add to this list of writers,
especially Faulkner.
And Hemingway,

139
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.030
and you should remember that there's a parallel American tradition.
Uh,

140
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.150
the realist tradition that we saw Richard Wright referring to that is Theodore

141
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.940
Dreiser Sinclair Lewis.

142
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.900
And then going back to the 19th century writers like Mark Twain.
You know,

143
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:50.160
I had a teacher who used to compare Lolita to huck Finn.

144
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.720
There two novels about traveling across America in an unconventional couple,

145
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.670
right?
Um,
so anyway,
uh,

146
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.743
okay.

147
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.580
But now that modernist tradition is something that new book of owes a lot too,

148
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:07.980
but he always tries to distinguish himself from it.
Uh,

149
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.380
from the book of the highest value is originality.

150
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.090
He says this in his last Russian novel,
the gift,
or he doesn't say it,

151
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:17.460
his autobiographical hero says it.

152
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.920
Any genuinely new trend in art is a night's move,
a change of shadows,

153
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.770
a shift that displaces the mirror.
Okay.

154
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.540
Any genuinely new trend is a night's move.
So just remind you in chess,

155
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.510
the night doesn't move in a straight line.

156
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.170
It starts out in a straight line and that had hops off on the diagonal.

157
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.520
Unlike any other piece,
it skips over pieces in the way.

158
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.420
So the night far from going on the straight course surprises you,

159
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.590
you might think of walking in here expecting Professor Hungerford on censorship

160
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:52.050
and getting me instead.
Uh,

161
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.800
but this is really very important idea for an Invoca both as a way of treating

162
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:59.970
predecessors and as a way of writing.
I want to show you that way of writing,

163
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.340
uh,
very early in the book on page 10.
Now let's take a look at that.

164
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.593
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

165
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.950
<v 0>this is at the top of the page.</v>

166
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.400
My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident,

167
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:25.060
picnic lightning when I was three and save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest

168
00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:29.600
past.
Nothing of hers subsists within the hollows and Dells of memory over which,

169
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.170
if you can still stand my style,
I'm writing under observation.

170
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.220
The son of my infancy had set.
Okay,

171
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.370
so this is a nice move from traumatic event of the mother's death.

172
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.370
Should be the center of the sentence is just dismissed.

173
00:11:43.371 --> 00:11:47.930
Hop beyond into this stylistic wash,
a golden haze.

174
00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:51.380
And he goes on to describe the sensations of early childhood.

175
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.540
So the strategy of the move is to frustrate your expectations.

176
00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.690
To reap over the apparently important events into something else characterized

177
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:04.180
by a kind of aesthetic play.

178
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.940
And these parentheses are a real icon of that.

179
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.070
A critic has counted 450 sets of them in this novel.
The parenthesis,

180
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:13.360
important example of knights move.

181
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.440
But I want to show you another kind of nights move and to do that,

182
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:21.760
I'm going to talk just for a moment about new book us relationship to the French

183
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:23.460
writer,
Proust.
Uh,

184
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:28.370
Proust is the great aesthetic cyst of modernism,

185
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.000
but the novelist who writes about art,

186
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:36.001
who holds up art as a value as well as giving a theory of memory and memory is

187
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:37.780
very important in Lolita.

188
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.650
That really comes from perused a theory of memory that has a lot to do with the

189
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:46.450
work of the artist.
And the book of in 1966 he said this,

190
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.070
the greatest masterpieces of 20th century prose.
This is convenient.

191
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.350
Take this down,
are in this order.

192
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.390
Joyce's Ulysses is transformation.
That is the metamorphosis,

193
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.700
Belize,
St Petersburg,
a pretty obscure Russian avant garde novel.

194
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.780
And the first half of proofs fairy tale in search of lost time.

195
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.300
I mentioned of the fairytale should remind you of that first meeting between

196
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.790
Humbert and Lolita described that we looked at on Monday described in fairy

197
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.753
terms,

198
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.960
but actually the thing I want to think about is accrued pun there a fairytale.

199
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.200
Uh,
Proust is himself gay.

200
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.780
One of his big subjects is homosexuality.

201
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.560
And the book us reaction to this is really homophobic.
Uh,

202
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.040
this is not just about new focus,
personal prejudice.

203
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.470
It's about a relationship to predecessors who are seen as two similar.

204
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.640
The danger from the Boca.
Remember that as value as originality,

205
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:50.140
the danger is that you will fall too in love with something to like himself.

206
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.680
He has to hold off this possibility of being too attracted to these male

207
00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:58.780
predecessors who are too similar to him.
Uh,

208
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.800
this should cue you to think about the theme of doubling in this novel.

209
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.360
To think about the possibility of desire between men here to think about the

210
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:08.200
word queer.

211
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.490
The treatment of guests don't go down that funny French character in Beardsley,

212
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.130
uh,
to think about Humberto contest.

213
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.910
Constant protestations that he's attractive to all women about is supposed to

214
00:14:19.911 --> 00:14:24.760
virility.
Um,
and uh,
it should,
um,

215
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:31.170
just make you wonder whether pedophilia is in itself a kind of nights move from

216
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:35.140
homosexuality.
In other words,

217
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:40.141
is there another form of perverted desire hiding behind the one that's in front

218
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:44.910
of us?
Let's look on a,
just a suggestion.
Look on page 20.

219
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.660
<v 0>Still in Humberto early life.</v>

221
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.470
<v 0>Near the bottom.
It happened,
for instance,
that from my balcony,</v>

223
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.390
I would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like an infant

224
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.630
in the act of undressing before a cooperative mirror,
thus isolated,

225
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.940
thus removed the vision acquired and especially King charm that made me race

226
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:13.430
with all speed toward my loan gratification.

227
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.930
So you have a kind of image there of the autonomous aesthetic pleasure,
right?

228
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.830
The pleasure of imagination that's taken alone according to one's own thoughts

229
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:25.040
rather than in some broader,
more social forum,

230
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.670
but abruptly fiendishly the tender pattern of nudity I had adored would be

231
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:36.221
transformed into the disgusting lamplight bare arm of a man in his underclothes

232
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.700
reading his paper by the open window in the hot damp,

233
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.270
hopeless summer night.
So that,
that the,

234
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.380
the object of this wonderful aesthetic reverie than in fat turns out to be an

235
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:54.620
adult male.
And I just want you to ask yourself why that could be,

236
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.000
but Nepal,

237
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.520
because relationship to this modernist past is not just the burlesque that he

238
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:02.031
visits on.

239
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:07.031
Elliott is not just this complicated attraction and disidentification that he

240
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:12.770
works on with Proust,
uh,
part of,
uh,
an element of admiration is also present.

241
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.820
Uh,
and that's,
that's really part of his relationship to Joyce.

242
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.590
Remember that he name's Joyce as the greatest master of 20th century prose.

243
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.480
Uh,

244
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.230
just going to name for you for features of Joyce's style that are important to

245
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.290
novakof stylistic virtuosity,

246
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.760
the ability to imitate any style at the same time,

247
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.020
a scrupulous attention to the banality of everyday life in all its detail.

248
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.500
Yet.
Third characteristic,

249
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.430
the constant use of a super imposed structure.

250
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.740
So in Ulysses famously joist puts the narrative of the Odyssey on top of a day

251
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:54.950
in Dublin or in Joyce's earlier novel,

252
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.930
a portrait of the artist as a young man,

253
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.290
a linear narrative in which a young boy grows up is structured as a series of

254
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.560
structurally parallel chapters in which moments in each one corresponds to the

255
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.370
ones in successive chapters.

256
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.520
And this has comes with a kind of suggestion that that been now reality is

257
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:21.050
redeemed by the art,
the artists activity.
Fourthly,

258
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.660
Joyce loves puns.
Sodas.
Bulk of this is incredibly important.
Uh,

259
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.330
and there's a direct glance at that,
uh,
just ahead of where you read.

260
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:33.830
So don't turn here.
I don't want to spoil what's coming up.
But on page two 21,

261
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.920
there's a reference to,
uh,
don't look,

262
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.950
don't look to a writer named Vivian dark bloom plagiarizing from Joyce now,

263
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:45.650
Vivian dark room.
You remember from Monday,

264
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.620
that's the Anagram of Vadim [inaudible].
Uh,

265
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.530
so an explicit recognition and the thing that's being plagiarized,

266
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.250
I've actually given you on the handout,
it's a little piece of Finnegans wake.

267
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:58.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

268
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.780
<v 0>Which is Joyce's work in which almost every word is upon almost every word is a</v>

269
00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:06.910
pun.
Just read you a sentence of this too.
So you know what it's like.

270
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.700
Say them all,
but tell them apart.
Cat in Zalando Coloratura artists,

271
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:14.890
we Bretta and a is a rancha.
Why is for Ula and n for green,

272
00:18:14.891 --> 00:18:19.330
Erin B as boy blue with auto Liscow while w waters the florets of November,

273
00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:22.370
it's that spells out rainbow,
right?
Um,

274
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.290
the important thing here is that in Boca Technologies,

275
00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.010
this debt to Joyce as not just a parody but a real debt.

276
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.260
Uh,
and so now I want to think at more length about another joy solution,

277
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.390
which,
uh,
shows how complicated the relationship to his predecessor is.

278
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:45.910
Uh,
and with Elliot,
I read the,
the Nabokovian Virgin first.
This time.

279
00:18:45.911 --> 00:18:48.610
I'll give you the Joyce first.
So this is on your handout as well.

280
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.550
From chapter two,

281
00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.700
uh,
this describes the hero,
uh,
Stephen Dedalus,
uh,

282
00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:05.330
as a young boy,
uh,
writing,
trying to write a poem.

283
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.370
And eventually in the novel he will succeed,
uh,

284
00:19:10.371 --> 00:19:14.030
in writing a poem.
Uh,
but here he doesn't manage to.

285
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.310
And so this is a kind of forecast of what will happen later on.
Uh,

286
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.400
the further complication is that here he's writing a poem and then he remembers

287
00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:29.330
an earlier attempt that layering of memory and that kind of layering is actually

288
00:19:29.331 --> 00:19:32.330
a prototype for the layering in Lolita.

289
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.010
The next day,
this is under chapter two.

290
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:42.011
The next day he sat at his table and the bare upper room for many hours before

291
00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:48.020
him lay a new pen,
a new bottle of ink,

292
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.940
and a new emerald exercise.

293
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.470
Skip a little on the first line of the page appeared the title of the verses he

294
00:19:54.471 --> 00:19:57.320
was trying to write to EEC.
He knew what was right to begin.

295
00:19:57.321 --> 00:20:00.800
So for you it seems similar titles in the collected poems of Lord Byron,

296
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.160
when he had written this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath,

297
00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:07.700
he fell into a daydream and began to draw diagrams on the corner of the book.

298
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:12.320
He saw himself sitting at his table and Bray the morning after the discussion at

299
00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:16.670
the Christmas dinner table trying to write a poem about Parnell on the back of

300
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:18.340
one of his father's second Boyd,

301
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.160
he notices but his brain then refuse to grapple with the theme.

302
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.350
And desisting he had covered the page with the names and addresses of certain of

303
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:30.890
his classmates,
Roderick kick him,
John Lawton,

304
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.890
Antony McSweeney,
Simon Moonen.

305
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.690
The version of this that comes up in the novel is in the midst of Humboldt's

306
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.840
diary.
And the diary itself,
I should say as a lot,
uh,

307
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.790
owes a lot to Joycean.
I've given you a piece that diary to look at,
uh,

308
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:51.380
on your own on the handout.
Uh,

309
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.420
but this is the moment that directly alludes to portrait and it's really very

310
00:20:55.421 --> 00:21:00.310
important for understanding and focus technique.
So page 51,

311
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.760
near the bottom
Thursday,

312
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.510
we are paying with Halan Gail for the tropical beginning of the month and a

313
00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:13.600
volume of the young people's encyclopedia.

314
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.070
I found a map of the states that a child's pencil had started copying out on a

315
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:22.090
sheet of lightweight paper upon the other side of which counter to the

316
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.220
unfinished outline of Florida and the Gulf.

317
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:29.580
There was a mimeographed list of names referring evidently to her class at the

318
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.140
Ramsdale school.

319
00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.910
Might think of that front and back of the page as another kind of nights move

320
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.460
there.
You think you're looking at one thing,
you land on another.

321
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.900
It is a poem I know already by Heart,
Angel Grace,
Austin,

322
00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:44.170
Floyd [inaudible],
Jack Biel,
Mary Buck,

323
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:47.050
Daniel and so on.
I'll come back to this list.

324
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:51.970
Actually just skip to the bottom on page 52 Talbot,

325
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:56.110
Edgar Talvin,
Edwin Wayne Lull,
lull in the book,

326
00:21:56.111 --> 00:22:00.190
Right Williams Ralph when Muller Luis,
a poem,

327
00:22:00.191 --> 00:22:04.660
a poem for suits.
So strange and sweet was it to discover this haze Dolores,

328
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.280
she and it's special bower of names with its bodyguard of roses,

329
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.430
a fairy princess between her two maids of honor that that's a fairy tale.

330
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:18.760
Again,
in a way,
this is just like the Joyce.

331
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.350
A list of names leads up to this aesthetic sensation.
The,

332
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.400
the revelation of a poem,
uh,

333
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.240
the ordinary materials of life become the basis for a kind of artistic

334
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:33.670
achievement.
However,

335
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.650
obviously this is not like the Joyce where there is a realistic depiction of a

336
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:42.610
young boy trying to write,
getting bored and failing here.

337
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:47.410
Something else is happening because the list of names is not ordinary,

338
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:51.910
right?
There's that bower of roses that refers to Mary Rose,

339
00:22:51.911 --> 00:22:55.540
Hamilton,
Hayes,
Dolores Hanuk,
Rosaline,

340
00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.160
and then there's Emil Rosato and car mine rose,

341
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:04.600
a red rose angel grace.
I mean really,
ah,

342
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.260
Stella fantasy.
Uh,
and then even the ordinary names are,

343
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.110
are kind of plants because almost every name on this list comes back elsewhere

344
00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:18.160
in the book.
You could look,
for example,
for Louise Wind Muller,
or,
um,

345
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.520
Vivian McChrystal,
and then right in the middle,
oh,

346
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:25.480
and then we have Shakespeare to Miranda,
Antony,
Miranda,
viola.

347
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.960
Um,
and right in the middle you have a kind of explanation,
uh,

348
00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.850
planted Macu,
Virginia McCrystal,

349
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.410
Vivian mcfate,
Aubrey mic FAPE,

350
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.461
which as you know,

351
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:44.461
is something Humbard gets kind of obsessed with is the icon of the difference

352
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.900
between the realistic world of Joyce and the already artificial already

353
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:55.450
aestheticize world of this novel.
No one was ever really named mcfate.

354
00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.830
Uh,
mic fate is a kind of parody of real randomness.

355
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.150
You might think of it as having the same relation to real fate as chicken

356
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:07.580
mcnuggets due to chicken.
In other words,

357
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:12.710
might think of it as a kind of artificial processed,

358
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:18.050
a bland,
easily consumable version of faith.
I really mean that.

359
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:18.830
You know,

360
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:23.360
one of the funny things about that debt to Finnegan's wake is Finnegan's wake as

361
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:27.590
a book of puns is unreadable.
Nobody reads it except specialists like me.

362
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.610
Lalita was a best seller.
Lito was a bestseller and then broke.

363
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:34.250
I've made so much money from it.
He was able to retire to Switzerland.

364
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.420
And you should ask yourself,
what about this novel makes that possible?

365
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:43.070
Why is that that you have this mcnugget version of the modernist novel?

366
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.680
And I don't don't really mean that to disparage the novel,

367
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.120
but it's makes it clear that there's some kind of difference between this and

368
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.070
the works that Nebraska is looking back to.

369
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.170
I want to think a little bit more about this idea of a mic fate.

370
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.580
There's a kind of short circuit between,
uh,

371
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:09.610
between the Joycey and idea of taking ordinary life and transforming it into an

372
00:25:10.641 --> 00:25:15.290
aesthetic order because the ordinary is already a static in the book.

373
00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.960
In other words,
chance is already faded.

374
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.050
The thing that stands for randomness in this book,

375
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:25.040
the thing that looks like ordinary detail has already been arranged to give you

376
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:29.160
artistic pleasure.
Uh,
that's why Humbert,
uh,

377
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.310
can be instantly delighted in the list of names.

378
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:36.130
This doesn't look forward to Humberto poems.
It already is a poem,
uh,

379
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.240
and it is a poem to the crazed aroused mind of Humber.

380
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.290
So there's,

381
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:47.270
the artificial has taken the place of the real here and this novel really

382
00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:50.720
reminds you of that all the time.
Uh,
on 84,

383
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:56.390
Humbert says a hundreds thinking of killing Charlotte.

384
00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.220
And he says,
no man can bring about the perfect murder.
Chance,
however,
can do it,

385
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.610
chance can do it.
And of course,
the perfect murder does happen.
Uh,

386
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.560
Charlotte Hayes dies at as if by total accident.

387
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.310
But we're aware that the asset is so perfect that it was arranged.

388
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.640
So this is the kind of hand of Novakof taking a narrative of real events and

389
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:22.370
twisting it into something that makes a kind of sense,

390
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.780
taking fate and making it Mick fate.
Uh,

391
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.000
and I want to show you one more example of that.
Uh,
uh,

392
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.870
in the scene where Humbert and Lolita,
I've reached the hotel,

393
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:36.020
the enchanted hunters.
This is on page one 18.

394
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

395
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.650
<v 0>Near the bottom in the slow,
clear hand of crime,</v>

396
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.020
I wrote Doctor Edgar,

397
00:26:48.021 --> 00:26:51.440
h Humbert and daughter three 42 long street.

398
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.540
Ramsdale a key three 42 was half shown to me.

399
00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:01.520
Magician showing object.
He's about to palm and hand it over to uncle Tom.

400
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:03.620
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

401
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.930
<v 0>the coincidence.
Normally in real life,</v>

402
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.560
it would be a delightful coincidence to go to a hotel room that has the same

403
00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:11.720
number as your street address.
Here.

404
00:27:11.721 --> 00:27:16.220
It's a kind of too easy icon of the correspondence between the place where

405
00:27:16.221 --> 00:27:18.530
Humbard meets Lolita and the place where he rapes her.

406
00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.590
And the book just tells you that.
Right?
And one of those parentheses,

407
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.610
the magician showing the object is about to palm the ordinary event,

408
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.140
which is really trickery,

409
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.060
trickery as suggestion that nothing has been left to chance in the novel.

410
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:36.790
Nothing is ordinary.
Uh,
no,

411
00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.440
it's like come to my last section here.

412
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.460
What I want to suggest is that this kind of transformation of arbitrary real

413
00:27:47.991 --> 00:27:52.850
faded events into conspicuously artificial tricks,

414
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.350
which you might think of as a night's move on.
The real fete fate,

415
00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.480
uh,
is a response in particular to exile,
uh,

416
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.820
in particular in invoke condition of exile

417
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.940
and exile living in a foreign country,
Liz,

418
00:28:10.941 --> 00:28:13.970
in a kind of a d naturalized world,

419
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.930
a world where instead of everything making instance sense,

420
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.420
everything has to be decoded,
right?

421
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.300
Nothing is initially known to make sense.

422
00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:25.340
Everything has to be figured out and reinvent it.

423
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.780
And that afterward to this book and the book of says he had to invent America.

424
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.100
He had to invent America.
That's because he didn't know it already.

425
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.080
It wasn't given to him.
Now,
in a way,
this is a terrible state,

426
00:28:39.081 --> 00:28:42.290
a state of discontinuity with the world you exist in,

427
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.160
but it has a payoff kind of a pay off,

428
00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:50.930
which is the possibility precisely of inventing a,
and this is,

429
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.190
this is visible everywhere in this book.
Uh,

430
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.140
one example is the transformation of housework.
Uh,

431
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.030
this is on page one 79.

432
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.750
My West door neighbor West door,

433
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.590
who might've been a businessman or a college teacher or both would speak to me

434
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:21.591
once in a while as he barbered some late garden blooms or watered his car or at

435
00:29:21.781 --> 00:29:26.220
a later date defrosted his driveway.
I don't mind if these verbs are all wrong.

436
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.160
Of course,
the point is that they're all wrong.

437
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:34.730
The point is that this cliched suburban life of mowing the lawn or washing the

438
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:40.330
car and so on has been transformed precisely because Humbard as a foreigner and

439
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.840
to something you can laugh at something,
you can joy,
something you can enjoy,

440
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.780
something that you can apply.
The night's move to.
Uh,

441
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:50.620
and this is even a couple of pages before explicitly described as something

442
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:53.800
particularly to foreigners because you remember,
gas don't go down,

443
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:56.650
says about the school that Lalita is going to go to.

444
00:29:56.651 --> 00:30:00.790
The girls are taught not to spell very well,
but to smell very well.

445
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.980
Uh,
and Humbert comments.
That's where the foreigners love for such things.

446
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:06.910
Uh,

447
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:11.910
the foreigners love for this kind of move is a response to this dean naturalized

448
00:30:12.251 --> 00:30:13.480
world of the exile.

449
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

450
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.340
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

451
00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.180
It's important in this connection to remember that the knights move as a way of

452
00:30:20.181 --> 00:30:24.800
avoiding obstacles in particular keeps skipping over,
uh,

453
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.480
forms of violence.
Ah,
there's that mother's death at the beginning.
Uh,

454
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.540
there's another moment in which Humbert is tracing his hand along the lead his

455
00:30:35.061 --> 00:30:39.170
leg and he discovers a bruise there that he'd given her accidentally.

456
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.700
That's early on in the book.
In other words,
the surprise is a violence surprise.

457
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:48.340
Uh,
you can even look at the mention of a night's move in this book.
Uh,

458
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.030
that's page one 92,

459
00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.940
one of the lattice squares in a small cobwebby casement window at the turn of

460
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:05.941
the staircase was glazed with Ruby and that raw wound among the unstained

461
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:11.071
rectangles and it's asymmetrical position a nights move from the top always

462
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.700
extremely disturbed me.

463
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.493
<v 1>Okay.</v>

464
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.680
<v 0>The Knights move,
which is just a playful way of describing where the window is,</v>

465
00:31:18.681 --> 00:31:22.400
right?
The knights move is nonetheless a kind of wound or damage.

466
00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.490
So even as it's the prototype for originality,

467
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.020
it's also something very disturbing and harmful.
And that conjunction,

468
00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:35.050
I want to suggest that conjunction has to do with the traumatic event of having

469
00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.880
had to emigrate.
Uh,

470
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:42.910
having had to take up another language in the Boca will say that his private

471
00:31:43.161 --> 00:31:47.630
tragedy is that,
uh,
let's see,

472
00:31:47.631 --> 00:31:48.950
his private tragedy,

473
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.480
which cannot and indeed not be anybody's concern,

474
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.060
is that I had to abandon my natural idiom,

475
00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:01.630
my untrammeled rich and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second rate brand

476
00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:06.440
of English,
devoid of any of those apparatuses.
The Baffling Mirror,

477
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.850
the black velvet backdrop,
the implied associations and traditions,

478
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.920
which the native illusionist,

479
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.480
the frack tales flying can magically use to transcend the heritage in his own

480
00:32:17.481 --> 00:32:20.360
way.
Uh,

481
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:25.870
here being an exile prevents near Boca from making that night's move.

482
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:31.010
And you might think about that homophobic attitude to approve the in past the

483
00:32:31.011 --> 00:32:35.010
fear that it's too,
like what he wants to do.
Uh,

484
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:39.740
but the main point here to think about is that that feeling of damage on the

485
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:40.890
other hand,
uh,

486
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.900
the critic Michael Wood has pointed out that in a book up didn't lose Russian.

487
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:47.600
You know,
he didn't lose it on the way while he was riding the boat.

488
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.750
He decided to stop writing in it and would says this new Boca could appreciate

489
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:55.340
language itself.

490
00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:01.220
Only after he had made himself lose a language and have found another and the

491
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:02.450
ashes of his loss,

492
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.940
a kind of economy of a balance between the loss of one language and a particular

493
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:11.660
set of techniques that comes in it's place.

494
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.740
These techniques are really,
I think,
uh,

495
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.610
the source of the most appealing writing in this book.
Uh,

496
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.930
and so let's look now at one of those advocations of the American landscape,

497
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.020
which I just think maybe,
or the close of the book comes just a pure beauty.
Uh,

498
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:33.380
on page one 52,
oh,
and by the way,

499
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.850
this book was written on Road Trips,
uh,
in a book of his wife.

500
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:42.170
Vera drove him on thousands of miles of trips around the country while he was

501
00:33:42.171 --> 00:33:46.190
writing this novel and hunting butterflies.
Think about that.

502
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:51.290
Um,
I'm a,
here's one 52 advocation of the landscape

503
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.730
by a paradox of pictorial thought.

504
00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.480
The average Loland North American countryside had at first seemed to me

505
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.110
something I accepted with a shock of amused recognition because of those painted

506
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:06.944
oil clause,

507
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.150
which were imported from America in the old days to be hung above wash stands

508
00:34:11.151 --> 00:34:15.770
and central European nurseries and which fascinated a drowsy child at bedtime

509
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:19.820
with the rustic glean views they depicted opaque curly trees,

510
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:23.570
a barn cattle Abrook,
the Dole White,

511
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:27.890
a vague orchards in bloom and perhaps a stone fence or hills of greenish garage.

512
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.480
So,
so far this is the American landscape is already a work of art already.

513
00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:35.570
Part of a European memory,
then something else happens.

514
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.710
But gradually the models of those elementary rusticity,

515
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:42.200
he's became stranger and stranger to the eye.

516
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.280
The newer I came to know them beyond the tilde plain.
In other words,

517
00:34:46.281 --> 00:34:49.940
they already worked over domesticated plane beyond the toy roofs.

518
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.660
There would be a slow,
so fusion of a new tile loveliness,

519
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:59.380
a low sun in a platinum Hayes with a warm field peach tinge pervading the upper

520
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:04.850
edge of a two dimensional dove gray cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist

521
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:09.260
and Utah loveliness.
That's kind of the keyword of new focus technique.

522
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.300
And he says the novel has as his only purpose to provide aesthetic bliss.

523
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:18.260
So here's the new tile loveliness coming just from seeing the landscape as a

524
00:35:18.261 --> 00:35:20.990
stranger.
Humbert goes on.

525
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.810
There might be a line of space trees silhouetted against the horizon and hot

526
00:35:26.811 --> 00:35:31.811
still Nunes above wilderness of clover and closed Loha clouds inscribed remotely

527
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:37.710
and to miss the Azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the

528
00:35:37.711 --> 00:35:40.380
neutral.
Swoon have the background,
or again,

529
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.800
it might be a stern El Greco horizon pregnant with inky rain and a passing

530
00:35:46.261 --> 00:35:51.261
glimpse of some mummy neck farmer and all around alternating strips of

531
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:54.420
quicksilver fish water and harsh green corn.

532
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.590
The whole arrangement opening like a fan somewhere in Kansas.

533
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.960
So European artists actually appears again there with closed though.
Huh.

534
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.910
But kind of made strange given that night's move,
given a new twist.

535
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:13.500
So instead of familiar incorporated into this profoundly strange,

536
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:17.490
vast landscape that gets a Humberto most appealing rhetoric,

537
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.980
the rhetoric of an exile.

538
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:26.070
But I don't want you to think that this just means everything's okay.

539
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.940
Of course everything is not okay.
Even Humbert will tell us.
So,

540
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:35.820
uh,
just a few pages later on page one 75,
he talks about his journey.

541
00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.240
We had been everywhere.
We had really seen nothing.

542
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.680
And I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with

543
00:36:51.291 --> 00:36:55.790
the seniors trail of slime,
the lovely trustful,
dreamy,

544
00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:01.060
enormous country that by then in retrospect was no more to us than a collection

545
00:37:01.521 --> 00:37:06.350
of doggy of maps,
ruined tour books,
old tires,
and her sobs.

546
00:37:06.351 --> 00:37:10.460
In the night,
every night,
every night.
The moment I feigned sleep,

547
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:15.620
you have to pair that with that other effication of the landscape to see this

548
00:37:15.621 --> 00:37:20.600
alternate idea that actually this distanced criss crossing of the landscape

549
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:24.920
could be damaging.
I think of those other violent nights moves like,

550
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.690
like skipping past the mother's death.
Somehow this has skipped past that.

551
00:37:29.691 --> 00:37:34.130
The hubs in the night,
there's a,
there's another version yet,

552
00:37:34.131 --> 00:37:38.810
another version that relates back to that funny figure of gas don't go down.
Uh,

553
00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:42.900
and I,
you know,
I spoke about Proust Gastro.

554
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.410
God has a picture of Proust on his wall.
In fact,

555
00:37:45.411 --> 00:37:50.280
he has pictures of all great figures of French modernism on [inaudible],

556
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.230
the dancer Nijinsky or figures of this kind of aesthetic autism.

557
00:37:54.231 --> 00:37:59.231
This belief in the power of art and all gag as go die himself is,

558
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.690
and Humbert has a kind of hatred for that.
Uh,

559
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:07.880
the sea which he voices on page one 73,
uh,
sorry,
one 83.

560
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.390
There he was devoid of any talent whatsoever.

561
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.590
A mediocre teacher of worthless scholar,
a Glum,

562
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:23.260
repulsive fat old invert,

563
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.410
highly contemptuous of the American way of life.

564
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.780
Triumphantly ignorant of the English language.

565
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.820
There he was in Priggish New England.

566
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:35.260
Here are we crooned over by the old and caressed by the young.
Oh,

567
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.340
having a grand time and fooling everybody.
And here was I

568
00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:46.060
on the contrast here is between someone who has remained tied to that European

569
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:48.101
past,

570
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:53.101
remained constantly alienated and by that very means been able to fit into

571
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:56.890
society with someone who is in a much more ambivalent position.

572
00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:01.030
Someone who's trying to become an American writer has an a book of says he's

573
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:03.710
doing,
trying to invent America,
uh,

574
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.150
trying to bridge the gap between a Russian and English,

575
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.620
but always finding that English is only a kind of second best.
Uh,
uh,

576
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:14.290
and he,
in fact,
it's more than that.

577
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:19.470
He translated Lolita back into Russian later on and he,

578
00:39:19.471 --> 00:39:23.920
he added a second afterward
where he said this,

579
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:30.330
that wondrous Russian tongue that it seemed to me was waiting for me somewhere

580
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:35.710
was flowering like a faithful springtime behind a tightly locked gate whose key

581
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:38.140
I had held in safe keeping for so many years,

582
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.360
proved to be nonexistent and there's nothing behind the gate but charred stumps.

583
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.370
And to hopeless all tunnel distance.

584
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.510
And the key in my hand is more like a skeleton key.

585
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:54.040
So there's a kind of lost paradise of European culture,

586
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:59.490
which he can't get back even with this spectacular effort in English.

587
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.540
Uh,
so,
um,

588
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.460
that suggests that it's not all to the good.

589
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:17.500
It hasn't,
he hasn't been saved by taking up these nights move techniques,

590
00:40:17.501 --> 00:40:21.190
the d familiarizing techniques,
there's still a record of damage.

591
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.640
And so,
um,
I just,
uh,
I'm going to end a little early just throwing out a,

592
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.240
an analogy for you and it's an analogy that,
um,

593
00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.890
in a Boca of himself tries to debunk completely in that afterward.

594
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.530
So you should be skeptical of it,

595
00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:41.560
but then you should also ask yourself whether you can really do completely

596
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:42.394
without it,

597
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.780
might it be that new Boca cuffs own relationship to American culture,

598
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:54.460
his relationship to the English language that he transforms is like Humberto

599
00:40:54.461 --> 00:40:56.500
relationship to Lolita.
That is,

600
00:40:56.501 --> 00:41:01.501
might it be that it's a kind of kidnapping of an American incent by a

601
00:41:02.081 --> 00:41:06.820
cosmopolitan European for his own ends ends which are seen as a kind of

602
00:41:06.821 --> 00:41:09.910
perversion.
Uh,
that's,

603
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.330
that's that element of violence that keeps coming back.

604
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:18.510
The trail of slime across this dream of transforming reality in this Joycey in

605
00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:20.260
way into,

606
00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:24.550
into something save that the dream of turning fate,

607
00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:28.900
the fate of a dead mother or in focus own case of father killed by
assassination,

608
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.910
a brother killed in the concentration camps.

609
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.120
Turning that into this beautifully worked out playful system defined by Pons and

610
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:41.900
images and a spell of rhetoric.
In other words,

611
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.680
uh,
could it be that all of this,
uh,

612
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.710
modernist technique that Humbert succeeds in putting to his own ends,

613
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:56.330
that nimble cuffs succeeds and putting to his own ends is not an unambiguous

614
00:41:56.331 --> 00:42:01.280
good but a record of a kind of damage.
Now,

615
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.630
on Monday you're going to hear about,
uh,

616
00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.750
this novels confrontation with the idea that art could be saving,

617
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.160
that it could somehow be redemptive.
But here I think is,
I can't,

618
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:18.161
that it's something that the novel simply laughs at Holly Laughs at Holloway.

619
00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:23.210
Uh,
and you might think of one last example.

620
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.710
There's all these things I've been saying about the delight and words is the

621
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:31.190
head mistress is put in the mouth of that horrible woman.

622
00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:35.960
The headmistress of the Beardsley school,
Ms. Pratt on page one 97.

623
00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

624
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.140
<v 0>Ms. Pratt says to Humbert,</v>

625
00:42:43.141 --> 00:42:47.570
I am always fascinated by the admirable way foreigners are,
at least naturalized.

626
00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:50.780
Americans use our rich language.
In other words,

627
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:56.050
that the aesthetic discovery of English is something that just kind of fits

628
00:42:56.811 --> 00:42:59.990
comfortably into this prejudice of the,

629
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:03.700
of the dull suburban American.
Um,

630
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.950
so I'll just end there with this,
with this thought,

631
00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:11.951
this doubt about an a cuffs own use of modernist technique in this novel,

632
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.300
about the emphasis on the aesthetic here,

633
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:19.540
whether it could be not just that a triumph of the imagination that Humbert sees

634
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.590
in the list of names,
but a mark of a wound that can't be healed.
