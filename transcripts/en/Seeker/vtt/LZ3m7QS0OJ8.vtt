00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.810
Relationships are terrifying.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:10.940
I mean, did you know half of all marriages
last forever??

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.940
Ello loves, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.270
Alright, first of all the oft quoted statistic
that 50% of marriages fail is just plain wrong.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.510
The actual number for first marriages is closer
to 20-25%, but that still begs the question;

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.750
why do they fail?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.881
Why do people who have avowed themselves to
one another for their whole lives not go the

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.270
distance?

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.610
John and Julie Gottman have been pondering
that question for decades.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.200
By the way, they’re both psychologists,
and yes, they’re married.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.379
Feel free to “d’awwww” now.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.360
According to the Gottmans, you can actually
predict with 94% certainty which relationships

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.760
will be healthy and which will be festering
quagmires of misery and stress simply by how

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.089
they support each other.

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.629
Anyone who’s been in a relationship knows
that sometimes you and your partner’s interests

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.629
don’t align.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.760
Maybe you like hockey but they’re not so
hot on it.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.879
Or maybe they like camping and you understandably
think sleeping on the dirty ground in the

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.079
woods with no wifi is a terrible way to spend
a vacation.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.320
But when one person tries to share their interests
with their significant other, that’s a big

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.420
for emotional support.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.409
How often they get that acknowledgment makes
all the difference.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.850
John Gottman conducted a study where they
invited 130 newlywed couples to what looked

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.210
like a bed and breakfast, but was actually
a lab where they could observe the subjects.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.299
He was watching for how often one person would
say something seemingly inconsequential, like,

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.289
“hey check out that bird,” or, “I have
the weirdest feeling we’re being watched.”

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.049
Gottman called these “bids” for emotional
support, and noted how often their partner

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.030
would respond in a meaningful way.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.490
Their findings show that couples stay together
when they show bids of interest or support

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.600
9 out of 10 times, while couples who only
support each other a third of the time split

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.899
within six years.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.909
Ignoring those bids for support and acceptance
can have an actual physiological effect.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.039
The Gottmans and a team of researchers brought
in newlyweds to interview them.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.460
They were asked some pretty tough questions
on their relationships while electrodes monitored

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.049
their heart rates, blood flow, and sweatiness.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.069
while across the board, everyone responded
calmly to the questions, some couples showed

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.840
higher heart rates, blood flow, and sweat
production.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.790
In other words, their palms were sweaty, knees
weak, arms are heavy.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.530
They’re nervous, but on the surface they
look calm and ready.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.260
The stress of being in the same room as their
spouse and talking about their relationship

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.030
caused their sympathetic nervous system to
kick in and they had a fight-or-flight response.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.780
Those couples were usually divorced within
6 years.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.060
So if you want to have a healthy and less
stressful relationship, it’s important you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.850
both work to actively support each other’s
emotional bids, even if camping is just the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.850
worst.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.610

of how texting can ruin a relationship.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.160
What do you think the key is to living happily
ever after?
