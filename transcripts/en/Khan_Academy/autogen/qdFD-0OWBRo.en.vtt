00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.770
 Suppose we have the same track that we had in the past video. 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.710
 My sketch is y axis, which is my x. 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.630
 Let's say the track looks like this, it seems 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.570
 something like that. 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.080
 It's the same one we had in the last video. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.270
 May not look quite like it, let me see what I am 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.430
 I did the last video. 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.330
 He started like this in the last video, but he closed enough. 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.270
 Suppose we are dealing with the same settings 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.450
 Curve as the last video. 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.840
 This curve can be called c. 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.850
 Another video now, we only deal with a vector field 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.240
 Vector in i direction. 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.590
 Let's build with another vector field that only contains the vector in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680
 J direction, or vertical orientation. 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.810
 So let's say that, the field vector to the XY layout, say it is equal 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:54.430
 To the capital times X and Y in J, we will worry 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.120
 We ourselves are on our way to care though 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:09.310
 Closed line integral about cq dot dt and 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.760
 We saw that act. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.240
 Dr. K can be rewritten as dx times, in addition to dy times. 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.940
 So if we take the product dot these two, this 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.300
 An integral line would be the same thing. 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.830
 This will be the same as a closed line 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.090
 Integrated via C of Dr. Well, q has only a component. 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.830
 So if you take [? with it?] 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.780
 Is 0i, where 0 times 0x and then you will 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.190
 To have an x ​​and y layout times dy. 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.810
 It has no i component, so this is just going to be q, 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.780
 Will switch to the same color again, p x y dy times. 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.900
 This product point. 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.960
 There was no i-component, that's why we lose dx. 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.030
 Now let's see if there is any way we can solve this line 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.710
 Integral without having to resort to a third parameter, t. 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.780
 As we did in the past video. 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.875
 In fact, it will be almost identical, we only deal 

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.080
 With the quality now instead of x marks 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.920
 Even what we can do, we can say, too, what we may have 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.070
 y minimum and our maximum y? 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.120
 So we have the minimum y, let's say the right here. 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.840
 Y lower, let us call that. 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.906
 Let's say y maximum we can achieve right there. 

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:24.880
 Let us call that b. 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.960
 Oh, just like in the past, I forgot to tell you 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.250
 Curve direction. 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.270
 But this is the same track as last time, so we're on our way 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.070
 Counterclockwise. 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.500
 The exact same curve, the exact same path. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.180
 So we're going in that direction. 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.160
 Now in the last video, we broke into it's two functions 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.600
 X, the quality of two functions as x. 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.920
 Now we want to deal with quality 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.530
 Let us divide into two tasks a thief. 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.560
 So if we can divide this path into two tracks, that kind 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.720
 And refer us to the extreme, let us call this last right here, let's 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.110
 Call that right path there, let's call that y, let's call 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.930
 That X of the day up here, walk on this path, x is equal to today, or 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.350
 You can only write track 2, or call from c2. 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.956
 We can tell him, 

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:22.210
 Equals x 2 x of y. 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.550
 That is the way. 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.250
 And then track first, or it should not be 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.740
 The first path, depending on where you start. 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.670
 You can start anywhere. 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.410
 Suppose this one is in purple. 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.050
 We will call this track 1, we can say, to know 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.480
 Where x equals 1 x of y. 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.395
 It's a bit confusing when you have x as a thief, 

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:41.290
 But it is identical to what we were really quite 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.470
 I did the last video. 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.630
 We're literally trading just the x and y signs. 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.140
 We are now expressing x as a function of thief, instead 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.870
 Thief as a function of x. 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.560
 So we have these two curves. 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.680
 You can only imagine flipping, and we are adjusting 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.460
 The same thing that we did in the past videos, just 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.820
 Now in terms of y. 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.610
 But if you look at it this way, this line can be integral 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.590
 Rewrite as being equal to integration, let's 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.650
 Just do c2 first. 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.380
 This integration of B to. 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.860
 Start with B, and go to. 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.290
 That is, you are returning from high y to low y. 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:30.240
 Integrated from B to Q of the day in that gray color. 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.430
 Q, instead of having x there, we know along this curve 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.650
 Right here, equal to x, we want everything in terms of y. 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.210
 So here, it equals x 2 x of y. 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.800
 Q Up to 2 x from y, 2 x from yy comma, maybe I'm using a large number of 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.680
 The colors here, but I think you get the idea. 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.045
 dy. 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.580
 So this is the part of the line that is embedded, just over 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.800
 This curve is the left hand. 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.940
 And then we'll add to that line integration, or 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.980
 Really just a regular integrated now, from y equals a thief 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:18.325
 Equals P, instead of x equals 2 x, now x 

00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:21.170
 Is equal to 1 x of y, equal to this curve, this is 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.780
 Another function. 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:33.060
 So 1 x of y, 1 x of yy is a comma, dy, and we can do exactly what 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.900
 We did the previous video. 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.370
 Instead, we do not like the larger number at the bottom, even 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.760
 Let's swap these two around. 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.870
 Even if you swap these two, if you make it in, and 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.800
 This is in A B, which makes the integrated negative, 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.200
 When you swap the two, change the direction. 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.150
 That's exactly what we did in the last video, so hopefully 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.000
 It is not too fancy. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.490
 But now that we have the same limits of integration, 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.690
 These integrals are two meta-tools, we can only write them down 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.280
 One integrated metadata tool. 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.470
 So this will not be equal to the integrated from to b. 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.450
 I write this one first, so it's positive. 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.370
 I am writing in this one. 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:18.500
 Q of 1 x of yy is a comma, minus this one. 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.730
 is not it? 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.710
 We have the subtraction here. 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:28.590
 Minus 2 x of y and y dy. 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.540
 Let me do it in those neutral colors. 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.590
 dy, which hits all these things. 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.060
 I distributed out dy, I think you get the idea. 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.930
 This is exactly what we did in the last video. 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.810
 This can be returned, since this is equal to integration 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.120
 From B to B, it is integrated within, we can evaluate 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:57.490
 Function P x Y from the border, the top 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.880
 Border, where the upper border will be of x 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.696
 Equals 1 x of y, and minimum 

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:11.560
 Equals x 2 x of y. 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.970
 is not it? 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.950
 All the x signs we replace are Balti, and then we got some 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.490
 Expression, then from that, we subtract this with x 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.650
 Replace as 2 x of y. 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.110
 That's exactly what we did, just as in another video, 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.160
 We kind of go the opposite direction we usually do 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.990
 Go in Integrations Tool Definition. 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.640
 Usually we get to it, and then the next 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.580
 Step, we get this. 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.210
 But now we are going in reverse direction, but it is 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.420
 However the difference. 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.860
 And all those times are dy. 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.740
 As we saw in the last video, this, let me do it 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.870
 In Orange, this expression, here actually let me 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.590
 Draw this dy out a bit more so no 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.460
 Get all crowded. 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.830
 Let me do dy here. 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:56.100
 This expression, this full expression, is exactly the same 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:07.410
 The integrated thing of x equals, can only be written 

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.280
 Here, let me write them in the same colors. 

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:27.450
 2 x from y 1 x from y 1 x from y in part q 

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.760
 With regard to x dx. 

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.020
 I want to be very clear. 

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.620
 That is, at least in my opinion, the first part, 

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.680
 A little confusing. 

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.620
 But if you only see an integral like this, this 

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.680
 From the inside of the integrated double. 

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.390
 And. 

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.250
 Exterior What we saw there, integrated 

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.380
 From B, D. 

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.280
 But if I just saw this in a dual integrated, what if you 

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.620
 Can you take this anti-adaptive, 

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.640
 It is anti-adaptive in relation to DS, 

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.430
 Antivirative micro-q with respect to x 

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.510
 It is about, and it will not be just q and y. 

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.120
 Because it is an integrated meta-tool, you can evaluate it 

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.850
 1 x of y, then subtract from it, this function 

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.370
 Evaluate 2 x of y, which is exactly what we did. 

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.220
 I wish you appreciate it. 

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.520
 Then we got our score, which is very similar 

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.410
 That last result. 

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.220
 What does this represent a double integral? 

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.390
 It represents, too, anything, if you have any integrated double 

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.970
 To go out of the day if you imagine, these are some function, 

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.640
 Let me draw it in three dimensions. 

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.430
 This is really almost a review of what we did 

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.360
 In the last video. 

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.240
 If this is the y axis, which of us is the x-axis, this is the focus of our work "p". 

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.720
 These are some X and Y function, even some surface you 

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.595
 Can be visualized on the XY plane. 

00:09:48.595 --> 00:09:50.750
 It is some surface. 

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:56.160
 So we can call this partial q in relation to. 

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.260
 Etc. This is a dual integrated, that's basically 

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.490
 Select a region, and you can sort of display the times of this DX 

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.550
 dy as a small difference type in the area. 

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.690
 The area under question, border points, of y 

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.460
 Go from, go y from the bottom, go from 2 x from y, 

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.130
 Our opinion is a curve that looks something like that. 

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.620
 This is the lowest y, here, if we put in two 

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.600
 Dimensions, this was the lowest y-curve. 

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.730
 The y-curve of the upper is 1 x of y, where y-looks the upper curve 

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.210
 something like that. 

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.570
 The upper y-curve is rich in something like this. 

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.510
 So x differs from the bottom-y-curve to the top 

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.650
 Y-Curve, right? 

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.540
 That's what we're doing here. 

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.180
 And then y differs from to b. 

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.340
 So this is basically saying, let's take the multiplier 

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:51.020
 This area is integrated here for this function. 

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.950
 So it's basically the volume, if this is the maximum, 

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.300
 This border is essentially a wall. 

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.680
 The size of that room is. 

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.750
 I do not know what it will look like when 

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.140
 They come here. 

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.840
 But you can imagine something in kind like that. 

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.990
 The size will be that. 

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.690
 That's what we do. 

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.490
 This is a match result we got in the last video. 

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.060
 This is a very neat thing. 

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.600
 So suddenly, this carrier, so - and o x, and I 

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.060
 I did not draw it as I did the last time, so r 

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.630
 Just [? Things?] 

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.475
 J-direction, so just him, if I had to draw her 

00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:21.920
 Vector field, carriers just go up or down. 

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.650
 They have no horizontal component to it. 

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.270
 But we saw, when you start using a vector field like this, you can 

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.810
 Take the integrated line around this closed loop, and will 

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.000
 Write it here, you can take this integral line around this 

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.200
 Close the loop Dr Q Dot, which is worth about integrated around 

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.560
 Closed loop of P and O dy. 

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.240
 Only we calculate that this is twice the equivalent 

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.490
 Integrated across the region. 

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.660
 This is the region. 

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:00.920
 is not it? 

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.380
 That's exactly what we're doing here. 

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.950
 If I just give you the area, you'll know it, if you're 

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.116
 I say, also, being x of, this happens from this 

00:12:07.116 --> 00:12:09.780
 The function to this function, the P goes from to B, and you 

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.310
 You may want to check the dual video parcel, if 

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.970
 That confuses you. 

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.270
 Where we multiply the parcel on the area 

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:20.370
 Micro-of q with respect to x, d-well, can write dx 

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.490
 So right di, or you can da little, right? 

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.110
 Teams hand, to the right, which we can imagine 

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.670
 Kda, the same thing dx dy. 

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.390
 And if we combine that with the last video, this kind 

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.030
 Sleek make it all part together, result 

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.760
 This was the last video. 

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.940
 It is a function that knows exactly where 

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.270
 x, we had, that's right here. 

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.090
 We had that result. 

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.280
 In fact, let me copy and paste both of them into a nice clean 

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.100
 Part of my blackboard board, and then we can do 

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.030
 The result is exciting. 

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.170
 Let me copy and paste this. 

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.300
 That's what we got in the last video. 

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.200
 And this video, we got this result. 

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.080
 I just copy and paste this part right there. 

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.140
 You might already predict where it is going. 

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.490
 And then let me paste it here. 

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.240
 This is the output of this video. 

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.390
 Now let's think of an arbitrary vector field but it is 

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:27.160
 He knows, I'll do pink, let's say and be a vector 

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.780
 Define the field over the plane X and Y, equal and P 

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:39.920
 To add to VHS. 

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.520
 You can almost imagine and are adding us destined 

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.040
 The fields, p and q, that we did in the last two videos. 

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.550
 P this video, we did P in the video before it. 

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.570
 But this really is any arbitrary vector field. 

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.710
 Let's say we want to field carrier, or sorry, 

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.680
 An integrated line for this vector pathology, along some pathway. 

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.730
 It could be the same as the one we did, which it was 

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.870
 Very random password. 

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.440
 It's really no arbitrary course. 

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.620
 So let me draw some arbitrary path over here. 

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.010
 Let's say, this is my arbitrary way, my arbitrary curve. 

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.610
 Let's say it goes in this direction counterclockwise, 

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.530
 Just like that. 

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.830
 I am interested in including the integral line, closed line 

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.570
 Integrated, about this path from Dr. Dutt. 

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.810
 We have seen this several times. 

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:36.700
 Dr. Equal to dx I additionally times dy. 

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.740
 Where such an integral line can be returned, and this is equal 

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.390
 To the integrated line around the c path. 

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.990
 And Dr. Dot, which is about to dx times this term, so that 

00:14:48.990 --> 00:15:00.090
 DS and DX times in addition to this term, XY and YDY times. 

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.250
 And that's all, basically this is the same 

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:11.470
 The thing as an integrated line of xy dx, in addition to the line 

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:16.660
 The integral of the Q and Y dy. 

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.750
 Now what are these things? 

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.180
 That's what we figured in the first video, that's what 

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.160
 We have now figured it out in this video. 

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.190
 This thing here is the same thing 

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.510
 As there is. 

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:35.270
 So this will not be equal to an integrated doubling over this 

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:41.310
 The area is right here, from the micro-minus of the p-y. 

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.550
 Instead of DX Dy, we can say just over 

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.750
 The difference in the region. 

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.870
 And then plus this one, this result. 

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.120
 F. 

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.930
 This is something here exactly what we've just proven, 

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.480
 Exactly what we just showed in this video. 

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.380
 This is in addition, I'll leave it there, maybe I'll do it 

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.760
 Yellow, plus dual integration on the same area 

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.220
 Of partial q in relation to. 

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.090
 Da, where this is just dy dx, or dx dy, you can 

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.950
 System switch, 

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.010
 Area teams. 

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.130
 Now, we can add these two integrals. 

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.070
 What do we get? 

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.220
 So this is worth, and this is kind of our business 

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.680
 Great, great conclusion. 

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.130
 Purple may be called here. 

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.720
 Integrated double around the area, I write this one 

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.230
 First because it is positive, negative, from 

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:42.390
 Micro-of-q with respect to x, minus micro-p with 

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:48.360
 Respect y, d, and difference in the area. 

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.960
 This is our big meals. 

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.670
 This is our big meals. 

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.700
 Let me write here. 

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.620
 Equals the integrated line of the closed loop of Dr 

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.420
 Dual integrated for this expression. 

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.720
 And nothing, just remember. 

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.545
 We do the function that was associated with it 

00:17:07.545 --> 00:17:09.540
 x-component or element i, we do 

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.880
 Partial regarding y. 

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.610
 And the function to which he was associated 

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.530
 Y-component, we do partial regards. 

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.580
 And this is the first one, we deny it. 

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.910
 This is a good way to remember them. 

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.140
 But this is the right result here, and this, perhaps I should 

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:30.730
 Writing in green, this is a theorem in green. 

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.080
 And it is a clean way connected to an integrated line in a vector field 

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.770
 Contains these partial derivatives, assuming they are 

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.460
 These derivatives are partial, to the region, for a double data type 

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.330
 Integrated area. 

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.680
 Now, this is a little side note, we've seen the 

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:56.980
 Clip several before, we learned that if and 

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:02.780
 Conservative, which means that the gradient of some functions, 

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.280
 It is independent of the track, that the integration is closed around 

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.550
 Any path is equal to 0. 

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.980
 That is still true. 

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.720
 So that tells us that if the conservative, this is the right thing 

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.560
 Here should be equal to 0. 

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.070
 This is the only way you always have to force that 

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.350
 This whole integral will be equal, and will be equal 

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.970
 0 across any area, ie, ie. 

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.270
 I'm sure you think about situations where it is 

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.880
 Cancel each other, but the truth on any area. 

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.700
 This is the only way that this will be true. 

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.880
 That these two things will be equal to 0. 

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.220
 So then you can say, partial q with respect to x, minus 

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.370
 Partially in relation to a product, it must be equal to 0, or 

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.970
 These two things have been equal to each other. 

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:45.300
 or. 

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.370
 This kind of result is natural to Greene's theory. 

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.900
 The type of low hanging fruit can be calculated. 

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.010
 Partial q in relation to x is equal to micro 

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.920
 From p to y. 

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.070
 And when you study the exact equations in the difference 

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.460
 Equations, you'll see this a lot. 

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.140
 In fact, well, I will not go into much, but conservatives 

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.330
 Fields, you actually, differential shape what 

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.500
 Look at the line integrals, if conservative, it 

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.450
 Be accurate equation. 

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.610
 But will not go that much. 

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.330
 But it is hoped that you may see similarities if you've already run 

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.790
 In precise equations in differential equations. 

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.980
 But this is a big meal, let's probably do some 

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.780
 Examples of using these meals in the next video.
