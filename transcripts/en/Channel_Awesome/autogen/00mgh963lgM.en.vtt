00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 align:start position:0%
rich that even the backgrounds are
 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
rich that even the backgrounds are

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 align:start position:0%

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.350 align:start position:0%
designed nicer like they're shaded nicer
and<00:04:33.949><c> there's</c><00:04:34.160><c> more</c><00:04:34.490><c> there's</c><00:04:34.729><c> like</c><00:04:34.850><c> color</c><00:04:35.060><c> line</c>

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
and there's more there's like color line
 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
and there's more there's like color line
work<00:04:35.690><c> and</c><00:04:35.870><c> a</c><00:04:36.020><c> lot</c><00:04:37.009><c> more</c><00:04:37.250><c> detail</c><00:04:37.810><c> yeah</c><00:04:38.830><c> I</c><00:04:39.830><c> would</c>

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 align:start position:0%
work and a lot more detail yeah I would
 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.420 align:start position:0%
work and a lot more detail yeah I would
say<00:04:40.280><c> detail</c><00:04:40.789><c> in</c><00:04:40.970><c> more</c><00:04:41.180><c> of</c><00:04:41.330><c> the</c><00:04:41.860><c> icy</c><00:04:42.860><c> shading</c>

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 align:start position:0%
say detail in more of the icy shading
 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.340 align:start position:0%
say detail in more of the icy shading
because<00:04:43.910><c> a</c><00:04:44.060><c> lot</c><00:04:44.300><c> of</c><00:04:44.330><c> backgrounds</c><00:04:45.139><c> are</c><00:04:45.199><c> very</c>

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 align:start position:0%
because a lot of backgrounds are very
 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
because a lot of backgrounds are very
detailed<00:04:45.500><c> but</c><00:04:45.919><c> this</c><00:04:46.100><c> was</c><00:04:46.310><c> definitely</c><00:04:46.669><c> shaded</c>

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
detailed but this was definitely shaded
 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.719 align:start position:0%
detailed but this was definitely shaded
to<00:04:47.449><c> cel-shaded</c><00:04:48.229><c> and</c><00:04:48.500><c> it</c><00:04:49.009><c> played</c><00:04:49.280><c> with</c><00:04:49.460><c> light</c>

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 align:start position:0%
to cel-shaded and it played with light
 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.050 align:start position:0%
to cel-shaded and it played with light
and<00:04:50.030><c> so</c><00:04:50.210><c> I</c><00:04:50.660><c> guess</c><00:04:50.840><c> I</c><00:04:51.110><c> guess</c><00:04:51.259><c> it's</c><00:04:51.440><c> more</c><00:04:51.650><c> like</c>

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 align:start position:0%
and so I guess I guess it's more like
 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.810 align:start position:0%
and so I guess I guess it's more like
things<00:04:53.060><c> were</c><00:04:53.270><c> clearer</c><00:04:53.810><c> yes</c><00:04:54.350><c> my</c><00:04:54.919><c> Disney</c><00:04:55.220><c> yeah</c>

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 align:start position:0%
things were clearer yes my Disney yeah
 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.580 align:start position:0%
things were clearer yes my Disney yeah
yeah<00:04:56.240><c> like</c><00:04:56.660><c> cuz</c><00:04:56.870><c> they're</c><00:04:57.139><c> walking</c><00:04:57.500><c> and</c>

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 align:start position:0%
