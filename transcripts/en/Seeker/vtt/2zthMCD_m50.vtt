00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.340
Volcanic eruptions may be terrifying, deadly,
and wreak havoc on transatlantic air travel,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.309
but they can also show us how the Earth’s
crust regenerates.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.430
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
We might not think about it, but beneath our
feet the Earth is a really active planet.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.070
The crust, the most superficial layer of the
planet, constantly regenerates.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.610
Molten rock in the mantle forms vertical sheet-like
structures called dykes, and as these rise,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.880
they force surface rock apart, typically where
two plates are moving away from one another.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.609
This creates a new portion of crust, but it
usually happens beneath the oceans where we

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:38.609
can’t see it.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.800
But the Bárðarbunga [BARTHAR BOONKA] volcano
in Iceland, which is buried beneath the Vatnajökull

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.179
[VATNA yukuk] ice cap, has recently become
active enough to offer scientists a rare chance

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.370
to see this resurfacing process in action.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.109
The volcano reawakened in August 2014, and
scientists have been monitoring the magma

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.280
flow in the surrounding area using GPS and
satellites.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.170
Specifically, scientists were able to track
the path of the moving magma for some 28 miles

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.870
before it reached a point where the volcano
began to erupt.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.720
The slow, long movement of magma comes down
to the way these dykes form and behave.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.500
Dykes form in segments, moving along the path
of least resistance and breaking through cracks

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.750
in rocks as the pressure from beneath builds.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.220
This means that the pressure from the mantle
as dykes form can spread out under something

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.040
like a volcano and rise to the surface at
points where there are breaks in the crust.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.960
In the case of the volcano in Iceland, scientists
actually measured a dyke change directions

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.060
at one point, yielding to the influence of
plate tectonics.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.900
They also uncovered the existence of ice cauldrons,
which are depressions in the glacier ice that

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.070
had been melted by magma.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.170
So the active Earth resurfacing itself all
comes down to magma breaking through the pressure

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.720
of rock and ice while responding to the pull
of plates moving apart.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.250
And speaking of breaking through things, sort
of, breaking through the internet to get your

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.700
story told is easier than ever when you own
your own domain.
