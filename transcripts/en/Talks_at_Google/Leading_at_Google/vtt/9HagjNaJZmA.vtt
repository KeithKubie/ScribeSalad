[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:08.210
SPEAKER: Gadi Ezra hold an
unparalleled perspective

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.060
on war, as both a human
rights attorney on one hand

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.837
and a soldier in Israeli
Special Forces on the other.

00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:15.920
He is currently advising
the Defense Establishment

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.620
on International Aspects
while pursuing his PhD in law.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.052
Gadi is a Forbes 30
under 30 honoree,

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:23.510
and holds already
three law degrees

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.580
from both Tel Aviv
University and NYU

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.150
School of Law specializing in
public law and human rights.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.190
At NYU, Gadi was
the first Israeli

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.320
chosen to deliver the
convocation speech

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.120
on behalf of his classmates.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.220
Previously he served
as a legal advisor

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.405
in the Israeli Ministry
of Foreign Affairs,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.780
and was selected to clerk
directly for the State Attorney

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.670
of Israel, Mr.
Moshe Lador, where

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.462
he participated in cardinal
decision-making processes.

00:00:46.462 --> 00:00:48.420
Drawing from his personal
experience as well as

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.390
his strong academic and
practical background

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.220
as a human rights lawyer,
Gadi examines the complexities

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.120
of applying the laws of
warfare in actual combat.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.761
So with that,
please welcome Gadi.

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:00.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.850
GADI EZRA: All right.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.600
Can everybody hear me?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.100
All right.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.482
So good afternoon and
thank you for coming.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:12.190
We were walking in
the building, and it's

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.840
a beautiful, beautiful building
environment and a lovely winter

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.860
day in the city.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.960
However, I'm here to talk to
you about a less pleasant issue.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.780
I'm here to talk
to you about war.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.870
War in one word, really, if
I could sum it up, is hell.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.290
War is the most chaotic
and unexpected scenario

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.450
you can find yourself in.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.570
And we as a Western society,
we have a very interesting way

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.600
to regulate this terrible
phenomenon called war.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.980
We call it the laws of war,
the laws of armed conflict.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.440
For those of you
who do not know,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.860
the laws of war are basically
a bunch of rules anchored

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.360
in different treaties,
international laws,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.430
domestic ones, and customs,
and they define the dos

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.620
and don'ts within war.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.150
They do not explain
to the commander

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.360
how tactically or strategically
operate within war.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.120
How to maneuver with the tanks
or with the F-35s, but rather,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.440
they define the general
moral guidelines

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.550
of how one should behave within
this terrible phenomenon.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.110
I had the pleasure of dealing
with war issues for the past 12

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.200
or 13 years of my life
from different angles.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.470
And as time went by, I started
to ask myself some questions.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.890
What is the purpose
of these laws?

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.250
Is it to protect innocent lives
during combat like most of us

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.840
would have think?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.540
Or perhaps from a mental
health perspective,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.310
to make sure that
soldiers would not

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.300
engage in horrific scenes
which will corrupt their souls.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.250
Others, cynical
scholars may claim

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.190
that those who shaped the
laws of armed conflict

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.620
did so in a way which
will help them--

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.300
or their nations-- to win wars
against less powerful actors,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.043
also known as terrorist
organizations.

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:04.130
Yet the truth is a bit
more complicated than that,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.780
and I simply know this
because I have been there.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.580
As I was kindly
introduced, my name is Gadi

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.640
and I hold a dual
perspective on war,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.520
both as a professional, as an
academic, but more importantly,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.500
as a combat soldier
who knows how

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.160
the translation of these
laws looks like in real life,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.140
in real combat.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.360
And today I'm going to make a
very simple argument to you.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.220
A strict adherence to the
laws of armed conflict

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.380
might put you on the
right side of the law.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.540
You are not going
to be indicted.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.370
Mazel tov.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.600
Yet it might lead you to partake
in some horrific, horrific

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.130
scenes.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.270
In order to avoid those scenes
yet to fulfill your mission,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.570
you would occasionally have
to apply higher standards

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.900
than the legal ones.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.000
If I may add, the low,
low standard legal ones.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.880
And in order to prove
that point to you,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.530
I would like to share with you
my personal story from Gaza.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.830
But before we begin, two main
assumptions for this talk.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.210
Number one, the scenes that I'm
going to describe to you today

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.850
are ones that I have sensed
from my own subjective senses.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.940
So other people who
were among those scenes

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.339
might describe them
a bit differently.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.860
And number two,
the views that I'm

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.313
going to share with you today
are my own personal views

00:04:22.313 --> 00:04:24.730
and they do not represent any
governmental office or other

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.470
entity whatsoever.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.550
OK.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.050
So now we can begin.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.090
So to talk to you about
my Gaza experiences,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.100
I would like to take you
back precisely 10 years ago--

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.270
December 2008.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.220
The state of Israel
is about three years

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.410
after the disengagement
plan in which

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.510
we evacuated any Israeli
presence from the Gaza Strip.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.010
Two years after Hamas
took over the Gaza Strip--

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.210
the terrorist organization
of Hamas over the Gaza Strip.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.920
And let's say that since Hamas
took over, the state of Israel

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.320
has suffered
thousands of thousands

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.210
of rockets being fired at our
villages in southern Israel.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.940
I was a civilian at that
time finishing my three years

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.500
of mandatory military service--

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.920
I was actually a 1L student,
my first year in law school,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.870
my first semester.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.730
And it's a Saturday
night, and I'm

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.640
finishing a terrific weekend
in my parents' house, which

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.930
is located down south in an
area already bombarded by Hamas.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.610
I'm driving my '95
blue Fiat right

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.510
inside Tel Aviv to begin
another week in law school.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.210
And at some point during
the entrance to Tel Aviv,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.110
I'm receiving a very
weird phone call

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.540
from an unidentified number.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.010
I'm making the mistake and
I'm answering this phone call.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.640
And on the other
side of the line

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.240
there is an automatic
message that basically asks

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.020
me to urgently arrive at our--

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.800
at my unit the
following morning.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.400
Today we are very smart after
three different campaigns

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.800
in Gaza.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.510
But back then, no
one really believed

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.020
we are going to war inside Gaza.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.540
So the next day,
my teammates and I,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.677
brothers from different mothers,
we are arriving at our unit

00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:15.260
and we really happy
to see each other.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.093
It's like a reunion.

00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:19.990
A lot of high-fives, a lot
of hugs, a lot of coffee.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.690
But very quickly we're
heading down south

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.780
to an army base in which
we spend the next week.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.630
During that week, we had
a pretty clear routine.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.550
During the days
we were training,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.500
we were simulating the
different scenarios

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.320
we thought we were going
to experience inside Gaza.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.840
During the night,
we were waiting.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.160
We were waiting for the
final call to invade Gaza.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.910
Each night we came
prepared with our gear,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.920
with our vests, grenades,
magazines, rifles,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.463
some candy bars for
the rough times,

00:06:49.463 --> 00:06:51.880
and by that, I'm going to say
I'm not going to glorify war

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.255
to you because
that's going to be

00:06:53.255 --> 00:06:54.800
a disrespect to
your intelligence.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.830
Yes, we did made sure
we have enough candies

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.120
for the rough times.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.930
It's essential sometimes
as other means.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.380
And we would stand in
front of our commander,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.870
and he would come and
he would look at us

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.430
and just say that every
night that everything is

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.620
postponed in 24 hours.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.250
The invasion is postponed
in 24 hours, just like that.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.870
Night after night after
night after night,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.770
which lasted to a
nerve-wracking week.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.620
I want you to think about
that feeling for a second

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.950
about a civilian that was
ripped out of his nice Espresso

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.200
routine in Tel Aviv
University, and he's

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.470
about to enter a territory in
which he could lose his life.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.720
And he doesn't know when
this is going to happen.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.110
I'm not sure the Geneva
Conventions nor the Hague

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.120
Regulations take these
emotions into account.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.490
But after one week--
precisely after,

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.350
it was Saturday night again.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.170
We were told that tonight is the
night and we're invading Gaza.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.170
We were transported to
another military base,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.000
this time much, much
closer to the border.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.210
And there we got
an emotional speech

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.060
from a very, very high-ranking
commander in the paratroopers.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:13.233
His speech was mainly focused
on Zionism, ideals, morales.

00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:15.400
Let me tell you, if there's
one thing that I learned

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.190
after three years
in the military,

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.730
is that if a commander's speech
is primarily focused on Zionism

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.760
and ideals and less about
the particular mission,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.570
this means things
are really bad.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.510
And that was the feeling.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.400
I was terrified.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.990
If anyone will tell
you they're not

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.620
terrified before
going to battle--

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.130
in our case, to Lebanon,
to Gaza, wherever,

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.320
they're either liars or crazy.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.790
I was terrified.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.310
The walk.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.730
The walk towards the Gaza
Strip starts about 1.2 miles

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.820
in Israeli territory.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.780
And we are carrying an enormous
amount of weight on our back.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.490
I'm carrying about 110 pounds
on my back of food, water,

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.020
ammunition,
camouflage equipment,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.260
different stuff we
usually take in with us.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.810
And during our walk, we are
accompanied by literally a wall

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.870
of fire being shot from
vessels, helicopters, artillery,

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.180
everything in order
to make sure that we

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.910
are going to arrive that our
destination the safest way

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.080
possible.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.110
And our mission, our
mission was pretty clear.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.970
We were told we needed
to locate ourselves

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.015
in front of the first line
of houses off the Gaza Strip.

00:09:31.015 --> 00:09:32.890
Once you're going to
get there, we were told,

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.860
you need to camouflage
yourself, become invisible,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.917
and constantly spot terrorists
in that first line of houses.

00:09:39.917 --> 00:09:41.500
Once you're going
to spot a terrorist,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.470
you're going to be allocated
with a helicopter or a drone

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.440
above your head, and the
helicopter or the drone

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.480
needed to help the terrorist
to reunite with God.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.430
So the purpose was pretty clear.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.440
We needed to make sure
that the surface is

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.810
safe for the rest
of the forces that

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:04.240
needed to invade that territory
about 48 to 72 hours later.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.740
And after around
two hours of walk,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.370
we were arriving at
a large sand dune.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.870
Now we knew it in
advance because we

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.280
had the maps and
intel and everything,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.110
but only when we got
there have we realized

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.527
that we were in a Jewish
village that was evacuated

00:10:17.527 --> 00:10:18.610
in the disengagement plan.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.330
We were literally the first
Israelis to go back there.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.300
I vividly remember
still the old basketball

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.580
court of the village.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.230
Some of the public facilities.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.300
Some people find mezuzahs
in the ground, in the sand.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.760
Yet we did not have
time for any nostalgia

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.930
because we did not
know two things.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.460
We did not know if the
terrorists that were only 200,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.530
300 yards away from
us at that point

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.638
has an ability to
see us at night.

00:10:47.638 --> 00:10:49.180
But more importantly,
we did not know

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.820
if they have sniping ability.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.830
So we were literally
in a race against time

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.218
to camouflage ourselves
the fastest way possible

00:10:56.218 --> 00:10:57.760
before the sun comes
up and we're all

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.800
going to end up like
ducks in a shooting range.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.200
And after additional two
hours of walk-- work,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.620
our team is creating what we
call in the military slang

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.090
a camouflaged position.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.827
This is basically a fake
artificial territory

00:11:12.827 --> 00:11:13.660
that we're creating.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.190
It is no larger from--

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.277
what is your name, sir?

00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:17.110
AUDIENCE: It's Fred.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.490
GADI EZRA: From
where Fred is to--

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.407
AUDIENCE: [? Eudor. ?]

00:11:19.407 --> 00:11:22.090
GADI EZRA: To [? Eudor. ?]
And in that territory, which

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.620
looks like it's
an integral part,

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.260
like a line-- another layer
of the sand in the dune,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.500
you would have six to seven IDF
soldiers that would sit inside,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.260
and inside, they
would have to eat,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.920
to drink, to communicate, to
do what human beings are doing

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.140
every three to
four hours together

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.060
with your teammates,
which can create

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.130
quite amusing scenes sometimes.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.208
And again, conduct the mission.

00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:46.000
Constantly look for
terrorists, once you're

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.910
spotting a terrorist, report
to the helicopter or the drone,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.800
and then close the
circle of fire,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.950
how would we call it
in the military slang.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.630
And it did not
take long before we

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.230
have faced our first scenario
in Operation Cast Lead.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:04.840
Around day two, we're
spotting on the third floor

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.750
of a building a terrorist.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.300
He is looking for IDF
soldiers in the horizon.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.520
He's clearly on an
intelligence mission,

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.790
he has no idea we're seeing him
because we're invisible to him.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.240
But we are preparing
ourselves for an engagement.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.610
We're talking to the
pilot above our head.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.170
Now I can tell you
as a lawyer now,

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.672
that if we had the Geneva
Conventions right there with us

00:12:25.672 --> 00:12:27.880
in that camouflaged position,
they would have told us

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.130
we are doing the
exact right thing.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.760
The reason is a core principle
in international law called

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.700
the principle of necessity.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.380
The principle of
necessity basically

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.380
says that weakening the other
party to an armed conflict

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.350
is a legitimate cause.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.910
As a matter of fact, the
only legitimate cause.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.810
Yet you would all agree with me
that targeting Hamas terrorists

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.120
in the middle of an
operation in Gaza for me

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.850
is a legitimate cause, right?

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.320
Yet life, as they tend to be,
were a bit more complicated

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.820
than that.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.510
Because right next
to the terrorist,

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.490
we're spotting a woman.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.340
We're looking at them
for over an hour,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.250
and we're concluding that
she is not a terrorist,

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.260
that she is a civilian.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.010
Now the laws of armed conflict
do acknowledge the fact

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.547
that civilians can
find themselves

00:13:16.547 --> 00:13:18.130
at the middle of the
war zone as well.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.505
And another
interesting principle

00:13:19.505 --> 00:13:22.090
called the principle
of distinction

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.720
says that civilians are
immune from any attack

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.060
unless they are
directly participating

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.980
in the hostilities themselves--

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.960
DPHing.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.830
Yet this woman was not DPHing.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.230
She was probably there
against her will,

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.080
or at least we could not prove
that she was voluntarily there.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.280
And then we were realizing
we're facing a true scenario

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.700
of a human shield.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.610
Now I do not have a
sniping ability in my team.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.850
Even if I would have, I wouldn't
take a shot with a sniper,

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.830
probably, although it's very
accurate and precise, because I

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.750
wouldn't want to
give away my location

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.190
due to operational reasons.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.410
I'm on an undercover mission.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.140
I do have a helicopter
above my head.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.510
The helicopter has a
very lethal missile

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.720
that can go right through the
window, and if it's not clear,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.180
take them both.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.930
Does this mean
that the terrorist

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.140
shall enjoy the immunity
granted to the woman

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.540
according to the laws of war?

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.870
Of course not, because of
another interesting principle

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.200
in international law, which
is called the principle

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.360
of proportionality.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.318
The principle of
proportionality basically says

00:14:32.318 --> 00:14:33.818
the following thing,
and be with me,

00:14:33.818 --> 00:14:35.850
because it sounds like
an equation in algebra.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.450
You're smart people,
but try to hold on.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.230
A military action is forbidden--

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.770
a military action is
forbidden if the collateral

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:51.270
damage it causes is excessive
to the military advantage.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.060
If the collateral
damage it causes

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.960
is excessive to the
military advantage.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.660
Now putting that in the
human being's language

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.350
for a second, what the laws of
armed conflict expect me to do,

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.980
a 22-year-old kid,
hungry, tired,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.130
and missing my
girlfriend, is to evaluate

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.392
hypothetically how
many points will I

00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:14.850
gain from targeting
that terrorist,

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.148
and hypothetically evaluate
how many points will I

00:15:17.148 --> 00:15:18.440
lose from targeting that woman.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.660
And if the number that
I'm receiving is positive,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.100
I did the right
thing, and if not,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.300
I might just perhaps did
a very, very bad thing.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:26.840
Good luck.

00:15:29.588 --> 00:15:33.117
I want to pause for
a second and ask you,

00:15:33.117 --> 00:15:34.700
what do you think
the right answer is?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.280
Let's make a quick
poll in the room.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.920
Who thinks that under
these circumstances

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.240
where I have a terrorist
right in front of me--

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.323
he's holding an
AK-47, a Kalashnikov,

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:46.740
and he's looking
for IDF soldiers,

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.220
and I have a woman
right next to him--

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.450
that under these circumstances
I should not take the shot?

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.590
AUDIENCE: OK, can
I ask, [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.960
why does the shot need to
be taken in the first place?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.150
GADI EZRA: Because my
mission as a soldier

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.080
there is to make sure that
no terrorist is surviving

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.970
and harming the
rest of the forces

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.381
that are going to invade
to that territory later.

00:16:10.381 --> 00:16:13.630
AUDIENCE: Well because it seems
like we're missing information,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:18.280
because you're only given one
specific means of neutralizing

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.375
that person.

00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:20.890
And we don't really
have information

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.390
about the strategic
value of that person.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.067
GADI EZRA: Well, war is
the kingdom of uncertainty.

00:16:26.067 --> 00:16:26.650
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.820
GADI EZRA: And I'm not
missing details for purpose,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.450
but rather trying to give you
the true authentic way you

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.580
would look at it on the ground.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.170
Now let me ask you
another question.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.360
Those of you who
would take the shot,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.160
may I ask you to raise
your hand, please?

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.660
All right.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.280
Those of you who
would take the shot,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.190
would you change your mind
if I will tell you that she

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.870
held a baby in her arms?

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.120
You wouldn't change your mind?

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.290
Because she did.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.160
AUDIENCE: I
[? wouldn't ?] [? have. ?]

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.160
GADI EZRA: You would?

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.660
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.702
GADI EZRA: You would not?

00:16:57.702 --> 00:16:59.120
You would not take the shot?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.703
AUDIENCE: I would
still take the shot.

00:17:00.703 --> 00:17:03.140
GADI EZRA: OK.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.800
I saw some of you kind of
like feeling uncomfortable

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.040
when I added the baby
component to that equation.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.510
And the truth is, the terrorists
are doing that on purpose.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.290
It's a known mean by them.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.130
Now I remember
sharing that scenario

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.089
with a colleague in a Red Cross
conference in Geneva once,

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.895
and he was less struggling
than some of you here.

00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:27.270
His answer was a
straightforward,

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.990
of course you can take the
shot, what's the problem?

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.740
And you know what?

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.860
Legally speaking, he
might be just right.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.860
Guys, the laws of armed conflict
has acknowledged sometimes

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.920
far away excessive
collateral damage

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.050
than just a woman and a baby.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.695
Sometimes five, sometimes
10, sometimes 15 people.

00:17:45.695 --> 00:17:47.570
Depends on the military
advantage, of course,

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.490
in a given case.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.950
But the equation is
relatively simple.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.350
Yet I gotta tell you that once
you're there on the ground--

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.830
on the ground, things tend to
look a bit more complicated.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.390
Because come on, let's face it.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:10.260
This woman is not collateral
damage, she's a human being.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.900
She has a face.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.520
She has a name.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.050
She has hopes.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.970
Aspirations.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.730
Past, present, perhaps a future.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.020
Friends, family members-- I can
see one of them in her arms.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:28.760
She's not just collateral
damage, she's a living soul.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.220
So we decided to wait.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.840
We decided to wait
for a time window

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.030
in which she would be allowed
to go to the restrooms

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.057
or whatever she
was allowed to do.

00:18:38.057 --> 00:18:39.890
And some of us still
do remember the missile

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.590
going right through the
window and her running

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.120
away from the
building hysterically

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.400
with a baby in her arms.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.130
We know she survived
because she ran on her feet.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.250
The terrorist is no longer
with us if you're concerned.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:56.270
But did we apply higher
standards than the legal ones?

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.560
Yes.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.650
Did we make our lives
more complicated?

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.180
Yes.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.460
However, can we sleep
better at night?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.540
Yes, we can.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.100
Absolutely.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.800
After four whole days in that
camouflaged position, four

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.400
whole days, we were told
that the valley between where

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.350
we were and the
first line of houses

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.500
was already occupied by the IDF.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.100
And the IDF has created what we
call in the military [HEBREW]

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.970
in Hebrew.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.340
[HEBREW] is
basically a safe zone

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.390
framed by sand batteries in
which vehicles, tanks, jeeps

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.470
could park safely.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.860
Soldiers could rest
there safely as well.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.800
Usually supply of
food and ammunition

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.280
would be transported
to the [HEBREW]..

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.410
It's like a
must-go-through point

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.840
before things are being
distributed to the soldiers

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.490
on the battlefield.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.010
Bodies of that soldiers would
be moved to the [HEBREW]

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.760
first, and only from there, sent
to burial in Israeli territory.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.060
So we were told,
go to the [HEBREW]

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.790
and wait for your
next assignment.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.080
We were also told, do
not leave the [HEBREW]

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.800
under any circumstances,
because if you

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.180
are outside of the [HEBREW]
with no permission,

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.757
the presumption is that
you are a terrorist.

00:20:11.757 --> 00:20:14.090
And if you're a terrorist,
according to the laws of war,

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.340
you're a legitimate target.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.880
Yet while we were
there, at some point,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.790
the soldiers who are
guarding the [HEBREW]

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.390
are seeing an IDF soldier
walking outside of the [HEBREW]

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.790
towards them.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.488
He's walking towards them
and they're screaming at him.

00:20:33.488 --> 00:20:34.530
Hey, what do you do here?

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.780
Please identify yourself.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.330
And the guy ignores them
and continues to walk.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:42.500
Brother, please stop.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.020
Who are you?

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.530
They scream at him again.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.890
And he continues to walk.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.050
30 meters, 25 meters, 20 meters.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.040
Now because he looked so good--

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.650
he looked like a
poster of the IDF

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.915
rather than a skinny,
sandy, muddy soldier

00:21:00.915 --> 00:21:02.540
like we were at that
time, they thought

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.180
he's from a particular
engineering unit called

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.980
the [HEBREW] which
is the equivalent

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.560
word in Hebrew for diamond.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.410
So they're reaching out to
the guy for the third time.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.250
And they're asking him, hey, are
you are you from the [HEBREW]

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.420
by any chance?

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.160
The guy stops, he looks
at them and he says,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:27.520
[SPEAKING ARABIC] in Arabic.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.300
That was a Hamas terrorist.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.250
He was disguised
as an IDF soldier,

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.750
he had ammunition
all over his body.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.080
And his plan was to
enter the [HEBREW]

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.030
and conduct what
would have probably

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.150
been the most horrific suicide
attack our country has ever

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.800
known in our war history.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.930
I wouldn't be standing
here if this guy would

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.850
have replied in Hebrew.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.420
He was probably excited, drunk,
drugged, whatever he was,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.950
and he mistakenly
replied in Arabic.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:56.870
Now we were furious.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.510
We were mad at the
soldiers who guarded us.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.070
Why are you conducting
this Q&amp;A session?

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.830
What are you, Oprah?

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.580
Come on, guys.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.600
This is Gaza, it's not a joke.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.850
Do something more tangible.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.070
Shoot to the air, shoot
to the leg, something.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.070
Even now when I started
to describe that scene,

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.720
some of you looked at me
and said, that's not right.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.760
It's not OK.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.840
But you know what?

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.850
It actually took us a
very, very short time

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.430
to realize that they set
a great example for us

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:26.607
and helped us to save lives,
and I'll explain in a second.

00:22:26.607 --> 00:22:28.190
Our next mission was
to locate ourself

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.357
in an apartment which is
in the neighborhood we just

00:22:30.357 --> 00:22:32.430
looked at 24 hours ago.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.105
Go to that apartment,
we were told,

00:22:34.105 --> 00:22:36.080
and look over a
valley which contained

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.708
a lot of rocket launchers.

00:22:38.708 --> 00:22:40.500
Once we're going to
spot a rocket launcher,

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.048
you would be allocated with
a helicopter above your head,

00:22:44.048 --> 00:22:45.590
you have to report
to the helicopter,

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.230
and the helicopter would
close a circle of fire

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.830
as we would do in the military
slang as I described before.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.330
So we're getting
into that apartment

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:57.260
and we are spotting the kitchen
as the most strategic room

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.670
in the house with the best view.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.010
And we're working in the
kitchen-- we're not cooking.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.380
We're playing with
shades and lights

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.870
and we're creating an illusion.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.620
It doesn't matter how
we do it, but if you

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.162
would look from the outside,
you would see a dark empty room,

00:23:09.162 --> 00:23:11.900
but from the inside, you would
have three, four, five IDF

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.450
soldiers looking right at you.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.400
While we were
there, we were also

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.420
accompanied by a younger
team of paratroopers.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.110
That team's sole mission was to
constantly look at the entrance

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.270
to the apartment to make
sure no terrorist is

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:30.270
coming and slaughtering us while
we're not paying any attention.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.192
So there we were, two
teams in one apartment.

00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:35.900
At some point in the
middle of the night,

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.230
that team is getting called to
conduct a different mission.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:43.077
Which is fine-- war is
a very dynamic scene.

00:23:43.077 --> 00:23:44.660
So they're standing
in a line and then

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.990
they're starting to
march away from us.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.180
Now you need to
understand something

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.090
about the walk in war.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.330
Unlike your initial
intuition, the walk in war

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.840
could be extremely,
extremely slow,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.080
because of two main reasons.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.780
Number one, the
physical conditions.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.980
You are terribly
tired, you're hungry,

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.690
you're carrying an enormous
amount of weight on your back.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.400
But number two and
more importantly,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.770
because of operational reasons.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.920
Every few hundred
meters, the soldiers

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.690
who were leading the
force would stop.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.320
They would go down on
the ground and they

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.760
would look for terrorists
on the horizon silently.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.110
After 60, 90 seconds,
while they're

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.110
making sure there are no
terrorists in the area,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.485
they would signal to the people
at the back of the column

00:24:32.485 --> 00:24:35.530
that the surface is clear
and they may proceed.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.910
While they are doing
this, the people

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.050
at the back of the
column, technically they

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.300
need to go down on
their knees as well

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.590
and secure the column to
the sides and the back.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.090
Now this, some would
describe it a bit Hollywood.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.520
Because in real life, what
really happens sometimes

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.600
is that soldiers
tend to daydream.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.203
They would have a snack.

00:25:02.203 --> 00:25:04.370
They would talk to their
friends about how much they

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.170
miss their girlfriend,
and they have

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.030
to propose when everything ends,
and a lot of wedding proposals

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.550
started on those moments.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.960
And some fall asleep.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.710
Happened to me more
than once, by the way.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.690
That I fell asleep
in the middle of war,

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.200
being woken up by a missile,
a shot in the background,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.330
or a bullet somewhere.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.250
Not something rare that
I'm describing to you.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.200
And the same thing
happened with that team.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.620
About a mile away
from us, that team

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.120
is going down on the ground,
they're looking for terrorists.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.950
Some of the people are
kind of daydreaming.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.820
The same thing happens with
the last guy in that column--

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.540
he's falling asleep.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.440
The only problem is that
when this guy opens his eyes,

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.950
he realizes he's all alone.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.970
The procedure, the
protocol is pretty clear.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.010
Before you start
to walk again, you

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.040
have to look back to make
sure your brother is with you.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.520
This team probably-- probably--
did not follow the protocol,

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.982
leaving that guy asleep.

00:26:03.982 --> 00:26:05.690
I want you to realize
what happened here.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.200
We're talking about
a 19-year-old guy

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:13.630
in the middle of war in Gaza
falling asleep, waking up,

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.730
looking left, looking
right, and he sees no one.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.900
He has no radio
and no cell phone.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.280
No nothing.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.430
This is the nightmare
of a lifetime.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.590
So this guy gets panicked.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.550
Who wouldn't, right?

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.620
And he decides to run to the
first place he remembers,

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.870
which is our place.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:42.660
During that time, my teammate,
one of my best friends,

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.625
is looking at the door--
he starts his night shift.

00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:48.000
Before he starts
his night shift,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.640
he's taken a glass
bottle and he breaks it

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.440
at the entrance to the building.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.474
Any idea why he's doing that?

00:26:54.474 --> 00:26:55.830
AUDIENCE: Noise.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:56.580
GADI EZRA: Pardon?

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.247
AUDIENCE: Noise?

00:26:57.247 --> 00:26:58.090
GADI EZRA: Exactly.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.270
For operational reasons.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.900
So if anyone would step
on the glass fragments,

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.820
he would have an advantage
and the element of surprise.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.530
And at some point in the middle
of the night, 2:00, 3:00 AM,

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.530
he hears someone steps
on the glass fragments.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.350
He looks down, he
sees a black figure

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.710
with a gun screaming at
him, hey, I'm IDF, I'm IDF,

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.500
don't shoot, don't shoot.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.280
Really?

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.520
Hamas did the same
thing 24 hours ago.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.380
Now I can tell you as a
lawyer now that my friend had

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.920
any legal justification
to take the shot,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.670
for three main reasons.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.590
Number one, when
this is happening,

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.200
we got no indication on the
radio about a lost soldier.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.033
As a matter of fact,
when this is happening,

00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:48.290
they still continues to
march like nothing happened.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.140
They have no idea
they're missing one guy.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.020
Number two, we know Hamas
is using that method

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.000
of disguising to IDF soldier.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.240
And number three, you tell me--

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.230
what is the reasonable action
expected from a combat soldier

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.930
that is being surprised in the
middle of the night when he

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.870
sees a figure and he cannot
see any identification

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.710
on the uniform because it's
completely dark and someone has

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.900
a gun in front of him?

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.520
I would probably take the shot.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.370
To not be mistaken.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:23.290
Yes, friendly fire is a
terrible, terrible incident,

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.580
yet this is just, I
guess, part of the reality

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:32.630
of whoever engages in this
terrible phenomenon called war.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:38.140
And my friend is a better
soldier than me, probably.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.080
And he takes just
one more second.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.730
He reaches out to the guy and
he asks him, please relax.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.170
What is your name?

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.590
And the guy mumbles hysterically
with literally tears

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.690
in his eyes.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.060
AUDIENCE: How did you see
the tears when it's dark?

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.850
GADI EZRA: Because you can
hear when someone speaks to you

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.760
and he shakes with his voice.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.320
It's pretty obvious
at that point.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.460
And the guy mumbles his name.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.615
Who's your commander?

00:29:08.615 --> 00:29:09.490
What happened to you?

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.940
What are you doing here?

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.180
And after 25, 30
seconds of a dialogue,

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.940
he realizes he's not facing a
disguised terrorist, but rather

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.450
a true authentic lost soldier.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.658
He's taking the gun down
and he's reaching out to him

00:29:21.658 --> 00:29:23.367
and saying, hey brother,
you're safe now.

00:29:23.367 --> 00:29:24.860
You may come, you're with us.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.430
And the guy enters our
apartment, crashes.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:29.740
Again, with tears thanking
us for not killing him.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.100
We're waking up thinking
we're looking at a ghost.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.530
But the truth is that
this guy is alive today

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:41.930
because my friend applied higher
standards than the legal ones.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.980
The following
night we celebrated

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:49.170
Shabbat in that apartment.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:53.940
Until this very day I remember
the davening in that apartment.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.990
Something in the contradiction
between the ancient texts

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.840
of Kaddish of Friday
night davening and the way

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.910
we looked like
24th century robots

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.730
with the lasers and
stuff on our helmets.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.720
That was something that just
was too much-- too hard to bear,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.180
and I'm not embarrassed to say
even until this day that we--

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.250
some of us, we're
conducting this prayer

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.840
with tears in our
eyes, and it was

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.673
one of the most emotional
scenes of my life,

00:30:17.673 --> 00:30:19.360
which I'll never forget.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.450
The following day we
were transported back

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.480
to Israeli territory
for the first time.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.580
We slept more than two hours.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.800
We had a nice breakfast.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.370
Nice.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.300
Not Eggs Benedict.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.820
Cucumbers and cheese
and military standards.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.830
And then we were transported
back to the Gaza Strip again.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.550
But this time,
not to a sand dune

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.920
and not to a lousy
apartment, but rather

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.920
to a very nice villa, actually,
inside the Gaza Strip.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.100
There are such places in Gaza
and you should know this.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.740
And I vividly remember
walking inside that villa,

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.080
and you could tell immediately
that this is the creme de

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.220
la creme of Gaza.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.710
The father of the
family has a picture

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.110
shaking the hand of late
Yasser Arafat on the wall.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.610
There are diplomas in French
and English on the wall.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.310
The kid-- I remember the kid's
room until this very day.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:13.590
The kid had a Sony PlayStation
with a very impressive library

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.340
of games.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.280
"FIFA," "NFL," "NBA."

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.460
And I gotta tell you, we
were happy to be there.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:25.570
If you're in war, then at
least be in a nice facility.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.800
We also noticed, however, that
the family was kind of rushed

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.150
when they left the villa,
because their laundry were

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.868
still folded in a
weird way on the sofa.

00:31:36.868 --> 00:31:37.660
Now think about it.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.180
What we usually do is
that we fold laundry

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.440
in front of the TV, right?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.290
And when we're done, we're
taking it to the closet.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.390
What might have happened
with that family

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.940
was that they folded the
laundry, and then they--

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.980
that indication that
the IDF is coming,

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.100
and they just left
everything as it was.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.350
But we'd not gave that too
much thought at the moment.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.780
We entered the
living room and we--

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.238
some of us crashed on the sofa,
we wanted our backs to have

00:31:59.238 --> 00:31:59.950
some relief--

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.570
it was literally
broken at that point.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.080
And we started to find
ourself in the house

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.730
and to search the
house for bombs

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.045
before beginning to operate
from within the house.

00:32:11.045 --> 00:32:13.170
But after 10 minutes, our
commander comes and says,

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:16.180
guys, change in plans,
change in plans,

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.700
we have to evacuate
this place immediately.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.840
We were very mad.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.120
We wanted to stay there.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.460
But an order is in
order, it is what it is.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.650
So we're standing in a
line in front of the door

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.360
and we're waiting to exit.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.535
And our commander comes and he
says, wait, guys, not just yet.

00:32:36.535 --> 00:32:38.160
What do you want now,
we're asking him.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.535
And he says, well, we gotta
bring this place just the way

00:32:40.535 --> 00:32:42.630
we got it.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.760
So we're replying, wait,
we didn't steal anything.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.885
What are you talking about?

00:32:45.885 --> 00:32:47.512
It's not us, we'll
never do that.

00:32:47.512 --> 00:32:48.720
He's like, no, of course not.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.600
I'm not talking about that.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.350
Look at the living
room, look at the mess.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.710
The entire laundry is on the
floor because of you guys.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:59.160
So I'm finding myself
at the age of 22

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.050
in the middle of
Gaza folding laundry.

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:04.317
Not in the best way.

00:33:04.317 --> 00:33:06.150
When my wife first heard
that, she was like,

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.010
do it at home finally.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.690
But literally folding laundry.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:15.150
Taking a note from this tiny
notebook that I had with me.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:19.045
I do not speak Arabic, although
my mother is an Arabic teacher.

00:33:19.045 --> 00:33:20.670
And I do not know if
they speak Hebrew,

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.460
but I soon had a pretty good
sense that they speak English.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.500
So I took a note and I wrote to
the family, sorry for the mess.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.300
May peace come upon us.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.730
Israeli Special Forces.

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:37.320
And I left the note on the
laundry and we left that villa.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.390
Now I always share
that laundry story,

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.340
not because it's challenging
like the human shield story,

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.880
and not because it's frightening
like the disguised terrorist

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.200
one and not because it's
unbelievable like almost

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.080
friendly fire incident
my friend experienced.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.960
I'm sharing that
story because to me,

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.850
it stresses the
simple notion that we

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.910
as soldiers in every
military are not just dealing

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.020
with collateral damages.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.060
We're dealing with human beings.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.489
And we're taking that
job very, very seriously.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:11.380
Very seriously.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.320
Now do not be mistaken.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.210
We are not perfect.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:17.860
You're not going to
hear that from me.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.159
That's going to be
a blunt disrespect

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.239
to your intelligence.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.969
As a matter of fact,
you can not be perfect

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:25.320
when you're dealing with war.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.900
War is a dirty business.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:34.020
Yet when mistakes happens,
and they do from time to time,

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.000
we investigate.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.929
We press charges.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:37.949
We indict.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.870
We do anything in our
power to make sure

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.540
that these wrongdoings
are not happening again

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.210
and they maintain
as the exception

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.500
and not the general custom.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.010
And we're not just doing that
because of them, by the way.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.300
Again, do not be fooled.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.990
We're doing that
also because of us.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.710
Not to lose who we are.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.910
Because-- and remember that.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.460
I believe that there
is a direct link--

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:10.500
direct link between the way
a nation conducts its warfare

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.160
and the way it
conducts its society.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.080
If we were to be barbarians
on the battlefield

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.150
just because we can,
these norms will

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.320
be integrated into our civilian
lives, particularly in Israel

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.070
where we are a military
of our own people.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.210
We do not have a
professional military.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:28.680
Those norms will be integrated
into our civilian lives,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.710
harms our society, our checks
and balances, and that,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:35.130
my friends, that would be the
end of the Zionist project

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:39.370
as we know it today.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.930
Thank you so much for
coming and listening.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.110
And if you have
any questions, I'm

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.470
more than open to hear them.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.310
Thank you.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.660
