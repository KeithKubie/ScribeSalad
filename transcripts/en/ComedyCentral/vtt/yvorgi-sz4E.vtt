This is Thaddeus Matthews.

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:05.138
I'm the guy that you're talking
about all around the country

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.642
as the "cussing pastor."

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.712

Hell, Jesus probably cursed!

I made that fool?"

Do you kiss your flock

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:32.799
That guy spittin' the holy shit
is Thaddeus, the Cussin' Pastor.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.202
And the only thing he has
in common with Billy Graham

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.437
is that they're both
a little ashy.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.740
Dropping F-bombs
in the name of religion

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.809
is better than dropping actual
bombs because of religion.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.945
Woke joke.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:47.414
As long he's not giving
reach-arounds to altar boys,

I don't give a shit
what he says.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.250
Hosanna!

Cuss words
are a gift from God.

Without them,
all rappers would be Will Smith.

Bill Cosby famously
refused to use profanity,

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.927
but he'll be cursing up a storm
in prison

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.995
when he's forced to take
his cellmate's pudding pop

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:06.466
and put it in...

used to do a bit

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.171
about the seven dirty words
you can't say on television.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.906

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.183
I wouldn't mind adding "squirt"
to the list.

That word is gross.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.154
Squirt.

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:30.724
Thaddeus has a clean soul
attached to a filthy mouth.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:33.293
But you got to preach blue
to put asses in the pew.

I call myself

even if it's these characters
in Hollywood,

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:11.031

Is it the "Cursing Pastor,"
or the "Cussing Pastor"?

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.378
It's the Cussing Pastor.
There's a difference.
Okay.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.546
In cussing, I use words

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.416
that you may think are not
the proper words, or --

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:31.551

That was like three examples

But Jesus was a cusser.

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.264
You think Jesus cussed

when they were hammering
the nails into his hands?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.036
If somebody was putting nails
in your hands,

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.670
you'd say a little shit too,

was Cesare Borgia?

Okay, but I thought the Bible
was against gambling.

the church has done,

you're alienating
young folk,

little radio,

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:01.688
and then it just reads you
some out-of-context scripture

00:07:01.688 --> 00:07:03.023
with no real message.

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.458
The only thing I "wonder" is how
they haven't gone bankrupt.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.295
But I say we take
that 1978 technology

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:10.664
and create a product
that even nonbelievers

00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:12.232
would find cool as shit.

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:13.767
I could create
one of those.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.669
Announcer:
Throw away your Wonder Bible.

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.637
It's The Boom Bible
by Thaddeus.

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.606
The Good Book
just got better.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.575
Paper Bibles are so flimsy
and old-fashioned.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.810
No thanks!

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.146
With The Boom Bible,
the sacred scriptures

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:28.248
are available
at the touch of a button.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:34.387
The King Kendrick version
of the scriptures, that is.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.157
Written and read by
the Cussing Pastor himself,

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:38.658
Thaddeus Matthews.

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:41.695
A raw, street-smart remix
of the holy word.

00:07:45.432 --> 00:07:48.868
Take God's ghetto blaster
with you everywhere you go.

00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:00.146
You've got to reach the kids
to teach the kids.

00:08:07.554 --> 00:08:10.190
Take it on faith,
there's nothing cooler.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.628
When you don't know
what to say,

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:18.198
let God and Thaddeus
speak for you.

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:24.437
The Boom Bible by Thaddeus.

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:27.874
Keep your favorite filthy pastor
right at your fingertips.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.175
And I swear to God,

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:32.178
act now and we'll include
close to a pound and a half

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.380
of skirt steak,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.082
and this coffee mug
that says "Boss Bitch."

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:38.151
Call today.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.387
So much more talk
about dildos

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:42.055
than I was expecting
from a pastor.
