00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.250
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UK, ENGLAND, AND
GREAT BRITAIN

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.770
The actual name of the sovereign state we
are talking about is The United Kingdom of

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.630
Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK).

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.859
The United Kingdom is made up of the countries
England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.789
The confusion of the terms seems to revolve
around the term “country” and the political

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.570
powers that are perceived based on that word.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.930
While the four countries that make up the
UK are considered separate in the minds of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.570
locals, and in certain sporting events, their
powers for local law and control are devolved

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.129
from the UK.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.019
Think of the 50 states of the United States,
while each state has their own set of laws,

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.140
they all are still under the power of the
federal government.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.140
In the case of the UK, it is somewhat similar,
though certain responsibilities are also implied,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.909
like healthcare and education, that are delegated
to three of the four countries.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.850
The responsibilities that are delegated differ
from one country to the next.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.240
England is the only country in which the UK
does not devolve any powers and instead it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.409
is legislated directly by the UK government.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.869
When it comes to international politics, it
is the sovereign nation of the UK that is

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.120
recognized and not any of the four constituent
countries.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.789
The term “Great Britain” refers to the
land mass that comprises England, Scotland,

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:32.960
and Wales.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.539
Something that aids in the confusion as to
the difference between Great Britain and the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.850
UK is that the term is sometimes internationally
used as a synonym for the UK.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.219
For instance, the UK’s Olympic team competes
under the name “Great Britain” and the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.799
ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
gives the UK the country codes of GB and GBR.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.979
This can be confusing given that the ISO also
codes England, Scotland, and Wales as subdivision

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.049
countries of the UK but Northern Ireland as
a subdivision province.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.120
If you’re getting the impression that Northern
Ireland is the red-headed stepchild of the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.560
UK, you may be right! (both figuratively and
literally, if you believe the current statistics

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.650
for redheaded populations that is)

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.870
The confusion over the definition of these
four countries, in reference to the UK, is

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.540
further muddied up in sporting competitions.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.540
There are several international sporting events,
like the commonwealth games, and football

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.560
competitions, in which each of the four has
their own team, and do not compete under a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.220
unified national team.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.720
When competing under these conditions, their
nations are referred to as “home nations”.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.890
Because each team is from a specific home
country, it can lead some to think these countries

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.040
have political autonomy as well.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.570
Given the inebriated thought processes attained
during the enjoyment of these competitions,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.730
it’s not too hard to understand where this
drunken confusion comes from.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.910
If you’re curious when these unions between
the countries that comprise the UK came about,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.320
it happened as follows: England and Wales
were joined in 1536.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.390
Scotland and England were joined together
in 1707, along with the previously joined

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.250
Wales, to officially form the Kingdom of Great
Britain.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.350
Ireland decided to join up in 1801, at which
point the United Kingdom of Great Britain

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.040
and Ireland was formed.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.990
In 1922, however, many of the Southern counties
of Ireland decided to remove themselves from

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.630
the union and the UK changed their name to
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.630
Ireland.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.290
So in summary:

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.130
Great Britain = England, Scotland, and Wales
UK = England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.510
Ireland (and the full name is the “United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland”)

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.250
England = Just the part of the island that
is England
