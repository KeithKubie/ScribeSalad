00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.010
RUTH OCHS: Sinfonia is a
full-size orchestra here

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.100
at the University.


00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.070
We are usually about
60 members strong.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.510
We invite undergraduates
and also are

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.140
inclusive of graduate students.


00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.330
Allie Lichterman, she's a
violinist, and she came to me

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.800
and mentioned this after
school tutoring program

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.230
that she volunteers for, and
how many of these middle school

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.890
students come with
instruments after school.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.650
And she had the very clever
idea of finding a way

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.340
to collaborate with them
to bring some Sinfonia

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.330
students over to CHASA--
Community House After School

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.250
Academy-- to play with
these middle schoolers,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.810
and thought that we
should give this a try.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.400
ALLIE LICHTERMAN:
One day I was just

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.560
here working with some kids.


00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.230
And Aba, actually,
pulled out her flute

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.740
and started playing
Katy Perry on the flute.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.710
And I was like, oh, I didn't
know you guys play instruments.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.600
And it turns out a
bunch of them did.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.120
We worked it out
that every Tuesday

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.930
for about an hour a group of
us come and we play and talk

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.540
about music.


00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.570
Sometimes we talk
about why we started

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.250
playing, what like about it.


00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.600
We ended up being able to
play at Communiversity,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.580
which was awesome.


00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.430
And that was a great
goal to work towards.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.980
And now that we're past that,
we're still hanging out,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.120
playing music.


00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.760
RAINA WILLIAMSON: I like being
able to play different things,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.140
like things that
are challenging,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.690
and learning new things
about my instrument.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.940
ABA SMITH: So, playing with a
bunch of college students.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.650
It makes me really happy.


00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.980
Because one, I get to see
what they're doing in college,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.670
so I get an idea of what it's
like for me when I grow up

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.240
when I go to college,
to actually get

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.660
the feeling of what it's going
to be like for me in college

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.500
when I do play on flute.


00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.280
And it gives me a choice if
I want to stay with flute

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.690
or if I want to quit.


00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.830
And right now, my choice is
I want to stay with flute.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.680
ANDREW SHU: I hope that
by playing with them

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.830
they'll also be able to have
a fun time enjoying music

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.320
and keep it with them when
they grow up, like I have.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.070
And it's been a major
part of my life.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.490
ABA SMITH: I
actually like it when

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.470
we play our
instruments together.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
When we all play the same
note, I can actually feel it.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.770
And it's sort of like we're
our own little family together,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.920
playing instruments.
