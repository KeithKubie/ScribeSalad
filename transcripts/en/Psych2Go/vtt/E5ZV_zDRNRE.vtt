Hello everybody. My name is Alaaniel for Psych2Go
and let's get the obvious out of the way first.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.180
I am acutely aware that I need a haircut.
But we're not talking about my hair in this

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.210
video, we're talking about something equally
as cute: Babies. So, Charles Darwin studied

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.660
a lot of different things about humans and
just nature in general and one of the most

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.370
of the most important things he studied for
this video at least is behavior and today

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.620
we're going to talk about behavior to children-babies.
If you have ever seen something in anime or

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.160
manga that just made you go 'Oooh, so kawaii'
then it probably has these features as well.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.590
Some of these Kindchenschema features are
big heads, prodominent brain capsules, big

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.230
round low setting eyes and big cute cheeks.
So, in 2009, a woman named Melonie L Glocker,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.550
held a research study where she would hook
people up to FMRI machine and she would study

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.930
their brains as she showed them pictures of
babies. Now, babies that have more of these

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.390
Kindchenschema features would activate more
areas in the Nucleus Accumbens which governs

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.869
reward and motivation and the our frontal
cortex which does decision making basically.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.909
The more prominent these features were, the
more activity was found in these areas and

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.380
it was a biological and a neutral response
which means that people weren't consciously

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.270
making these changes in their brains. It happens
quicker than they had the chance to, it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.159
just a biological, physiological response
that we have to babies that have these features.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.970
Now, all babies to some extend have these
features but ones that have it more prominent

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.759
produced more of this activity in their brains.
Now [Unknown Name] in 2008 had the same idea,

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.229
did a similar study and got the same results.
Now, Darwin knew where he was going

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.950
with this because species with the same, similar
response to children and babies have a higher

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.870
success rate of living beyond childhood. For
example if you think of turtles, they will

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.099
lay hundreds and hundreds of eggs and they
don't have this nurturing instinct inside

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.599
of them so they just leave and then the babies
hatch and about 1 in 1000 of these baby turtles

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:32.169
live. That means about 999 of them die before
they actually become adults. Now, if you think

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:36.639
of whales on the other hand, they have their
children one at a time and they nurture them

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:42.480
all and their babies have a much higher success
rate of surviving to adulthood. Similarly,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.730
with humans because us humans and whales are
both mammals and we both have this nurturing

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.059
instinct to children and we have a much higher
success rate than turtles. Fortunately, but

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:59.109
unfortunately for the turtles. Those are good
things that humans do have this response specifically

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:05.779
because about 13% of women after birth will
suffer from postpartum depression within 6

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:11.099
weeks after giving birth. That being said,
if you feel like you might have postpartum

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.540
depression or you're afraid that you might
after giving birth then you should definitely

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.480
seek professional help and go see someone
to help get over this for your baby's sake

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.969
and for your sake because you're dealing with
two people here. Not to mention the impact

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.230
that it has on the rest of your family as
well. Make sure that you subscribe below,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.999
there's a little red button that says subscribe
that you should really hit as well as the

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:38.359
thumbs up button that would definitely help
to show your support to this channel and that

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.290
you want to see more videos like this. You
can also follow a site to go to on all of

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.079
the social media like Tumblr and Twitter if
you want to keep up with these interesting

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.309
facts that they have. So, I hope you enjoyed
this video as much as I enjoyed making it.

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:56.059
This was a lot of fun to record and to read
about. So, if you want to learn more, you

00:03:56.059 --> 00:04:01.049
can go to the link below. I will give you
a link to the actual Psych2Go's article where

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.549
you can read all about this and more because
they have plenty of subjects for you to read

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.669
about. It's an awesome website. Once again
my name's Alaaniel Davis and I hope you have

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.800
an awesome week. Bye!
