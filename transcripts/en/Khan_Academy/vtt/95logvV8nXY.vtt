00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:02.420
Now this looks like an
interesting problem.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.280
We have this polygon.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.765
It looks like a pentagon right
over here, has five sides.

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:07.890
It's an irregular pentagon.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.520
Not all the sides look
to be the same length.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.950
And the sides are
kind of continued on.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.850
And we have these
particular exterior angles

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.540
of this pentagon.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.550
And what we're asked
is, what is the sum

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.422
of all of these exterior angles.

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:23.630
And it's kind of daunting,
because they don't give us

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.546
any other information.

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:26.580
They don't even give us
any particular angles.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.535
They don't start
us off anywhere.

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:30.160
And so what we can
do, let's just think

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.260
about the step by step, just
based on what we do know.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.850
Well, we have these
exterior angles.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.470
And these exterior
angles, they're

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.340
each supplementary to
some interior angle.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.400
So maybe if we can
express them as a function

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.440
of the interior angles, we
can maybe write this problem

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.930
in a way that seems a
little bit more doable.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.380
So let's write the
interior angles over here.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.360
We already got to e.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.710
So let's call this f,
this interior angle f.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.250
Let's call this
interior angle g.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.530
Let's call this
interior angle h.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.120
Let's call this one i.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.190
And let's call this one j.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.170
And so this sum of these
particular exterior angles, a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.050
is now the same
thing as 180 minus g,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.850
because a and g
are supplementary.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.660
So a is 180 minus g.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.640
And then we have plus b.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.190
But b we can write in terms
of this interior angle.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.650
It's going to be 180 minus h,
because these two angles once

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.197
again, are supplementary.

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:34.280
We do that in a new color.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.590
So this is going
to be 180 minus h.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.140
And we could do the same
thing for each of them. c,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.360
we can write as 180 minus
i, so plus 180 minus i.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:55.100
And then d, we can write as 180
minus j, so plus 180 minus j.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.080
And then finally, e, I'm
running out of colors,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.890
e, we can write as 180 minus
f, so plus 180 minus f.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.770
And so, what we're left with,
if we add up all the 180s,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.550
we have 180 5 times.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.910
So this is going to be equal to
5 times 180 which is what, 900.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.520
And then you have minus g, minus
h, minus i, minus j, minus f.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.100
Or we could write
that as minus-- I'll

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.040
try to do the same
colors-- g plus h--

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.770
I'm kind of factoring out
this negative sign-- g

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.360
plus h-- I'll do
the same color as g,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:48.570
that's not the same color-- g
plus h, plus i, plus j, plus f.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.690
And the whole
reason why did this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.710
and why this is
interesting now, is

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.270
that we've expressed
this first thing

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.395
that we need to figure out.

00:02:57.395 --> 00:03:01.380
We've expressed it in terms
of sum of the interior angles.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.230
So it's going to be 900
minus all of this business.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.190
So this is 900 minus all
of this business, which

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.630
is the sum of the
interior angles.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.070
So this is the sum of
the interior angles.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.735
So it seems like we've made a
little progress, at least if we

00:03:17.735 --> 00:03:19.990
can figure out the sum
of the interior angles.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.350
And to do that part, I'll
show you a little trick.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.280
What you want to do is
divide this polygon,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.100
the inside of the
polygon, into three

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.260
non-overlapping triangles.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.880
And so we could do
that from any side.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.180
Let's say that
they're all coming out

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.000
of that side right over there.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.540
So there.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.830
I have divide it-- let me
do this in a neutral color,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.260
I'm doing it in
white-- so that's

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.890
one triangle right over here.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.554
And then let me make another
triangle just like that.

00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:48.220
So there you go.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.906
I've divided into three
non-overlapping triangles.

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:52.780
And the reason why I
did that, the reason why

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.154
this is valuable,
is we know what

00:03:54.154 --> 00:03:57.320
the sum of the angles
of a triangle add up to.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.130
And so to make that
useful, we have

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.514
to express these angles
in terms of angles

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:06.180
that we can figure
out based on the fact

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.810
that the sums of the
angles, or the measures

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.390
of the angles in a
triangle add up to 180.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.140
So g is kind of already one
of the angles in the triangle.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.310
F is made up of two
angles in the triangle.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.329
So remember, f is this
entire angle right over here.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.860
So let's divide f
into two other angles,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.070
or two other measures
of angles, I should say.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.660
So let's say that f is equal
to-- we've already gone as high

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.310
as, let's see, a,
b, c, d, e, f, g, h,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.530
i, j-- we haven't used k yet.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.990
So let's say that f
is equal to k plus l.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.450
It's equal to the sum of
the measures of these two

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.850
adjacent angles right over here.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.920
So f is equal to k plus l.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.350
So that way we've
split it up into angles

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.200
of these other triangles.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.520
And then we can do
that with j as well,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.550
because j, once again,
is that whole thing.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.280
So we could that j is equal to--
let's see, we already used l.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.785
So let's say j is
equal to m plus n.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.012
And then finally,
we can split up h.

00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:16.950
h is up here.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.390
Remember, it's this whole thing.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.740
Let's say that h is the same
thing as o plus p plus q.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.120
This is o, this is p, this is q.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.750
And once again, I wanted to
split up these interior angles

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.830
if they're not already
an angle of a triangle.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.910
I want to split
them up into angles

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.790
that are parts of
these triangles.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.349
So we have h is equal
to o, plus p, plus q.

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:40.890
And the reason why
that's interesting

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.690
is now we can write the sum
of these interior angles

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.690
as the sum of a
bunch of angles that

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.080
are part of these triangles.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.730
And then we can use the fact
that, for any one triangle,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.090
they add up to 180 degrees.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.840
So let's do that.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.800
So this expression
right over her

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.190
is going to be g. g is
that angle right over here.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.180
We didn't make
any substitutions.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.092
So it's going to
be g-- actually,

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:04.300
let me write the whole thing.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.235
So we have 900 minus,
and instead of a g, well,

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:10.860
actually I'm not
making a substitution,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.880
so I can write g plus,
and instead of an h

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.920
I can write that h
is o plus p plus q.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.050
And then plus i.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.690
i is sitting right over there.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.980
Plus i.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.430
And then plus j.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.160
And I kind of messed
up the colors.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.340
The magenta will go with i.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.960
And then j is this
expression right over here.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.000
So j is equal to
m plus n instead

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.560
of writing a j right there.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.880
And then finally, we have our f.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.550
And f, we've already seen,
is equal to k plus l.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.170
So plus k plus l.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.770
So once again, I just rewrote
this part right over here,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.080
in terms of these
component angles.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.000
And now something very
interesting is going to happen,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.100
because we know what these
sums are going to be.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.660
Because we know that g plus
k plus o is 180 degrees.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.270
They are the
measures of the angle

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.770
for this first
triangle over here,

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.630
for this triangle
right over here.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.320
So g plus o plus
k is 180 degrees.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.040
So g-- let me do
this in a new color.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.130
So for this triangle
right over here,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.200
we know that g plus
o plus k are going

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.840
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.180
So if we cross those out,
we can write 180 instead.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.170
And then we also know-- let me
see, I'm definitely running out

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.140
of colors-- we know that
p, for this middle triangle

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.615
right over here, we know that
p plus l plus m is 180 degrees.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.920
So you take those
out and you know

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.400
that sum is going to be
equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.270
And then finally, this
is the home stretch here.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.010
We know that q plus n
plus i is 180 degrees

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.960
in this last triangle.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.230
Those three are also
going to be 180 degrees.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.920
And so now we know that the
sum of the interior angles

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.200
for this irregular
pentagon-- it's actually

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.580
going to be true for any
pentagon-- is 180 plus 180

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.630
plus 180, which is 540 degrees.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.004
So that whole thing
is 540 degrees.

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:24.170
And if we want to get the
sum of those extra angles,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.220
we just subtract it from 900.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.540
So 900 minus 540 is
going to be 360 degrees.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.730
And we are done.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.330
This is equal to 360 degrees.
