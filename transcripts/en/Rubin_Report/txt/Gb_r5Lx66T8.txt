Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04          joining me today as an entrepreneur. There are co founder of clarity capitol and the author of God in the crowd, 21st century Judaism talking and welcome to the Rubin report. Thank you, Dave. So there's a lot that I want to talk to you about here because I mentioned to you right before we started that most of the conversations that I've had here about religion have come from a Christian perspective. Uh, so adding a Jewish element to this I thought would be interesting. Uh, your, your story is kind of fascinating. You're a Jew from Florida and yet your religious awakening was because of a Christian minister in New England. Am I getting that correct? Yeah, that's right. Let's start there.

Speaker 1:          00:43          So I, I grew up in boarding schools, mainly New Hampshire, so born in Florida and grew up there until age 10. But then, uh, then New Hampshire and um, you know, I got into Judaism for today describes as the wrong the wrong reasons. Uh, I don't know if you've seen the picture of the boy in the Warsaw ghetto with his hands, kind of iconic picture that I saw that when I was 16 years old and it immediately became where there was looking at the picture wrong. You know, it's, it's, it's framed in a way that almost begs this juxtaposition between the, the boys innocence and it was six or seven years old, angelic face and the Nazi barbarism. You can see on the right side of the picture you've got the Nazis and with their guns pointed in his, in his direction. And that never spoke to me.

Speaker 1:          01:24          And I tried to muster anger and hatred for these Nazis. I couldn't, all I saw was irrelevance. You know, this, you know, I didn't have a good sense of Jewish history, but enough of a sense to realize this is, that was just, that generation is manifestation of an age old phenomenon. The cheese just keeps coming back. It was in Iraq during the far, who'd you know, two years earlier. It was with Russian Cossacks, you know, 30 years earlier this, this keeps happening. Um, but if you look at the left side of the picture and you can Google it, boy in the Warsaw ghetto, I think it's the first thing that comes up. You see the boy's family and they're being, I think that evacuated from the building. This is the liquidation of the ghetto in 1943 and they're in this state of shocked submission. Uh, you've see it in their body language and their expressions.

Speaker 1:          02:07          And I was furious at them for having aggregated their responsibility to this boy. How could they not have had a contingency plan there? The Jews had, they convinced themselves that they were Polish and here they were about to be marched off to their deaths. As far as I know, everyone in that picture was, was dead within, within weeks. Um, but it only took me a week to realize I'm probably as close as h in age to the parents as I entered the child. What's my contingency plan? And for the first time I started thinking of myself as a Jew and I come from a typical American home. All three of my older brothers, married, non Jewish women were, we were pretty much shake out the way American Judaism does. And we had no training. I had no familiarity with Judaism at the time. So you didn't grow up religious in any particular right now

Speaker 2:          02:55          I guess not if you going to boarding school in the northeast. Right, right. Yeah. So,

Speaker 1:          03:00          so what happened then? You have this wake up. So I, so Reverend Thompson was the school chaplain. It was a, if Exeter, it's a prep school in New Hampshire. Uh, he was a congregationalist minister. It's a branch of Calvinism. That was the kind of original religion in the Massachusetts Bay colony. Very open, very old testament focused. Um, and he knew a lot about Judaism and he arranged a, a weekly Shabbat dinner, uh, for the, for the Jewish kids, which I started going to after that. It never really meant anything to me up until that, that, that, that, that moment, um, and got me into, I don't know if it's exactly a religion, but a, a, a sort of a spirituality that's tied to this ritual of Shabbat as sort of a mode shift. Um, and you know, from that point I kind of dug into everything I could, took every class that had to do with Judaism.

Speaker 1:          03:52          I read them the Old Testament. I can, um, never became a believer in the kind of classical sense in, in the god of scripture. I'm still still haven't, haven't, uh, been able to, to access that, but found my way to Israel, uh, through that. Yeah. And you ended up in the Israeli air force. Yeah. Yeah. That's quite a jump from strangers to face. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. What was that like? Um, we're just doing the biographical stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, you know, it, it certainly, it wasn't the plan. I mean, I, I, I became enamored with Zionism on a summer tour, kind of a, on a, something like a birthright type program. The summer after I saw that picture and I fell in love. I think that's the best way to describe it. You know, suspended pretty much all logic. And I think the notion that got me is this was the opposite of what I saw in that picture.

Speaker 1:          04:51          And it took me until the end to realize that, that the, that the thing that struck me the most was the lack of dignity in that picture. We had no agency, we were just victims. And it was just such a terrible way to kind of define ourselves and think of ourselves as a people. And you know, when I asked Jewish friends at Exeter or even my, my, my family, you know, is there a contingency plan? What do we do? And my grandfather was German. I think he conceived of himself when he was, you know, my age at the time, uh, as German way before he was Jewish, until he was notified. You're no longer German. Uh, and luckily that happened in 1936 and 1990, 39 so he could still leave. Um, what happens if we get that call? What's our, what's our plan? And people thought that was a crazy question.

Speaker 1:          05:34          That's just not, it's just not a pleasant thing to have to think about who talks about that. And in Israel, I saw people who had not just asked that question with all the courage that it takes to, you know, you need to muster in order to ask. But they, they'd answered it and he was dignity and it was, it was intoxicating to me. And so I, I, at that point I think realized I was going to make my way somehow to Israel whether I was going to live there or just be very involved. Um, and when I finally did move, you know, I understood that military service was kind of the ticket to full membership. Um, and so I, I did what I was told. I ended up

Speaker 2:          06:10          and, but ending up in the air force is not an easy route for that ticket. Yeah. Turns probably the most complex route, I would imagine. Yeah, it was, at the time it was, it was very calm, very complicated, and it certainly wasn't an nap.

Speaker 1:          06:20          She'll fit. Uh, for me, I'm required a lot of, a lot of adjustments along the way. Um, but, uh, but that, that, that is where I ended up. Yeah. And kind of what I think brought me to the book ultimately is that, you know, I found myself, um, it's such a focused and intense experience, you know, the academies is just extremely, uh, um, it's just a concentrated source of knowledge and skills dump. Uh, and, and it doesn't let up after you, you graduate that I really never had time to examine what is this, what, what, what exactly am I pursuing? What is Judaism? What is Israel? I didn't know Israel. I knew a very narrow cut, the kind of the several hundred people in the aircrew community and he was, so that's why I knew it was Israel for me. And it's not reflective of, of, of society.

Speaker 1:          07:08          And you know, it took me probably, you know, eight or nine years of service to kind of step back and say, okay, now can I at the time to investigate what this is. Um, and that was actually a moment of crisis because I had already done things that I couldn't take back. I mean, you know, there's a very combat intensive decade, uh, the 1990s in Israel. Um, you know what, what it started sort of as a romantic sort of teach for America or Peace Corps type type adventure for a college kid ended up being something that I couldn't, couldn't erase. There's things I could not take back and I had to really understand what it is that, that I was, I was doing there and I started kind of a search. And what is Judaism exactly? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:50          All right. So that's a perfect set up on a, on a personal note for everything that the book is about and that we're going to talk about here. So first I was trying to think of the right way to do this interview because it's a little weird talking about Judaism in a religious sense because it's an ethnicity and a culture and a religion. And usually when people are talking about religion, you can remove those two other things because people are from all parts of the world. And have different, uh, you know, traditions and all of that, but Jews have the same traditions and those are at least at some level related to religion and all that. So what's the easiest way to start that conversation about culture and tradition and religion? All, all in one mixed bag?

Speaker 1:          08:28          Well that is very much at the heart of this book is that we were called upon the generations of Jews who are alive today are called upon to redefine Judaism. And the, and what kind of the premise I start with is in our story, it's almost a 4,000 year story. We have two episodes of fundamental reinvention Judaism's constantly evolving. We've always changed. There's no generation that it'd be quite the same. Judy's with their kids that they inherited from their parents, but there were two fundamental reinventions. One is the exodus where we leave Egypt unclear what we are exactly where some group, but it's unclear exactly what, what it is. Um, and 40 years later arrive in the promise land with sovereignty, right? We control ourselves and we're governed by a book of law which will stay with us for, for as long as I've story laughs and it's still with us today.

Speaker 1:          09:17          It's a fundamental reconfiguration of, of, of what this is, what this enterprise is Judaism. And the second is the Roman expulsion, uh, from, from Israel. And in the year one 35, which is a bright, the end of sovereignty in Israel at the end of a geographic cause you didn't all show up there in 1948. We did that later. Okay, let's just dispel that right now. Yes, we for exactly. Okay. So here we are a people configured very much like any other people around us, the Phoenicians and Nabataeans, we looked like any province of the Roman Empire, uh, in, in, in most ways. And then off we go, we're scattered to hundreds of nodes around the world, uh, with an already complex orthodoxy that was to continue evolving dramatically over the next 2000 years. No central conductor, no pope. The officiating over our evolution. Almost no contact between most of the notes, right? If you are often some shtetl in Poland and I was in Casa Blanca, we didn't even know about each other and we certainly were not in touch with each other for most of that period.

Speaker 1:          10:22          What I would bet against the idea that there'd be a coherent identity called Jew 1800 years after that event. It is, you know, it's something that I think bears in investigation. Um, but you think there's a reason for that. And that's what this book is about. I do. And I think that was the second fundamental reinvention. We, we're not, we, we, we, we reconfigured ourselves at that point where we became a people that was about a set of questions and debating a set of questions, ethical questions at which we still do today. I think we're on the eve of a third fundamental reinvention. And that comes from the fact, or were, or at least the, what I posit is that antisemitism is no longer defining force for the Jews for 1800 years. It was we most, for most of that period, we didn't have the choice to be, you know, we talk about religion, you know, we use the word faith and religion sort of interchangeably in the United say, Hey, there's not a central component of Judaism.

Speaker 1:          11:15          Uh, it not in the way we define ourselves and not the way we were defined. Know, no one asks you what you believe before you stepped into the gas chambers, right? That was a, you could be secular, you could be an atheist, you can be getting matter. You were a Jew. So it wasn't a religion, it wasn't a faith. Uh, that, that, that, and I think in that sense, the Nazis got us right in many ways is it's not, not really about whether we believe or not. Um, which is why they're seemingly are so many Jewish atheist, which we can get into how that works and has worked throughout Jewish history. I mean, faith is not a precondition to, uh, to Jewish observance, even orthodox Jewish observance. But what we're facing today, I think is, is certainly not precedented in the last 2000 years, is that 90% of us live in the United States and in Israel.

Speaker 1:          12:01          Two jurisdictions that I think are largely devoid of antisemitism in, in any practical day to day way. I, I have, uh, you know, uh, maybe a correction is on the left. There is something happening today that we should maybe talk about. It's a fault in the book. I'm, I'm maybe too dismissive of, of a, of that and I hope it's a passing, you know, fed. But essentially in this country, being Jewish is a choice today. It wasn't for our grandparents generation were Jewish kind of in the sense that you are in Europe today, right? If you're French, a French Jew, you're a Jew. I mean to, to, to, to other French people that, that, that, that that's how we're, we're, we're, uh, looked at, in this country, you are truly an American. And in Israel you are truly Israeli. Judaism is a choice. That's our challenge.

Speaker 1:          12:44          It's a huge opportunity because for the first time I think we can write our own script throughout the Jewish world, not just in Israel. We can decide what this is, what is this enterprise. Um, but it's also a threat because right now and if we see what's happening in this country and it's much easier to track it in this country, we're voting with our feet. We are marrying ourselves out of existence. Uh, which, you know, the, for the First Section of the book, sculpture, there'd be Jews. I think we have to start with that fundamental question and ask it honestly and bravely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:15          So, so why is your answer to that question? Yeah. Because I think a certain amount of people would say, all right, well that, so I would, I was going to ask you this at the end, but when I had my first sit down with Sam Harris, who's, who's obviously one of the most well known atheists, but he was born Jewish, I don't think he considers himself Jewish in a, in any real sense, but I don't want to speak for him specifically. We did talk about this. There's a couple of years ago and he said that there would be a nice end story to the Jews, which is that they would all give up on all of the superstition and all the rest of it and just sort of evolve out of it. And that would be a pleasant ending that that's his basic premise on that. But that's not your premise. Um, so I'd love to hear, so why is the answer

Speaker 1:          13:55          well for what I think I would agree with is if we are going to end, that's the best way to do it for sure.

Speaker 2:          14:00          Okay. Uh, the atheist is the dreamer,

Speaker 1:          14:03          but, but I would say, look, I mean, when I, when I look at what Sam Harris has, I think tried to do, um, over time, which to me, and I don't know if he'd put it this way, but to me it's very much a inventing a religion that doesn't require faith, right? Or an ethical system. Maybe religion is, is the wrong word. And that, you know, there's a lot that's wired in us from the Savannah, right? A lot of of, of, of, of altruism, altruism and morality that is wired. And let's build on that. Let's take the golden rule as a sort of a, as a, as a starting point. Um, and, and build on that. I like that. I think the issue with it is, you know, I use the wisdom of crowds as a, as, as a sort of, as a framework for Jewish governance in diaspora.

Speaker 1:          14:48          And I believe in that. I think there is something quite compelling about this notion of, of, of, of, of, of a group defining itself in governance and governing itself through, uh, through crowd wisdom. It's a great kind of noise cancellation, um, uh, mechanism. And this is what you'd say is, is sort of the lack of the top down part of Judaism because there is no pope, not everybody's or we're not all pointing one way for this or looking for wisdom in that direction. Correct. It's coming from the people. Yeah. It's, it requires diversity, requires independent thought that, that that's Jewish at it's [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          15:20          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          15:20          One of the issues and you see this in markets all the time, markets at the end of the day, financial markets are, are you know, in in many ways an exercise in, in crowd wisdom. We're trying to divine the truth. What is the value of that stock? What is the present value of future earnings of this company? That's what we're all trying to guess at, uh, at, at its essence. And one thing you'll find is if you look at it long term, if you look at chart the s and p 500 for the last hundred years, all right? Uh, you'll see that the incredible how closely, you know, if you look at the actual present value of future earnings and retrospective of, of the, of the securities in that, in that, in that index, uh, you'll find that the market is incredibly good at getting it right over long periods of time.

Speaker 1:          15:59          But zoom in on any short timeframe, right? Three years, five years, it's always wrong, almost always wrong. The market is almost always wrong in, in, in the, in the short term. So the notion of, of inventing a, a, a code of ethics from scratch leaves us hostage to the sensibilities of our generation. You know, I often has to tell it's a tough question say, but had I been born a Lutheran in Germany, uh, and come of age in the 1930s, can I say I would definitely would not have joined, uh, the, uh, that, that the Nazi movement, of course not most people, most people are verbal question to face, but I think it's an important one to think about it, right? So we're all hostage to kind of the prevailing winds of our era. What I think Judaism does and the reason I think it has valued not just to Jews but, but to humanity is it as a

Speaker 1:          16:47          methodically recorded history of the evolution of our ethics as, as, as, as a species, right? It's a, it's a critically important reference point and it's a unique reference. Right now there's a record of, of papal edicts that also goes back a long way. And I think it's also extremely valuable. It's different though, right? It's the opinion of one man, very learned man in general. But, but it's one man. Well, we have now is a snapshot of the crowd wisdom of a generation on questions that, you know, and Judy is always [inaudible] always great about kind of highlighting the, the two tensions, right? Hillel and Sean, you go into a wedding, you're introduced to the bride, uh, and the people or person introduced me as his, isn't she beautiful? And you don't think she's beautiful. What do you say? Okay, so Sean, I will say, well, the, the most important guiding ethic is truth, right?

Speaker 1:          17:38          Honesty is, is, is a, is a, is a critical, uh, value that we be pursuing. I would come down on the side of tell the truth. No, I don't think you're beautiful. That's a tough one. At the wedding, the wedding yellow was saying how humanity is a more understand that honesty I'm giving you to do for sure. I, I get your point. However, here's where I think the optimism that, that, that is the exercise of Judaism. It has been. Um, uh, I, I think forever, but we've recorded a history of the evolution of the both the consensus views and the dissenting views on a host of topic. That is Tom would, that is, that is that exercise. So when we use a term like justice today, justice is not a natural phenomenon. It's a human invention. And we could have invented in a lot of different ways.

Speaker 1:          18:24          We did invent it in a lot of different ways, are kind of prevailing concept of justice 100 years ago is quite different from what it is today. And let's have the humility to admit that a hundred years from now we will probably evolve significantly further. The fact that we have a record of the trajectory of that evolution, I'll show some justice, but on, on hundreds of ethical questions. That's a gift of Judaism. And to me personally, I've yet to meet. It's a privilege to be a link in that chain. I, I want that. I mean, that's, that, that's exciting to me. So that is why when you have three Jews at the table, you have four opinions based on 100% yes, that's right. It's annoying, but it's got,

Speaker 2:          19:00          it was loud and there's a lot of yelling involved. So, all right, so there's a lot to do there, but let's just go to the god part of that first because, because there is this interesting phenomenon with, with I think Jews describing themselves as Jewish atheist.

Speaker 1:          19:15          That's all right. Um, and, uh,

Speaker 2:          19:18          how I think the average person hearing that would go, well, how does that make any sense? How can you say you were a member of a religion if you don't believe in the basic tenant of the religion, right? You could open up any old testament or any book that they're going to have at any synagogue in anywhere, a lot about God. So how can you be a Jew and then not necessarily believe, uh, be a believer?

Speaker 1:          19:37          Well, so I think the, the notion of, of God in, even in Jewish scripture is actually quite fluid, right? The, it's not just some guy with a beard who cares about what you eat. Right? We refer to that entity and the masculine and the feminine in the singular and the plural. It's a very evolving, uh, notion. And as we get to kind of the Post Biblical era, I think some of the greatest Jewess sages of history have questionable faith in the god of scripture. My monities himself I'm not convinced is a, is a true believer in the god of scripture as, as laid out in the Old Testament. Um, what I, I do think though is there is a, there's tremendous value in having a, a reference point. And to me the notion, and I think a lot of, um, may be more, more devout people will take issue with it.

Speaker 1:          20:27          I understand that and that this is kind of part of the debate that we have to have an invented God can be just as meaningful and as valuable, certainly as a spiritual rallying point, as a revealed God. And we can actually work together if you're a true believer, so to speak. And I'm not, we can work together. I've been thinking in terms of, uh, of, uh, if you and I start a business that makes circles, that's, that's our product. Uh, anybody can come in and order a circle of any size. You just tell us the radius and we'll make your, your, your, your, your circle. We need a point to draw that sort of circle around, right? Yeah. We need a point in a radius. That's it. Now I could be of the view that we can put that point on the ceiling, on the floor in space.

Speaker 1:          21:08          It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. As long as we have the radius and a point, we can make the circle. You can be of the view that no, I'm sorry that this circle is not kosher unless the point around which is drawn is right in the middle of that wall. We can work together because, okay, so let's do it. Or I don't care where it goes. You do care where it goes. Let's put it where you want it. That's fine. As long as, and this is an exercise very much in love and in humility, as long as you're okay with the idea that I think you're crazy, but that it needs to be in the middle, that wall. And I'm okay with you think I'm a heretic, that, uh, that I, I don't, I don't care. The result is the same. We have our circle and we can work together. And in many ways I think that is, that is Judaism. And if, you know, we, we've conflated faith with religion in this country and that's a very Christian notion. It's not a Jewish notion. We, faith is not really a critical part of, of, of, of Judaism.

Speaker 2:          21:57          So does that explain why someone like Albert Einstein who certainly, you know, God doesn't play dice with the universe who, so he wasn't a believer in any sort of traditional sense, although maybe in the way that you are describing it. Um, he was extremely proud of being Jewish and who was almost the president that he was going to be the first president of Israel. Um, and obviously he lived through a Germany during the Holocaust. So, um, or at least was a child at the beginning of it. So, um, that, that type of person though seems to exist. There's a, there's a lot of that you go to hospitals in New York City where they have like a Shabbat elevator for doctors and that seems very strange and yet it's somehow kind of functions. So that's just a piece of everything that yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:37          you're talking about basically. Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, it's, it's, it sounds, sounds crazy, but operating system is a, is a, is a better term to me. It captures Judaism better than religion does. Right? It's a code, uh, through which we w w uh, through which rapid or a lens through which we, we, we, we see the world. Um, we don't have to see it the same way. It's okay.

Speaker 2:          22:59          Yeah. So, so what about the cultural and traditional part of it? Because most Jews, so I grew up in long island. Everyone was either Jewish or Greek or Italian basically, but, but cer a certain ethnic identity that most of them came from Ellis Island. You know, their grandparents are saying came from Ellis Island, eventually lived in Brooklyn or Queens, and then they made it to long island. But I grew up, obviously around a lot of Jewish people. Um, most people weren't religious per se, but there was a huge cultural identity. There's a sense of humor, mostly a sense of humor, I would say perhaps more than anything else. A certain way of talking to each other. There are certain like Seinfeld in way of looking at the world. Right. Do you think that is enough to sustain something

Speaker 1:          23:40          long enough? No, I think it's great. It's essential. It's, it's more, uh, uh, an outgrowth of, of the core than, than, than core itself. Um, but no, it's not. It's, um, you know, uh, again, we, we need to ask ourselves, do we want this people to continue, uh, uh, existing? Uh, if we do, we need a much more tangible, much more accessible, much more definable, a source of identity than humor is difficult to kind of put your finger on. I mean, I, and, and we know, we both know what we're talking about when we say Jewish humor. We know what we're talking about when we say Jewish thinking, this is a Jewish way. If they go below of looking at a problem or like w we, we get that. But it is a little bit too nuanced I think to communicate to certainly to future generations or to, to other people.

Speaker 1:          24:28          So what is it? So what's needed then in this vision of the future that, that you think would be the right way to continue this, this incredible and also tragic story. W what's the best way to, right. So the good news is I see a path to making it, not tragic, but still incredible. Um, and it is a shift in our story, right? This is even that right there is a huge part, right? It's sort of acknowledging like it's a little bit weird to look back at the history of our ancestors and go, man, there was a lot of depth here. There was a lot of horrible things that happened and I've talked about it many times. I have family members on both sides have died in the Holocaust. I have family members that live in Israel now. I've, you know, that people, that it's a history of pogroms and genocides and holocausts and all of these things that make it a little bit tough to, to look at the future or something like that.

Speaker 1:          25:19          Yeah. Look, I, I hear that. I, um, you know, I've, I've, I've, I've had conflicting feelings on using that history as a, as an anchor of identity, even though many of us do, and for many of us it's still relevant. You know, to be clear, you certainly feel Israel is changing that I suppose. So that's, that gets to what you said in Israel. You feel it right in Israel that you do feel that in a way that I don't think you do in the United States, which is you're in the Middle East. Yeah. And our neighbors have not reconciled themselves with the notion of Jewish sovereignty. And we see that. And it might be difficult to see from here, especially if you, and if it's, you're not, it's not your day to day. I understand that. It was crazy. Greedy. Jews want a country that's about six miles wide at, won't be in it.

Speaker 1:          26:00          Right. Do know, man. Right. Never write enough, right? Yeah. I mean, if, if you kind of look at a few of it doesn't, it doesn't take a ton of analysis, but what, what are the other Jewish options in the Middle East? We have 7.2 million Jews in Israel. Are they supposed to go back to bed? Baghdad. Damascus. Cairo where you're supposed to get the entire Middle East has been ethnically cleansed of 100% of its Jews. 100%. There's one guy in Egypt, isn't there? Why I read about that? I've met that one. I'm not, I met the one guy, I think he's gone but did meet the guy. Yeah. The guy that claimed he was a Jew, I don't know. Right, right, right. So you look at that and you know, with the tragedy of that, assuming that the Baghdadi Jewish community is a thousand years older than Islam itself and it's been eradicated zero, uh, there is no formula for existing as a Jew in the Middle East, outside of Israel. It doesn't work. I mean this th th th there are no exceptions to that rule, that, that that's clear enough. And when you live in Israel, it's, it, you know, it, uh, I think it's something that, that, that, that, that, that's quite clear. So we're not in a place where we can escape that anymore now or yet. I think I'm an optimist in terms of, uh, Israel's eventual acceptance among the community of nations in the Middle East. Again,

Speaker 2:          27:13          I think there's a lot of reasons to think that's happening right now, that sort of a whole other show about geopolitics, I guess, than anything else. But I think they've started to just accept, wow, these guys are here and they're actually giving us water and a whole bunch of other things

Speaker 1:          27:27          we can do together. Yeah, yeah. Agreed. Um, so, so anyhow, I, you know, I, I don't think we can divorce ourselves completely from our past, nor should we, I think that's, that, that's fine. But as an anchor for identity, particularly in the United States where, you know, the Ma, my children's generation in this country sees the Holocaust is kind of ancient history. That's not that it has no bearing on their lives. You know, they see themselves as, you know, very, very privileged. Um, you know, well educated, uh, you know, uh, Americans with a great future Americans and Israelis with, with a great future wherever they end up in either country, you know, they, um, so selling them on Jewish identity through the Holocaust or through, you know, the inquisition or through or through that part of Jewish history for now is not working. And I hope it continues not working.

Speaker 1:          28:19          Right. I mean, a lot of people have reacted to the book by saying, you know, one good wave of antisemitism and we solve your problem. So that's, you know, I hope, first of all, let's look, should we hope for that? I mean, that doesn't sound like a, and it's also pathetic notion of that, that we can't, without antisemites, there can't be Jews. I mean, that's the w w w w there's so much more to this legacy than, than hatred and persecution so much more. There's so much richness here and and, and beauty that we can develop and now steer. Now that we have the agency to actually steer ourselves, let's do it. Let's claim it. This is, this is I, to me, a very exciting moment in Jewish history with with a threat associated with it. Okay.

Speaker 2:          28:56          Yeah. It's interesting because right now in America and you, you referenced this a little bit earlier, that with what's going on with the left, if you were to ask me where antisemitism is in America right now, are there some KKK members that might be far right extremists? Yes, there are, and they've always been here. I don't think there's any more of them. I don't think they have any institutional power. I think the media makes it seem like they're everywhere and they're just not, they call everybody and Nazi. I just don't think that's real. I don't, I just simply don't think it's real. Yeah. Where I am concerned about antisemitism though is what is happening on the left that Jews are no longer victims and they love victimhood because they'd be view victimhood is virtuous and now Jews are thought of as white. So my brown brother-in-law, Reggie's parents were both refugees, kicked out of their countries, is now privileged in the, you know, it's, he's a immigrant at our end child of refugees and, and he's Brown, but he's now privileged and I see a much more what actually I think is systemic racism because they're trying to build this all into the system of how we view each other.

Speaker 2:          29:57          I see that really hardening on the left and, and I think that's why so many, you know, I talk about this all the time, why I see minority groups breaking from leftism. I see this happening with, with black people. There's a lot of evidence that it's happening. It's how I see it happening with gay people. I see it happening with Jewish people. I think it's happening with Asian people now. Um, so in a certain way I'm hopeful because Jews are going, ah, the old thing maybe isn't working the way it always has.

Speaker 1:          30:22          So I, I hope I'm not naive. I'm an optimist on that as well. In, in that I think the ideologies that have, you know, I think for very natural and good reasons have surfaced, right? We're always going to be overshooting and undershooting truth. That's, that's that, that's us more, you know, human beings, um, are in many ways self defeating, right? Intersectionality as an exclusionary ideology versus as a, as a framework for understanding social phenomena. I mean, it's collapsing in the face of Louis Farrakhan right now. How are you supposed to be gay and still be on board with this? How are you supposed to be a Jew and still be on board with this? And I think, I feel like we're probably even, I mean if you look at what to me is a shame because you know, blacks and Jews in this country have been kindred spirits for over a hundred years. You know, we found that the NAACP, this was our fight black education, that the schools in the south were Jewish on the resort. We marched and died in Mississippi.

Speaker 2:          31:18          The thing I was going to say, most of those people in those pictures marching with Martin Luther King, most of the white people were Jewish. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:23          Right. So this is a false divide, which I think ultimately corrects itself. I was just speaking to a group, uh, recently about, um, black lives matter. Um, and you know, to me this, this ultimately has to be self correcting. You take the people who really have been on your side and have tied your fate to yours and for some reason have decided that they're on the other side. Right? If you look at the 2016 social policy agenda of the black lives matter movement, um, it has one foreign policy clause. It's there to condemn the genocidal apartheid state of Israel. Yeah. It's actually for some reason the Palestinian population keeps going up. This is the worst. Genocide were terrible or bad numbers, right? Yeah. Just can't get anything. Right. But you kind of look at that. And if black lives matter, which they do to me, you know, my wife and I adopted two door Foria and refugees 10 years ago in Israel. They live in Israel now. Uh, there is a genocide going on right now in Darfur during 300,000 or 400,000 people killed because they are black. The foreign policy agenda that you chose in a movement who flies the flag of black lives is not that. It's, it's that I have to believe is ultimately going to collapse under the weight its own, uh, did just an unreasonableness that doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          32:41          Does it make sense? Interesting though? Cause I don't see that as a tension between blacks and Jews cause I really don't see that changing. I see it. I see that as a tension between short, what I would say basically are crazy leftist versus everyone else. Pretty much it. Yeah. That just happens to be a political slice. I don't think that's really a racial tension. Does that, does that make sense?

Speaker 1:          32:59          Yeah. No, I hear that. I mean I hit the plus plenty of a, a black interlocutors who see it exactly as, as we do, by the way, who also sake I kinda like we do about Judaism. Victim Hood is a terrible basis for identity. It's a self defeating and it's a self fulfilling prophecy. Ultimately, if you'd let you know, let, let's aspire to something better than that. Yeah. By the way, not ignoring the past, right? There is, there is a legacy here that we of course have to acknowledge if we're gonna, if we're going to do anything about it,

Speaker 2:          33:24          but, but does that also explain the, the endless sort of focused hatred of Israel from the modern left and I, not just in America, but in virtually every country or the UN, which is basically the biggest crock in the history of the world. Why they all, you know, for every one condemnation of another country, there's 27 against Israel or something, right? Yeah. Completely insane that Jews in Israel are no longer victims and the left loves victims. So now that you're not victims anymore, you automatically are the enemy. I would argue it's better to not be a victim and to be alive than to be liked by a bunch of people who want you to live like slaves, but, right. Um, but does that, is it really that simple to boil it down? Cause I think it's pretty close to that.

Speaker 1:          34:04          Okay. I, I, I wish that were the best explanation for it.

Speaker 4:          34:09          MMM.

Speaker 1:          34:11          I fear that antisemitism, it might be a better, a better explanation because there, there are plenty of countries. Singapore is succeeding wildly. Incredible. Singapore is an incredible story. There no UN resolutions against Singapore. That's not something that, uh, uh, so,

Speaker 2:          34:28          well, no, I mean, I mean the history of the Jews was, you guys were on the, you were the, on the victim side of this whole thing and we liked it. We liked it that way, that that's the way it was. Right. And there's some weird thing about like the chosen people think about that. It's like, ah, I see. I guess they're not that chosen or something like that. But my favorite line ever rise from fiddler on the roof, which is, you know, I know we're the chosen people. I just wish we could be chosen for something else. Right. But, but, so I don't mean that in terms of the success of a country, I think, I mean the uniqueness of the success of a country that was so associated with being slaughtered and everything else that no longer acts as a victim. That bat flips the whole thing on its head.

Speaker 1:          35:04          Yeah. Like it could be that, I mean, I just see the, the suspension of logic in a lot of the condemnations of Israel that I think you're talking about reminds me very much of the suspension of logic in classic European antisemitic tropes, right. The blood libel, things that don't really make sense. Right. That's a [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          35:25          MMM.

Speaker 1:          35:28          It rhymes with that. And the fact that we're this, the Jews in this case and Jews in that case seat seems to be not a coincidence. Yeah. Unfortunately wished. I, you know, I, I, and I try to see it differently because it feels like a cop out to say, oh, it's antisemitism. Uh, it's tough for me to find a, an explanation of it. You know, things like, uh, you can't be a Zionist and a feminist, right? You're, you're gonna pick the first liberal democracy to elect a female head of state to say you can't be that and a feminist as strange, better women's representation on corporate boards and incorporate managements than the United States. That's the country that feminists can't, can't, can't get onboard with when it's neighborhood is exactly the opposite of,

Speaker 2:          36:06          remind me again, are they throwing gays off roofs in Israel?

Speaker 1:          36:09          Right, exactly. Yeah. Right. I mean, I think a Tel Aviv for, forgot which magazine put it on, uh, number one, uh, gay city on earth. Right? It's, how is it that, you know, Spanish pride parade. We'll boycott Israeli marchers or the Chicago Dyke March. We'll throw people out for having a star of David on the, these things don't make sense. And to me, it very much rhymes with a w with something from our, from our history. I think we're at a place where we can, I don't know, maybe it's too much to say safely ignore it, but it doesn't have to factor into our lives in any huge way in Israel. You don't feel that in your day to day, you don't feel embattled or you know, uh, um, you know, uh, that, that, that, that we're not glued to the TV to watch, you know, UN votes and see what happens. We can't, okay. We know that story.

Speaker 2:          36:58          We were literally sublimating that thing anyway.

Speaker 1:          37:00          Yeah, true. Yeah, that's right. So hopefully these are signs, you know, cycles that were worked themselves out. But, you know, um, again, I, I, uh, I'm kind of a, almost allergic to the, to anything that might lead us to define ourselves on those terms. Let's not let the haters define us. We're in a place where we have the agency to do it ourselves. And that, that to me is the, that's the exciting part of this. But that's why I wrote the book.

Speaker 2:          37:23          So with all this in my own, one of the things that I'm always amazed by is when they do that happiness index, right? That world happiness index that comes out every year. Israel is usually somewhere between like 10 and 15 on that. And yet if you turn on CNN and all you ever see or bombs blowing up and terrorist attacks and buses blowing up and all that, now there obviously is some connection to the good things that you're talking about and the ability to still be happy in a pretty rough part of the world. What do you see that as if you believe in the premise that I'm offering?

Speaker 1:          37:55          Right. Well, I mean you, you've spent time in Israel. It's, it is a happy place. It's not no Israeli surprised by those, by those rankings. We w we get it when we, and I, and I think there's a certain appreciation of that. Yeah. I think a big piece of it is community and you know, a part of why the book is, I think getting the reception that it's getting right now is there's a thirst for, for that. Um, in many ways we're losing it or maybe there's a pendulum that swings between, you kind of think we can conceive of ourselves as individuals. We can conceive of ourselves as cells in an organism called community, religion, country, what would it, however you choose to define it. Um, it seems that we're kind of on an individualistic, uh, extreme of the swing of that, of, of that pendulum today.

Speaker 1:          38:43          And there is a communal itch that needs to get scratched. I think that's, that, that that's wired into us, uh, right now. And one of the things that Israel is getting right and there are many things that his is getting wrong. As I, as I described in the book, one of the things that Israel is getting right is it is a community and a sense of I have your back and you have mine. We have responsibility for each other. Uh, we're, we're not just individuals in some rat race. We are th th th th we are part of something bigger. How would you think of that do you think is a, is a Jewish Jewish ethic per se versus the fact that everyone has to go to the army, which then would obviously create a very similar ethic? Yeah, so I, I think they're both at play.

Speaker 1:          39:26          Um, it is a profoundly Jewish ethic though. I kind of, if you look at other diasporas look what this Jewish community in United States did in the seventies and eighties on behalf of Soviet Jewry, right? People they hadn't met before, people that if they hadn't had any association with for generations, uh, but still felt that these are people we need to stick our necks out for and write checks for and March four and protest for a and get them out and liquid Israeli Jewry did write a population of four and a half million people absorbed over a million immigrants in a year and a half. It's a huge nut to swallow from if a fiscal perspective from a social and, and, and did it unquestioningly of course it was the obvious thing where we were going to do, we do look out for each other. And that is a, that is a Jewish notion to look what we did for Yemeni jewelry and Ethiopian Jewry and Iraqi Jewry.

Speaker 1:          40:17          We take responsibility for each other. So that is a very Jewish ethic and it permeates Israeli society. You can feel that. And that's, uh, that's part of it. And Yeah, and I think part of it is through military service. Right? You, you, you do get exposed in a real, uh, many of us do, at least in a, in a, in a, in a frontal way to people who have genocidal intentions towards you. Luckily they don't have the means to, to, to fulfill those, um, the, the, the, those intentions, but they're pretty obvious. I mean, it's not something you, anybody who serves, we'll see that. I don't think that. So does that make you happy? I don't know, but certainly fought, forges a sense of, of community, I think. Yeah. Um, you have some stories about combat and how that relates to all of this. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:01          I mean, uh, you, you know, one of the things I try to talk about is, you know, if we're going to revive a Jewish spark, which, you know, I think two or three generations of Jews in Israel and the United States have tried to extinguish, um, uh, in many ways. What are the starting points, you know, what are their embers that we can figure? What do you mean by that? That two or three generations of Jews have tried to Accenture? You mean just sort of run from religion or also if you look at it? So I segment Israeli society and it's my segmentation. I, I just pay, people have, you know, issues with this specific segmentation. But I do see it and I think a lot of people see it as well. Um, when we look at the notion of Jewish statehood, there are three separate constituencies in Israel that are defined in my view by what their vision is for Jewish statehood.

Speaker 1:          41:49          And these are visions that were never reconciled. They should have been but, but, but they weren't. Instead, in 1947, we came up with an agreement to split them into different communities and that's how we are in Israel today. There was a community they call the secularists that really want a harbor, a safe, safe haven for the Jews that is structured as a democracy. That's pretty much it. That was hurtles, vision. That's how Bob's vision with some Jewish trappings, you know, the national holiday should be Jewish holidays, but not much more than that. We're not going to have the government prescribed religious practice to the citizenry. That's, that's the secular verse vision. There was a theocratic vision, um, which had very few adherence in 1947 when the status quo agreement with which is the agreement that's cemented those constituencies into different camps. There are very few adherence with almost no political ambitions today.

Speaker 1:          42:35          That group is big and growing massively and has maximalist political ambitions to turn Israel into a theocracy. And then there's what I call a territorial as vision, which says the whole land of Israel is a, is a, a god given gift. And there is no human prerogative in relinquishing it, right? We can't step away from it. These are three competing camps, uh, in, in, in Israeli society. Uh, whose views were going to have to reconcile. When I talk about extinguishing Judaism though, it was the secularist who ruled Israel certainly until 1977 and I would argue to great extents to, to, to this day, and the original secularists were Russians, right? The arc is the architects of Jewish statehood. We're central Europeans, right? Hungarians, Austrians, you know, her Hertzel, uh, [inaudible], uh, Israel's angle that that crowd, the actual builders were Russians. They were the eastern Europeans who were escaping pogroms when they came to Israel.

Speaker 1:          43:35          And these guys came at the dawn of Bolshevism and the czar was their enemy. And you know, the, the, the Bolshevik resolute revolution was largely Jewish from the leadership down to the, to, to the, to the, to the ground troops. Antisemitism was so embedded in Russia that it became very quickly clear as Trotsky under understood to light. We're still the Jews and we're not welcome in this enterprise. But people who have had drunk, that socialist Koolaid came to Israel and, and that was the elite of our country for the first, you know, 50 years of, of its existence and certainly pre-state right. The kibbutzniks the guys who taught me to be in Israeli, right. The, the guys who I was with at the academy, we're primarily kibbutzniks. That was, that was Israel's elite. So they were like small scale socialists at some level either. Yeah. I mean, when I, I'd spend weekends on, you know, my friends keep with same and there was a Komisar that was a title in the boots. I don't know how small scale, I mean, this was, uh, uh, that, that, that ethic has more or less died. But what's, what's interesting is

Speaker 1:          44:35          there was a baby that was thrown out with the bathwater when they came to Israel is that these people are fanatical about expunging any vestige of a European antisemitic stereotype in Israel. We were going to be muscular and feisty and we're not going to lock ourselves in a head or studying taught mode or anything like that. We're going to be out in the fields farming and fighting and defending our, our, our land was, and in many ways, I think it was an abrogation of, of, of, of many things that are Jewish by the way. You can be both, right and you can stand up for yourself and also study. You can, you can do both. Um, one of the stories I tell in the book or just kind of interesting is my first year I, you know, I did nothing Jewish growing up except for fasting on Yom Kippor for whatever reason.

Speaker 1:          45:17          It was kind of an easy thing to understand. We're Jews. We fast on Yom Kippur. That's our thing. I did nothing else. I was a, but I did that and it was kind of, I don't know, a challenge. I don't know what it was, but that the, uh, the first time I didn't fasten your group, who was my first Yankee Kippor at the academy. It was a feast. It was a feast. I knew board the kibbutzniks, you know, made a write in the book. Uh, you know, uh, grilled cheese sandwiches was the thing which was really ham and cheese. So I didn't want to shock anybody but of what it was. Wow. So they, so you illustrate that point, meaning that they were really going out of their way to erase any connection to religion even though they had come to a country to be safe because they were persecuted for their religion.

Speaker 1:          45:57          I mean, there's like real psychological stuff, but here's the interesting irony is he was a very unknownst attempt to erase that history. You don't keep pro was still an anchor point. It was a day of rebellion against our ancestors. So we were still orbiting the same death star, so to speak. We just in the opposite order. But we hadn't gone off into space, which is actually really good news if you want to rekindle a Judaism. And, and I think a lot of the ethic of the Israel Defense Forces is Jewish despite itself. Um, and you know, so, so one, one of the, you know, toward the, when I started flying in reserves was a very kind of ethically fraught period in for the air force in Israel. And, and these are dilemmas that now, you know, our colleagues in the US air force and navy face, and then the British air force we're all facing these day, which is how do you fight a war in civilian areas when your enemy can dictate exactly where that war is going to be fun.

Speaker 1:          46:56          If you're launching rockets out of schools and hospitals at civilian targets, how are you supposed to contend with, with that challenge? And it's tough and there are no perfect answer to that. Um, but, uh, you know, one of the stories we talk about is his, uh, there was a, uh, uh, a Hamas planner named [inaudible] who had been responsible for really hundreds of, of civilian deaths in Israel. There was a kind of a way of, of bus bombings, primarily bus bombings, but also restaurants, cafes, cause there's like late nineties, this is early 2006 when we come the second, second, second Intifada. Exactly. Uh, and we had tried to target this guy and a number of times and our rules of engagement were, were clear enough to the enemies is that are on our ride. It was a very kind of a cat and mouse game. As we kinda got more nuanced in finessing the rules of engagement. It only took a few weeks for the other side. It was whether it was his Bella and in Lebanon or Hamas in Gaza to understand, um, how close could we bomb to civilian targets? How close could we bomb to UN, uh, facilities, what types of munitions we could use in these situation? There's kind of very clear and we tipped our hand in, in, in many ways I think maybe

Speaker 2:          48:09          so when we see this on the media, during the war that Israel has bombed all of this stuff and they show you all of this destruction, you're really missing the subutex. I mean, I think a certain amount of people, I try to tweet about it, at least these show that, you know, they dropped, they dropped leaflets saying, you guys gotta get out of this house because there's people, you know, text messages, text message. I mean, no army in the history of the world would do anything like this ever. You Israelis keep doing it and there, and as you're saying, they're enemies actually take advantage of that over intentionally. They, which is now they put bombs in hospitals and they say, well, what are you going to do knowing that the world will be more than happy to condemn the Jews,

Speaker 1:          48:45          right. By the way, which to me is okay to ignore it. It's okay to ignore it. We need to defend ourselves and you know, you mean ignore the media outrage or something? Yeah, yeah. I mean it's, it's, it's there and I think we sometimes pay a little bit too much attention to it. The same critics weren't doing much when we were being exterminated right now that we're defending ourselves, we're going to not take their advice. We're going to do this the way we want to do it ethically, ethically, but not to appease a European critic or the UN or anything like that, but to do this Jewishly and there is a way to do it and it's not clean and it's not simple and these dilemmas are real and you're not going to solve them in any perfect way. Uh, so you know, the, the, you know, the kid get the kind of frustration of not being able to get this guy and watching buses blow up children killed over and over again with his fingerprints on, on, on, on, on each of these is a very tough thing to go.

Speaker 1:          49:41          When we finally got a shot at him, uh, there was an intelligence failure, uh, and we hit the house that he was in. It was on the outskirts of, of a, of Gaza City. Uh, but 14 people were there and that we'd, and none of them were civilians and Israel erupted and outrage. And this is not therapy. We don't need the UN in the Europeans to tell us when those problems, right? Yeah. Two class action lawsuits against the Israeli air force by Jewish Israeli civil rights groups. Um, 27 pilots quitting, right? It was the kind of famous, the pilot's letter, which was kind of a pub, the open letter published in the newspaper saying, we're, we're, we're stepping down from active service. Uh, and this became a morale crisis in the air force. And the way we addressed it, and this to me is it's sort of the connection, it's why these, these stories are, are, are, are in there, is done hollow too with the time was, was the commander of chief of the air force did a tour of the various bases and wings of, of, of the air force to do a debriefing.

Speaker 1:          50:41          Debriefing is a, is a, is a, a, um, almost a religious ritual in the Israeli air force. It's a very, very, uh, rigorous, painful, methodical kind of, uh, um, for every ton Bluetick exercise of going through everything that went wrong. Some of the things that went right but mainly went, went wrong. And how do we, how do we improve? And, and it, it, it's a rank blind and he put himself out there and he came to our, where the wing that, that, that, that, that conducted the operation. And so he started with us and they were about 50 people in the room and we had an almost all night session, which started with his debriefing but, but progress very quickly into a kind of an ethical debate as to how do we conduct ourselves. Um, and the way I describe it, which I think some of my colleagues who read a thing could think of was it's pretty accurate.

Speaker 1:          51:28          And it was the 2002, so sometimes fast. Um, a friend of mine from theU s navy read it and said, what you guys conducted would be mutiny in, in, in our organization. And I understand that, I understand it because it was a complete subversion of the hierarchy in pursuit of a truth and ethical truth, which is elusive. Um, but it is a very Jewish way to conduct yourself. It's not hierarchical. It is a crowds wisdom that is guiding us. And that doesn't mean you're going to get perfect answers. And our answers have not been perfect since then, but they've improved. And we're also, it provided real clarity on how we navigate this dilemma. What do we define as Optima? Right? You can't, on the one hand, please the virtue of truth and tell the bride that she's ugly. Uh, and at the same time, the virtue of humanity, you're going to have to navigate Optima and that's life, right?

Speaker 1:          52:24          And against it, it's a very Jewish exercise and it's how we conduct ourselves to say that we solved, we solved that, but this, this is the way we muddle through, um, in, in Judaism and to me that there's value in that it was not extinguished by our socialists founders. So it's interesting that you said that, um, that we should just ignore or that Israelis should just ignore the media portion of this. Cause that always seems to be a huge part of any of this in the Middle East at any time. It's like, oh, every it, there's just this endless focus or this absurdly tiny piece of land with no, virtually no natural resources. I guess they found natural gas in the last 10 years, but for most of their history had no, certainly had no oil. Um, this like obsessive focus where it's like they're just kind of live in and going on and doing their thing.

Speaker 1:          53:10          And I guess maybe we should all probably pay less attention to the media. I think that that's probably the Jews are doing a great job of controlling the media, I guess. That's right. That's right. Yeah. We've lost control of the media. That's, that's the bigger problem here too by the, to be clear, we joke, I have a Palestinian business part, right? Uh, Macona in a Palestinian business. We joke about this, the Palestinians get this as well. By the way. I, and I think my partner was, it was, today's is a, is a close friend I think also sees it as part of the Palestinian problem is that, you know, I'm a, I'm a pro Palestine guy. I, I'd love to see a Palestinian state tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          53:50          The challenge for the Palestinians is very much the same as it is. Our challenge is they need to define themselves in a framework that is something other than victimhood take away the Jews. What are the Palestinians exactly that if they continue to define themselves with us as the backdrop, then never going to be anybody. And there's so much potential to build something exciting, uh, uh, in Palestine. And in many ways when we talk about the media, I mean, maybe it's too strong a term, we should ignore it. Um, we're all complicit in that, in perpetuating that human failure in the Middle East. We're complicit in it. We're placing no demands on the Arab world to take some sort of responsibility for its future. It's so easy to say, oh, it's the Jews' fault over and over again at some point that rings hollow in Israel. So we start ignoring it in the Arab world. You know, if, if you're, if you're, it's a very intoxicating notion, right? Is If someone sells you victimhood, it's something that's kind of easy to embrace, but at the end of the day, it's toxic.

Speaker 2:          54:52          You should steer away from it. Yeah. And interestingly, I think that does ring back to the way you were defining sort of an old antisemitism that's now thrust on Israel because Egypt can bomb the hell out of the border of Gaza and blow up tunnels and do whatever they want. No one cares. Saudi Arabia can bomb the hell out of Yemen and kill thousands and thousands of people and cause of famine and nobody cares. Genocide in Darfur. Yeah. And so there's this odd asymmetry there. Uh, well there's an asymmetry. There's literally symmetry in the powers of both sides, which is being used against each other. And then there's an asymmetry of media and everything else. So it does have that, that one through line that these, these weird people kind of survived through this thing.

Speaker 1:          55:30          Look who the, who the real victims are right there. Black Sudanese there, Yemeni civilians, every Iraqi civilians or Syrian civilians. These are the real victims because they're not getting attention, right? We're not, no, no. You and them resolutions coming in lately on dark for our or anything. We're very focused on, on a problem that I don't think it is a huge problem. In fact, we're probably contributing more to its perpetuation, then it's

Speaker 2:          55:52          it's solution. Yeah. All right. So let's finish with, with some of the, the future of how this stuff can work out. I have a sense of how you think it can work out on the Israeli side. They just have to sort of keep going basically, I think, and, and, and sort of reconcile, I think what you think those three different pillars of society are that which is not easy and yeah. Yeah. Would you say that's a bigger problem for them than the external pressures?

Speaker 1:          56:14          Much, much bigger. Yeah. In fact, it's the only thing I'm really frightened of in Israel. I don't think the Palestinian issue sinks us. I don't think the Iranians sink us. I don't think the Greater Middle East thing says we sink ourselves. Um, yeah. I think the good news is it's the same medicine in Israel, in the United States, it's, it's gotta be about Judaism. We didn't come to start a Jewish state just to have another democracy in the world. This is the Jewish state. It's the nation state of the Jews. What does that mean for Dave Rubin, who's not a citizen of that state? But as a Jew, we are the his self proclaimed nation state. What does that mean? What's our responsibility to him? These are questions that we haven't really answered and they're not just Israeli questions. They're, they're, they're Jewish questions. So ultimately I think we're all engaged.

Speaker 1:          57:03          Israeli American and rest of world Jewry in the same exercise, which is good news because we don't have, you know, a dozen different prescriptions. It's one, it's one. The exercise is we need to define Judaism for the 21st century. What does that mean exactly? Who's in, who's out? How'd you get in? Had you leave? Um, and what I, I don't actually put down a definition for Judaism. I put down a mechanism because the definition should evolve. It should be static. Whatever I say today is probably wrong to start with, but certainly we'll be wrong, you know, 10 years from now, what's important is that we have a mechanism for continuing to refine and hone our, the definition of what Jewish is. And the last section of the book is exactly that. I'll leave it as a story

Speaker 2:          57:46          surprise cause because you wrote a book. I got it. Got It. Well, it's been a pleasure chatting with you, I think. I think this is a really fascinating thing because it permeates so many of the issues that I talk about just related because this is related to free speech. It's related to oppression and perceived depression and freedom and liberty and all of these things in history and the rest of it. So I've thoroughly enjoyed this, so thanks for coming today.
