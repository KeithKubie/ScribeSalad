00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.450
In the last video we talked
about the scenario where a

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.230
company, for whatever reason,
it just couldn't

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.200
pay it's debt holders.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.880
So let's say these are debt
holders right here.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.690
This is the debt, or
the liabilities.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.250
It couldn't pay it's
debt holders.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.510
It went into bankruptcy, and it
was determined that these

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.040
assets that it had right here,
that it made no sense

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.440
operating them as a company.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.880
And then the bankruptcy court
essentially just decided to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.850
liquidate it.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.840
And we learned that the debt
holders were actually more

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.130
senior to the equity holders.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.670
And they get paid first. And if
there wasn't enough money

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.840
to pay all of the debt holders,
then the equity

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.380
holders got nothing.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.750
And that was called
a Chapter 7.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.700
We're just focusing on the
corporate world right now.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.790
Maybe we'll do personal soon.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.230
So that's Chapter
7 liquidation.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.290
That was the last video.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.120
And in that case, and I think
that's what most people

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.140
associate when you say that a
company has gone bankrupt.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.310
That it'll just disappear.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.820
That people just say,
OK, these assets

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.560
don't make any sense.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.830
They can't pay these guys.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.440
We're just going to take these
into possession by the courts

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.660
and then just liquidate
the assets.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.290
But that raises kind of an
obvious question of, well,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.220
what if these assets are
worth something?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.600
What if I sell a socks website,
and socks have gotten

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.940
even more popular.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.770
And the only problem is I just
can't pay all of the interest

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.060
that I owe on the debt.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.330
Right?

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.120
Maybe, for whatever reason, I
took out a really crazy loan

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.520
that was variable rate.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.950
Or for some reason, I have to
pay back some loans because I

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.310
messed-- and I'll talk
more about covenants

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.870
and things like that.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.470
Covenants are pretty much a
bunch of rules that the debt

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.220
holders say, look, you're good,
but if any of these x,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.190
y, or z things happen, we can
take you into bankruptcy.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.070
And we could force you
into bankruptcy.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.760
So maybe because of that,
I'm in bankruptcy.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.730
But it's determined that these
assets, right here, are

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.690
actually worth more as an
operating entity than they are

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.120
if you were to liquidate them.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.370
A good example might be, I don't
know, a car company.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.490
Right?

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.345
Let's actually take this example
as a car company,

00:01:55.345 --> 00:02:00.860
because it's very salient to
our, at least it was-- I've

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.050
heard a lot less about the auto
bailouts, but it was very

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.950
salient at the end
of last year.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.509
So let's say that these are
car factories and land and

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.560
whatever else.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.180
And if we're the debt holders,
and let's say it goes into

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.940
bankruptcy.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.370
Let's say this is
generating cash.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.690
And I'll teach you in a future
video how do you see what is

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.490
the cash being generated
by the assets.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.720
And then you have to subtract
out the cash that has to be

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.420
used to pay the debt holders,
because you're paying

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.170
interest, and then what's
left over for equity.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.000
And I'll show you how to do that
on an income statement.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.760
But let's say this is generating
a lot of cash.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.340
Right?

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.680
It's generating a good bit of
cash, but let's say, these

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.240
guys eat up interest. Right?

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.310
So some of the cash will go to
the debt holders as interest.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.800
And let's say, for whatever
reason, either interest rates

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.275
went up, or they had a bad
quarter or a bad year, and

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.330
they just didn't generate enough
cash, let's say they

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.040
couldn't pay off one of
the debt holders.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.620
And that debt holder says,
hey, you couldn't pay my

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.880
interest payment, or
you couldn't pay

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.920
the principal payment.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.220
I'm taking you into
bankruptcy.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.545
Right?

00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:04.740
I'm taking you into
bankruptcy.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.460
So it goes into bankruptcy.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.920
And in this situation,
immediately we realize it

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.700
makes no sense to shutter
this asset.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.300
If we were just to shut down
the factory and lay off the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.360
employees, we're going to get
nothing for these assets.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.520
Because the land is in a part of
the country where'd there's

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.340
no obvious buyer for the land.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.010
An empty car factory is pretty
much useless, especially when

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.380
the other people in the industry
are in no mood to buy

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.530
the factories from you.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.310
So everyone decides that it's
in their best interests to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.420
keep this thing running.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.090
So what happens is that the
debtor stays in possession of

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.170
the assets.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.730
So you can kind of view the
debtor as the equity holders

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.910
and the management
of the company.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.970
So they stay in possession
of the assets.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.500
And actually what happens is--
because these guys didn't have

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.905
enough cash to pay off their
debt holders-- what happens is

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:51.680
that they take on a
new loan, called a

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.270
debtor-in-possession loan.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.235
And this new loan is the
most senior loan.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:57.810
It's called DIP financing.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.520
It's actually a great business,
although it's become

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.770
scarce recently.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.105
It's a great business
because you're at

00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:06.340
the top of the stack.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.065
You're more senior than
even the senior guys.

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:10.940
And it's called DIP financing.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.190
Debtor-in-possession
financing.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.209
And what this provides is a
company with some kind of

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.630
cushion cash so that it can keep
operating, so it can keep

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.100
the lights on.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.000
So it's essentially a debt.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.550
It's just a very senior
type of debt.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.150
And it happens once a company
has entered bankruptcy.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.690
Right?

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.220
And this bankruptcy that
we're going to talk

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.630
about is Chapter 11.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.810
Chapter 11 restructuring.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.780
And in Chapter 11 restructuring,
you keep

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.150
operating the company.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.280
You might do some things on the

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.220
left-hand side of the equation.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.465
You might want to sell off some
of the assets and all of

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:48.680
that, but we won't
go into that.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.770
Most of what you do is you
rearrange this side of the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.675
balance sheet.

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:57.200
And this is why, you probably--
every airline has,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.470
some of them, have gone into
bankruptcy multiple times, but

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.100
they still exist. It's not
like when you go into

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.710
bankruptcy the company
just disappears.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.170
The assets will persist and all
of this gets reorganized

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.100
on this side.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.870
A lot of times when someone goes
into Chapter 11 and then

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.920
they come out of it and they
go back into it, they call

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.730
that Chapter 22, and
then Chapter 33.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.630
I think you get the idea.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.240
So anyway, what happens
in Chapter 11?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.250
So the assets-- essentially it
becomes kind of the bankruptcy

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.590
court takes over, and they
hire some investments.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.190
They'll get the
debtor-in-possession financing

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.400
so that the company has some
cash to operate, pay the

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.990
bills, and pay the employees
and whatever else.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.230
The company keeps operating as
it always would so it can pay

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.820
its suppliers and operate
as a regular business.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.960
And then all of these guys
hire a bunch of lawyers.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.930
And they start negotiating
with each other.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.650
And essentially there will be
a bank associated with the

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.160
bankruptcy court whose whole
job-- and it's all part of a

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.650
negotiation-- is
to value this.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.960
And it's often, maybe this
debtor right here,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.690
he'll hire one bank.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.820
This debtor will
hire one bank.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.080
Maybe the management will
hire another bank.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.670
And everyone's going to come
up with bankruptcy plans.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.730
But bankruptcy plans
are usually

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.160
of one or more varieties.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.370
It's essentially just saying,
well, we need to value these

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.060
assets, right?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.910
We're not selling it.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.250
So we're not just going
to get cash.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.510
We're going to hire
some bankers.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.180
And we'll do a lot of videos
on that in the future.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.640
And they're just going to say--
based on the prospects

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.080
of this company, how fast it's
growing or how fast it's not

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.440
growing, or how much cash it's
generating in a year-- they're

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.815
going to assign a value to it.

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:43.880
So let's say that this guy up
here, he hires a banker.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.500
And this banker says-- Let's
say this was originally the

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.290
same situation.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.650
This was $10 million.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.065
Let's say that the liabilities
were $6 million.

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:56.280
And that the original equity
was $4 million.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.260
Right?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.130
And let's say these bankers
evaluate the business.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.330
They make detailed models.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.760
They take it in the context of
the current macro environment.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.290
And they say, you know what?

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.520
I think this company
is actually

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.780
only worth $5 million.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.960
And given that it's worth $5
million, and we think that it

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:24.120
can sustain-- it's only worth $5
million and there's no way

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.360
that it can pay interest
on $6 million of debt.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.590
Right?

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.240
It doesn't have enough cash to
generate $6 million of debt.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.630
We think it can afford
$2 million of debt.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.085
Right?

00:07:35.085 --> 00:07:37.890
So what will happen is,
the new company--

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.010
And this is just a plan.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.900
And then once you have a plan,
then everyone has to vote on

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.470
it, and there are things called
cram downs-- and we''l

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.460
do that in more detail--
but the plan will

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.760
say, you know what?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.480
The assets are worth
$5 million.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.770
I thought I was using
the square tool.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.590
Undo.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.270
This plan might say, you
know, those assets

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.520
are worth $5 million.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.280
And the company can only handle
$2 million of debt, not

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.530
$6 million of debt.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:14.180
So now, it can only handle $2
million of debt, and then

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:20.360
there will be $3 million
left of equity.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.200
Right?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.270
And I'll call this
the new equity.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.990
Because sometimes this
can get confusing.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.490
So let's just say for a second--
and I want you to

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.080
think about it-- what is
everyone's incentive?

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.440
This guy up here, his incentive
is to value the

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.510
company as lowly as
possible, right?

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.190
Because then he gets more
of the company.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.530
I think that'll be clear
to you in a second.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.130
This guy's incentive
is to say, no, this

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.380
company is worth a lot.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.520
So all of you guys are going
to get paid back and then I

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.610
get what's left over.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.740
And you're probably asking, what
do you get paid back for

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.850
not liquidating it?

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.670
And the answer is the new
shares of the company.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:59.780
So what happens is that this
stock-- let's say this plan

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.270
gets passed.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.100
This plan right here.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.370
In this situation, these
guys up here were the

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.840
most senior, right?

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.180
Let's say there was $2 million
of senior debt up here.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.700
Let me write that in
a different color.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.620
There's $2 million of
senior debt up here.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.180
So what they'll do is they'll
actually get $2

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.210
million of the new debt.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.880
They're most senior.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.730
And then all of these other $4
million, who are more junior--

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.060
let me see if I can
color it in.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.930
I know it's hard to read-- these
other $4 million guys,

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.370
instead of getting any kind of
cash or any kind of debt

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.370
securities for having been owed
this money, they'll get

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.390
the new stock.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.890
So they'll get $3 million
of new stock.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.550
Let me see if I can
draw that in.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.930
So this $3 million of new equity
will go to these guys.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.150
And this unsecured guy down
here, he's not going to get as

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.290
much equity.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.750
He'll be impaired
a little bit.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.370
And the old equity guys, the
stock's going to go to 0.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.490
They're not going
to get anything.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.480
So the old shareholders of the
company are wiped out.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.150
They go to 0.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.280
And essentially, the debt
holders become the new

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.000
shareholders of the company.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.070
You'll often see when a company
goes into bankruptcy

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.960
but it's getting reorganized,
you'll often see some people

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:30.180
start to buy up this debt or
these bonds, right here,

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.820
because they want to be the
new equity holders.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.075
When this company emerges from
bankruptcy-- let's say that

00:10:36.075 --> 00:10:38.740
this is how it emerges from
bankruptcy-- they want to be

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.850
these guys, the new
equity holders.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.100
Because usually when you value
it, you want to undervalue it

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.540
a little bit.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.490
I know I've overdrawn this
picture a little bit too much.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.700
But the debt guys, especially
the senior debt guys, they

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.510
want to be safe.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.810
They want to say,
you know what?

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.590
We've already been hurt
by this company.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.300
They're already not
paying our debt.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.845
We want to assign as low a
possible value to the company

00:10:58.845 --> 00:11:01.870
as possible-- in this
case $5 million-- so

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.940
that we make sure.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.645
Hopefully the company ends up
being worth $10 million again,

00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:11.780
in which case these guys
right here make out

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.030
like bandits, right?

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.080
If the company was really worth
$10 million but the

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.450
bankruptcy court values it at $5
million, these guys get all

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.280
of the shares of the company.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.880
These guys get wiped out, even
though the company really was

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.810
worth something.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.030
So let's say the company emerges
from bankruptcy like

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.360
this, but it actually turns out
there were $10 million.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.800
Then let's say a year
later the company

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.170
starts doing well again.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.570
And let's say that someone could
value the company again

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.060
at $10 million.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.970
Now it only has $2
million of debt.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.050
And now you have $8 million
worth of equity.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.330
So these guys-- maybe they were
owed $2 or $3 million

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.470
before, and they got $3 million
of the new equity,

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.780
they might have made
out like bandits.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.790
Because now all of a
sudden, that equity

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.550
could be worth a lot.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.610
That's not always the case.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.670
But that's the view from the
debt holders' point of view.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.510
The equity holders, you can
imagine, they don't want to be

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.980
left with nothing.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.640
They'll hire their
own bankers.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.315
And their bankers, they'll
probably submit a plan that

00:12:03.315 --> 00:12:03.930
says, no, no, no, no.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.890
This company is worth
at least $8 million.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.910
So up here $8 million.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.470
And we think it can handle
$4 million of debt.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.550
So they'd want a scenario like
this, where they think the

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.270
company's worth $8 million.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.060
It can handle $4 million
worth of debt.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.310
And so it has $4 million
worth of equity.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.520
And of course, the first $6
million of the value-- so the

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.000
$4 million of debt, and then $2
million of the equity will

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.940
go to the debt holders, right?

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.090
Because they were owed $6
million to begin with.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.620
And then what's left over, which
is essentially-- so this

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.780
is $2 million of equity, and
then you'd have $2 million of

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.050
equity here-- this $2 million
of new equity, right?

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.700
This is the new shares of the
company will be given to the

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.470
old shareholders
of the company.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.320
So that's what the shareholders
want.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.560
I know this gets a little
confusing, but it all ends up

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.140
being valuing the assets as you
emerge from bankruptcy.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.020
You say, you know,
it's generating

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.500
cash, it's worth something.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.240
And then you pay people off
according to seniority.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.500
And first you pay them off.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.250
You say, OK, I still
owe you some money.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.960
But this company can't support
$6 million of debt.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.090
It can now support $2 million.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.680
And whatever's left, people
are paid with actually

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.150
shares-- new shares--
of the company.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.080
Not the old shares.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.820
So the old shares
will go to 0.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.560
So you can imagine a world
where GM goes bankrupt.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.520
Right now, the shares
of GM go to 0.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.330
GM old goes to 0.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.750
But the assets keep operating,
and that's why some people are

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.970
a little bit misleading in
this whole automotive

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.810
bankruptcy debate.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.440
They're kind of using scare
tactics to say, oh, if GM goes

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.790
bankrupt, then these assets are
just going to disappear.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.070
No, they'll just
keep operating.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.750
If it makes sense to operate
them, they'll keep operating.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.170
The only people who
will lose big are

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.620
the old equity holders.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.900
And then some of the unsecured,
the more junior

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.700
levels of debt, will probably
lose some money.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.290
But if the assets are
worth operating,

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.175
they'll continue to operate.

00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:00.690
And if the people, if it makes
sense to have them employed,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.410
they'll keep working.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.230
See you in the next video.
