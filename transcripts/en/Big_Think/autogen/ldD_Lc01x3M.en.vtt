not living up to our potential but and I

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730
not living up to our potential but and I
 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.310
not living up to our potential but and I
might dispute whether we are an empire

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
might dispute whether we are an empire
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.049
might dispute whether we are an empire
or not I know there's a big debate about

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
or not I know there's a big debate about
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.330
or not I know there's a big debate about
that I don't I don't think we need to go

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
that I don't I don't think we need to go
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.870
that I don't I don't think we need to go
there but we we need to be leaving in a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
there but we we need to be leaving in a
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.010
there but we we need to be leaving in a
different way we need to be leading

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
different way we need to be leading
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.660
different way we need to be leading
let's put it that way we aren't we are

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
let's put it that way we aren't we are
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.310
let's put it that way we aren't we are
not leading the world as it is we've

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
not leading the world as it is we've
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500
not leading the world as it is we've
really been the big detractor in the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
really been the big detractor in the
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.349
really been the big detractor in the
international system and if we want to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
international system and if we want to
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.530
international system and if we want to
continue to thrive we have to lead in a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
continue to thrive we have to lead in a
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.940
continue to thrive we have to lead in a
different way and we have to get our act

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
different way and we have to get our act
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.319
different way and we have to get our act
together at home and I think those are

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
together at home and I think those are
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.660
together at home and I think those are
the two real key things that we have to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
the two real key things that we have to
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.240
the two real key things that we have to
do differently but the issue of of

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
do differently but the issue of of
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.270
do differently but the issue of of
whether we are declining is semantics in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
whether we are declining is semantics in
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.190
whether we are declining is semantics in
some ways to me I mean if you if you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
some ways to me I mean if you if you
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.540
some ways to me I mean if you if you
think of power as a relative concept

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
think of power as a relative concept
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.139
think of power as a relative concept
then of course as as China and India and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
then of course as as China and India and
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209
then of course as as China and India and
Russia and even Japan and Europe gain

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
Russia and even Japan and Europe gain
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680
Russia and even Japan and Europe gain
more power we're going to have

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
more power we're going to have
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.170
more power we're going to have
relatively less than they do but I don't

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180
relatively less than they do but I don't
 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.729
relatively less than they do but I don't
think that's the key question I think

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
think that's the key question I think
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.799
think that's the key question I think
the key question is so what does that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
the key question is so what does that
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.689
the key question is so what does that
matter for the United States how will

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
matter for the United States how will
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.369
matter for the United States how will
that affect American security and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
that affect American security and
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.289
that affect American security and
prosperity and our way of life because

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
prosperity and our way of life because
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.390
prosperity and our way of life because
the fact is that the rise of these other

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
the fact is that the rise of these other
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640
the fact is that the rise of these other
powers can actually be good to the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
powers can actually be good to the
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.930
powers can actually be good to the
United States in many ways

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940
 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.790
we are for example our security they can

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800
we are for example our security they can
 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.220
we are for example our security they can
be our security partners the two threats

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230
be our security partners the two threats
 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.040
be our security partners the two threats
that are able to kill large numbers of

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050
that are able to kill large numbers of
 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.090
that are able to kill large numbers of
Americans soon are terrorists armed with

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100
Americans soon are terrorists armed with
 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.370
Americans soon are terrorists armed with
a nuclear weapon and contagious disease

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380
a nuclear weapon and contagious disease
 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.990
a nuclear weapon and contagious disease
lethal contagious disease something like

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000
lethal contagious disease something like
 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.820
lethal contagious disease something like
the avian flu those are the only two and

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830
the avian flu those are the only two and
 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.400
the avian flu those are the only two and
if you look at those two the rise of

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410
if you look at those two the rise of
 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.440
if you look at those two the rise of
these other powers can help us with

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450
these other powers can help us with
 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.420
these other powers can help us with
those threats they face those threats as

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430
those threats they face those threats as
 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.170
those threats they face those threats as
well and for example on terrorism we

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180
well and for example on terrorism we
 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.470
well and for example on terrorism we
rely on Scotland Yard and on the police

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480
rely on Scotland Yard and on the police
 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.690
rely on Scotland Yard and on the police
and Hamburg to be arresting suspects and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
and Hamburg to be arresting suspects and
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.400
and Hamburg to be arresting suspects and
I think there are Americans alive today

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410
I think there are Americans alive today
 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.650
I think there are Americans alive today
because of those efforts China allows

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660
because of those efforts China allows
 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.380
because of those efforts China allows
our inspectors and their ports to screen

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390
our inspectors and their ports to screen
 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.970
our inspectors and their ports to screen

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980
shipping containers for nuclear devices
 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.520
shipping containers for nuclear devices
before they reach our shores India has

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530
before they reach our shores India has
 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.890
before they reach our shores India has

deep expertise in Islamic extremist
groups that we now need because these

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370
groups that we now need because these
 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.500
groups that we now need because these
groups are now targeting the United

groups are now targeting the United
 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.600
groups are now targeting the United
States and even Russia we have a very

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610
States and even Russia we have a very
 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.250

you know cantankerous relationship with
 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.140
you know cantankerous relationship with
Russia at the moment but they are a key

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150
Russia at the moment but they are a key
 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.360
Russia at the moment but they are a key
security partner in keeping nuclear

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370
security partner in keeping nuclear
 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.400

materials out of the hands of terrorists
and on disease I mean the best

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020
and on disease I mean the best
 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.140
and on disease I mean the best
protection against it you know disease

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150
protection against it you know disease
 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.490
protection against it you know disease
here in the United States is a strong

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500
here in the United States is a strong
 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.400
here in the United States is a strong
public health system in China so on

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410
public health system in China so on
 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.320
public health system in China so on
these on the issues that are that the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
these on the issues that are that the
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.090
these on the issues that are that the
most direct security threats to United

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100
most direct security threats to United
 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.280
most direct security threats to United
States these other countries are really

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290
States these other countries are really
 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.850
States these other countries are really
our partners and even on economics you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860
our partners and even on economics you
 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.490
our partners and even on economics you
know they there's a lot of dislocation

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500
know they there's a lot of dislocation
 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.690
know they there's a lot of dislocation
that happens because of globalization

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700
that happens because of globalization
 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.920
that happens because of globalization
and because of trade with these

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930
and because of trade with these
 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.320
and because of trade with these
countries but there are ways in which

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330
countries but there are ways in which
 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.090
countries but there are ways in which
their prosperity is it is pretty

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100
their prosperity is it is pretty
 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.050
their prosperity is it is pretty
directly linked to our prosperity

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060
directly linked to our prosperity
 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.800
directly linked to our prosperity
I think that things could be potentially

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
I think that things could be potentially
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.089
I think that things could be potentially
different if we have a Democratic

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099
different if we have a Democratic
 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.430
different if we have a Democratic
president and the Democratic Congress

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
president and the Democratic Congress
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.050
president and the Democratic Congress
maybe not as different as we would hope

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
maybe not as different as we would hope
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.280
maybe not as different as we would hope
but I think they will be different for

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
but I think they will be different for
 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.830
but I think they will be different for
example the climate the climate crisis

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840
example the climate the climate crisis
 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.420
example the climate the climate crisis
is a good example I do think that a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430
is a good example I do think that a
 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.660
is a good example I do think that a
Democratic president with the Democratic

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
Democratic president with the Democratic
 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.320
Democratic president with the Democratic
Congress behind him or her we'll be able

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330
Congress behind him or her we'll be able
 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.270
Congress behind him or her we'll be able
to actually push that issue in a way

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
to actually push that issue in a way
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.790
to actually push that issue in a way
that hasn't we haven't been able to so

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800
that hasn't we haven't been able to so
 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.720
that hasn't we haven't been able to so
far and I think on other issues as well

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
far and I think on other issues as well
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.820
far and I think on other issues as well
universal health care for example I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830
universal health care for example I
 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.740
universal health care for example I
think I'd have more hope for universal

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
think I'd have more hope for universal
 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.770
think I'd have more hope for universal
health care going forward under under

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
health care going forward under under
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.860
health care going forward under under
that kind of a scenario and a more

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
that kind of a scenario and a more
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.880
that kind of a scenario and a more
robust and renewed social safety net to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890
robust and renewed social safety net to
 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.250
robust and renewed social safety net to
empower our workers and to have them

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260
empower our workers and to have them
 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.589
empower our workers and to have them
feel less anxious about the about

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599
feel less anxious about the about
 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.449
feel less anxious about the about
globalization I think I think all those

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459
globalization I think I think all those
 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.850
globalization I think I think all those
things could be different in Canada

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860
things could be different in Canada
 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.410
things could be different in Canada
hundred Democratic administration I

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420
 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.729
