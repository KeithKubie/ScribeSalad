NARRATOR: When Arctic
waters turn warmer,

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.934
walruses must abandon
their melting havens

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.200
in search of food and dry land.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.567
[music playing]

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:33.166
The fate of a walrus
lies in the shifting ice.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:37.400
With nothing solid to rest on
and long distances to swim,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.867
a walrus can drown
in a watery Arctic.

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:43.033

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.800
Not far from the males, females
have also been contending

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.667
with a melting refuge.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.000
Born less than a day
ago, a pup follows

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.300
his mother into Arctic water.

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:12.433
With no time to lose, his mother
gives him a swimming lesson.

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:16.200
[music playing]

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:30.600
It looks like fun, but
this is serious business.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.900
The females and the young will
soon begin their own journey

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.767
in pursuit of ice.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.300
Their lives depend on
keeping up with Mom.
