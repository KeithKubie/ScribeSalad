00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.080
Every journey is made up of moments. It

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.980
begins with the point of departure, a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.139
moment that would become permanently

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.349
etched in our minds, the moment it all

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.560
began.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.960
When we think back to that moment years

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.760
from now it will feel like it happened

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.760
in slow motion, like time was frozen still.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.119
We'll try to recall what it felt

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.390
like to be in that space, in that time, to

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.900
breathe in that air and feel the way we did.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.710
My journey is brimming with moments like

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.070
this. Snapshots that capture a dream I

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.790
was living. These moments, they're

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.200
untouchable.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.960
For some of us, it began when we were 10

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.620
years old,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.110
learning about Harvard from watching TV

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.270
and determining to do everything in our

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.570
power to become a part of it. For others,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.690
it began in high school: growing up in

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.390
the shadow of Harvard's glory,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.890
intimidated by centuries of celebrated

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.030
alumni. For most, it began the moment we

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.890
challenged the assumption that we did

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.700
not belong there.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.450
And then there are the hundreds of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.700
images, moments in our memories

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.479
accumulated over four years here. If you

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.070
have preconceived notions about this

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.240
place, throw them away. Harvard is what you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.299
make it. It changes and shifts just as we

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.329
do as individuals. How much we mold it is

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.119
up to us and the more you shape Harvard,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.940
the more it shapes you.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.260
I've been challenged here. I failed and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.730
I've succeeded.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.910
I've grown. I've experienced moments of

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.000
pressure, moments of happiness. I'll never

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.640
be the same.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.180
This is our moment. This is the end of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.340
our journey.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.909
And when this moment is gone, our new

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.629
journeys begins.
