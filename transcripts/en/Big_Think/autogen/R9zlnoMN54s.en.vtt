00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.099
implanted medical devices in human
beings in the United States and around

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109
beings in the United States and around
 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.509

the world today that number is going to

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519
the world today that number is going to
 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.120
the world today that number is going to
grow exponentially as they become more

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130
grow exponentially as they become more
 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.460
grow exponentially as they become more
powerful brain computer interface

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470
powerful brain computer interface
 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.979
powerful brain computer interface
computers such as cochlear implants are

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989
computers such as cochlear implants are
 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.900
computers such as cochlear implants are
growing in the old days if you were

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910
growing in the old days if you were
 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.580
growing in the old days if you were
hearing impaired they would kind of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590
hearing impaired they would kind of
 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.199
hearing impaired they would kind of
create a hearing aid that you'd war

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209
create a hearing aid that you'd war
 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.720
create a hearing aid that you'd war
inside your ear now they can actually

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730
inside your ear now they can actually
 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.789
inside your ear now they can actually
attach a device directly to your skull

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799
attach a device directly to your skull
 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.430
attach a device directly to your skull
and wire it into your auditory nerve

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
and wire it into your auditory nerve
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.129
and wire it into your auditory nerve
directly into your brain so there is an

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139
directly into your brain so there is an
 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.020
directly into your brain so there is an
interface between a computer on your

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
interface between a computer on your
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.259
interface between a computer on your
body and your brain via the auditory

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269
body and your brain via the auditory
 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.539
body and your brain via the auditory
nerve and it's controlled again via

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549
nerve and it's controlled again via
 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.820
nerve and it's controlled again via
bluetooth so think about this the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830
bluetooth so think about this the
 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.730
bluetooth so think about this the
Bluetooth hacks are incredibly easy to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740
Bluetooth hacks are incredibly easy to
 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.450
Bluetooth hacks are incredibly easy to
carry out there are many many known

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460
carry out there are many many known
 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.070
carry out there are many many known
exploits you can download apps that will

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080
exploits you can download apps that will
 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.990
exploits you can download apps that will
do Bluetooth exploits and so if

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000
do Bluetooth exploits and so if
 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.430
do Bluetooth exploits and so if
somebody's wearing this type of hearing

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
somebody's wearing this type of hearing
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.920
somebody's wearing this type of hearing
aid I could subvert that I could make

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930
aid I could subvert that I could make
 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.439
aid I could subvert that I could make
sounds and noise into their auditory

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449
sounds and noise into their auditory
 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.629

hear i could make them think that

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319
hear i could make them think that
 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.170

they're going crazy right you can do all

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180
they're going crazy right you can do all
 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.969
they're going crazy right you can do all
different types of terrible things and

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979
different types of terrible things and
 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.189
different types of terrible things and
you may be thinking why would somebody

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199
you may be thinking why would somebody
 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.040
you may be thinking why would somebody
do this right only a truly sick person

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050
do this right only a truly sick person
 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.080
do this right only a truly sick person
would do this and I'm sad to say there

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090
would do this and I'm sad to say there
 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.360
would do this and I'm sad to say there
are some people like that in this world

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370
are some people like that in this world
 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.059
are some people like that in this world
I go back five or six years to a case

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069
I go back five or six years to a case
 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.740
I go back five or six years to a case

who may not be aware epileptics have to
guard themselves against sudden bright

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289
guard themselves against sudden bright
 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.920
guard themselves against sudden bright
flashing lights that can cause them to

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930
flashing lights that can cause them to
 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.230
flashing lights that can cause them to
go into grand mal seizures and somebody

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240
go into grand mal seizures and somebody
 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.420
go into grand mal seizures and somebody
five or six years ago hack the national

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430
five or six years ago hack the national
 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.879
five or six years ago hack the national
epilepsy foundation website and so when

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889
epilepsy foundation website and so when
 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.490
epilepsy foundation website and so when
epileptics went to their website for

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500
epileptics went to their website for
 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.230
epileptics went to their website for
information rather than seeing the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240
information rather than seeing the
 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.480
information rather than seeing the
epilepsy foundations webpage what they

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490
epilepsy foundations webpage what they
 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.120
epilepsy foundations webpage what they
saw was a bunch of flash code blinking

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130
saw was a bunch of flash code blinking
 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.980
saw was a bunch of flash code blinking
blinking blinking really fast in their

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990
blinking blinking really fast in their
 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.839

seizures were recorded as a result of
 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.159
seizures were recorded as a result of
that hack so unfortunately there are

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169
that hack so unfortunately there are
 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.290
that hack so unfortunately there are
some people in this world who do things

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300
some people in this world who do things
 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.420
some people in this world who do things
like that and our mothers for no other

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430
like that and our mothers for no other
 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.810
like that and our mothers for no other
reason than for the kicks of it all
