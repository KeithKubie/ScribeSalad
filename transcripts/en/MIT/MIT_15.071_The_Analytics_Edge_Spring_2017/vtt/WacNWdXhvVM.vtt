00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.480
Today's lecture is a
story of Moneyball,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.470
a book by Michael Lewis in
2003 and a movie in 2011

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.030
starring Brad Pitt.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.280
Moneyball discusses how sports
analytics changed baseball.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.130
Moneyball tells the
story of the Oakland A's.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.820
The A's is a team near
San Francisco, California.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.550
They were once a rich
team, but the team

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
was purchased in
1995 by owners who

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.450
enforced strict budget cuts.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.720
Despite this, they
were improving

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.620
over the years 1997 to 2001.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.710
In the table, you can see
that the percentage of wins

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.430
was increasing in
each and every year.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.700
This was puzzling, and
many baseball experts

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.980
thought it was just luck.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.510
In 2002, the A's lost
three key players.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.320
The key question: could they
continue winning without them?

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.980
So what is the key problem?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.260
Let us discuss the graph
on the left of the screen.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:26.330
The horizontal axis
shows the average payroll

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.970
during the years 1998 to 2001.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.450
The vertical axis shows
the average yearly wins

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.590
over the same years.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.440
So let's look at some of
the teams in this graph.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.580
So which one is this team?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.320
This is a team that
won about 100 games

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.310
and spent roughly $90
million during this period.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.640
So this is the New York Yankees.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.070
Let's look at this team.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.160
This team spent about $80
million and won about 90 games.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.200
This is the Red Sox.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.850
Where are the Oakland A's?

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.470
The A's are here.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.640
They won about 90 games, and
they spent under $30 million.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.290
If you compare it
with the Red Sox,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.700
they won about the same number
of games during this period

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.000
but the Red Sox spent about
$50 million more per year than

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.500
the A's.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.630
Clearly, rich teams like
the Yankees and the Red Sox

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.440
can afford the all-star players.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.670
But please observe how
efficient the A's are.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.530
As I mentioned,
they won 90 games,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.280
and their payroll
was under $30 million

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.520
compared to the Yankees,
who spent almost three

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.540
to four times as much,
and they won, of course,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.800
more games, but
not that much more.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.830
So rich teams, as
I mentioned, have

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.300
three to four times the
payroll of poor teams.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.180
Yet the A's made the
playoffs every year.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.290
How do they do this?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.970
And what we will see
in this lecture is

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.940
that by taking a
quantitative approach,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.420
an analytics approach, they
were able to find undervalued

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.040
players and form teams
that were very efficient.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.880
So the A's started
using a different method

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.630
to select players.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.010
The traditional way of selecting
players was through scouting.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.350
Scouts would watch high
school and college players,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.840
and they would report
back about their skills,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.390
especially discussing their
speed and their athletic build.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.880
The A's, however,
selected players

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.550
based on their statistics,
not on their looks.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.490
The following are quotes
from the book Moneyball.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.360
"The statistics enable
you to find your way

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.390
past all sorts of sight-based
scouting prejudices."

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.410
And a direct quote
from Billy Beane,

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.890
the manager of the Oakland
A's and the architect

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:34.409
of this approach: "We are
not selling jeans here."

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.700
Let us contrast how
the A's selected

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.480
players versus the Yankees.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.080
On the left, you see a
catcher, Scott Hatteberg,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.090
that the A's selected, who would
not throw particularly well

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.300
but got on base a lot.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.700
On the right, you
see Derek Jeter,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.250
one of the top
players in baseball,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.000
a consistent shortstop
and the leader

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.340
in hits and stolen bases.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.930
Let us look into pitchers.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.030
On the left, you
see Chad Bradford,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.210
a pitcher for the
A's, a submariner

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.640
who used an unconventional
delivery and slow speed.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.980
On the right, you
see Roger Clemens,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.650
one of the best pitchers
in the game that

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.170
used conventional
delivery and fast speed.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.970
Billy Beane was the manager
of the Oakland A's since 1997.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.820
He played Major League Baseball,
but he was not a great player.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.420
In fact, he sees himself as
a typical scouting error.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.500
In the 1980s and 1990s, analysts
were hired by baseball teams,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.340
but none of them
had enough power

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.410
to affect anything important.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.440
As I mentioned,
Billy Beane became

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.680
the general manager of
the Oakland A's in 1997,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.930
and he was given a
rather small budget.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.160
He understood the
importance of analytics.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.180
But during this period,
most general managers

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.490
knew little about statistics
and based decisions primarily

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.980
on feelings.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.770
In contrast, Billy Beane hired
Paul DePodesta, a Harvard

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.240
graduate, as his assistant.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.520
Furthermore, he was not afraid
to alienate scouts, managers,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.320
and players if the quantitative
approach suggested decisions

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.060
that were different than
the scouts or the managers

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.220
or the players suggested.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.900
An important player
in this story

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.870
is Paul DePodesta,
a Harvard graduate.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.780
Paul spent a lot of time
looking at the data.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.600
The analysis suggested that
some skills were undervalued

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.840
and some skills were overvalued.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.350
The key premise of
the Oakland A's is

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.810
that if they could detect
the undervalued skills,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.980
they could find
players at a bargain.
