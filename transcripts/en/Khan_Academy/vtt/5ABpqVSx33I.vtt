00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.050
I want to use this video
to kind of make sure we

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.590
intuitively and otherwise and
understand the difference

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.260
between a Z-statistic--
something I have trouble

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.820
saying-- and a T-statistic.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.970
So in a lot of what we're doing
in this inferential

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.480
statistics, we're trying to
figure out what is the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.610
probability of getting a
certain sample mean.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.620
So what we've been doing,
especially when we have a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.010
large sample size-- so let
me just draw a sampling

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.540
distribution here.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.480
So let's say we have a sampling
distribution of the

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.040
sample mean right here.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.090
It has some assumed mean value
and some standard deviation.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.920
What we want to do is any result
that we get, let's say

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.460
we get some sample
mean out here.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.350
We want to figure out the
probability of getting a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.700
result at least as
extreme as this.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.170
So you can either figure out the
probability of getting a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.614
result below this and subtracted
that from 1, or

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:08.470
just figure out this area
right over there.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.720
And to do that we've been
figuring out how many standard

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.120
deviations above the mean
we actually are.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.010
The way we figured that out is
we take our sample mean, we

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.200
subtract from that our mean
itself, we subtract from that

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.750
what we assume the mean should
be, or maybe we don't know

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.890
what this is.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.740
And then we divide that by the
standard deviation of the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.990
sampling distribution.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.700
This is how many standard
deviations we

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100
are above the mean.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.860
That is that distance
right over there.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.420
Now, we usually don't know
what this is either.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.840
We normally don't know
what that is either.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.020
And the central limit theorem
told us that assuming that we

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.650
have a sufficient sample size,
this thing right here, this

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.729
thing is going to be the same
thing as-- the sample is going

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.750
to be the same thing as the
standard deviation of our

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.370
population divided by
the square root

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.190
of our sample size.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.930
So this thing right over here
can be re-written as our

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.290
sample mean minus the mean of
our sampling distribution of

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.510
the sample mean divided by
this thing right here--

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.190
divided by our population mean,
divided by the square

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.160
root of our sample size.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.830
And this is essentially our
best sense of how many

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.650
standard deviations away from
the actual mean we are.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.485
And this thing right here, we've
learned it before, is a

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:51.780
Z-score, or when we're dealing
with an actual statistic when

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.370
it's derived from the sample
mean statistic, we call this a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.620
Z-statistic.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.080
And then we could look it up
in a Z-table or in a normal

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.730
distribution table to say what's
the probability of

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.330
getting a value of this
Z or greater.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.890
So that would give us
that probability.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.640
So what's the probability
of getting that

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.680
extreme of a result?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.350
Now normally when we've done
this in the last few videos,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.270
we also do not know what the
standard deviation of the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.550
population is.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.200
So in order to approximate that
we say that the Z-score

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.280
is approximately, or the
Z-statistic, is approximately

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.030
going to be-- so let me just
write the numerator over

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.380
again-- over, we estimate this
using our sample standard

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.890
deviation-- let me do this in
a new color-- with using our

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.455
sample standard deviation.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:02.830
And this is OK if our sample
size is greater than 30.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.770
Or another way to think about
it is this will be normally

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:14.310
distributed if our sample
size is greater than 30.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.950
Even this approximation will
be approximately normally

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.930
distributed.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.174
Now, if your sample size is less
than 30, especially if

00:04:21.174 --> 00:04:23.180
it's a good bit less than
30, all of a sudden this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.730
expression will not be
normally distributed.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.270
So let me re-write the
expression over here.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.140
Sample mean minus the mean of
your sampling distribution of

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.640
the sample mean divided by your
sample standard deviation

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.420
over the square root of
your sample size.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.100
We just said if this thing is
well over 30, or at least 30,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.240
then this value right here, this
statistic, is going to be

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.520
normally distributed.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.540
If it's not, if this is small,
then this is going to have a

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.790
T-distribution.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.100
And then you're going to do the
exact same thing you did

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.810
here, but now you would assume
that the bell is no longer a

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.380
normal distribution, so this
example it was normal.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.160
All of Z's are normally
distributed.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.100
Over here in a T-distribution,
and this will actually be a

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.120
normalized T-distribution
right here because we

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.220
subtracted out the mean.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.220
So in a normalized
T-distribution, you're going

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.410
to have a mean of 0.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.070
And what you're going to do is
you want to figure out the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.850
probability of getting a T-value
at least this extreme.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.680
So this is your T-value you
would get, and then you

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.990
essentially figure out the area
under the curve right

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.030
over there.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.400
So a very easy rule of thumb
is calculate this quantity

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.530
either way.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.410
Calculate this quantity
either way.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.905
If you will have more than 30
samples, if your sample size

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:55.380
is more than 30, your sample
standard deviation is going to

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.580
be a good approximator for your

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.250
population standard deviation.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.900
And so this whole thing is
going to be approximately

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.680
normally distributed, and so
you can use a Z-table to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.850
figure out the probability
of getting a result

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.380
at least that extreme.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.450
If your sample size is small,
then this statistic, this

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.410
quantity, is going to have a
T-distribution, and then

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.800
you're going to have to use a
T-table to figure out the

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.180
probability of getting a T-value
at least this extreme.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.330
And we're going to see this
in an example a couple

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.040
of videos from now.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.970
Anyway, hopefully that helped
clarify some things in your

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.920
head about when to use a
Z-statistic or when to use a

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.170
T-statistic.
