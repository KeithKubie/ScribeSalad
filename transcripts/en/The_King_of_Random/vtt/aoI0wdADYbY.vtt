00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.899
For this video, I’m going to show you how
to use electricity and water to blow up a

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.130
party balloon like a mad scientist. These
might look like any other party balloons,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.270
but there’s one major difference. These
ones explode.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.080
Let’s start this project with the “Water
to Fuel Generator” we made in a previous

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.800
project, and two, fully charged car batteries.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.390
You can see I’ve got a 4 gauge cable connecting
the positive terminal on one battery, to the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.009
negative terminal on the other. And by hooking the jumper cables to the other two posts, we’ve

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.330
just created a series circuit that will power
our generator.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.550
If we remove the cap from the bubbler and
pour in a bit of fresh water, it will push

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.140
out any of the stale air, and give us a safe
watery platform, for testing small amounts of the gas.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.530
Let’s go ahead and power up the generator
by connecting the jumper cables to the two

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.059
terminals at the top.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.399
And look at the way the water instantly, begins
bubbling and churning. That’s because the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.239
electricity is ripping the water molecules
apart, and converting them into hydrogen and

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.420
oxygen gas, which make a pretty explosive
combination. So, guess what we’re going to try next?

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.329
First we’ll need to push the cap back onto
the bubbler, so the gas will flow through

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.390
the plastic tubing at the top. This way, we
can direct it wherever we want.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.210
So what do you think would happen, if we tried
blowing up a latex party balloon?

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.790
You can see I wrapped a thick elastic band
around the tube and the balloon multiple times,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.700
so they’ll stay together hands free. That
means we’ll be able to fill our balloons

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.890
up safely, from a distance.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.170
Now the generator works just fine regardless
of how the the leads are connected, but when

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.340
you’re running power to it, the contacts
will shower sparks of electricity when you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.979
disconnect them. And since we’re working
with explosive gases, I’m sure you can figure

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.860
out why that’s a really big problem.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.140
So to reduce the risk of blowing ourselves
up, let’s connect the power on the battery

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.520
side instead.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.579
This way, if the terminals spark when we make
the connection, we’ll be so far away from

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.909
the gas that it won’t be much of a hazard.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.939
Now look how fast the gas starts filling up
this balloon. At 24 volts, the generator is

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.060
producing around 5 liters of hydroxy gas per
minute, so it takes less than 2 minutes to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.030
fill the balloon completely.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.850
And check this out. If we pull the balloon
off the hose and let it go, it floats.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.450
The elastic keeps all the gas trapped inside,
and since the hydrogen is lighter than air,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.310
it rises to the ceiling just like a helium
balloon would do. And to make sure it doesn’t

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.740
float away and blow something up, it’s a
good idea to tie it down somewhere safe.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.289
Now what do you think would happen if we replaced
the ribbon, with a fuse? I know what you’re

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.290
thinking, but rather than lighting them and
sending them into the sky, let’s tape them

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.910
to a rod instead so you can see exactly what
happens the moment the sparks get through

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.280
the rubber. It ignites the gas and makes a
very satisfying bang, that kind of sounds

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.530
like gunshot.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.450
When the balloons explode, the gas simply
turns back into steam and water vapor. And

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.610
absorbs back in with the atmosphere.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.860
Now I tried filling another balloon, even
bigger, and look how buoyant and lively it

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.310
is now. To push the boundaries even further,
I went ahead made a whole bunch more, and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.330
it’s pretty mind blowing to realize, that
we just filled these party balloons, with

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
gas we made, from water.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.050
To top it all off, I picked up a SpongeBob
balloon from a local party store, and filled

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.840
him up, until he was about ready to burst.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.620
Don’t let that big grin on his face fool
you, because our friend SpongeBob has just

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.160
become, a SpongeBomb.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.090
I tied him down to make sure he wouldn’t
float away, then lit a fuse behind his back

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.170
and got really really, really, far away.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.670
When our little friend finally went off, the
shockwave was so powerful, that it actually

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.420
shook the windows on the house.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.940
Well now you know what happens when electrolyzed
water is trapped inside a balloon, and set

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.940
off with a fuse. And while I’m not suggesting
this is something you should try, if you’re

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.400
going to do it anyway, make sure you use extreme
caution, and just be prepared for the police to show up.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.400
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
video, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
