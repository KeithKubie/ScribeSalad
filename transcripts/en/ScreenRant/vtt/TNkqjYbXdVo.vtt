00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.529
The role of the costume designer is not only
to dress the actor but also to help define

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.880
the character the actor portrays.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.940
They help paint each frame of the film and
their work can either contribute or distract

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.620
from the art the audience is experiencing.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.720
A successful costume must be incorporated
by the story and be woven seamlessly into

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.040
the narrative and visual tapestry of the movie.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.240
When you are adapting a superhero story into
a movie I is even harder due to the expectations

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.240
of the fans.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.630
Here is Screen Rants list of 10 Superhero
Costume Designs That Could Have Ruined The

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.630
Movie.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.870
Make sure to give us a thumbs up when we talk
about your favorite superhero.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.030
Hugh Jackman as Wolverine

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.890
Director Sam Raimi wanted to make sure his
first X-Men venture was authentic to the comic

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.010
books, starting with the story line all the
way down to the costumes.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.890
His original idea for Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine
costume was the yellow spandex we have grown

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.340
accustomed to in the comics.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.579
He wasn’t the only one that was going to
wear their outfits in the comics; the entire

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.059
team was going to look like their original
designs.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.989
Singer ultimately decided that the costumes
were too cartoonish and chose to go with the

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.780
sleek black costumes we saw in the movie.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.900
Anthony Mackie as The Falcon

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.470
Anthony Mackie flew into 2014’s Captain
America: The Winter Soldier as The Falcon

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.250
and audiences loved him immediately.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.000
His character, Sam Wilson was an expert aviator
due to his time as a military pararescue before

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.971
he joined the Avengers team so he fit well
into his superhero outfit.

00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:25.050
The outfit you see in the films look like
a falcon but before the filmmakers settled

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.380
on those wings, they had another variation.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.210
The prototype design looked more like an airliner
with jet engines on either side.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.630
Maybe they would have renamed him The Aviator.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.700
Anne Hathaway as Catwoman

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.440
Catwoman had numerous concepts drawn for her
role in The Dark Knight Rises, in and out

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.820
of superhero costume.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.840
From her heels to her maid outfit they all
seemed to have changes but none more than

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.030
her Catwoman outfit.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.900
The artists must have researched Tim Burton’s
Batman Returns because her original costume

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.490
had a much stronger resemblance to that film
and didn’t fit well in this Batman series.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.450
Anne Hathaway looked great in all of her final
costumes and we probably couldn’t find much

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.370
reason to complain about her in any outfit.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.170
Chris O'Donnell as Robin

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.230
Tim Burton directed the first two Batman films
and was ready to helm the third installment,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.790
Batman Forever but the studio had a different
agenda.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.390
Burton’s last installment was too dark for
the studio and they wanted to keep Batman

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.760
Forever family friendly.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.890
The costume we saw Chris O'Donnell wear was
not the costume Burton had in mind for his

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.010
Robin, that was prepared for Marlon Wayans.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.560
Burton’s costume had a mask that looked
like the Scarlet Witches mask and check out

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.760
the hair.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.840
Jared Leto as the Joker

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.700
It seems that you can’t mention the film,
Suicide Squad without someone defending it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.000
or complaining about it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.600
No matter what your opinion is you can see
that the concept art of Jared Leto’s Joker

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.610
was originally bland.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.000
Initially he had no tattoos on his face and
no metal teeth and his costume was a simple

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.310
duster along with a dress shirt and a bow
tie.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.060
The filmmakers decided to make Leto’s character
crazier and took his outfit and makeup to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.060
the next level.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.060
Interested in Harley Quinn’s costume changes?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.930
Stick around and we’ll show you.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.250
Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.069
When you see Ryan Reynolds in 2016’s Deadpool
it is hard to believe that the team behind

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.290
that film was thinking of a different costume
than the one we saw in the film.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.069
His final costume was perfect, his eyes showed
emotion and he wore his signature belt buckle.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.540
The Merc with a Mouth was originally going
to wear a hockey-mask instead of his signature

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.180
mask and had straps holding the costume together.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.370
This was a mediocre concept that everyone
should be glad that they decided against and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:42.090
we’re sure Deadpool spoke out against it
too.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.140
Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.770
Rorschach is a badass.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.770
Period.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.800
Jackie Earle Haley performed Rorschach perfectly
from his uncompromising code, ability to solve

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.160
mysteries and his love for killing bad guys.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.250
Luckily his original costume was scrapped
or we would have been too distracted to enjoy

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.250
his performance.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.379
Concept art of his original costume featured
bellbottoms.

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.099
That’s right, bellbottoms on the man that
makes a stop to the bathroom during a prison

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:15.239
escape to handle a little problem.

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.680
Stefan Kapicic as Colossus

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.070
It’s hard to say who was the actor behind
the character Colossus in the 2016, R-rated

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.600
superhero film, Deadpool.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.510
It took five different actors to actually
create the CGI version of this character with

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.640
Stefan Kapicic performing the voice.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.000
Colossus was a big mutant made of organic
steel but despite being made of steel and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.320
CGI he had great expressions.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.410
The original costume concepts for this character
were hidden behind a hood.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.680
It’s a lot more fun to see his expressions
during battle and when listening to Deadpool’s

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.100
loving commentary.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.120
Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.650
When Sam Raimi started pre-production on 2002’s
Spider-Man he hired one of the greatest comic

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.280
book artists of all time to work on costume
concepts, Alex Ross.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.080
Ross’s drawings were not aligned with Raimi’s
vision.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.430
For starters the costume was much darker,
which would have brought a bleaker tone to

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.430
the film.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.410
Still, one of the biggest problems with his
work was Spider-Man’s eyes, they were dome-shaped

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.490
and extruded from the front of his costume.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:17.970
This concept might have worked for a real
spider but not for the heroic Peter Parker.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.660
Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.240
There is no denying that Margot Robbie stole
the show in 2016’s Suicide Squad, hence

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.530
why thousands of woman dressed as her for
Halloween.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.190
Maybe they wouldn’t have if they used the
original concepts for Harley Quinn’s costume.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.470
They originally wanted to have a tattoo of
the Joker’s face on her chest and the word,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.720
“puddin” across her crotch.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.300
Her entire stomach would have been shown and
half her breasts too.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.340
If the filmmakers thought they were given
a hard time about sexualizing Robbie in this

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.170
film, imagine how bad it would have been if
they used the concept costumes.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.170
What do you think of our video?

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.919
Did we skip over any other costume designs
that would have ruined the movie?
