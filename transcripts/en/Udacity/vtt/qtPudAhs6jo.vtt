00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.700
Now is also a good time to add
the images for the record and

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.510
stop recording button.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.910
Adding images of different sizes
is easy with the next code and

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.950
it can make your iOS app
look a whole lot better.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.650
To start,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.350
click on the assets catalog, this blue
icon here in the project navigator.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.640
We're going to add a new image set
by clicking on this plus button

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.250
here on the bottom of the screen,
and selecting a new image set.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.540
Let's name this record button
by single clicking on this

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.780
newly created image set.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.900
Now we need images for 1x, 2x, and 3x.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.440
We're going to explain, one x,
two x, and three x in full detail

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.200
in the UI kit fundamentals
lesson later in this course.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.950
For now, just know that we
need different sizes for

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.770
different iPhones and iPads.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.070
Our graphic designers have already
created those icons for us.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.780
So I just need to drag them
over from the finder folder

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.410
to the corresponding Xcode box.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.720
Let's drag the record
100 into the one x box.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.090
The record 200 into the two x box.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.900
And then the record 300
into the three x box.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.730
Back in may not storyboard, we can
select a record button in document

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.550
outline and under image,
we can select our record button image.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.650
Note that our button now has
both an image and a text.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.310
We can remove the record text since
the image does that work for us.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.200
And attach record label
further explains it.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.300
Select a record field here
under the title and clear it.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.990
And then hit return for
it to take effect.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.410
Now, since the button has changed, our
outer layer constraints are incorrect.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.820
We can fix this issue easily
with the help of Xcode.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.470
Click on the yellow disclosure button
here to see our auto layout issues.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.360
We see three auto layout issues.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.610
One with the Recording Label.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.330
One with the Stop Recording Button.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.300
And one with the Record Button.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.980
Remember that everything on the screen
is positioned off the Record Button.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.380
So we need to fix it first.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.610
Select it here by pressing
the CLO disclosure triangle, and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.240
choose update frames.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.699
Press fix misplacement.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.120
This has adjusted the frame on the
record button so that it fits the image.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.940
For these other two issues we're going
to choose update frames as well.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.610
Let's first fix the recording label.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.850
Update frames and fix misplacement,
and do the same for

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.840
the stop recording button.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.310
Update frames and fix misplacement.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.880
Now they're all correct and properly
positioned off of the recording button.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.170
One last thing,
let's turn off the screen background.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.910
Let's go back into the document outlined
here, select a recording button.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.800
Scroll down to the background and
instead of green.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.270
Let's choose the transparent one.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.590
That's it,
our recording button looks much better.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.280
Below you going to find the steps for
adding the icons for

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.750
the stop recording button,
so it can look good as well.
