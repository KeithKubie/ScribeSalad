00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.040
&gt;&gt; Well, we want to bring out
two more of our cartoonists,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.460
so we have with us two cartoonists,
two political cartoonists,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.660
both with the Washington
Post Writer's Group.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.950
Last year we had a
political cartooning panel

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.490
and not a lot has gone on in the
last year in terms of politics.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.160
But we decided we would
do this again anyway.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.860
And what we've done is we have
a cartoonist from the left

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.400
and cartoonist from the right.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.780
From the left we have Ann Telnaes,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.890
who's on the Washington
Post.com site.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.800
Earlier this year, she
won the Reuben Award.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.220
She is the first woman to woman
to win both the Reuben Award

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.990
and the Pulitzer Prize
for Editorial Cartooning.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.610
She is -- yes.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.860
And she has had a book out
here, "Humor's Edge," 2004

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.050
and also had a show here
at the Jefferson Building.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.300
And she works in a
beautiful animation style.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.840
We also have Mike Lester from
the right, up here from Florida,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.800
escaping any potential
hurricanes, and he has the book

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.040
"Cool Daddy Rat," and
they can come on out.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.840
Thank you guys.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.250
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.550
Welcome, guys.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.270
You know, one thing is, I'm
curious, all of you now are working

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.720
from real life and you're finding
inspiration from real life.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.770
Does real life consistently inspire
you or sometimes does real life get

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.070
so difficult your imagination
just has to go into overdrive?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.370
Can you talk about that?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.950
Getting inspiration from --

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.250
&gt;&gt; Yes, you already said it.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.670
It's an embarrassment
of riches right now.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.550
&gt;&gt; No matter what side
you may find yourself.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.600
What Ann and I do is really
just counterpunch to news cycles

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.900
and stories and -- at
least that's what I do,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.050
and it's not the worst
job in the world.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.550
And what about you, Ann?

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.840
Is it, you know?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.160
&gt;&gt; Well, I've been
doing political cartoons

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.010
since the Clinton Administration,
and I mean usually, you know,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.100
we just got off summer, right, and
usually for editorial cartoonists,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.650
summer is such a slow time
that you're looking for things

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.040
to comment on, like reading lists
on the beach and things like that.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.480
And now we have to actually choose.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.570
I mean I find myself going, what
do I want to comment on first?

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.870
Or what's more important?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.860
So it's definitely
-- it's different.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you're working
from real life in a different way,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.040
but you're dealing with
some serious themes.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.530
Is that -- what is it
like to work with that,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.990
because it's so different
from fiction.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.490
You have to respect
it in a different way.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.030
&gt;&gt; You're talking about the
non-fiction book I'm working on?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, with "Dragon Hoops."

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know how you all
feel about this, but it seems to me

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.090
that as soon as you cartoon,
you're adding a perspective,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.630
you're adding a layer of fiction.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.880
And I guess that's true for
documentary films as well,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.840
but in cartoons, it's
just much more pronounced.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.030
Everything is filtered through your
own pen, right, your own style.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.800
&gt;&gt; And even real people have
to become a character, right?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.400
&gt;&gt; They have to become yours.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.000
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about [inaudible].

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.300
&gt;&gt; And in the beginning, like this
is the first non-fiction thing

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.600
that I've done.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.900
And in the beginning I
felt like I was lying.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.500
&gt;&gt; I felt like I was
constantly lying.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.800
Every time I drew a
character, because it came

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.100
out in my style, I was lying.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.700
&gt;&gt; And at a certain point, I
just had to make peace with that.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.000
&gt;&gt; So you're creating
fake news cartoons?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess so.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.600
I guess so.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.900
&gt;&gt; But what about you, Mike?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.300
Does it take time for a
real person to become yours?

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.200
Like you've adopted
that real person?

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.490
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, a lot of young
cartoonists, I've talked to them

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.450 position:56%
for years and years, and they all
want to know how to get their style.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.980
And I think that's the
wrong question to ask,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.190
because I don't think you have
any choice in what your style is

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.490
if you're working honestly.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.090
&gt;&gt; And that's an old quote.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.210
"Your style is the result
of your most honest labors."

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.030
I don't know who said
it, but it wasn't me.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.360
I'm just re-quoting it.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.900 position:56%
And I don't think if you're -- I
mean, if you're really trying to put

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.410
out something that's
honest from yourself.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.710
You don't have a --
I don't have a choice

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.290
in how I draw, really, anymore.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.520
And it is an editorial statement,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.790
whether I put any words
to it or not.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.090
I think that's what you're saying.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.110
I mean, at this stage of the
game, I'm kind of stuck with that.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like your thumbprint.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.750
It's what you are.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.500
Well, we need to say
goodbye to Gene Luen Yang.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.800
We want to thank him.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.890
And I think we deserve
-- applause loud enough

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.510
that his parents can hear.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:14.120
[ Applause ]

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.540
&gt;&gt; You want me to slide over?

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, please.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.070
Can you stay, miked?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.030
There you go.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.870
Well, what I want to make
sure, because you guys brought

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.030
so many great cartoons from both
sides, I want to get to that,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.120
but to understand, like Mike also
creates a strip, "Mike du Jour,"

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.750
where you get to have fun
and step away from it.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.850
And Ann trained at Cal Arts,
studied character animation

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.500
and does these beautiful animations
and works in watercolor as well.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.130
And so you both have such
distinct voices and passions.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.280
Could you each talk about
sort of what's it like?

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.130
Did it take a while to find
your voice and find your style?

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.310
Did it come quickly?

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.360
Can you talk about that?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting, because I
actually started out as an animator.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.630 position:56%
I had no interest in editorial
cartooning when I was a young woman.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.400
So my style was based on
what I learned for animation.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.210
But when I started doing
editorial cartooning,

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.370
I was looking at other people's
work, and I was mimicking them.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.360
And at the time it was
cross-hatching, right?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.390
The pen and cross -- and I realized

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.160
that editorial cartooning
you have to do really fast.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.190
I mean you have to get one out a
day, and I couldn't do them fast.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.110
So I thought, what can I do fast?

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.480 position:56%
Well, I had learned how to use a
brush and ink for my licensing work.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.170
And so I just started
doing it that way.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.520
So I didn't consciously think
about a style, but it sort of,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.910
it evolved because I
had to do them fast.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.790
So that's where that came from.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.940
And then I always encourage
young people, you know,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.070
don't get hung up on doing a style.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.450
The style will come.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.650
You just want to really learn
what it is you want to say.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.240
Don't worry what it looks like.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.930
You can look at other
people's work, but put it aside

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.120
and then just do your own stuff.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.520
Because it will develop.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, as I understand
it, you have something in common

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.800
with a lot of young people now,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.170
in that it was quite a while before
you actually read a newspaper.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Isn't that embarrassing?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.300
&gt;&gt; But events like the Anita
Hill hearings, Tiananmen Square,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.200
they politically engaged you.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.420
Could you just talk a
little bit about that?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're absolutely right.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.580
I did not read a newspaper -- I was
living in Los Angeles at the time.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.600
I was working for the
Walt Disney Company.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.260 position:56%
I was an imagineer, a show designer.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.510
And I had no interest in politics.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.230
I mean, I knew about
editorial cartoons

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.600
because I liked the artwork.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.480
So I looked at them.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.030
But until I was working late one
night and I watched, it was 1989,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.110
and the Tiananmen Square
massacre unfolded on television.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.110
&gt;&gt; Watching that tank come out,
and the students, and all that.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.190
&gt;&gt; I watched those students that
were close to my own age get mowed

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.840
down by their own government,
then I felt the need,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.980
that I needed to say
something through my art.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.890
So that's when I started trying
to become an editorial cartoonist.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.190
&gt;&gt; You say trying.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.490
You're humble.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.790
It seemed to come quickly.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.110
&gt;&gt; Well, it took a
few years, but yeah.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.710
And what about you, Mike?

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.640
I mean, did you grow up political?

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.960
Were your parents political?

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.260
&gt;&gt; Not at all.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, when did it come?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.880
&gt;&gt; I grew up on the floor
with a comics page on Sundays,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.140
and most every day, and
then the box scores.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.020
So I was the farthest thing
from interested in politics.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.320
&gt;&gt; And this was in Georgia, right?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.800
&gt;&gt; And I really wish I
weren't so interested now.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.100
&gt;&gt; Because why?

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.700
&gt;&gt; It would make life a
lot simpler for all of us.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.950
But I started out in
another field, just like Ann.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.990
I was -- I could just always draw.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.790
I didn't know if I could
write, but I knew I could draw

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.930
and I didn't really
-- I had that down.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.150
But it doesn't matter if you
can draw in the editorial,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.970
in the comic strip business, if
you don't have anything to say.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.280
And that took some time.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.610
I didn't -- I wasn't very good
at it right out of the box.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.690
Fortunately I was in
a small town and --

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.990
but I worked at it and I think
I got a little bit better.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:28.970
I've found my own voice, both in
the comic strip and the editorial.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.910
And I was really tired -- at the
time I was doing advertising,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:38.260
and I was tired of drawing
storyboards for drug companies

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.670
and -- it's nice work, but
there's not a whole lot

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.970
to take home with you.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.080
Well, this will get the
crowd fired up, I know.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:55.270
Let's go to the cartoons, because
-- so we'll start with Ann.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.860
And you do a lot of things about
freedom of the press and rights.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.990
And I think you said to me, we
were speaking last year ahead

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.730
of the election, saying you
wanted to get as many cartoons

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.490
out while you still had a certain
protected freedom of the press,

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.940
in case it might be
endangered very soon.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.240
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.940
&gt;&gt; But could you talk about some
of your passion about cartooning,

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.370
about rights and freedoms?

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.600
&gt;&gt; Right, well, I've always been
interested in it, but especially

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.180
since the Danish cartoon
controversy in 2005.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.100
&gt;&gt; And then, of course, the Charlie
Hebdo murders a few years ago.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.590
You know, I go overseas
for a lot of conferences,

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.050
and I talk to my colleagues there,
and you know, they actually do have

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.540
to deal with people wanting
to throw them in jail

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.710
for their cartoons,
as well as kill them.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.010
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.310
&gt;&gt; And we've had many
incidents about that,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.910
but I always thought we had the
first amendment, we're fine.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.060
&gt;&gt; We still have the first
amendment, but I am very worried

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.470
about this administration,
because we have a president

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.840
that doesn't seem to understand
what the first amendment is.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.600
And he seems to think that the free
press is his own personal PR firm.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.550
So I think we're in danger.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.180
&gt;&gt; He's also called them the enemy.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.660
&gt;&gt; He's called them the enemy.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.430
This is dangerous talk,
and I really am concerned

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.450
for editorial cartoonists, because
we really are on the front line.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.400
And the reason that we are,
is even though we are funny,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.430
and we do cartoons, we do images.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.990
And images can reach anyone.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.560
Words are different.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.350
People actually have to know
how to read, know the language.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.650
But editorial cartoons, especially
with the internet, can reach wide,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.120
and that's why the Charlie Hebdo,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.690
the Danish cartoon
controversy, happened.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.500
So I am worried about it now.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.070
It's something to be
concerned about.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.900
And I think especially young
people should understand

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.060
that this isn't something
that you should ignore.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.200
This is your future, if you can
speak up the way you want to speak.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.840
So I do a lot more
work about it now.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so here you have
Trump trying to muzzle, you know --

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.890
&gt;&gt; Justice, yes.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.190
&gt;&gt; Justice.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.490
Yes.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.790
&gt;&gt; Yes, he's hard at it.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:21.510
&gt;&gt; And part of it with that is the
-- on social media, your images,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.610
they can go out and sort of --
people can attach their own words

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.770
and try to reframe
even what you've drawn.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.490
And so we're in an era now
where everything, you know,

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.750
what you take is almost repurposed.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.720
And I recently have interviewed
a few political cartoonists,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.570
including like Gary Varvel.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.080
President Trump retweeted --
someone memed what he did,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.100
changed the meaning of the cartoon.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.400
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.700
&gt;&gt; Different.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.000
It got reinterpreted and I even
interviewed Gary and he's like,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.510
the person who did it
and that Trump retweeted,

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.240
it was a different meaning
entirely from what he meant.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.800
But people don't know that.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.400
&gt;&gt; And social media has
definitely contributed to that.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.410
I mean, it's good for
us, in one sense.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.990 position:56%
I reach a lot more people through my
Twitter account, but the problem is,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.990
is social media can
also, like you said,

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.980
people will interpret it the
way they want to interpret it,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.430
and then they will retweet
it, and they'll say something

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.780
about the cartoon, which was not
the original intent of the cartoon.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.630
I've seen journalists even do this,
people that ought to know better,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.560
talking about a cartoon
and presenting this cartoon

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.180
as something that it is not.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.480 position:56%
So it's something that we have to --

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.140
we're still kind of
dealing with, actually.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.100
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah, we're
still very much changing.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.870
I do -- before I go on, I
do want to make a point.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:38.710
I, being online, I get -- we
all get hate mail and vitriol,

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.700
and there's a coarseness that comes
with the anonymity of social media.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.910
But I will say there's so few
women in political cartooning,

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.530
but even columnists at The Post
who are female, you, to me,

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:57.110
it turns my stomach what you
get called as a result of that.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:02.200
How do you -- you're tough,
but how do you deal with that?

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.200
&gt;&gt; Well, like you said,
editorial cartoonists, I mean,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.050
we've dealt with hate mail forever.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.910
I mean we were told always, we're
stupid, our cartoons are stupid.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.500
First it's with mail,
then it goes to email,

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.930
and then it's social media.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.520
The thing about social
media now for women,

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.230
and it's not just editorial
cartoonists, it's gamers,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.840
it's female journalists,
those two sports journalists,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.290
the misogyny is amazing.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.090
I have never in my 25 years

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.320
of editorial cartooning
received the kind

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:38.170
of misogynistic crap I've gotten
in the past couple of years.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.570
I used to think you
just sort of ignore it.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:45.730 position:56%
I think the people that kind of take
it on, head-on, is the way to do it.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.650
Now I will speak up.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.010
And I like it when my
supporters speak up, as well.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.670
Because it's just not acceptable.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.440
It's like being --

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.240
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:03.870
[ Applause ]

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.560
Yeah. Absolutely.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.820
So getting to free
speech and rights.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.630
Mike, you have -- we know
that there's certain comedians

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.850
who talk a lot now about how
they won't go to campuses

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.310
where they get protested, because
they feel as though campuses,

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.550
what used to be bastions of free
speech are, it's now the opposite.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.280
They feel like they're bastions
of political correctness.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:33.630
Can you talk about your
view in this cartoon?

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, go back to the media.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.530
Let me look at that backwards.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:49.250
I'm a -- for many years now, I have
worked in media and newspapers,

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.740
and they're my biggest
target, by and large.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.030
&gt;&gt; yeah, like the Daily Show.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.390
The Daily Show is created,
not as a political show.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.510
I've interviewed the co-creator
of the show and I've talked

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.900
to Jon Stewart and Colbert's
producer, and it was started

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.520
because it felt like news
wasn't doing its job.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.820
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.120
&gt;&gt; And it became a
critique of media.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.800
&gt;&gt; I love my job.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.680
I love the career and the
discipline of doing it.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:26.630
But I also think that I'm not
going to be presumptuous enough

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.350
to think I have a responsibility,
but I take a lot

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.360
of shots at my own field.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.240
And it's no different than --

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:40.660 position:56%
well, you were talking about college
campuses, and college campuses have,

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:47.250
like media, I think have
lost their way a little bit.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:55.890
It is the place in America that
you shouldn't be afraid to say,

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.810
hey, the emperor's naked.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:03.230
Now you can't say that right
now, even though he is.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:08.780
So that's an old and
a small metaphor

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.260
that I assume everybody gets, but
that's how I see it right now.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:20.270
And I'll go a little further and
say I'm not a fan of politicians.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.340
I'm not a fan of this
one, this President,

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.900
I'm not a fan of the last one.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.500
But that's my job,
at least I think so.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:34.270 position:56%
But I think the media was a little
bit -- I think the last eight years,

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.910
we had the exact opposite.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.190
I think we're kind of overreacting
now, and I think we under-reacted

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.020
for the previous eight years.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.730
That's just my opinion.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.370
You may have yours.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.670
I know --

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.420
&gt;&gt; Do you speak at colleges?

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.720
&gt;&gt; I haven't lately.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.350
&gt;&gt; By choice?

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.480
&gt;&gt; No, I just -- I
just haven't lately.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.840
I mean I'm happy to.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.040
I'll speak anywhere.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.110
Well, you're not holding back on
this one in terms of free speech

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.520
and using a Game of
Thrones metaphor.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.610
Could you talk about this one?

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:13.940
Well, that's not a metaphor.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:19.070
There really is a class
at Berkeley called Game

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.870
of Thrones as a Second Language.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sometimes jokes write themselves.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:31.040
&gt;&gt; And if they're going to
do that, I'm just going to --

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.880
I'm notorious for, if
we're going to go that far,

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.520
I can usually go further.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.030
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.330
&gt;&gt; So.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.390
So let's talk about
the emperor, here.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.310
You each take your shots.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.820
And you [inaudible] up
to -- you told me before,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.250
last year you were
running out of orange

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.130
and pink pigments, especially.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:59.340
You literally had to stock
up and not for the flames.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.160
But you have really developed
this comic body, the hair,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.930
his tie only gets longer.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.610
And you only get more pointed.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.570
And you're able to turn these
around at an incredible rate.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.680
I mean, just these beautiful works.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.640
But can you talk about Trump
as a target, specifically?

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.980
&gt;&gt; Well, caricature, to me, is
not about how the person looks.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.170
I mean, I really feel

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:27.740
like a successful caricature
is about who the person is.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.340
During the Bush Administration,
my favorite was Cheney,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.650
and I can honestly say
my Cheney didn't look

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.550
like Cheney, but it
felt like Cheney.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.970
And I think that's what's
been happening with Trump.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.560
It's not just about him
being orange or whatever.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.960
I mean, the tie is wonderful.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.380
It's a wonderful visual metaphor.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.010
You can do all kinds of
things with that tie.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.640
But going back to -- what this was

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.210
about was his rhetoric
before he became President,

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.400
what he did during
the entire election.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.540
And I have to say, I think the
editorial cartoonists did a really

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.300
fantastic job about knowing exactly
who Trump was from the beginning.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.780
Our media, and I totally
agree with Mike, and Mike

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.680 position:56%
and I never agree on anything, ever.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.410
&gt;&gt; I like you.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.050
&gt;&gt; But I totally agree
with him about the media.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:24.060
The media did a horrible
job leading up to Trump,

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.520
as they did during the
lead up to the Iraqi War.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.660
They were laughing about him.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.770
I mean I watched journalists
giggle through interviews with him.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.810
And we were, frankly,
frightened about him.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.900
So Mike and I, the thing
about the free speech,

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.740
I am totally with Mike on this.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.940
I think the more free
speech the better.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.440
If you threaten me, though,
that is not your free speech.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.760
If you're going to hit me in
the head with a baseball bat,

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.650
that I've been told before,
that is not free speech.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.720
But you can say anything
you want, but be prepared

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.660
for me to come back at you.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.840
I'll draw a cartoon about
it, and I'll argue with you.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.280
But what's kind of interesting
about where we are now is someone

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.020
like Mike, who's very conservative.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.050
And I'm very liberal.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.460
I think on speech, we're
like exactly the same.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.980
It's all the people in the
middle that are having a problem.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.580
&gt;&gt; Could I just add to that?

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.880
&gt;&gt; No. What?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.570
[ Laughter ]

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.040

I'm sitting in the middle.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.340
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.220

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.520
&gt;&gt; I like [inaudible].

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.820
Is that no?

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.420
&gt;&gt; No.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.720

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.020
&gt;&gt; Are you signing from
the left or right on this?

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.620
&gt;&gt; I asked him if he could do a
Southern accent and he said yes.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.240
All right.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.090
Now -- you threw me.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.130
The free speech, okay.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.430
Go ahead.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.730
&gt;&gt; You're on the same on this?

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.250
Well, you're talking about
the middle, it's famous,

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.630
when I would do political cartoons,
they talked about the people

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.210
that get run over are those
in the middle of the freeway.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.190
If you're on one side or the
other, you know where you stand,

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.010
and the middle's where
you can get lost.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.150
But you guys are on
the same on this.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.970
And I wanted to get
-- and this is yours.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.290
But part of what ties [inaudible]
free speech is also what we have

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.600
going currently with
Charlottesville,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.920
post-Charlottesville,
with the monuments

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.930
and can you talk about
your take on that?

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:21.750
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a quote that I
-- it's a rather obscure quote,

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.340
one that I -- but I'm also an
obscure -- I'm into obscurities.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.180
&gt;&gt; And the quote is
"Nations are based as much

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.240
on what the people jointly
forget as what they remember."

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.010
It was, I believe, a
Frenchman named Ernest Kenan.

the guy saying this one's got to go.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.250
Yeah, maybe the monument's
got to go,

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.810
but that sentiment
doesn't need to go.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:53.610
I mean we got here some how,
some way, and I just don't think

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.590
that sanitizing how we got here
is really all that instructive.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:04.990
I think it's kind of living in
the rearview mirror, if you will.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:13.720
You know, yeah, maybe there are
things that need to be removed,

there's a lot of emphasis placed

on trying to rectify things
we're never going to rectify.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.880

If they can't -- but Ann, one
thing you've talked about, how --

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.500
I mean, you talked during --

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.150
about Anita Hill, about how
it was male senators, right?

the cartoon, but here you have,

does that [inaudible]?

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.590

of course, was both Democratic

they were all clueless.

was not necessarily lying,

her -- for sexual harassment.

Hillary at business.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.140
So, yeah. The -- and --

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.440
&gt;&gt; The tie.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.740
&gt;&gt; The tie.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.040
And here it comes.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.340
And the cutout deal.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.860
And you have such fun
with him physically.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.200
And there it is again.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.500
&gt;&gt; The tie again.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.800
&gt;&gt; The tie.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.100
I think it's getting longer.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.400
&gt;&gt; It's a great -- you can do --

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.000
&gt;&gt; Your direction things,
and it's red.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.300
&gt;&gt; And it's red, and there.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.630
That one's just -- that's just
beautiful, actually [inaudible].

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.770
And here's one of the animations.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.570
So stroking --

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.700
[ Laughing ]

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.660
That's, that's -- how can -- if
they want that as a screen saver,

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.970
is there a way they can, anyone
from the left want to -- yeah.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.470
I like how he's not moving, too.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.110
He's very comfortable.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.790
And of course, wind him
up and watch him go.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.200
That's a lot of red.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.500
That's a lot of red.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.370
And, of course, everyone --

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.370
&gt;&gt; That was when Spicer
finally let go.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.040
And he finally got to meet
the Pope once he let go.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.890
So things worked out.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:16.190
And you have Russia is
still very much with us.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.780
So you could probably keep
bringing this one out.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:25.770
And drinking -- if
everybody can see that.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.390
And so one question I have,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.080
because we have just a few minutes
before we bring the next cartoonist

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:37.140
out, is -- and you had, as
you know, a Ted Cruz cartoon,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.080 position:56%
in depicting that The Post took down

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.730
and it had the organ
grinder metaphor.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:48.050
And Mike, one of your most
controversial involved depicting --

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:53.140
with Sandra Fluke in depicting
Obama as her pimp, basically.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.440
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:59.580
&gt;&gt; And these are things, even so
far above the daily kind of thing.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.240
What do you, since you need to
have tougher skin, just quickly,

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.870
could you each talk about,
what do you do when that comes?

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.170
How do you gird yourself
against that?

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.470
&gt;&gt; Well, that was a surprise.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.430
I mean, that was really -- that was
the first time I think editorial

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.480
cartoonists have really had social
media play such a large role

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.450
in why a cartoon gets
that kind of push-back.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.240
&gt;&gt; Because it happened so fast.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.350
And you know, it happened
two days before Christmas,

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.650
so that is another thing.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:27.950
I don't work in the office.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.250
I'm at home.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.630
All these things kind
of contributed to it.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.060
You know, like I said,
we are used to push-back.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.740
I don't have a problem
with push-back.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.450
For me, the misogynistic
physical threats were different,

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.230
and I didn't care for that.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.420
We have an Association
for Editorial Cartoonists.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.760
They supported me.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.140
They put out a statement, which
was great for me at the time.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.920
But, you know, we all have to
deal with it, unfortunately,

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.620
and social media is definitely
a whole new wrench in it.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.040
And I've seen it's
happening more and more now.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.640
Mike, your sense?

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.490
&gt;&gt; Well, the cartoon you
referenced was easily --

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:12.010
it was the first administration
of Obama and --

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.310
you know, I signed my name.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:16.810
I don't apologize,
and that thing's --

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:23.140
nothing kills a joke faster than
explaining it, so I stand by it.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.630
&gt;&gt; So would you like to explain it?

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:25.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.230
Would be glad to.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:33.300
You've got Sandra Fluke, who
was asking for $3,000 a month,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.780
and contraception, welfare,
from Columbia, well, Georgetown.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.080
&gt;&gt; Georgetown.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.380
&gt;&gt; Georgetown.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.170
And Obama came out
and supported her.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.300
So Sandra, if you're here, I
don't know, but she's in town.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.700
Anyway. Well, thank you.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.360
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
