00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.550
We've all heard penguins mate for life, but
in reality nature doesn't DO monogamy.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:15.039
Hey animals, thanks for stopping by DNews,
I'm Trace!

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.820
Humans tend to personify pretty much every
other creature on this planet, and with love

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.380
being one of our more desired emotions -- we
REALLY WORK to see it in nature.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.300
We really don't have to look that far, to
see some of the happiness we hope for in ourselves.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.910
Plenty of animals, like penguins, are monogamous,
but even penguins will cheat on their partners

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.300
in some species and situations.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.280
True mammal monogamy is rare, only 3 to 5
percent of the 5,000 mammals do it, but there

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.899
are some monogamous heroes out there.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.960
For example, the MOST monogamous bird is the
albatross.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.100
Albatross flirt by dancing, which they learn
from hanging around with older albatrosses.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.329
This all sounds oddly familiar...

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.440
They'll go out dancing with lots of partners
until they find the right one and when they

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.040
do, they pair up forever.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.180
A mated pair of albatross can be apart for
months, and will still return to nest at the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.180
same time.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.460
They cuddle with each other and never snapchat
with anyone else.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.750
They never divorce, no matter what -- even
if the male does the dirty bird with another

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.750
lady.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.430
Yes, the males DO cheat, but they'll stay
together.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.700
Gibbons are the closest human relatives who
mate for life, finding a mate when they're

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.830
young and trying to make it work for the kids.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.390
Once they mate and form a family unit, they'll
all live in the same territory, groom each

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.850
other and socialize.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.409
It sounds all mid-century American family,
but gibbons know the difference between SOCIAL

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.280
monogamy and REPRODUCTIVE monogamy.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.171
In gibbons, the female is the head of the
family unit, then the offspring, and the male

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.290
is at the bottom.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.299
Cheating and casual sex with other members
of the group happens and the monkeys will

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.140
even get a kind of divorce; separating from
their family groups and striking out on their

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.140
own.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.049
Monogamy in nature is starting to look more
like human monogamy, eh?

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.920
Bald eagles mate for life too, once they've
picked their mate, the two eagles build a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.390
nest together, returning to the same spot
year after year.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.849
They expand the nest each time, so bald eagle
nests can grow to ten feet across and weigh

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.550
as much as half a ton.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.760
The baby eaglets -- which is the CUTEST NAME
EVER -- are on their own four months after

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.950
birth and can live for 25 years!

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.790
That would be like you being kicked out at
11 months old.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.080
Sounds rough to be an eagle.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.150
Not to mention, the couple splits up and does
the long-distance thing during migration season

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.819
-- getting back together during mating season.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.230
But the animal rated by me to be the most
passionate, the most pure -- is the prairie

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.230
vole.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.580
A study in Nature Neuroscience found when
a male vole and a single female vole meet

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.700
their brains are irrevocably altered by massive
release of oxytocin and vasopressin.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.110
Their gene switch, and boom they're addicted
to each other, they work together, play together

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.090
and if he needs to he'll fight for her like
the Dredd Pirate Roberts.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.580
Though, funnily, if you give the guy a bit
of alcohol -- he'll go chill with a stranger

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.580
vole. #sigh...

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.580
Monogamy...

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.970
It's never easy, but it's out there.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.680
And messing with it can be REAL bad.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
What do you think?

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680
Do you have a favorite animal that mates for
life?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.060
If you believe in monogamy tell us below,
and if not, why!

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.060
Let's talk about it.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.349
