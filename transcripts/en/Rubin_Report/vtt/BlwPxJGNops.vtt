WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.620
We are the New York Knicks.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.200
We are the [inaudible].

3
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.360
<v 1>Joining me today is the New York Times bestselling author,</v>

4
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.470
the guy who wrote that mid nineties New York Knicks anthem,

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.390
a man who has founded enterprises from private jet companies to Zico coconut

6
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:31.860
water,
the Co owner of the Mbas,
Atlanta Hawks and Oh,

7
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.180
a former rapper Jesse.
It's lyrical.
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Uh,

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.950
thanks for having me,
dude.
Your bio is like,

9
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.280
like it doesn't even seem like it could possibly be real.

10
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.170
It's been quite a journey.
Quite a journey.
All right.

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.320
There's so much I want to do with you.
I,
I said to you right before we started,

12
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:54.321
I mean I remember that 94 Nick's team so well that was like right in my

13
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:57.660
formative years of basketball,
which I love.

14
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:00.810
I said to you right before we started that that game six,

15
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.870
which as a Knicks fan is probably one of the most painful things you ever

16
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:04.620
watched.

17
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.620
A was the night of my senior prom and of course tonight of the Oj Simpson car

18
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.360
chase,
you lived through that whole experience.

19
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.080
<v 2>I did.
I was at the Knick game that night.</v>

20
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.910
I was at the Knick game as a playoff game.

21
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:18.330
I had just written the theme song for the Knicks and started,

22
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:23.200
it was starting to get momentum on the radio and in the garden and I was so,

23
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:28.201
I mean my whole life up a knick fan and this was a big moment and here we are,

24
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:32.980
game six at home and all of a sudden the Oj Chase,
I was getting like a pretzel.

25
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.790
I went outside,
I was like,
everyone's looking at the monitor and I looked up,

26
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:38.800
I'm like,
what in the world is this?
Oh Wow.

27
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:42.130
So they were showing you like don't go out to the concessions.
Yeah,

28
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.160
it was on the Monitor.

29
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:47.410
So you know I was conflicted and people were running back and forth.
It was wild.

30
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.590
What a crazy night because the rangers had just won the Stanley Cup finals I

32
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:55.980
think.
And it was just like a great time to be in New York.
Then Oj,

33
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:58.020
obviously people must've been talking about my prom,

34
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:00.660
so I can only imagine what was going on over there.
All right,

35
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.890
so speaking of New York,
you're from Roslyn Long Island.

36
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.300
I'm from Syosset Long Island.

37
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.320
We're about 10 minutes away from each other on the long island expressway.

38
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.380
I find that a lot of interesting people come out of long island had,

39
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.730
have you found that?
Is that the water?
What's going on?

40
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.030
<v 2>You know,
it's crazy.
I was telling,</v>

41
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.100
I was actually just having this conversation the other day with a friend of mine

42
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.050
and I was saying in my town,

43
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.290
if you took the year that I graduated my senior year and went back four years

44
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.950
and forward four years,
so in that eight year gap or whatever it is from,

45
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940
you know,
of kids that went through my school.
We have a,

46
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.900
I think we have two with three professional sports team owners.

47
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.210
We have multiple billionaires.

48
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.230
I have five guys that I went to high school is that are in jail.

49
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.890
We've had multiple suicides and Bernie Madoff was from my town.

50
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.840
I look at my town and think that everybody had the same opportunity.

51
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.670
Same teachers.
We had one movie theater.
I mean it was a small,

52
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.420
relatively small town.
One,
one real high,
one high school that everyone went to.

53
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.280
A real sense of community,
everyone at the same basically,
you know,

54
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.800
journey through as far as teachers and everything.

55
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.100
Yet we had this crazy swing of the biggest Ponzi schemer and his,

56
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.820
his family and sons where in our school,
you know,
guys who were super successful,

57
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.880
people that had super successful parents that went to jail.

58
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:29.740
I mean all in this community.
And it was like,
Whoa,
what was in the water?
Yeah.

59
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.200
In this town.
What do you make of that actually?

60
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:35.910
Cause there's gotta be something there.
I mean,
even my high school,
I mean there,

61
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.070
I knew a couple people that I went to high school with that ended up in jail,

62
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:43.450
but we also had Judd Apatow into my high school.
Idina Menzel huge Broadway star.

63
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.290
Natalie Portman.
Yeah.
I went to my high school and,
and all sorts of things.

64
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.670
I think that I would feel very lucky that I grew up in a town that I grew up in

65
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:56.440
and the area that we grew up in.
Yeah.
That,
um,
you know,
it was,
it was diverse.

66
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.800
There was a lot of opportunity.
There was creativity.
It wasn't far from the city.

67
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:03.520
So we had like a little bit of the city vibe.
Is that what it is?

68
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:06.820
I think it has something to do with the proximity because we were about 45

69
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:09.820
minutes away from New York City.
Most of our parents,

70
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:12.250
I'm guessing maybe your parents who worked in New York City,

71
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.230
so there was like a little bit of a commuter thing,

72
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.920
but you weren't totally part of New York.
Like something related to that.

73
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.870
I think that's part of it.
I think for me,

74
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:24.840
I think it's just the time period that I grew up,
you know,
as a kid.
Yeah.
Uh,

75
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.590
and there was just a change in music change in culture and uh,

76
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.990
we would just expose being close to the city.

77
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.910
We had early exposure to all those trends and we were early to the party and I

78
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:39.340
think that had a big impact.
At least it did for me.

79
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:42.700
I know he's an entrepreneur and in my journey it was exciting.

80
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.510
There was always excitement.
I want to be a part of everything.
Yeah.
So,
you know,

81
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:51.400
I got addicted to newness because there was always something new going on and
uh,

82
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.420
that fueled me even going forward.
So I feel very lucky that,
you know,

83
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:58.120
we grew up where we did.
Yeah.
Anything else I should know about your,

84
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.860
your formative years are family before we get into some of the things that you,

85
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.950
uh,
no,
no,
no.
You can ask me.
All right.
Well No,

86
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.810
if there's nothing else to specific,
you said addicted to newness.

87
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.160
So I feel this is the right time to play a little clip from you as a rapper.

88
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.010
Milne as Jesse James.
Lovely

89
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.043
<v 3>was lucky.</v>

90
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.330
I wanted to get my free book.

91
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.490
Nobody does wait.
I'll wait for fantastic.
But he moved like,

92
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.960
where am I getting slow?
Me Down
was one.

93
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:40.690
Let me get a pen.
In my case she said I was only in my money.

94
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.490
How was the pain foot at the five?
A couple bucks.
Same.
But y'all keep quiet.

95
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.850
Don't even try it.
I pulled through.
I love it.
But Nah,
she didn't fight it.

96
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.730
The store man back received diplomas of car.
She was laid off.

97
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.150
<v 2>Wow.
Oh Man.
Jesse James that wasn't in the,</v>

98
00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:07.330
uh,

99
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.850
in the email that you sent me about the shelf that you're going to flash back.

100
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.300
We have a pretty crack research team around here.

101
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.980
We're going full flashback or before we get to the future and the present.

102
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.960
How did that happen?
Like I said,
grew up in long island in the 80s,
you know,

103
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.740
and hip hop was comment was emerging.
Um,

104
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.540
I got really into it at an early age and then when I was in college,
you know,
I,

105
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.630
when everybody was writing their resumes and sending out resumes,
I was like,

106
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.980
I'm gonna try and make a record.
You're like,
this is what I wanna do.
And,
um,

107
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.170
there was no B plan.
And ultimately,
you know,
that passion,
uh,

108
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.771
really,

109
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:48.010
for three years of college I was working towards trying to get a record deal and

110
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.780
ultimately landed a deal with a company called delicious vinyl out in Cali,

111
00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:55.720
not far from where we are.
And they had two big accidents time.

112
00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:59.290
They had a guy named Tony Local Roy.
Yeah.
Wild thing of called Medina.

113
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.780
And then they had had a little bit of a tone loke feel to it that yeah,

114
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.270
same producers.
Yeah.
And then we had a young Mc who won a grammy for buster move.

115
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.960
Yeah.
So I was able to,
uh,
I,
I didn't know that,

116
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:13.960
but literally I was watching it this morning and I said to David,

117
00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:17.530
my producer that it's,
that's what it sounded like.
Yeah.
It's the same guys,

118
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.360
same year.
Same time.
Yeah.
And a,
and put an album out in the early nineties.
Wow.

119
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.710
So I was watching it and I was thinking,
man,
time changes,
you know,

120
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.030
things change.
We get sensitive to different things,
but I would guarantee it.

121
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:31.930
But if a young guy,

122
00:07:31.931 --> 00:07:36.430
like you put that song out now talking about a white woman and a white rapper,

123
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.000
we'd have a certain amount of people screaming about cultural appropriation and

124
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:43.720
all sorts of other stuff.
Was that even remotely something back then?
Well,

125
00:07:43.721 --> 00:07:46.230
you know,
I think it was a,
it was on my mind,
but the shaker,

126
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.380
like a white girl was my first single was actually a remake.

127
00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:52.450
The title of an old EU song.

128
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:57.100
A of an old gogo song from washing abandoned Washington DC.
Huh.
Um,

129
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.570
that was predominant was all black.

130
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.900
So I felt like I was just kind of taking the momentum of this hit song.

131
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.470
Yeah.
And introducing it to the theme too.
You know,
it was fun.
I was in college,

132
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.290
I would,
I wrote the whole album basically,
you know,

133
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.270
as a fraternity in my fraternity house.
And um,
yeah,

134
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.740
it was pretty tongue in cheek.
Yeah.

135
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.800
It kind of makes you wish that things were as simple now as they were back then.

136
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:24.850
Right.
Cause you could,
could you,
are you following me on this?

137
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.780
Like I see like some fraternity kid doing something silly like that now and,

138
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.320
and just like getting just like a ton of shit for it.
Yeah.

139
00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:34.510
I mean I'll eat it if it was totally good natured and all that.

140
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.020
It was totally good natured.
But I look back on it now and I think,
you know,

141
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.430
if I were to go back in time I probably would do a lot of things differently

142
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:47.140
just based on what I know now.
And you know,
I'm turning 50,

143
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.160
so I'm very aware of,
you know,
what chapter I am in my life.

144
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:55.830
But when I looked back at me at 21 and what I knew then and you know all the

145
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:58.530
mistakes,
I made a 21.
Uh,
but you know,

146
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.780
it's part of the growth and part of the journey.

147
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.540
<v 1>Yeah.
All right.
So I want to get to some of the growth in the journey.</v>

148
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:06.720
I want to get,
okay.
Cook and all that stuff.
Go,
wait,
let's just jump back to the,

149
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.190
to the go New York.
Go New York,
go.

150
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.380
How in the world did that even appear that you are going to be the guy that

151
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.200
wrote that thing and were you shocked that it caught on?
I mean,

152
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.320
the video which we'll uh,
we'll also link to down below.
I like,

153
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:21.660
I remember every moment of that.

154
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.440
<v 2>So what happened for me is right after college,
no resume,
you know,</v>

155
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.490
got rejected by a lot of record labels.
I had no context.

156
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:33.900
My Dad owned a plumbing supply house in Mineola,
also not from [inaudible].

157
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.590
I didn't know anyone that was connected to anything.
So I had to take this whole,

158
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.450
this whole process on my own shoulders and I would literally take a greyhound

159
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:47.160
bus on Friday from Washington DC where I went to school with my demo tape,

160
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:51.120
which was a recording of an instrumental that I played on my CD player.

161
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.800
And I would hit record on my answering machine and leave a wrap to the music

162
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:58.680
while it was playing.
That was out.
The only way I can man damn unbelievable.

163
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.420
Like that just sounds like a time warp.
I know.
That's,

164
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.640
that was the only way I could do it.

165
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.840
Then I would show up and hand out that cassette to everybody and got rejected.

166
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.650
But ultimately I did get a record.
I get,

167
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.330
I didn't get a record deal and um,

168
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.760
but that was my only goal.

169
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.150
So I took my foot off the gas pedal once I got the deal and I didn't get signed

170
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.730
for a second album,
which to me was crushing at the time.
Uh,

171
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:26.040
because the only thing on my resume now was,
you know,
failed rapper.
You know,

172
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.470
I was also a Kiddie pool attendant before there,

173
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.030
so that wasn't really going to get me a job on Wall Street.

174
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:36.090
That's like a low level life.
Low you're training,
like walk,

175
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.230
no peeing.
Like was if you could say walk and stop,
stop peeing.

176
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:41.790
You could get the job fair.
Always pinging,

177
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.440
you know that always to get them out of there.
But in any event,

178
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.560
um,
I wanted to stay even though I didn't get picked up for a second album,

179
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:51.480
I wanted to marry my two passions,

180
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:55.500
which was sports and music and I had this idea to write a theme song for the

181
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:58.230
next.
I was like,
all of a sudden sports,
we're changing.

182
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.870
The game is only 48 minutes and you're there,
you're a fan for for 48 minutes.

183
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.810
But for the other two hours that you're in the arena during timeouts,

184
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.673
you're an audience.

185
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.820
And the teams had to entertain the audience and now they brought in the dancers.

186
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:15.360
The Knicks city dancer is came in and they had video boards that all of a sudden

187
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:18.000
never existed.
So I was like,
let's do a theme song.

188
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:21.990
Like the bears did a song in 86.
Yeah,
let's do a theme song.

189
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:24.690
We'll get all the celebrities involved in and maybe it'll catch on.

190
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:29.580
So I wrote this demo basically in my apartment,

191
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.900
which was like a dorm room and I played it for the next and uh,

192
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.010
had you even get that meeting?
I had,
I started doing jingles,
uh,

193
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.160
and somehow I,

194
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.800
I did a jingle for Nancy Grunfeld clothing company or husband.

195
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.970
Ernie was the GM and she loved the jingle and I said,
well,
Nancy,

196
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:51.840
if you love this,
let's,
let's do something for the next.
Let's try this.

197
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:54.880
So she said,
we'll take a shot at.
So I just did it on Spec.

198
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.220
I walked in and I knew it.

199
00:11:57.221 --> 00:12:01.990
There was something there and I played it for them and they said,
you know,
we'll,

200
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:06.670
we'll give you a $4,000 for the song.
And I said,
okay.

201
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.060
I hired a right then and there you said,
okay.
Right then and there.
Oh yeah.

202
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:11.650
No lawyer or nothing.
Dot.

203
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.580
I didn't ask any questions at $4,000 who's eight months of rent.

204
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.980
So I um,
when I hired a lawyer,
ultimately I needed a lawyer,

205
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.610
studio engineer,
Singer,
drummer,
producer,
et cetera.

206
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.650
It costs me $4,800 to do this song.

207
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.030
But every team that came into Madison Square Garden said,

208
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.350
why don't we have a theme so this and the next got hot and it became the number

209
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:38.800
one most requested song,
that little jingle on New York radio.

210
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.550
And I realized like that's the white space.
Nobody else is know.

211
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.830
Everyone's trying to get on MTV and get their records and tower records.
But no,

212
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.380
there's a category,
a new category that I can create sports,

213
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:54.220
music and I started doing theme songs for professional sports teams.
Yeah.

214
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.180
It's so awesome.
Like it's just such a great story of just like a kid,

215
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.740
basically a kid just like it over look,
just get out there and do something.

216
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.410
It's kind of a kind of a beautiful thing.
You must look at it back.

217
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:06.550
I can see sort of in your face,

218
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:10.120
like there's like a nostalgia to it cause it was just like I was what it was.

219
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.210
I look at it from that chapter of my life where I had 21 years old.
I,

220
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.120
there were no consequences.
Like if I didn't get this song,

221
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:20.710
I would have gotten to the next team and kept,

222
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.670
I was so deeply connected to my dream,

223
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.150
like emotionally connected to the goal that I would,

224
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.840
I was on greyhound bus every day drive.
I mean I would do anything.

225
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:36.520
So just to have the opportunity that it was just everything else was gravy.

226
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.900
Yeah.
So is that really where the entrepreneurial spirit started with you?

227
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.500
Because it seems like you've got that going and then that opened up a whole slew

228
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:49.000
of other doors that opened up the flood gates for some big,
for some big futures,

229
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.550
you know,
successes and failures.
But,

230
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:54.730
and I was thinking about this actually yesterday on a run,
you know,
I used to,

231
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:56.800
you'll probably remember,
I don't know if you're into tennis,

232
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.440
but the US Open was right by,
you know,
you take oh yeah,
flushing.
Yes,

233
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.380
we would just take the train,
you know,
there were no rules.
My,
my parents,

234
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.861
there's almost a home.

235
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:10.210
By eight o'clock at night I would take the train and I remember I would never

236
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:12.490
have a ticket and all I could look,

237
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.400
I would look forward to being able to try to sneak into the u s open.

238
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.810
And I remember though that I've kind of figured out how to sneak into the u s

239
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:23.770
open regularly.
So I would go,
no ticket,
everyone's online.

240
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:28.090
And I would go to like how I went in and then I would walk out and see if I

241
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:32.590
could do it again somewhere else.
And that was really the start of like,

242
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.240
as I look back,
like I just want,
I like challenges.
Yeah.
It doesn't,

243
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.200
does not about anything other than can I figure it out?
And,

244
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.330
and it started for me at an early age and ultimately it gravitate,

245
00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:50.890
you know,
it started to gravitate towards business.
Yeah.
So let's,
let's get there.

246
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.310
So,
okay,
you're making the jingles.

247
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.170
<v 1>Some things happen.
You're obviously making money,</v>

248
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:56.030
probably some serious money for the first time.

249
00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.140
How does this get you to starting incubators and starting these couples?

250
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.940
<v 2>Every team that came into Madison Square Garden say,</v>

251
00:15:03.941 --> 00:15:07.540
why don't we have a song like this who did this?
And I was the guy.

252
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.690
So I started writing all these teams songs and ultimately sold that company to a

253
00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:16.240
public company called SFX.

254
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.570
And the owner of SFX had a timeshare in a private jet and he invited was like 26

255
00:15:21.761 --> 00:15:25.720
years old.
And he invited my partner and I as guests onto his private jet.

256
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.600
And it was like the scene in the wizard of Oz when we walked on the plane,

257
00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:31.780
when everything goes from black and white color,
I walked on the plane,
I'm like,

258
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.180
people fly like this.
And by the time we landed,
my partner turned to me,

259
00:15:37.181 --> 00:15:37.690
he's like,

260
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.680
we've got to start a private jet companies so we can fly around on these planes.

261
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.920
And I was like,
let's do it.
That's hilarious.

262
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.740
And that's literally how we started this company that ultimately be called,

263
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.860
I was called Marquis jet that um,

264
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.340
became the largest private jet car company in the world.

265
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.440
So you were eventually sold the company,
it's called [inaudible].

266
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.450
It was called Marquis jet.
You sold it to a Warren Buffet's yeah,
net jets,

267
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:02.740
which is a Berkshire Hathaway company.

268
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.440
And then so then now you're rolling in bill.
Um,
it was,
it was a change,

269
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.060
definitely a life changing moment for me.
Um,
but again,

270
00:16:13.061 --> 00:16:15.850
I love newness and I was,
uh,

271
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.340
at that time in my life I had just ran a hundred mile run for charity and I gave

272
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:26.140
myself 90 days to train for it.
And during the process of,
of my training,

273
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.280
I discovered coconut water cause I did a lot of research around hydration and

274
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:34.330
nutrition.
If you're going to run 24,
100 miles nonstop,

275
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.010
what do you eat,
what you drink and how many calories you take in.
And um,

276
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.370
you're experimenting with that,
with that now through your new diet,

277
00:16:42.371 --> 00:16:46.540
which are going through.
But I discovered coconut water and which ultimately,

278
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.140
you know,

279
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.350
I fueled me for this race that I completed and when I was done I was like,
man,

280
00:16:50.351 --> 00:16:51.430
this is the fountain of Youth.

281
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.310
This is going to be the next big thing in beverage.
You know,

282
00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:57.760
it's like this is the next orange juice is the next palm.
Wonderful.

283
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.420
And I spent a year traveling the globe trying to figure out how to import

284
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:05.590
coconut water where yours is.
This is a 2007,

285
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.750
2007 so like there money,

286
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.590
<v 1>cause it's not that long ago and yet coconut orders so massive right now.
Right.</v>

287
00:17:11.591 --> 00:17:13.380
You'd think this would have to be 25 years ago.

288
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.470
<v 2>Right.
But in 2007 it wasn't even on the show.</v>

289
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:19.990
And there was one skew on the shelf.
Yeah,
it wasn't,
it didn't really exist.
Um,

290
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.960
but I realized that the learning curve,
I got like a nine 80 MSAT.

291
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.560
The learning curve was 1200.
Okay.
All right.
Were them old ones.

292
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:29.740
I should have called you.
I couldn't figure it out,
man.
I'm like,

293
00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:31.000
I know I can market this,

294
00:17:31.001 --> 00:17:34.450
but like I don't know how I'm going to import this as so many moving pieces.

295
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.020
So I ended up partnering with the company that was uh,
you know,

296
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.620
on the scene called Zico,
just doing a couple of million dollars in sales.

297
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.140
And then ultimately two years later we sold it the coke.

298
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.760
<v 1>So then,
then you're really in the business world.</v>

299
00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:50.010
Like at that point you've two companies

300
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.420
<v 2>and,
and your role and how do you then go,
all right,
I like newness.</v>

301
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.070
What's new after this?
Um,
cause that's when your story seems to be,

302
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:02.040
it's just like another,
what's new,
what's new,
what's new,
what's new.

303
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.530
But I get bored easily and I just,
you know,

304
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.590
I believe in checking the box and like not celebrating what happened,

305
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:13.950
happen,
what's next.
And you know,
my whole thing,
I always talk about this,

306
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:16.260
it's just about building my own personal life resume,

307
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.860
not even my business resume.
And Like I love adventure.

308
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:23.820
So I was just looking for,
you know,
whatever that next opportunity was.

309
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:28.560
And it became,
it was not for me at,
in the timeline of my life.

310
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.000
The next thing was a book,
but it wasn't planned.
It wasn't planned.
Let's,

311
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:36.060
let's talk about that book a little bit before we get to this book.
Yeah.

312
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.040
I was at a,
uh,
at a race,
a 24 hour race.
I love endurance.

313
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.320
I participate in a lot of endurance events and um,
the race was,

314
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.240
was a really,
really format.

315
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:52.740
So I was with five friends and each runs a mile and you rotate and whatever team

316
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:56.940
runs the most amount of miles in 24 hours wins the competition.

317
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.610
But at the start of the race,
there was a guy sitting next to us,

318
00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:01.680
had no one to really with,
he had no teammates.

319
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.390
He was his own team and he weighed like 285 pounds,

320
00:19:05.391 --> 00:19:09.570
just big African American guy just sitting in a chair.
And I'm thinking myself,

321
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:15.050
how in the world is a guy that weighs two 85 going to run for 24 straight hours?

322
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.300
And the race was on,
are you even allowed?
They let you run a relay.
One guy.

323
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.180
You were just like the only solo you know,
by himself.
And it was just like,

324
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.210
and I was just so big and intimidating and the race was unsupported.
So they,

325
00:19:28.211 --> 00:19:32.370
they provide nothing.
It was on a dirt one mile,
unlit parking lot.

326
00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:35.310
And you had to even bring their own water.
I mean they gave you nothing.

327
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:40.200
So I had just sold my company.
I like,
I went crazy on our side.
I as a Seuss's,

328
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.190
a table fell off like 10.
This guy had three items,

329
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.050
a box of crackers,
a fold up chair and a bottle of water.
And I was like,

330
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.580
man,
have this isn't gonna work out well.
And sure enough that mouth 70 he,

331
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:57.660
because of his weight,
he had broken multiple bones in both of his feet.

332
00:19:57.661 --> 00:20:00.210
He crushed the bones in his feet.
He's from just the pounding,

333
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:04.050
cause he was just so big and because he only had water and crackers,

334
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.230
he had kidney failure and he was peeing blood down his leg.

335
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.150
And my first reaction is,
man,

336
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:13.680
but we've got to get this guy a medic immediately like air lift him out of here

337
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:18.600
to a hospital.
But what did he do?
He gets out of the chair,

338
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.740
picks himself up,

339
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.690
runs another 30 miles to get to his goal of a hundred and then runs one more in

340
00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:28.080
case they miscounted.
And I immediately was like,
man,
I gotta,

341
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.480
I gotta meet this guy,

342
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.660
I got to meet him because whatever secrets sauce he has,

343
00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:37.230
like whatever drive he has to get them out,
get them out of the chair.

344
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.890
You don't even get a ribbon for affinity.
Like they'd like pat you on the back.

345
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:44.580
Good job.
There's no trophy.
You don't get extra crackers.
No,

346
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.090
this is like you go home and that's that.
Whatever got him out of the chair.

347
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.250
If I could teach that to my kids,

348
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.170
if I could apply that drive to the multiple buckets of my life,

349
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.730
then all the areas of my life would be so much better.
So I ended up calling,

350
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.280
you know,
googling,
I'm fanning out,
he was a navy seal.

351
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.180
I cold called them and we sat down for lunch and I realized I would never get

352
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:10.360
the secret sauce in a lunch meeting and just ask them like,

353
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.130
would you come live with me for a month?
And he said to me,
um,

354
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.590
basically direct quote,

355
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.820
if you're crazy enough to ask a guy like me to come live with you mother Fucker,

356
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:25.240
I'm crazy enough to come.
And that was the start of our journey.

357
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.940
So you've spent how much time?
I spend a month.

358
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.530
He came and moved into with my wife,
Sarah,
myself.

359
00:21:31.531 --> 00:21:33.820
And at the time my son had one child,

360
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:38.350
we should mention his name because let's give them the credit.
David Goggins,

361
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.700
David Goggins,

362
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:44.701
he's an amazing human and American and I'm with an amazing story.

363
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.690
Came and live with my wife and I and my son for a,
for 30 days.

364
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.360
What did your wife think about this?
Oh,

365
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.330
I'm bringing a navy seal and for a month she called me after the lunch meeting

366
00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:57.940
and she said,
you know,
how did it go?
And I said,

367
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.500
very quickly isn't on live with us.
You know what I know,

368
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:05.470
like got into a big fuss.
I said,
no,

369
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:09.790
he's actually sweeties coming to live with us on Friday.
And um,
no,

370
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:11.860
I mean she wants,
he came in,

371
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.730
they immediately took to each other and um,

372
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.820
it was just an amazing journey and I never thought the notion of writing a book

373
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.380
never crossed my mind.
In fact,
the book came out,

374
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:28.590
the book living with a seal came out five years after he actually lived with us.

375
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.710
Um,
because as I started to put some of the tools that I,

376
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.940
I learned and what I learned about myself and about his mindset into action and

377
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:42.640
share with others,
I was like,
Whoa,
there's a,
there's something here.

378
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.060
And that sort of how it came to fruition.
Yeah.
Let's explore some of that stuff.

379
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:48.040
So he gets to your house first day,
like,

380
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:51.370
did you have a plan or were you just like,
take over man,
you got a month?
Like,

381
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.560
make me better.
I said to him,

382
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:56.560
make yourself at home is the first thing I said to him.
And I said,
you know,

383
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.310
our home is your home and you walked right over to me and he said,
I,

384
00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:04.900
I don't have a home.
As I know,
make yourself at home is just an expression.

385
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.200
And again,
he got a little closer,
like nose to nose.
And he said,

386
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.110
I don't operate in expressions as like,
oh,
gay,

387
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.080
great little grape,
30 day house guests.
And he said,
in fact,
get your stuff on.

388
00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:18.430
Let's go see where you're at.

389
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:20.860
Physically would go down to the gym so I can map out the month.

390
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.010
And when he came and lived with us at that time in my life,

391
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:27.610
I was in a great spot.
You know,
I was married,
I'm still married,
um,

392
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.580
had had a child and now for had some failure,
had some success,

393
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:37.120
but I was in,
I thought I was in a really good spot,
but like so many of us,

394
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.960
I was in a routine and I was really comfortable in my routine.

395
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:44.890
My routine was get up,
workout hard,
go to work all day,
come home,

396
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:49.040
have dinner with my wife and child,
little bit alone time repeat.

397
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.710
And like,
I thought I was operating up here,

398
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.340
but I was so comfortable I couldn't get out of it.

399
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.030
And like you routines are great,
but they can also be a Rut.

400
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.840
Like I realized like I don't wanna fucking go through life like this.

401
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.980
Like I'm gonna go through life like this.
I got to get out of my routine man,

402
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:10.700
otherwise I'm going to wake up and it'd be 70 so you think that that routine,

403
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.580
even when it's all going well and it sounds like things were going pretty well

404
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:15.140
for you,
that no matter what,

405
00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:19.490
that that level of routine will automatically stifle creativity without question

406
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.630
and,
and time goes fast.
Like I have four kids,

407
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:25.250
I want to slow the clock down.
Yeah.

408
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.810
And if I'm in a routine and you're in routine,
you miss a lot of opportunities,

409
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:32.900
at least for me,
that's the way I found my life to unfold.

410
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.890
And I feel like when I step out of routine,
you know,

411
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:40.880
when I go into the unknown,
that's where amazing growth happens.

412
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.900
And that's where I feel most alive.
And that's where I get the most benefit.

413
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.050
And that's why as a check the box and move on mentality.

414
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:53.180
And that's what this opportunity was for me.
Nothing other than to,
you know,

415
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:58.100
to step into the unknown.
He represented unknown and a,

416
00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:01.420
and a little bit of secret sauce.
So we'd go down on my gym and you know,

417
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.940
he's like,
let me see how many posts you can do.
So I got up and I,
you know,

418
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.720
I can run pretty far in a circle or a straight line for a long time,

419
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:13.280
but not really strong.
So I did like a like eight pull ups,

420
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:18.730
which is an exaggeration for like four pole to pole to full up.

421
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.920
And then he started wait 30 seconds and do it again.

422
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.120
So I got back on the bar and I did again,
like one or two or something,
you know,

423
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.460
barely said,
wait 30 seconds,
I want you to do it again.
And now,
like my arms are,

424
00:25:30.461 --> 00:25:34.430
you know,
I can get back on the barn.
I'm trying to get my chin up over the bar.

425
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.360
And I dropped down and I started,
well,
what's next?
And he said,
well,

426
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:42.170
what's next is we're not leaving here until you do a hundred more Jesus Christ.

427
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.820
And I said,
like,
that's impossible.
I can't do a hundred and he said to me,

428
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.180
well,
I already know what your biggest problem is,

429
00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:53.660
but probably what all of our biggest problem is.
And he said,

430
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:57.830
I'm the limitations that you're putting on herself that we put on ourselves are

431
00:25:57.831 --> 00:26:00.290
self imposed and I'm going to prove it to you.

432
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.190
So get back up on fucking bar and give me a pull up.

433
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.960
So I did a pull up and I dropped down and I repeated that process until I did

434
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.470
all a hundred holy.
And I realize it took,
it took like two hours.

435
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:17.471
But I realized that that moment that if I'm under indexing by a hundred pull

436
00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:21.890
ups,
like what are the areas of my life and my under indexing it,
you know,

437
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.990
am I under indexing at work with my wife and my relationships?
Am I comfortable?

438
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:28.340
Am I in this routine?
I mean,

439
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.590
I just didn't want to go to that place of pain to see what I was really made of.

440
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:39.130
And that started our journey and that was a constant theme of like how far can

441
00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:42.560
you take this Jesse?
Like,
you know,
why are you holding yourself back?

442
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:46.830
And not just physically but in,
in everything and work.
Okay,

443
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.150
you've had some success,
but how do you know your limits?

444
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.350
It's like when I started running,
my goal was drawn two miles.

445
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.380
If I could run two miles in 18 minutes,

446
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.680
I consider myself a runner and that was it.
And I worked hard to get,

447
00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.310
took me weeks to go from the couch to those two miles.

448
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.770
There's a lot of people with a gun to their head.

449
00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:12.630
They can run two miles right now.
Nothing changed in my body since then.
Same leg,

450
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:15.630
same lungs.
God gave me saying I'm not really strong,

451
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.910
but I was able to take that same body guy gave me from two miles and ultimately

452
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:23.430
take it to a hundred miles without stopping.

453
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:27.660
And the only thing that changed was what I thought I could do.

454
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:33.190
So if I was under indexing 50 x in that area again,

455
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.160
what am I limits and business?
What am I limits in my life?

456
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:42.360
Resume and how I live my life and what am I limits and how deep my relationships

457
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:47.361
can be and what am I limits in how much I can learn and we're travel or

458
00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:48.324
anything.
Yeah.

459
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.260
So I think it's probably easy for people at some level to understand the

460
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:56.580
quantifiable stuff.
I can run faster,
I can lift more,
that kind of stuff.

461
00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.490
Could you talk about it sort of on the mental side,
on the relationship side?

462
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:04.490
Like how do you actually judge what are the right ways to spread yourself in

463
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:07.500
those areas?
Sure.
Well,
I mean I think that,
I think for me,

464
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.190
I think a lot of people,
and we think about relationships,

465
00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:13.230
we think of relationships between people.

466
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.060
How was your relationship with your parents or your child or your husband or

467
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:19.200
wife or whatever it is.

468
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.880
And I think one thing that's often very neglected is our relationship with time

469
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.960
and talked about quantifiable stuff.

470
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.900
And I'm very aware of my relationship with time.

471
00:28:30.901 --> 00:28:34.080
That's been a fundamental shift for me over the last couple of years.

472
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:38.490
And maybe cause I've turned 50 but I was recently on a,
on a camping trip.

473
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.480
You look like you're 28 he's doing something right.
I don't know man,

474
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.010
it's the long island jeans.

475
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.560
But I was recently on a camping trip and I was with a friend of mine as a police

476
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.260
officer and stuff that county,
county.
He had his daughter,

477
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:55.830
I had my son and we went on and on a cold winter,

478
00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:00.780
Mount Washington lizardy outdoor,
sleeping in the snow camping trip.

479
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:05.490
And I turned to him,
I said,
Kevin,
how often did you trip do trips like this?

480
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:08.250
And this is a guy that's a police officer,
you know,

481
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.330
one of the happiest guys I know,
probably not super well off.
I mean,
you know,

482
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.070
blue collar guy,
extremely happy.
And he says,
I take,

483
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.030
he said every year I take one trip a year with my college friends.

484
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:22.500
I've been doing it to some 21 years old.

485
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.730
Then every other month I take a trip with my family or myself.

486
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.560
It could be running a marathon,
it could be go to the lake,

487
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:32.700
it could be go on a hike,
whatever.
And I said to myself,
if I can't take,

488
00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:33.780
I call it Kevin's rule,

489
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:39.230
one weekend every eight weeks for my own adventure with my family,

490
00:29:40.171 --> 00:29:43.030
with friends.
And it doesn't have to be something that costs a lot of money.

491
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:46.210
But if I can think five or six of those a year,

492
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.990
then I'm way out of balance.
So it might not be a direct answer to your question,

493
00:29:51.991 --> 00:29:55.690
but what I'm saying is,
you know,
you,
you could in the past,

494
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.890
maybe that would be one or two times a year and I wouldn't even be aware of it.

495
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.670
But once you become aware of it,
look over the next 30 years,

496
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.960
you're talking about 150 memories.
You know,

497
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:11.740
it's all cumulative as opposed to maybe 2030 memories.

498
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.280
That's the difference of like a really full life.

499
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.460
It could be at the end of the day with no regrets,

500
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:24.190
with no regrets versus someone that's in their routine going through life like

501
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.180
this.
And then you wake up and you're 75 and you're like,
fuck,

502
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.020
I don't have the energy to go to Mt.
Washington anymore.
I don't have my son.

503
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.130
My kids are grown up.

504
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:39.030
So those kinds of shifts are measurable and I can pinpoint an end time,

505
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.270
I can pinpoint into my relationship with my wife and just Friday night dinners,

506
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:48.040
Wednesday night,
date night.
It's just what's your relationship with time?

507
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:49.090
How do you spend it,

508
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.210
who do you spend it with and are you doing the things you love to do?

509
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:57.260
<v 1>Yeah.
Well that's definitely a good segue to living with monks so quickly though.</v>

510
00:30:57.261 --> 00:31:00.440
Do you have some of those people in your life where Kevin just said about

511
00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.330
reconnect with the high school friends and that,

512
00:31:02.331 --> 00:31:06.560
cause I find now a couple of my most valuable relationships that I have right

513
00:31:06.561 --> 00:31:10.100
now are with one of them's Mike Trout who'd best friends since um,

514
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.480
since we were four years old,

515
00:31:11.481 --> 00:31:14.230
I remember meeting the guy and in kindergarten we are,

516
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:17.180
I think maybe it was the day before kindergarten and then another friend from

517
00:31:17.181 --> 00:31:20.840
third grade.
And we've stayed connected.
And because of that,

518
00:31:20.841 --> 00:31:25.460
it helps me frame the future because we've been having these same conversations

519
00:31:25.461 --> 00:31:28.850
about love and life and sports and politics forever.

520
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.000
And it's like watching us all,
you know,
one of them lives in jersey,

521
00:31:32.001 --> 00:31:36.200
ones in Texas,
and I'm here in La.
And yet our journeys,

522
00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.290
they still matter to each other.
So I think it helps like set the future sort of.

523
00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:44.950
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm fortunate that I do.
Uh,
I'm so,
you know,</v>

524
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.770
so still have the same high school friends and friends from my neighborhood when

525
00:31:48.771 --> 00:31:52.690
I grew up,
still super close too.
And I think you're right.
You know,

526
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.700
we're so lucky to have that and uh,
it's,
you know,

527
00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.260
it's still a big part of my life that those relationships and also,
you know,

528
00:32:00.261 --> 00:32:04.490
they can relate to the backstory very often.

529
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.890
If I meet someone now they know Jessie had 50,

530
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.880
they don't know Jesse at six and Roz and little league and they don't know
Jesse,

531
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.230
you know,
you know,

532
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.600
<v 1>we,
we probably are,
you're a couple of years older than you guys can say.</v>

533
00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:16.190
We probably played little league against each other,

534
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.530
but you've got a couple of years out.

535
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:22.040
<v 2>Right,
right,
right.
But same,
same thing.
Handling.
Yeah.
Um,
so I agree with you.</v>

536
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.530
I agree with you and,
but,
you know,
I,

537
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:29.750
I think all of my friends from high school and even college,

538
00:32:29.751 --> 00:32:34.370
and even today,
I mean,
they invest time and keeping those relationships.

539
00:32:34.371 --> 00:32:35.170
So,

540
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.270
and you can do it easily now through Facebook and social media and this kind of

541
00:32:38.271 --> 00:32:41.600
stuff,
but often we don't.
But I'm,

542
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:45.810
I'm fortunate that my group of friends,
we do,
you know,
we had for awhile,

543
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.070
we had a newsletter that we put together for each other.
And,
um,

544
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.990
it makes me smile just thinking about it now,
you know what I mean?
Uh,

545
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.210
just feel really lucky.
