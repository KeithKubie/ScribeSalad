Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello freak bitches. This fights about to go down. [inaudible] what do you think Eddie? Bravo initial thoughts. I don't know. Does Luke Rockhold get the same guy after getting CalEd by Bisping? It's a hard, hard one to call. Been a long time outside the octagon. Jim Norton, what do you think? You're the host of UFC uncensored on taking David Branch. Woo new Yorker goes to the new Yorker, David Branch moving towards him, dropping some shots. Luke Rockhold is got a powerful left kick. Yeah, strong left kick. And he landed at a few times to the body already. It's a legit kick and he catches you with it way outside. And Luke Rockhold super hard to take down. He trains all the time with Daniel Cormier. [inaudible] and Cain Velasquez. He's got all these monster wrestlers over there. How be you've never got mad off and you think branch wants to take him down? He might.

Speaker 1:          00:50          He's got a very good ground game. He sends a black spinning sidekick. Kayla finish. Is that? No, he got wheel kicked in the head by [inaudible] Belfort and then he got um, uh, Chris Weidman tried to wheel kick him and he took Weidman to the ground and beat the fuck out of him. And that was the beginning of the end right there. It was crazy cause up until that, it was like a really competitive fight. Branches Cirque doing a good job of circling to his leftover boy that left kick. He's not old, but he landed it right there. Branch is doing a real good job. Oh he's, he's putting Rockhold in danger and Rockhold he teed off on him. Oh my God. Rockwell is in trouble. This is a real fight and he's, Oh my God, he's taking Rockhold down. That's how you know Rocco's in big trouble.

Speaker 1:          01:36          I brought you super hard to take down, should have stayed standing AB, but he lets him know you can take them down. God damn, this is legit. And he just looked over at his friend and waved and said I'm okay. Or his coach his corner. But it didn't look okay. He got hit with bombs, man. You never, okay. When you get hit with those kinds of bombs, you might not have gone out, but you're not okay. She's a fucking ham. I may so much different than boxing. These two fights. Highlight it like you do. You guys barely know who Mike Perry is, right? Yeah. But meanwhile, he's so invested in that fight. Chaos. Right? And this fight, this is fucking chaos in so many different ways. One 18 to one 10, I'm not going to let's get a room or a fucking weekend. Adelaide Burj is a very nice lady. I can't say anything terrible, but that's where it is.

Speaker 1:          02:27          She's always very pleasant. She always waves and says hello. I mean just cause I don't think I agree with her in boxing. Yeah. Not mad at lady. Do judges get removed for poor officiating to good questions that ever happened? Well, back in the old days, the Nevada state athletic commission wasn't being run very well. Um, Bob Bennett, the guy who runs it now as an animal, he's, he's on the ball. He's really good. And he's really smart and he's just a real easy guy to talk to too. And you know he wants to commission though. Right now he's Devonish date at same. Same. It's the same thing. Yeah, he's, yeah. He handles all that stuff, so most likely he'll probably be looking into that. That's, do they ever get booted though? If it's not corruption, if they literally just think this guy sucks and making decisions, do they ever get kicked out?

Speaker 1:          03:11          Like you've fucked up too many times? It's a good question. I don't know enough about boxing about, I know when there's a bad decision and I know names that I keep hearing, but it's not like I know a MMA judges that was a T. that's a disgraceful score. Disgraceful. I agree. And has she had an another? Yeah, they're just terrible decisions in terms of what I think about the call. Ooh, look out for the Nissan I, he's trying to trip branch down. Luke Rockhold super strong, super strong. Top game branch might be fade and had been here. Nope. Branch still looking at wings, some shots. One of the things that branch thought was a big factor in this fight was his boxing, but he's got to avoid those kicks. Especially the left one man, the left one's the big one for Rocco and he'll do it off the switch.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Ooh, that's a nice bright light kick. He'll do it off the switch and he's got a nasty question. Mark kick is question Mark kick is what he used to crack Bisping with cause he hits you with the body shots like over and over and over again, and then he gets your reaching. So he throws one like this to the body and then at the last minute he whips it around over the top. He's nasty with that. Really good with that. It's like one of his best techniques that in his left power kick that left power kick to the body. It's just so good. He stopped Casa Philipo with that left body kick as well. Oh, we went jumping round, kicking. Nice straight left. He said, no, no, no, no. He certainly looks like he recovered. Yeah, he recovered for sure. Oh, he just clipped David Branch with a right hook. Look, Rockhold does not want to go out like that. Bisping fight. See, here's the clinch, what you're talking about. Yeah. See, it's just way harder to pull off. This is too much scrambling in MMA and looking for take downs and stuff. Look at that. Recruit crock hold, get in the back, get in the back. Oh shit. David Branch almost goes down. Oh, Luke Rockhold on top. Very dangerous on top. Super strong and branch is tired as fuck man.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Rockhold looks like a surgeon here. Branch is doing a good job at protecting them. One thing Rockwell has got to watch out for is his legs. What branches from the Henzel Gracie school? What's his motive and put him up against the cage. When he's smashing a wall, they can't move. He wants to just hold them somewhere. Ooh, look up. Not makeup dude. What do that shit [inaudible] yeah, just smash them. Rockhold came on strong towards the end of that round. There's nothing more claustrophobic than washing that when someone's mushed up against the cage like that. A a, it could be a Johnson fight. That's probably the most claustrophobic I've ever been watching your fight. That was one of the worst ones over. There's an a to smashing a guy against that fence for sure. Keeping him there and land in shots and wearing them out and just smashing them.

Speaker 1:          05:55          It takes you back to when you're 10 years old. That's how I got beat up when I was a kid. Like you're just helpless in a corner. Dude. That happened to me when I was 14 that's why I started wrestling. This guy took me down in the locker room and he was like gonna punch me in the head, but he decided not to because it was so easy for him to take me down. He just grabbed me in a headlock. I didn't even know if we were fighting. Like I didn't know what was going on. Like we were looking at each other and he was talking some shit and I wasn't exactly sure like what we're going to do and then all of a sudden we were grabbing each other and he just got me in a headlock and threw me on the ground and held me there and could easily punch my face in.

Speaker 1:          06:28          To this day I owe him a debt of gratitude. Changed your life. He did change my life cause he made me realize like, Oh my God. And then I had a friend, my friend Steven Arduino, he was a wrestler in high school and I was already doing uh, martial arts then and I just had no idea how easy it was for someone to take me down. And we went outside, we went outside on the grass and it was like, I could take you down easy. I was like, no, you can't. And he's like, boom. I was like, fuck that. Try again. Boom. I was like, Oh my God, I got to start wrestling. So those two events led me to wrestling class in high school and I was terrible. I was probably one of the worst wrestlers in high school history. I got one one take down.

Speaker 1:          07:07          I would never take anybody down. I was always afraid that I was going to catch a knee in my teeth. So I would just brawl on dudes that took down. Oof. They tried to take me down. That was my game plan. But regular people, when I'd get in a fight, I would take them down and I always felt like I was cheating, but I didn't care cause you use wrestling. I go, you know what? I don't give a fuck if someone fucks with me. I'm a double leg. Um, and then I'd get like twister cyclotron punch their stomach. I did that to a soccer player. He was talking shit in school and um, I took him down. [inaudible] think that it would be cheating. I thought it was, I didn't think it was real fighting back then. So when I saw hoists, when I saw hoists and nosy too, I'm like, Oh shit, you could take dudes down and fight.

Speaker 1:          07:45          That's, that's legit. He's hurting that leg. By the way. Rockhold is really hurting that leg. Bolt guys are hurting the legs. Rockhold has been landed. A bunch of hard leg kicks on branch two. This is a serious fight. No, that's what I mean. He's been, he's been hurting branches like, Oh yeah, but rock holds her to men. This is a, this is a real fight. Very good fight. Is it funny now? Like a fight where two guys take each other down. It's like totally standard. Like you had no kids today would ever think that would be cheating. Like that's how you fight motherfucker. If someone takes someone down like Oh shit, ground and pound kids know the moves so I can draw. Oh you guys I see fight videos. Just street five videos where someone takes him down and they tap like that's like the understood moving now.

Speaker 1:          08:26          That's hilarious. But it, look, if people can tap in street fights, the world would be a better place. Yeah. Because if somebody leaves you alone after you tap and they let it alone, like you two guys agree to fight and then someone taps in there, the guy respects the tap. That's good. That will, that opens. Yeah. I hope it does. I hope it happens more often. I guess it all depends on what push your fight to begin with though. Yeah, sure. You're not signing the contracts. I've got fucked your chin. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Boom. And what's some of the craziest shit is girls fighting? Cause it's so primal, especially when they don't know how to fight. And that grabbing hair and just screaming come off a law's wailing at each other. See the thing about Rockhold is he's so used to this shit cause he's in the gym with D C and Kane doing this.

Speaker 1:          09:15          So like there's very few guys, they're going to have the kind of clinch game that Rockhold is going to have and the kind of grappling like grinding skills that Rockhold is going to have because he's been doing it with these fucking monsters. Yeah, I mean Ron was past, he's like, Oh there's a lot of time left to full Mount cha not good for branch. Super bad for branch. Let's see if he gives up his back and trying to get out. That's, that's super dangerous. Don't panic. Let's see if he panics. He's got to figure out a way to defend himself. Oh look at this. He's giving up his back. He's given us back. Give it up his back. It's going to handcuff him. Oh, he got that back. Oh, flat place to base flat. This is terrible branches in a world of shit. Dude. Rockhold does this to everybody, man.

Speaker 1:          10:02          Yeah. He gets on top of you and he just smashes you. It's so impressive. Look at his top-mount. No, he did it to, um, uh, uh, the Odo Leo Machida. Oh, Bryson Futura wheel kicked him in the head. Remember? Oh, that's right dude. Ranches at serious trouble. He's going to flatten them out. That's a serious mountain man. That back Mount is out of control. His Mount and his back Mount or sees his top game. It's just fucking ferocious. Oh, branch has done. He's done. Did the, he's just covering up Dan's give him a lot of chances here, but he's taken a fucking bad beat. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap the strikes.

Speaker 1:          10:44          Tap the strikes. Great fight. Fuck yeah. That was a great fight, dude. Brock holds top game. Might be the best in the fucking division. He might be better than Romero. He might be better bloodshot, right? Yeah. He's a black belt under who? I don't know. I don't know who they're. Um, it's not, um, Oh, it's an AKA Dave camera. Rio Cameleo. How long has he been find out? It's forever. Was still in AKA? No, I think, but a lot of guys train with them still. A lot of guys still go over there. Yeah, we'll throw it to somebody. That's a joy. Would you suck on that? No, I wouldn't. Would you put it in your mouth? No, I wouldn't. Girls would. Some girls would. Some girls want to get pregnant with that. Spit get you pregnant. I used to depend on the fighter.

Speaker 1:          11:36          Boom. I got a text message from Vinny Shoreman fucking Adelaide bird. Again, a lot of people are aware that Allie birds does know the best decisions. Boom, boom, boom, boom. She's trending. Jamie knows who's trending. Would you ever know who's trending? Never. Not. You never. Would you ever had any idea ever who's trending or was that, would you ever have any idea who's trending? No. SAS. Jamie. Oh, that's Justin Bieber's look. Trending. Trending is, he's still on top. Can't you try two different ways to like locally like I've had guys go, dude, you're trending, but I'm not. It's like a fucking local, like in Jersey. I'm trying to compare it to other Jersey people. Nice. Which is, how does that work? How do you, how do you train in Jersey? I don't know. There's a way to do it location wise. Like when it gets your hopes up and utilize all snowing fucking cares.

Speaker 1:          12:24          Luke rock hold put the beat down. But I'll tell you what man, David Branch made it a scrap made a scrap for the beginning till Luke Rockhold wore on him with that pressure, that clench and that wrestling too. I'm telling you man, all those years with Cain and DC, I mean you don't get any better wrestling than that. You don't get any better, more Savage, big giant dudes than those two. Think about it. Olympic class wrestler and the arguably arguably the greatest UFC heavyweight ever. Well who puts, who helps cane like that cause he's obviously he's heavier than [inaudible]. Not much. Not much. DC walks around all the time at two 35 to 40. You know, he'll, he even said he was feeling kind of slim like this time after the fight. You know, we did commentary last weekend and he said, uh, he was a, usually he'd be at like two 35 by now, but uh, he was lighter than that.

Speaker 1:          13:18          I think you'd be like two 15 or two 20 or something like that. But he'll get up to two 35 so he canes two 40 so in there, in the neighborhood of each other, like five pounds difference with a world-class grappling like those two guys have. They just go on war constantly. Always a problem though for big guys guys. Two 50 and above finding training partners. Sure. Tough jujitsu schools, man. It's tough. We don't have very many big guys we got right now in my class, I think the biggest guy pro 200 pounds. It's crazy. What a fight man. Huh? I'm not crazy Luke Rockhold I'll tell you dude, when that guy gets people down, they're not getting up. He has one of the best fucking top games.

Speaker 1:          14:05          You don't see a lot of tap outs due to strikes. A lot of people don't do it. They don't believe in it. A lot of people have said that like that's a bitch move. I don't think it is even even a little bit. I think it's a smart move when you're getting hit and you're getting fucked up and you know you're not going to recover, you know, and the fights over does no need to take extra shots if you know that you're done, just tap. But it's seen as a bitch. They see fighters say this. Well a lot of people like George Saint Pierre. That's one of the things that BJ Penn was taunting him about how he tapped his strikes against Matt. When Matt beat him, Matt beat the shit out of him and clipped him with a big right hand early gun on top of him, banged out and then GSP tapped strikes and BJ was like, I would never tap the strikes, but really maybe some of those career fights he should have. You know, you got nothing left. Why not? Yeah, I'm going to get

Speaker 2:          14:54          the more you still can get out of what is my client. This is my fight and I'll be there soon.

Speaker 1:          15:03          Okay. That sounds a bit, I don't know. That's some bad trash. Again, it's a, it's Bisbing cause he's saying it's his fight. I think he feels he should be fighting for the belt nuts. GSP. Yup.

Speaker 2:          15:14          Yeah. I want to be patient. Like I said,

Speaker 1:          15:18          Oh man. You getting credit for taking that and, and so I in the first round, yeah, he was in trouble, dude. He was in trouble for sure. That Thai clinch stopped the strikes. Yep. This, this is what stops everything, man. His fucking smush game. Look at that step over Mount may no resistance. And getting that Mount, he just overwhelmed. Branch branches couldn't keep up that pace. You know, Luke rock holds, I mean, he's the reason why he was the champ. He's fucking world-class

Speaker 2:          15:45          in November,

Speaker 1:          15:47          November Madison square garden.

Speaker 2:          15:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:51          wow. He's so, he's telling GSP to back out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          16:01          [inaudible].
