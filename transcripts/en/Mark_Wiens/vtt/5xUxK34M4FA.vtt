00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.800
It's about your 7am. We are flying on Thai airways from Bangkok to Manila

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.330
This is Micah's first flight.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.830
Micah

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.740
You excited to travel for the first time?

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.240
Oh

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.439
Since we got an early morning flight. They're serving us breakfast on a flight.Croissant on the top there, some orange juice

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.819
This is what is this the yogurt?

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.549
And then we've also got some fruit and then my main

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.609
in the main Dish I got there the

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.399
should be an omelet and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.089
Also, A

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.089
sausage in here

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.010
Oh, yeah, that is very simple-looking

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.050
triangle

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.439
a tail of an animal

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.870
Oh a shark fin. This is like a shark fin of a piece of omelette

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.169
It's actually kind of juicy

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.130
Let me get a bite of that that sausage here. Oh wow, that is erm

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.450
It takes a little bit of pressure to puncture that the bounciness of that sausage

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520
And with some egg

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.970
Come on!

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.620
It's okay. Thank you

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.690
We should have about two more hours left on this flight until we land in Manila

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.309
travelling with a baby is much different than traveling without a baby, but apart from

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.989
semi emergency diaper change right at the beginning of the flight

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.210
Everything went really smoothly. I think Micah is a traveler

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.960
I've Visited manila. I've been to the philippines, maybe three or four times

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.210
But I've always had complications making videos like a last time my camera broke

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.639
So I am ready to be here. I'm ready to [eat] and hopefully no

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.339
Mishaps with the [camera], but anyway

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.990
I just wanted to give you a really quick update about my Youtube channel and the videos you can expect to see

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.720
About a year and a half ago

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.099
that was back... when was that Ying?  back in 2015

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.060
I think end of 2015

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.560
Ying and I took a trip to Bhutan

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.809
 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.070
And it was an amazing trip.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.459
It was an amazing opportunity to visit Bhutan and

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.330
I had

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.160
promised that I would be publishing a bunch of videos for you from Bhutan

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.479
But unfortunately due to the circumstances all the videos that I made had to be pre-approved

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.049
Before I could post them so I am happy to let you know that they have finally after a year and a half

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.110
they have finally been approved so I can publish the video and so I'm going to

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.580
starting

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.339
Starting right now in the next couple days. I'm going to start to Publish the whole Bhutan series

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.619
There's 20 videos in total and I will be posting a video on Sunday

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.209
on Wednesday

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.269
Friday and Saturday, so for videos per week. It's a bit different and more videos from my normal schedule

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.700
So it's a total of twenty videos. So that will be five weeks of Bhutan videos

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.379
So stay tuned. I think you'll really enjoy the series it is a

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.749
Bhutan is an amazing and enchanting destination, and I think it's very

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.539
Unseen and the food was awesome as [well] by the way. I've never eaten so much cheese in my entire life

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.019
But so that's what's going to happen for the next five weeks

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.980
You'll be seeing Bhutan videos and then after that

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.510
we're going to get straight to Filipino food, so

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.260
Stay tuned lots of videos coming your way

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.440
Thank you [very] much for all your support and for watching

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.450
This is just a quick little video. I wanted to show you mainly Micah's first trip outside of Thailand, and he did extremely well

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.320
And then I wanted to also share with you that I'll be publishing Bhutan video  followed by the philippines

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.400
and

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.310
That's as far as our travel plans go  for now. But hopefully lots of travels coming up

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.089
Thank you again for all of your support and for following and watching

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.229
