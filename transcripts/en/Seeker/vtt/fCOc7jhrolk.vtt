00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.370
The first gas-powered car sped through the
streets of Mannheim, Germany at a blistering

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.370
10 mph.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.419
Today, we can go a LOT faster… so what's
changed?

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.909
Hey motorheads, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.949
Over the last 130ish years, car speed has
come a long way.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.320
As of February 2016, the fastest car you can
buy is the Bugatti Chiron, which is limited

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.810
to 261 miles per hour.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.810
(420 km/h).

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.660
But why is that car faster than yours?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.769
How did we figure out how to make cars go
faster?

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.170
First of all, and it's probably obvious, but
the major reason cars today can move so fast,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.900
is because engines have gotten a lot more
powerful in the last 130 years.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.289
The 1908 Ford Model T had only 22 horsepower
and a top speed of 45 miles per hour (70 km/h).

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.250
But today, a base Honda Accord can easily
clear 100 mph (160kp/h) with almost 200 horsepower!

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.899
Modern cars can pull more power from highly
refined petroleum.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.070
Today's more powerful cars, can push more
mass, more easily.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.719
But it's not that car engines have gotten
more efficient, the Model T only got 3 miles

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.080
per gallon less than the average car today!

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.150
Only 14 to 30 percent of the power from gasoline
combustion is used to pull the car forward;

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.860
most of the energy is lost to heat and friction.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.640
So, to give cars more horsepower engineers
have either added more engine, or reduced

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.900
weight… or BOTH.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.690
It all comes down to the Power to Weight ratio.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.770
That super-fast Bugatti Chiron has 1,500 horsepower,
but needs TWO V8 engines to get that -- that's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.770
a lot of weight.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.180
So, to make the car go fast, they needed to
make it lighter.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.480
The power to weight ratio, is a simple formula…
divide Weight by Power.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.380
Lemme give you an example or three…

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.140
A 1200 pound Model T, has 22 horsepower.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.280
It's weight to power ratio is 54.5 pounds
for every horsepower.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
That's not great.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.280
A 3000 pound 2016 Prius has 121 horsepower
so has a better ratio of 24.8 pounds for every

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280
1 horsepower!

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.610
While the new car does have more power in
a heavier vehicle it is a balance.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.190
By comparison, the Chiron weighs in at 4,400
pounds with 1500 hp: for a ratio of 2.9.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.530
2.9 pounds per horsepower.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.530
That.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.530
Is.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.530
Crazy.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.530
Obviously, it's way fast.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.989
If engineers can get a low weight-to-power
ratio, they'll have a faster car.

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.409
But to MAKE a car with a heavy engine have
less weight ain't easy.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.459
Ford mixed the steel on Model Ts with the
element Vanadium to try and make it lighter;

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.420
engineers still do stuff like that today.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.209
The Prius uses aluminum, plastics, and special
high-tensile, high-strength steels.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.359
The Chiron, however, was built with ultra-lightweight
materials like titanium and carbon fiber,

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.519
keeping the weight down even further and making
for an even lower ratio!

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.010
Of course, the Chiron is 100 times more expensive
than a Prius, partly due to that lightweight

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.640
material, so there's that.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.530
Tweaks like these are the reason horsepower
has increased 80 percent from 1980 to 2004…

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.249
but even then, we can only do so much.

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:57.329
If you have a big engine, and a light car,
you can still only make it go so fast.

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.069
And the faster you go, the more air friction
will start to affect top speed.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.469
For this reason, the car that holds the fastest
land speed record in the world -- 763.035

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.079
mph (1227.985 km/h) -- looks NOTHING like
a Chiron, or even a car.

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.249
It looks like a jet, because jets are perfect
for minimizing drag from air.

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:19.969
But basically, for every pound added either
more power has to be coaxed from the engine,

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.920
or a bigger engine has to be built.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.279
The power-to-weight ratio is a delicate balance
even for the muscliest of cars.

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.029
Without understanding it, we'd never have
made cars go fast.

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.029
Sponsor?

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.999
It also takes a lot of effort to keep your
car clean.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.340
Techron by Chevron’s patented Precision
Clean Technology targets and removes deposits

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.560
left by lower tier gasolines.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.060
It bonds with and breaks apart carbon deposits,
more effectively than other additive technologies.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.269
Techron gets into the deepest parts of the
engine, where the most destructive deposits

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.749
built up, and sweeps them away.

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:52.140
No matter how fast we can make cars go, though,
there will always be speed limits holding

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.140
us back.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.140
How we decide speed limits isn't arbitrary
to get me pulled over every other week...

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.709
in fact, there's a ton of research on it!

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.709
I checked!

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:14.049
Take a pitstop and watch here.

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.169
What's your favorite speedy car?

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.420
I always loved the Lotus, any of them.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.870
They're so curvy!

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.161

in your childhood bedroom...and subscribe
