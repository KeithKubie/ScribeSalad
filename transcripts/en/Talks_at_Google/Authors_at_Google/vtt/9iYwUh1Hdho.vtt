00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.260
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
everybody to one more Authors

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.165
at Google talk.

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:09.540
I am glad to see everybody
here with lunch in their hands

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.480
because the topic
will be on food.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.620
So today with us
is Dan Jurafsky.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.670
He is the recipient of
a MacArthur Genius Award

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.050
and professor of Linguistics
at Stanford University.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.850
He lives with his
wife in San Francisco.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.205
Please welcome Dan to Google.

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:28.080
DAN JURAFSKY: Thanks.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.925
Thanks so much.

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:32.000
Great.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.980
Well, thanks so
much for having me.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.396
So I want to talk
about food and I

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:37.490
want to start by talking
about food in America.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.605
So we are an immigrant
nation and you

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.230
can tell that we're
an immigrant nation

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.940
by looking at the
words on our foods.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.930
So the name of our foods like
hamburgers or frankfurter

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.830
or french fries
make it very clear,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.220
our immigrant status and I want
to talk about ketchup, as well.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.240
So those of you
who've been to Europe

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.760
know that there's
Hamburg and that's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.600
where hamburgers come from and
there is Frankfurt and that's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.769
kind of the French region.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.280
French fries are Belgian
but close enough--

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.500
but what about ketchup?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.020
So I want everyone to read
the words below the word Heinz

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.690
on this bottle.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.935
Out loud, please.

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:16.240
AUDIENCE: Tomato ketchup.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.490
DAN JURAFSKY: OK.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.770
Why does it say tomato ketchup?

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.270
Right?

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.470
Ketchup is made of
tomatoes so the fact

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.830
that it says tomato
ketchup tells us something.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.654
There's a linguistic
piece of information there

00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:27.820
which is that it didn't
used to be made of tomatoes,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.736
that the fact that ketchup
is made of tomatoes

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:31.680
is a modern
innovation and I want

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.200
to talk about this
innovation and to do

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.290
so I have to go back a
couple of thousand years

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.850
and imagine that
you're a fisherman.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.200
You're living in Southeast
Asia, what's now southern China,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.980
and you're speaking
a language-- one

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.180
of these ancestral languages,
Mon-Khmer, or Tai-Kadai,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.520
the ancestors of modern
Hmong or modern Vietnamese

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.202
or modern Thai-- and
you're a fisherman

00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:53.660
but what happens
in the dry season?

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.920
All the ponds dry
up and what you do

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.250
is you preserve your fish
in the following way.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.840
You take rice and you
layer it over the fish

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.835
in layers-- rice and salt--
and then you put it in a basket

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:06.460
and you cover the
basket in a big stone

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.270
and you go away for, I
don't know, three months.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.680
And when you come back, the
rice has gotten all goopy

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.030
from lactic acid
fermentation and the acid

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.510
has pickled the fish and
the fish is now preserved

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.010
and it keeps through
the dry season.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.140
And you scrape off the icky,
goopy rice and you eat the fish

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.810
and it tastes kind
of like a modern ham.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.610
And we know all this,
in fact, because back

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.590
in the fifth century, Chinese
ethnographers described

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.612
these strange Southerners and
all of their preserved fishes

00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:39.070
and, in fact,
they're still made up

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.236
in the hill tribes of
Guangxi, in the west of China.

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:43.070
This exact dish is still made.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.640
OK, so then, let's
say, 200 BCE China

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.890
which is, up till now,
been more in the north

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.190
expands into Lingnan, the area
that's now Canton and Fujian

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.270
provinces.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.780
And these locals and all
their fermented seafoods

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.390
get assimilated and some
of them get pushed south,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.610
some get assimilated, and
the foods get assimilated.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.350
And all these
fermented fish dishes

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.090
spread throughout the Chinese
empire and the Chinese sphere

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.830
of influence where, for
example, they go to Japan.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.880
And this dish of
fish and rice that's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.770
let to sit until
everything goes sour

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.080
becomes the ancestor of
the modern dish sushi.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.360
So it's called narezushi,
the ancestor of sushi.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.420
And then slowly,
the dish changes.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.820
So instead of letting the
fish get all lactic acid

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.922
and goopy-- the rice, I
mean-- you use fresh rice

00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:31.630
and you use vinegar
to make the sourness.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.780
And instead of, as
a refrigeration, ice

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.700
and refrigeration
come in, now instead

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.390
of letting the fish be pickled,
you can eat the fish fresh

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.500
because you can preserve
it and our modern dish,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.650
which is a completely different
food-- a very fresh fish

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.070
and very fresh
rice-- is invented.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.020
So we see here's one
descendent of this ancient dish

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.720
and there's lots of
other descendants

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.586
of this ancient
fish-preserving dish.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.710
Ethnic Chinese are
sailing around,

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.680
trading with Southeast
Asia and the stars

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.360
are ethnic Chinese
settlements in Southeast Asia.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.380
And lots of foods come and
go between the ethnic Chinese

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.550
and the people of Southeast Asia
and one of them is fish sauce.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.977
Here's a picture of a
Fujianese fish sauce.

00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:20.560
That's the fish sauce
that we know now

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.650
from Vietnamese
and Thai cooking.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.210
It's a preserved fish.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.880
Lots of other sauces
by the way, so here

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.820
is a sauce made from-- when
you make Chinese rice wine,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.910
you use a kind of red yeast that
converts the starch in the rice

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.410
into sugar.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.570
We can talk about the
chemistry if you want

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.172
but when you finish
making the wine,

00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:42.130
the leftover leaves at
the bottom of the barrel

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.010
can be used to make a
very delicious chicken

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.300
dish, red rice lees chicken.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.670
And over time, with this
trading with Southeast Asia,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.860
you end up with what I
call a fish/soy isogloss,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.670
meaning that south of
this line everybody

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.730
ferments fish products.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.340
And you can see that Southern
China, this Canton and this

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.360
is Hainan Island are part
of this Southern isogloss,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.950
whereas north of this line
people tend to ferment tofu.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.900
Soy products, sorry.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.236
And we end up with various
fermented soy products.

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:20.610
So south of this line you get
things like this fish sauce

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.951
that probably was originally
developed along the Mekong

00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:23.450
River.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.810
This is me in a
fish sauce factory.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.520
These big barrels look like
wine fermentation barrels

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.510
but that's how fish
sauce is fermented.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.190
This is a picture
from my honeymoon.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.720
It was very, very romantic.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.065
OK, so then, now
it's about 1600.

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:41.940
Chinese have spread out
and now the Europeans

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.790
enter the picture.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.870
Europeans are looking for
spices, textiles, porcelain.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.660
This is the age of exploration.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.050
If you will, the Silicon
Valley of Europe at the time--

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.160
the money to be
made was all in Asia

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.887
and so Europeans were all
heading to Asia to make money.

00:05:57.887 --> 00:05:59.470
And imagine that
you're a sailor, now,

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.320
on one of these ships
and you're spending

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.597
nine months on a boat
on the way to Asia

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:04.680
going through the tropics.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.002
It's very hot.

00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:07.460
It's hard to get
fresh water so you

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.736
bring beer and
wine along and hops

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:10.860
have not yet been invented.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.970
Here's a picture of hops.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.810
Hops is a thing you add
to beer that preserves it

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.447
and they haven't
figured this out yet.

00:06:18.447 --> 00:06:20.780
The Dutch have figured out
but the English haven't quite

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.080
got it yet.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.454
The English are
very conservative

00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:24.167
about these things.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:26.250
And so the beer and wine,
they go bad in the heat.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.791
And they get to
Indonesia and they're

00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:31.110
very excited because they
find ethnic Chinese making

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.280
this thing called
Arrack, and Arrack

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.240
is the first commercially
produced distilled liquor.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.414
So distillation
was invented twice

00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:39.580
in the history of the world.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.280
Once by the Arabs,
once by the Chinese

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.196
and there was a kind of
fight about whether it

00:06:43.196 --> 00:06:46.890
was really just once
and got borrowed,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.400
but let's assume twice.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.750
And so these ethnic Chinese
fish sauce and soy sauce makers

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.080
are also distilling
alcohol from palm wine

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.750
and that same red
rice that they were

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.040
making into this lovely
delicious dish-- they were

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.430
distilling that into Arrack.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.530
The word comes from the
Arabic word for sweat

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.680
because, as you probably
remember from high school

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.982
chemistry, you distill
things by boiling things

00:07:09.982 --> 00:07:11.440
and then you put
a pot over the top

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.825
and you let the drops of
the distillate drip off

00:07:13.825 --> 00:07:16.240
and that's your alcohol.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.880
So they're very excited.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.350
The Chinese are
making this Arrack,

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.141
and the thing about
hard liquor like Arrack

00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:24.530
is it doesn't go
bad in the heat.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.410
So they're very excited.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.460
They buy it and if you add
it to water, kills germs.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.620
It's like the perfect medicine.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.600
They're very excited.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.740
And they buy thousands
of barrels of Arrack--

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.180
the British Navy-- and it
becomes the common drink

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.350
of Europeans throughout Asia.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.720
And, in fact, sailors
add limes, which

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.510
they're caring for scurvy,
to this newly bought Arrack

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.220
and that ends up inventing the
world's first cocktail called

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.690
Punch.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.180
So cocktails are invented
at the same time.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.719
So they're buying this liquor
and while they're there

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:53.510
they pick up some
barrels of the local fish

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.520
sauce because why not?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.520
And you're in a boat,
you have lots of room,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.690
you could sell it maybe.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.476
And it turns out that this fish
sauce in one of the Fujianese

00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:04.350
dialects-- Southern Min
is the technical name

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.540
for the family of
Fujianese languages

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.790
and the dialect in the Zhangzhou
region, the word for fish sauce

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.880
is ketchup from an old word
for salted fish that's died out

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.870
and now the word can mean
salmon in different dialects

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.940
and other kinds of fish.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.780
And chiap still means sauce
in various Southern dialects.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.240
So the British buy this fish
sauce, this ketchup-- which

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.180
is what it was called, ketchup--
and they bring it home.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.990
And we know all this because,
in 1703, the British East India

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.980
Company traders, these young men
trying to make their fortune--

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.937
one of them who wrote
the details of his travel

00:08:42.937 --> 00:08:45.020
to what he called India
which is what we would now

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.440
call all of Asia.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.731
He was mostly in what we
now call Southeast Asia

00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:51.730
but he also went to Hong
Kong and he and he also

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.760
went to India.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.540
And he talks about how
important this commodity is,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.930
this ketchup, and here's
how he talks about it.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.140
I'll read it for you just
because the font is very faint.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.720
"Soy comes in Tubs from Japan
and the best ketchup from

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.577
Tanqueen"-- Tanqueen is like
Northern part of Vietnam--

00:09:10.577 --> 00:09:13.160
"yet good of both sorts are made
and sold very cheap in China.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.230
So he talks about how he buys
fish sauce and soy sauce-- fish

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.830
sauce which he calls
ketchup-- in Hong Kong

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.950
and soy sauce in Hong Kong.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.680
And he also says, "I know not
a more profitable Commodity."

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.300
And the reason is this stuff
is an exotic, imported sauce.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.690
He's selling this back in
London, making a lot of money

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.190
at it.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.814
They actually bring
bottles all the way

00:09:32.814 --> 00:09:35.309
to Asia-- empty bottles--
they fill them with fish sauce

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:36.350
and they bring them back.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.183
I don't know why they
don't do it in barrels

00:09:38.183 --> 00:09:39.850
but that's what they did.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.630
So he actually advises young
people who want to go to Asia

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.684
and make their money, make sure
you fill the ship with bottles

00:09:45.684 --> 00:09:46.350
on your way out.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.530
Empty bottles.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.637
It's very interesting.

00:09:48.637 --> 00:09:50.470
Anyway, so you've got
this really expensive,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.730
imported luxury.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.010
So what do you do if you
want to make some money?

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.090
You make knockoffs of this
expensive, imported luxury.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.110
So there are almost immediately
recipes for fake ketchup.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.700
So here's a recipe
for fake ketchup.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.580
It involves beer.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.540
It involves anchovy.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.770
So it's still fish sauce
but there's beer in it

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.960
and it's got what had become
European spices by now.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.250
Cloves, and pepper, and ginger
but it's also got mushrooms,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.140
and shallots.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.810
And you boil it and
you can tell they're

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.919
trying to copy an Asian
sauce because it says,

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:23.210
"This is thought to exceed
what is brought from India."

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.271
Again, India at the
time means Asia.

00:10:25.271 --> 00:10:27.020
So they're trying to
copy this Asian sauce

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.270
and they invent something with
still fishy but other flavors

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.860
and then the recipe
changes over the years

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.990
and they start to add other
ingredients that are salty

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.410
and have glutamates in them
and one of those is walnuts.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.180
So here is, from Jane Austen's
family recipe, actually,

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.510
for walnut ketchup.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.130
So again, it's walnuts and
vinegar and various spices

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.730
and horseradish.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.680
Sounds-- yeah.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.560
So then, about 1800, tomatoes
come from the New World.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.650
So tomatoes are a
Mexican fruit, of course,

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.192
and they come via
Portugal and Spain.

00:10:56.192 --> 00:10:58.275
Eventually they get to
England and eventually they

00:10:58.275 --> 00:10:59.110
come to America.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.010
We didn't get them directly
through from Mexico.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.660
They had to come and
be baptized by Europe.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.400
And the first tomato
ketchups are salty.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.639
They're made with anchovies.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:11.930
So it's tomatoes and anchovies.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.960
It's an anchovy, salty sauce.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.730
Notice that it will
keep for seven years.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.770
So these are preserving methods.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.720
And then our favorite drug
is invented-- not invented,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.670
but it becomes cheaper-- sugar.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.780
Sugar becomes much cheaper and
right around the Civil War,

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.460
the anchovies disappear
and, Especially in the US,

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.480
we start adding a lot
of sugar to this recipe.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.000
The vinegar is still there,
but now instead of salt we

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.700
add sugar and you end up with
our modern tomato ketchup,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.687
which is basically a chutney.

00:11:43.687 --> 00:11:46.270
It's basically a sweet and sour
chutney if you think about it,

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.660
is what ketchup is.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.920
So why am I telling you this?

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:58.780
So one reason is, we think of
ketchup as an All-American food

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.270
but really it's not
just an American food.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.430
It's a world Food.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.949
And the history of how
it became this world food

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:08.240
and all of its cousins-- right.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.300
It's a first cousin once
removed-- twice removed,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.000
maybe-- to sushi and it's
related to fish sauce.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.540
It's to all of these things
and all of these innovations

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.080
were made by individual
chefs who took this food

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.780
and changed something
about it to make

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.980
it conform to their own
particular cuisines.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.320
And if you think about it, a
recipe is just a technology.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:31.820
Right.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.570
These are all people
inventing new technologies

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.130
by going to some
foreign country,

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.640
stealing their technology and
trying to recreate it at home

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.140
and getting it wrong but, in
the process, creating something

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.420
exciting and interesting.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.910
So I call this the ketchup
theory of innovation which

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.830
says, innovation happens
when you borrow and extend

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.594
the ideas of your
neighbors and often, it

00:12:50.594 --> 00:12:52.760
happens because you physically
go somewhere and talk

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.600
to somebody.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.390
And I won't talk
about this but we

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.930
have tons of
research in our lab--

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.888
you can ask me in the
question session-- about,

00:12:58.888 --> 00:13:02.670
for example, how probability
theory entered my field--

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.090
natural language processing.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.140
And it entered because a
bunch of electrical engineers,

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.274
in 1988, went to a
computer science conference

00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:12.690
and presented a bunch of math
and all the computer science

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.148
graduate students
were very excited

00:13:14.148 --> 00:13:15.940
and started borrowing
it and changing it

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.773
and things happened.

00:13:16.773 --> 00:13:19.250
People actually physically
had to go somewhere on a boat

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.770
or in a plane and so that's
how innovation happens.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.400
And there's lots
of other stories.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.910
I won't tell you
lots of all of them

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.570
but you can ask me
the question session.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.135
But one fun thing--
because today

00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:34.380
is both Diwali and
Veteran's Day--

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.061
is the story of how ice cream
comes from military technology.

00:13:38.061 --> 00:13:39.560
And I won't tell
you the whole story

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.726
but you can ask me about it.

00:13:40.726 --> 00:13:42.690
But the short
version of the story

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.140
is that ice cream is a
descendent of gun powder.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.970
Gun powder, which
uses saltpeter,

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.660
which is potassium nitrate, has
interesting cooling properties.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.760
And the reason why we use
the word sherbet, which

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.720
comes from an Arabic
word for drink,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.440
and sorbet-- sorbetto and
sorbet and these words

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.396
is because of the Muslim
history of ice cream

00:14:04.396 --> 00:14:05.770
which you can ask
me about later.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.970
And, in fact, the julep
in mint julep-- julep

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.040
was the old word we used to use
for any kind of sugar syrup,

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.490
and it comes from
the Persian word

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:19.034
for rose water, which is there
in gulan jamun, the desert

00:14:19.034 --> 00:14:19.950
that I pictured there.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.350
So there's all sorts of fun
links I've shown you from China

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.970
but there's lots, also, from
the Middle East and Persia.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.590
All right.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.650
So that's my little
history segment

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.060
and now I want to
talk about identity

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.740
and I have a lovely
photograph staged by my friend

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.620
Stephanie of why potato chips
should be considered a luxury

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.232
food.

00:14:42.232 --> 00:14:44.440
And I'm going to talk about
how potato chip packaging

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.790
words reveal identity,
and this is research

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.760
that I started with a freshman
at Stanford, Josh Friedman, who

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.870
I've shown over
there in the corner.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.130
And I had a freshman class
called The Language of Food

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.550
and the students got interested
in language in different ways

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.980
and Josh had the brilliant
idea of looking at potato chips

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.540
and, being a freshman, he went
to the Safeway on El Camino

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.140
and just took pictures of all
of the bags of potato chips

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.820
because he was too
cheap to buy them.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.489
And so this is our data set and
he brought it back-- the backs.

00:15:15.489 --> 00:15:16.530
The fronts and the backs.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.988
And then the class, we all kind
of looked at them together.

00:15:18.988 --> 00:15:21.687
So this is a sample
from our corpus.

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:23.270
This is the kind of
things that people

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.540
say in the back of
potato chip bags.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.915
You may never have read the
back of your potato chip bags

00:15:26.915 --> 00:15:29.100
but this is what they say.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.240
And we were relying
on this work by

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.660
the famous French
sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.030
and what Bourdieu said was,
he looked at French tastes

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.320
in the 1960s and he
compared the working class

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.230
and the upper class--
the professional class.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.380
And what he noticed was
the working class had taste

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.750
that we now think of as
kind of populist taste,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.922
like they liked Strauss.

00:15:50.922 --> 00:15:52.880
That was a thing for the
working class to like.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.255
They liked The
Blue Danube waltz.

00:15:54.255 --> 00:15:57.460
And they had these very heavy,
starchy meals-- cassoulet,

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.280
which has got beans
and duck confit

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.030
and it's really heavy
and solid, whereas

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.525
the professional
class-- the bour

00:16:04.525 --> 00:16:06.190
geois-- they had
these refined tastes.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:06.910
They liked Bach.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.010
They're liked Bruegel.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.822
And they were eating
these new ethnic foods

00:16:09.822 --> 00:16:11.780
that were just coming
into France at that time.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.200
Curry and brown rice was
all very novel and exciting

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.040
in the 60s.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.280
And what he said
was, there is nothing

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.644
absolutely better or worse
about cassoulet than curry.

00:16:21.644 --> 00:16:23.810
The fact that one of them
is eaten by the high-class

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.351
and one of them is
eaten by low-class

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:27.385
is completely an arbitrary
marker of status.

00:16:27.385 --> 00:16:28.980
It could've been the
other way around.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.271
In fact now, cassoulet is a
marker of fancy French food

00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:32.340
here.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.980
So he said these are just ways
of distinguishing ourselves

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.340
and that society comes
up with these ways

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.260
and he specifically
said, when we're

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.440
talking about what
counts as good taste,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.840
that taste is about distaste.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.106
That what it is to have the
taste of the upper class

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.980
is just to be different
than the poor people.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.670
We don't care what
they do as long as what

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.878
we do is different than them.

00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:52.840
That was his model
of what it is.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.930
So he said, taste is
negation, sick-making.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.550
He's very visceral,
he says this.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.480
So we thought, well, maybe
this is true in potato chips.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.470
Let's look at how
expensive potato chips look

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.950
different than
cheap potato chips

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.550
on this Bourdieu
distinction idea

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.270
and so we just counted
the linguistic markers

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.060
of distinctions.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.670
So we looked at comparison
words like more or less,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.890
words like least or unique, and
then we just counted the number

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.359
of negations-- the
number of no's and not's.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.819
And sure enough, we
found five times more

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.069
of linguistic markers
of distinction

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.594
in the expensive chips.

00:17:29.594 --> 00:17:30.760
So here's are some examples.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.310
Deliciously different,
best in America, less fat,

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.050
won't find in any other chip.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.977
And in particular, a lot
of negation, and, in fact,

00:17:39.977 --> 00:17:41.060
you pay for this negation.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.280
So every time you add
one negative word,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.680
you're paying four
more cents per ounce

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.610
and I want to show you the back
of the most expensive potato

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.460
chip bag in our sample.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.780
I'll let you read it.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.020
Nothing fake or phony.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.360
No fake colors, no
fake flavors, no--

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.020
t so there's lot of no's
and not's and nothing's.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.580
We also found, by the way,
that potato chips turn out

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.200
to be a health food.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.820
So all potato chips talk
about how natural they are.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.180
They are the most
natural and healthy food

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.830
you could possibly
buy if you believe

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.980
the advertising on the back.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.690
It's kind of exciting to know.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.660
I'm going to stop eating
bananas and eat potato chips,

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.529
but it turns out that expensive
chips do this six times

00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:28.695
more often than cheap chips.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.560
So, for example, no chips
have trans fats in them

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.160
but only the
expensive bags talked

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.440
about the lack of trans fats.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.360
So it's something about
health and the appeal

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.600
to health in the upper class.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.580
Cheap chips, by contrast,
appeal to an idea

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.750
of traditional authenticity.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.410
So cheap chips are
more likely to talk

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.740
about the founder,
the age of the recipe,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.170
tradition, kind of conservative
words, classic American,

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.366
locales in America.

00:18:59.366 --> 00:19:00.990
Expensive chips are
more likely to talk

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.450
about what we call
natural authenticity, so

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.500
the lack of
artificialness, the fact

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.750
that they're natural, the fact
that they're hand-processed.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.730
All of these
differences in metaphor.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.230
All right.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.000
So just from potato
chips, you've

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.710
seen all sorts of-- from a very
small data of 14 potato chip

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:23.910
bags, we suggest there are
these really big differences

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.650
in how class is
represented in America.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.780
Traditional versus
natural authenticity,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.100
the role of negation,
the role of health.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.390
And we decided to
follow this study up

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.610
by looking at more data because
14 is a very small data set.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:41.860
So we looked at a much
larger data set of menus,

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.750
and this is with Victor
Chahuneau and Brian Routledge

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.520
and Noah Smith who are
friends from Carnegie Mellon.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.000
And we looked at online
menus from 6,000 restaurants

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.170
and we looked, again, at
how the wording differed

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.990
by the price of the restaurant.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:06.750
So for example, look at
these lovely adjectives.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.920
Your zestys, your rich,
your crispys, your fluffys,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.740
your golden brown.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.650
Here's some examples.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.520
Rich, creamy, spinach
artichoke dip.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.690
Creamy, homemade fettuccine.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.180
And then let's just plot the use
of those, the amount of them,

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.514
by the price of the restaurant.

00:20:21.514 --> 00:20:23.930
And we used the Yelp criteria
of one, two, three, and four

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.680
dollar sign restaurants.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.700
So there's our
adjectives and you'll

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.947
see big bumps in the two
and three dollar sign

00:20:29.947 --> 00:20:32.280
restaurants, especially the
two dollar sign restaurants.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.850
That's your California
Pizza Kitchens

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:38.450
and your Cheesecake Factories
and your lower-middle-priced

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.950
restaurants.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.310
Lots of mentions of these
beautiful adjectives

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.200
whereas the cheaper
restaurants, instead

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.210
of using the crispys
and the creamys,

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:51.580
they use these very vague
adjectives that you can't

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.572
really disagree-- if
they say it's crispy

00:20:55.572 --> 00:20:57.780
and it's not crispy, you
can complain to your waiter,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.690
but if they say it's
flavorful and you say,

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.720
well, it wasn't
really flavorful,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.270
that's really a
matter of choice.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.590
And sure enough, lots more
of these vague adjectives

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.710
in the cheap restaurants.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.404
So why would--
these two facts be--

00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:13.570
why would it be that the
expensive restaurants don't

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.153
have any of these words and it's
the cheaper restaurants that,

00:21:16.153 --> 00:21:19.720
say, mention that
their food is fresh.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.670
And there's a lovely linguistic
literature from the philosopher

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.930
Grice who argues as follows.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.039
Why would I tell you
that the food is fresh?

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.580
Well, the reason I
tell you something

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.850
is because you don't know
what I'm trying to inform you

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.000
about something you don't know.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.430
I want you to know
the food is fresh.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.388
Well, why would you not
know the food is fresh?

00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:38.960
You might think the
food isn't fresh

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.560
and have to be convinced and,
if I'm an expensive restaurant,

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.480
that's a bad proposition.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.490
I don't want you to be thinking
that you need to be convinced

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.380
the food is fresh.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.338
I'm just not going to
mention it and we'll just

00:21:47.338 --> 00:21:49.040
both assume that
the food is fresh

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.300
if it's supposed to be fresh.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.180
And that's, in
fact, the mechanism

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:56.260
that high-priced restaurants
take in their menus.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.260
And, for those of you
interested in game theory,

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.676
there's even a
cute game theoretic

00:21:59.676 --> 00:22:03.130
proof of this which I won't
go into but-- OK, I will.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:08.700
So imagine that you have three
prices-- because game theory is

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.070
very easy to explain.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.210
The math is harder but the
explanation is very simple.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.860
Imagine you have high, mid,
and low-priced restaurants

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.210
and then imagine there's some
other noisy cues to quality

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.830
like location or
expense, so that you

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.050
have some vague idea
whether the restaurant is

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.370
in class A, B, or C.
Expensive, mid-priced, or low.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:32.064
What the proof shows is that the
high-class restaurants, no one

00:22:32.064 --> 00:22:33.730
confuses them with
the cheap restaurants

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.820
because you have these
other cues like the decor

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.690
or something.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.270
But the people might be
confused with the restaurant

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.812
next to them, so
cheap restaurants

00:22:40.812 --> 00:22:42.270
might be confused
with middle class

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.353
and middle class might be
confused with expensive.

00:22:44.353 --> 00:22:47.850
So the optimal strategy is for
the middle-priced restaurants

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.590
to signal, say, I'm great, so
that you think that they're not

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.130
the cheap restaurants and
then the expensive restaurants

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.445
counter-signal--
don't say anything--

00:22:56.445 --> 00:22:57.820
to show that
they're not the same

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.670
as the mid-priced restaurants.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.590
And so, the result is what
the advertising literature

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.480
technically calls
modest advertising.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.730
Modest advertising, something
that the high-class--

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.680
that's why you get these
Tiffany's ads with lots

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.700
of white space on the
page and a little diamond

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.890
right in the middle.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:17.210
We're using lots of
blank space to indicate

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.340
that we don't have to
brag about our-- it just

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.540
speaks for itself.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.030
We're expensive.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:27.050
And this same idea,
this Gricean idea, you

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.600
can see this just in vocabulary.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:34.120
So, the word real, not used at
all in expensive restaurants.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.000
On cheap restaurants--
the cheapest ones--

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.410
you get real whipped cream
and real mashed potatoes

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.359
and real bacon.

00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:41.900
You pay a little
more money you might

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.150
get real crab and
real maple syrup,

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.447
but again, as you
go up the hierarchy,

00:23:48.447 --> 00:23:50.030
when you're at this
kind of restaurant

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.161
you assume that the potatoes
are actually made of potato

00:23:54.161 --> 00:23:55.660
and when you're at
these restaurants

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.970
they want you to assume
everything is real.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.489
So you can learn a lot just
by counting these words.

00:24:01.489 --> 00:24:03.280
You can also, actually,
learn about history

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.446
by looking at the word real.

00:24:04.446 --> 00:24:07.977
Those of you who were
alive in the 70s and 80s

00:24:07.977 --> 00:24:09.810
may remember that there
were various-- well,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.590
there is still Cool Whip,
these imitation whip creams

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.020
and various imitation
sour creams.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.477
And we looked at-- there's a
recipe collection at the New

00:24:17.477 --> 00:24:18.310
York Public Library.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.893
It's very fun.

00:24:18.893 --> 00:24:20.160
You can check it out online.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.940
You can also crowdsource
helping transcribe the menus.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.740
I said recipes but I
meant menu collection.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.650
And you can look
back through time

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.380
at when words like
real and genuine-- what

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.290
most likely the head
that they modify is.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.860
And real bacon, right about the
time bacon bits were invented,

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.610
and real whip cream just
after Cool Whip was invented,

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.040
and real butter soon after
margarine became popular.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.451
And if you go back to 1900,
they had mock turtle back then

00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:50.950
because turtle soup
was very popular

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.820
and they made a
fake turtle soup,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.852
but the most common thing to
talk about in 1900 on a menu

00:24:57.852 --> 00:24:59.310
that you bragged
about was the fact

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.490
you had actual
German beer because

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.330
the great German immigration,
that was probably the largest

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:10.490
immigration to America, happened
in about the 1860s, 1870s.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.350
And Americans before that drank
what we now would call ale.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.320
They drank dark beer, not lager.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.610
And the Germans brought what
was not the norm for beer here,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.620
was all brought by the Germans
and and so right around 1800,

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.470
New York, for example, was full
of these German beer houses

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.170
and restaurants were beginning
to serve beer and beer

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.340
became popular and
associated with being

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.870
German because it was the
Germans that brought it.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.000
And so you had real German beer.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.624
So you can actually
look at the history

00:25:35.624 --> 00:25:38.810
of American food,
immigration, and imitation

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.650
just by counting what
we modify with real.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.320
OK, so that's all
techniques we talked about

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.260
for cheap restaurants.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.090
What do expensive
restaurants do?

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:48.926
They use rare words.

00:25:48.926 --> 00:25:51.550
Many of you will have seen this
if you go to fancy restaurants.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.960
You have to ask the waiter
one of the words mean.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.200
I just put some of these up.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.930
And even if you know
what the words mean,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.560
they'll use longer
versions of them

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.430
and not the shorter
versions of them.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.600
So decaffeinated for
expensive restaurants,

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.420
decaf for cheap restaurants.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.390
And that suggests-- both of
these facts-- these are all

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.310
long-looking words, suggest
we could measure word length

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:16.360
and sure enough the average
length of a word in a menu

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.620
is correlated with the price.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.560
And you are, again, paying
for those extra letters.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.860
So longer words, more expensive
menus but, by contrast,

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.850
more words, cheaper menus.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.240
So the most expensive
menus have long words

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.010
but there aren't
very many of them.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.720
So this is Saison, a very fancy
restaurant in San Francisco

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.500
and, at the time I went, they
had no menu but we asked them,

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.230
please could we have a menu?

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.327
And they very kindly
emailed us a PDF.

00:26:47.327 --> 00:26:49.910
You can see that it's in a very
light font because they really

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.046
didn't want to give us a
menu, although the food was

00:26:53.046 --> 00:26:54.670
very excellent and
they were very nice.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.360
So I'm just picking on
them, but anyway, you

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.720
can see that the dishes are
described with single words

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.280
so, trout roe, abalone, cardoon.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.010
It says brassica, not cabbage,
which is the more frequent word

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.120
but brassicas is the rare word.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.370
So that's what an expensive
menu looks like in America

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.580
right now.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.764
This is, by contrast, what
a cheap menu looks like.

00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:22.430
Of course, that's The
Cheesecake Factory

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.320
and that's just page one.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.540
There are 20 pages on this menu.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.500
OK, so, more differences.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.300
Cheap restaurants, that same
traditional authenticity

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.290
that we saw in
cheap potato chips.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:42.060
The mentioning of words like
old-fashioned and homemade,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.610
mentions of female relatives
like grandmas and aunts

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.420
and moms.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.800
By contrast, exactly
as with potato chips,

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.550
the expensive restaurants
talk about where

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.520
the food comes from.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.190
The fact that it
was fed on grass,

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.480
that it was raised in a pasture,
the name of the farm where it

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.250
was fed this grass and so on.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:04.130
Mentions of where the food
comes from, vastly more common

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.260
in expensive restaurants.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.710
Now, just as with ketchup,
where ketchup was this expensive

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.670
imported sauce and now it's the
cheapest food that all children

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.690
grow up on here.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.720
Sociologists-- so Vablen,
who was actually at Stanford,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.717
and Georg Simmel-- pointed
out that stuff trickles down

00:28:23.717 --> 00:28:24.300
from the rich.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.925
Some things get
borrowed from the poor,

00:28:25.925 --> 00:28:27.830
some things get
borrowed from the rich

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:32.580
and these ideas seem
to have trickled down.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.300
So in the early 20th
century, fancy restaurants

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.080
were in French and
they were very long

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.470
and they had lots
of descriptions

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.178
and that idea seems
to have trickled down

00:28:40.178 --> 00:28:42.360
to two star restaurants
like The Cheesecake Factory

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.770
with these long menus.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:48.490
And now the expensive menus,
by contrast, are really short.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.910
Taco Bell just closed
one of these failed ideas

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:53.740
they had called US
Tacos, where they

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.470
were going to have
a taqueria that

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.360
looked like an
expensive restaurant

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.000
and you can see
that on the menu.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.710
So, like expensive menus,
they didn't use "and",

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.500
they had just commas between
the names of the dishes

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.780
and they had fancy
words in it and they

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:17.390
had kind of cutesy
names and it basically

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:20.109
closed because
people were confused

00:29:20.109 --> 00:29:21.900
about whether this was
a hipster restaurant

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.066
or whether it was Taco Bell.

00:29:24.365 --> 00:29:26.490
AUDIENCE: They should have
just charged more money.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.740
DAN JURAFSKY: They should
have just charged more money

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.130
and just not mentioned.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:34.360
Another fun fact, I call
this the Tiki Lounge effect,

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.480
so if you see words like
exotic, oriental, spices,

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.780
or even spicy-- seems like a
very innocuous word, spicy--

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.330
on the menu, here are some
examples of what I mean.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:50.150
I just got these
from various menus.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:55.980
So if you think about it, why
would you call a food spicy?

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.590
So if it's your native
cuisine, it's not spicy.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.160
It's just how the dish tastes.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.010
Spicy is a word you used to
describe somebody else's food

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.880
to say that it has spices
I wasn't expecting,

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.647
or you might need to be
warned about, or so on.

00:30:08.647 --> 00:30:11.230
Exotic is a much more explicit
way of saying that it's not us,

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.180
it's them.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.890
So these are all names
that you use when you're

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.580
serving to non-native eaters.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.080
Right.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.949
A native chef cooking
for a native eater

00:30:18.949 --> 00:30:21.240
wouldn't use those words
because it would make no sense

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.309
and so that suggests
that, in fact, they're

00:30:23.309 --> 00:30:25.600
going to charge more for this
because you're selling it

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.320
to tourist eaters, if you will.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.860
And sure enough, if you
use those words in a dish,

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.610
you're going to charge
more for that dish.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.750
We ran a little
regression on price.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.250
All right.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.090
So summaries of menus.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.660
Expensive menus are
linguistically modest.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.820
We saw effects of
health and authenticity

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.420
and their interaction
with class.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.060
We talked about trickle-down
effects and fun things

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.580
like cues for exoticism.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.500
There's a lot you
can see in menus

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.380
and I want to now turn
to restaurant reviews.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:00.200
So I've shown you a one star,
really bad restaurant review.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.077
I've modified it slightly so
you can't Google the words

00:31:03.077 --> 00:31:05.410
and see who wrote this because
I don't want to embarrass

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.910
anybody, but anyway, somebody
had a bad time at a restaurant

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.530
and wrote this one
star review and I

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.770
want you to just take a
look at it for a second.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.311
What do you notice
about this review?

00:31:16.992 --> 00:31:18.450
It doesn't mention
the food at all.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:18.950
Right?

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.750
There is no mention of
food in this review.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.040
So we thought, going into
this project, that one star

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.770
reviews would be
people complaining

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.080
about greasy food
or ill-cooked food

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.610
and what we found
instead when we

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:34.540
focused on the one star
reviews was these three or four

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.354
factors.

00:31:35.354 --> 00:31:37.520
Negative sentiment language,
that wasn't surprising.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.700
They use words like bad or
disgusting or horrible or

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.020
awful.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.644
Then they had a
lot of past tense,

00:31:42.644 --> 00:31:45.060
so rather than the present
tense they used the past tense.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.920
We waited, we didn't, he was.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.660
And lots of mentions of people.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.210
So, third person pronouns, names
of roles of people-- managers,

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.030
and customers, and waiters--
and kind of surprisingly,

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.900
way more mentions
of the first person

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.170
plural-- we, us,
our, ourselves--

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.680
than we expected by chance.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.970
So lots of reviews might
use I or they might use we.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.640
So there's a base rate for
what you use them both in

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.960
and it was way higher in
these one star reviews

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.387
for the use of we and us.

00:32:15.387 --> 00:32:16.970
And we looked at the
literature to see

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:21.380
what other genre of writing
has these exact features.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.070
Negative sentiment, past
tense narratives about people,

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.090
overuse of we and us,
and we did find a genre

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.777
with exactly these
characteristics

00:32:28.777 --> 00:32:30.360
and it's the genre
of people who write

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.110
after they'd been traumatized.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.140
And so there's a literature
on this, so a lot of this

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.740
is from Texas in
the Pennebaker lab.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.150
So they looked at people
blogging after 9/11, they

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.920
looked at students who write
after tragedies on campus,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.080
and the idea is they're using
the past tense to distance

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.622
themselves from this bad thing
happened but it's in the past.

00:32:48.622 --> 00:32:49.871
We're going to get through it.

00:32:49.871 --> 00:32:51.360
And you use the
we and us and our

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.550
because this bad
thing happened but it

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.540
happened to us collectively
and, again, we'll

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.980
get through it together and
so it's a mark of trauma.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.010
So, really, these
one star reviews

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:04.800
are minor trauma narratives
and the important lesson

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.510
is that you think
these reviews are

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.530
objective descriptions of
some product flaw or something

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:11.535
and that's why you're
looking at them, if you're

00:33:11.535 --> 00:33:12.993
a company reading
your own reviews,

00:33:12.993 --> 00:33:15.102
but really they're
describing these facts

00:33:15.102 --> 00:33:16.060
about personal actions.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.574
Somebody was mean to a person
and face-to-face rudeness

00:33:20.574 --> 00:33:22.740
is extremely traumatizing
even though it's obviously

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.000
a minor trauma.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.860
Nonetheless, face-to-face
interaction matters a lot.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.350
OK, so that's the
negative reviews.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.753
The positive reviews,
here's an example

00:33:30.753 --> 00:33:34.810
of phrases from
a positive review

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:38.600
but not every positive review
talked about sex-- only

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.810
the expensive ones.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.950
And you probably all know
that sex is not cheap

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.430
but what is cheap, it turns
out, is addiction, crack,

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.070
and craving.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.770
So, the cheaper the restaurant,
the more likely people

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:59.510
were to use drugs as their
metaphor for the food.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.320
So why drugs?

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.420
Well if you think
about it, these foods

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.580
that they're talking about
in these cheap reviews,

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.830
they're talking about chicken
wings, and french fries,

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:09.750
and chocolate.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:10.780
A lot of desserts.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.080
So they're feeling guilty.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.909
So partly, drugs
is a negative thing

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.040
and I'm feeling
guilty about thinking

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.456
of these foods as
a negative thing

00:34:16.456 --> 00:34:18.270
so that's a good
metaphor but it also,

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.340
by using the metaphor of
drugs, you're saying it's

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:26.620
not my fault. Some of
the agency of this eating

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.969
is not my agency.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.980
I didn't choose to
eat that cupcake,

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.460
I was medically forced
to eat the cupcake

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:37.290
and it's not my fault, right?

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.500
We know that women are much
more pressured to conform

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.320
to these norms of
healthy eating and women

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.489
were much more likely to
use this metaphor of food

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.326
as a drug than men.

00:34:45.326 --> 00:34:47.159
Men, by contrast, by
the way, were much more

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:51.370
likely to display trauma
in those one star reviews.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.368
So men were more traumatized,
women are more guilty.

00:34:55.368 --> 00:34:56.409
Do with that as you will.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.820
All right.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.132
I'll very briefly talk
about food requests.

00:35:05.132 --> 00:35:06.590
So this was a study
where we wanted

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.760
to know-- there's lots of
online funding mechanisms

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.360
where people ask for things and
you give them what they want.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.977
And we want to
know, because we're

00:35:14.977 --> 00:35:17.310
linguists, what does the
language matter in whether they

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:21.327
get the thing they ask
for online and the problem

00:35:21.327 --> 00:35:23.160
with studying that--
it's very hard to study

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.520
that because obviously it
depends on what you ask for.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.460
If you ask for a
million dollars,

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.890
you're much less likely to get
it than if you ask for $10.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:34.830
So to study any of these
crowdfunding platforms,

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.830
we need to control, extremely
strictly, for the thing they're

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.830
asking for.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.040
And so we picked a
subreddit in which

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.990
everyone asked for the same
thing, which was a pizza.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:45.390
It's called Random
Acts of Pizza.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.730
You ask for pizza and they
either do or don't give you

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.420
a gift certificate for pizza.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.140
And so let's look at
the language of one

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.030
of these requests for pizza.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.300
This is a sad story.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.970
Sorry to give you sad
stories but this is somebody

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.650
who really needed that pizza.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.940
There's unemployment, there's
all sorts of problems.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.730
And let's look at
the linguistics going

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.920
on in their request for pizza.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.850
So they do things
like reciprocity.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:12.680
So reciprocity, in
social psychology,

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.610
is I do something for you,
you do something back for me.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.677
Generalized reciprocity
is I do something for you

00:36:17.677 --> 00:36:19.260
and you do something
for somebody else

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.560
and kind of pass on the favor.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.040
So we coded, just wrote
regular expressions and things,

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.470
to code-- we have lexicons
and things-- to code

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.760
for generalized reciprocity.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.580
We coded for length,
maybe it matters

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.860
to ask with longer,
longer requests.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.376
We coded evidentiality.

00:36:37.376 --> 00:36:38.750
So this is a
picture that someone

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:41.780
posted of their bank account,
showing they only had $5 in it.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.360
And so we quoted how much
they mention the evidence.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.220
We coded status.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.620
Reddit has karma so maybe people
who are high-status or have

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.580
been-- presumably, having
high karma on Reddit

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.329
means that you're a
good person and you've

00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:58.710
helped out other people and
done a bunch of good stuff,

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.380
so maybe that gets
rewarded on Reddit.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.970
We can check that.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.630
And, just to cut to
the chase very quickly,

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.220
it turns out that
if you add up all

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.695
of these pro-social
behaviors they

00:37:07.695 --> 00:37:10.070
are, in fact, one of the most
significant factors-- maybe

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.670
the most significant
factor-- in whether you're

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.790
going to get that pizza.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.170
So if you promise to pay it
forward, if you say thank you,

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.720
if you have karma
in the community,

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.350
you're going to get your pizza.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.900
So that suggests
that good behavior

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.660
is awarded, which is good.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.554
And for my last
topic I want to go

00:37:26.554 --> 00:37:28.970
to something that seems even
more surprising, at the time,

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:29.780
to us.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.346
And this is the
idea that how you

00:37:32.346 --> 00:37:33.720
name a food could
actually matter

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.200
in what's going on in the food.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.190
So if you think about
names, the classic theory

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.450
of how names work or how
words work in general--

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.280
how words match objects--
is called conventionalism.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.337
And this is a famous formulation
in "Romeo and Juliet."

00:37:47.337 --> 00:37:49.920
"What's in a name? that which
we call a rose By any other name

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.836
would smell as sweet."

00:37:50.836 --> 00:37:53.920
It doesn't matter that
we use the sounds rose

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.789
to describe a rose.

00:37:54.789 --> 00:37:56.330
If we have some
other language, we'll

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.000
have some other word for it.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.046
That's OK, too.

00:37:58.046 --> 00:37:59.920
And it turns out that
there is an alternative

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.950
to conventionalism called
naturalism, something

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.650
that actually Plato talks about
in the Cratylus, very famously.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.830
And here's how Plato says it.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.540
That there is an
"inherently correct" name,

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.670
everything has its
own perfect name,

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.930
and not just in Greek
but even for barbarians,

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.840
which is to say the best of
us, that there is an inherently

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.190
correct name for everything.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:20.620
And what could
this possibly mean?

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.680
It makes no sense at all.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.890
But it turns out it's
true, in some sense,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.390
and I want to talk
about that sense.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.610
So, first I have
to show you mouths.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.310
So these are
midsagittal, meaning cut

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.270
through the body this way,
views of the tongue, the upper

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.270
and lower lips, the
upper and lower teeth.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.972
And there are two classes of
vowels cross-linguistically,

00:38:41.972 --> 00:38:43.680
and they're called
front vowels and back.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.719
So front vowels are ones in
which, very roughly speaking,

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:48.760
the tongue is more toward
the front of the mouth.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.070
So you can see how the tongue
is kind of more up here and back

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.280
vowels, roughly
speaking, the tongue

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.550
is in the back of the mouth.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:55.826
So front vowels,
that's your ee, ih, eh.

00:38:55.826 --> 00:38:56.780
Ee, ih, eh.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:57.433
Watch my mouth.

00:38:57.433 --> 00:38:58.304
Ee, ih, eh.

00:38:58.304 --> 00:39:00.470
I get wider and the tongue
is up there. can't really

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.820
see the tongue but it's there.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.400
And the back vowels,
that's your oh, aw.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.327
Oh, aw, ooh.

00:39:06.327 --> 00:39:08.160
The tongue is more in
the back of the mouth.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.940
And it turns out that,
across languages, these

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.810
seem to be associated--
it's called

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.700
sound symbolism-- associated
with different concepts.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.670
So across lots of
languages, front vowels

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.450
are used for small things.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.500
So we have in English,
little, itsy bitsy,

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.880
teeny weeny all
have ih, ee vowel

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.720
but it's true in
lots of languages.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.470
Your ee in petite in
French and your ito in lots

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.220
of Spanish words.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.520
And, by contrast, back
vowels used in words

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:39.430
like huge-- huge, very big right
now-- and humongous, and large.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.520
Huge.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.380
And, again, cross-linguistically
this is generally true.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.670
So we thought, well, this is
a generally widely-known fact

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:48.490
about language.

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.610
Maybe it's true
for food as well.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:52.710
And we looked at
crackers versus ice cream

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.820
and our idea was, well,
crackers, those are small.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.820
They're meant to be light,
meant to be delicate.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.430
Maybe they're going to use more
front vowels in their names

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.690
whereas ice creams, you
want an ice cream to be big

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.720
and plump and solid
and heavy and so maybe

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.890
we'll use back vowels and I
just scraped some cracker brand

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:12.210
names from a website and took
all of the Haagen-Dazs and Ben

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:15.160
and Jerry flavor names
as my ice cream database.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.700
So, very quick study.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.030
And so here's the crackers.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.710
Please repeat the names as you
see them on the screen with me.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:23.530
Krispy.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.170
Ritz.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.930
Wheat Thins.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.660
Triscuit Thin Crisps.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.560
Cheeze-It.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.790
Chicken in a Biskit.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:33.290
OK.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:34.330
You get the idea, right?

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:39.324
Lots of ih's and ee's,
whereas an ice cream--

00:40:39.324 --> 00:40:40.490
here's some ice cream names.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.920
Rocky Road.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.270
Jamoca Almond Fudge.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.680
Chocolate, Carmel,
Coconut Cookie Dough.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.300
All ah's and oh's and ooh's.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.930
And sure enough,
here's my lovely graph.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:55.340
That blue is front vowels
and green is back vowels

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.350
and you get much more
front vowels with crackers

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:59.920
and much more back
vowels with ice creams.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.450
So why would this be?

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.610
There's a standard explanation.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.990
Front vowels have a
particular low pitched,

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.180
one of the formants
for front vowels--

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.420
sorry, front vowels have
a high pitched resonance.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.790
Front vowel is made
by putting the tongue

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.630
in the front of the mouth.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.046
In the amount of space in front
of that, before the teeth,

00:41:15.046 --> 00:41:16.230
is a small cavity.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:19.290
Small cavity, high frequency
waves get to fit in there.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.290
Think of it that way.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.974
And back vowels,
they're in the back

00:41:21.974 --> 00:41:23.890
and there's a much bigger
cavity in the mouth.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.973
So there's a lot of high
pitches with front vowels

00:41:25.973 --> 00:41:27.630
and low pitches with
back vowels and we

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.630
know that high pitches
are made by squeaky,

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.800
little animals like little birds
and little mice make squeaks.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.180
And big lions make big
roars and low pitches

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.980
and, instinctively, we
associate pitch with size

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.340
and somehow, that
works for language.

00:41:47.194 --> 00:41:49.110
So it's not just front
vowels and back vowels,

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.930
there's actually
other cases of this.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:54.730
So, let me show you
two pictures and let's

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:58.000
suppose there's words for
these pictures in Martian

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.960
and one of them is maluma, or
the other dialect of Martian

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.090
calls it bouba, and one of
these is takete, or kiki.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.960
So which of these is
the takete-kiki picture?

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.365
The spiky one, right?

00:42:11.365 --> 00:42:12.740
Everyone has that
same intuition?

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.620
There's something about that
that looks more takete or kiki

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.070
and it turns out that this
is also true for food.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.580
So this is the work from
the Spence lab at Oxford

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.760
that people use
words like takete

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.220
to describe dark chocolate,
maluma to describe

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.610
milk chocolate.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.270
They use maluma to
describe still water,

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.810
takete to describe carbonated
water and, I didn't mention

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:36.470
this before, but in
our cracker study,

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:39.380
lots of crackers have T's and
K's in their names whereas ice

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.020
cream is more likely
to have L's and M's.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.860
So, in summary, M's
and L's are associated

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.870
with these creamy,
gentler tastes and T and K

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.470
with these sharper tastes.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.200
So why would this be?

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.800
And I'll show you
a picture of me.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.100
This is a sound wave of me
saying maluma and takete

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.820
and you can see, maluma is
is a much more continuous

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.970
sound wave.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.974
The way you make the T's
and K's of takete is you

00:43:01.974 --> 00:43:04.140
actually close your mouth,
let air pressure build up

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.040
behind the tongue in various
places, open your mouth,

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.080
the air explodes out.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.930
So you see these little
bursts of explosion.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:15.090
So, in fact, the sound of
takete is very sharp and jagged

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.590
and explosive in the
real world and maluma

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.500
is very smooth in
the real world.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.420
And this suggests that something
synesthetic is going on.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.680
Synesthesia is the
general case when people--

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.545
one sense interferes
with another sense,

00:43:26.545 --> 00:43:29.070
or the two senses are
involved in each other.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:34.030
So somehow, vision, that
you saw with those pictures,

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.420
are a sense of a picture
being a picture being curvy

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.390
versus jaggedm taste,
creamy versus sharp

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:43.850
and sound, sharp versus
smoothness in acoustic,

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.760
are all subconsciously linked.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.850
And I want to suggest
that both of these facts,

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:50.410
the fact about front
and back vowels

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:53.450
and the fact about smooth
versus sharp consonants,

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.360
may have evolutionary
implications.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:00.812
So there's an acute idea
from phonetician John Ohala.

00:44:00.812 --> 00:44:02.270
So, if you think
about it, when you

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:04.180
make the first front
vowels, those ee,

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.020
ih eh's, you have to
pull your mouth back.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.730
Ee, ih, eh and you
instinctively have to smile.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.080
So that's why we have the
word cheese in English

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.960
for taking a picture
because cheese forces you--

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.650
any front vowel--
forces you to smile.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:21.300
And what Ohala suggested
is maybe smiles evolved

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.620
very early in mammalian
history to make yourself sound

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.900
physically smaller
because, by smiling, you're

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.310
dropping this size
of this formant

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:34.220
and it's like, I'm
small, don't hurt me.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.300
So that was his--
smiling is like, eh.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.340
It's going to be OK.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.320
And maybe it solves
this other problem,

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.110
which is, how could language
possibly have evolved?

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:46.900
How did the first
listener know what

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.580
the first speaker was saying?

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:49.600
Right?

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.320
Like that first word,
how did they know?

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.820
And one theory, it's called
the Bootstrap theory,

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.390
said maybe some of
the sound symbolism

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.960
could have been a
possible bootstrap.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.700
So maybe the very
first cavewoman

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.570
talking to the very first other
caveperson used like a sound

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.840
with an ee in it to mean
baby, like ee, little ee,

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.930
and used some kind of
oo, ooh sound to mean big

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.170
or says kikikikiki to
mean something sharp

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.430
and then you have a couple
of words and then, with that,

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:22.671
bootstrapping goes
on from there.

00:45:22.671 --> 00:45:23.170
All right.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:26.240
So, summarizing, we
learned that innovation

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.300
happened at interstices.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.690
This is a general
fact about innovation,

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.620
as we're borrowing
ideas of our neighbors.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.950
We learned that
people don't like it

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.560
when you're mean to
them, so don't do that,

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.770
and they reward you if you're
kind, which is a good thing.

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.570
Society's roughly
working in the right way.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.270
And, bottom line, you can tell
a lot about all sorts of things.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:47.770
Psychology,
economics, evolution,

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.587
if you look very carefully
at the language of food.

00:45:50.587 --> 00:45:52.170
So I'll stop there
and take questions.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:52.862
Thank you.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.900
AUDIENCE: Has
anybody come to you

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.320
from marketing departments
from either restaurants or food

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.972
companies to use this to
come up with better names?

00:46:08.972 --> 00:46:10.430
It seems like they
already have it.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.221
DAN JURAFSKY: They
totally already have it.

00:46:12.221 --> 00:46:14.640
I have talked to a bunch
of advertising people

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.100
and so branding companies
already use sound symbolism.

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.630
So branding companies
are staffed by linguists

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.890
and they do, in fact-- when
they come up with a name,

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:26.680
they put in all the
semantic associations

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.290
with a possible name
but they also do

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.539
all the sound symbolic things.

00:46:29.539 --> 00:46:31.260
So these are known things.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:37.310
And then I've asked restaurants
about their menu design

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:40.314
and, I think, some of this
they don't do systematically.

00:46:40.314 --> 00:46:41.730
They don't tend
to hire linguists.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.980
I've talked to chefs
of local restaurants

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.438
and they're just
busy and they just

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:50.540
make a menu that looks
right to them, artistically

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.830
and, of course, they're in
a particular social strata.

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.360
They're influenced
by the context.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.090
So I think they have
excellent instincts about how

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:00.716
to appeal to the customers they
want to appeal to and so they

00:47:00.716 --> 00:47:03.090
don't do it systematically,
but I think they're appealing

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.506
to the same things and that's,
of course, how we study it,

00:47:05.506 --> 00:47:08.440
is by noticing that they
have this instinctive model

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.132
that we're capturing.

00:47:10.132 --> 00:47:12.340
AUDIENCE: So did you just
mentioned an example where,

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.048
and I think this is
the most common case,

00:47:14.048 --> 00:47:17.360
where people try to appeal
to their customer base?

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.720
Now, have you thought of,
do you know of applications

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:26.420
where a company can use
linguistics to actually shape

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.040
the consumer preference?

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.950
And I could give you an example
of what I'm thinking about.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.500
There are some
ethnic foods that are

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.330
trendy among the
majority of a population.

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.180
Right?

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:43.240
Why everyone in college
eats instant ramen soup

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:49.870
but they would reject
another ethnic item, right?

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:56.910
Or why sushi or other foreign
dishes have become so popular.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.097
How can you use to actually--

00:47:59.097 --> 00:48:00.430
DAN JURAFSKY: Create preference.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.840
Yeah.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.340
Yeah.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.770
The short answer
is, I don't know.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.370
Here's a paradox.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:08.160
If you look at the menus
for foods in general

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.870
and you just look at the price
by ethnicity, price by cuisine,

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.860
the expensive cuisines
are all European.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.820
The cheap cuisines
are all Asian,

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.520
except for Japanese food.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.620
So sushi is an
expensive cuisine,

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.880
you can have a very fancy
Michelin-starred Japanese

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.530
restaurant.

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.445
Very uncommon to have a
Michelin-starred Chinese

00:48:27.445 --> 00:48:29.570
restaurant, even though
that's the most common food

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:33.320
in America, or a
Thai restaurant.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.220
So why is that?

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:35.950
Don't know.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:39.670
It has to do with history and
social class and our perception

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:43.060
and presumably we can
change these things,

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:48.410
but I'm taken by the fact that
Mexican food and Chinese food

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:51.190
are perceived socially
differently than French food

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:52.890
and Japanese food.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.400
That seems to me
very hard to change

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.233
and so somebody will
figure how to change it

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:57.750
and then these
things will change.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:58.840
AUDIENCE: I was curious
what implications

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.250
you think this has for
the dynamics of inequality

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:02.450
in society because
it seems like there's

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:04.200
this inexorable thing--
I think it's totally game

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.460
theoretic-- that the
mid-priced guys try to emulate

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.180
the high-priced guys
to be aspirational,

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.960
then the high-priced guys
have to be different to keep

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.990
being different.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.651
But there are societies
with more or less inequality

00:49:13.651 --> 00:49:16.150
and even our society's been
more and less inequal over time.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:17.930
Do you think you see
that in the food?

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:19.440
Do they have to lay
down their arms?

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.690
What drives that, apart from--

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:21.810
DAN JURAFSKY: That's
a great question.

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:23.976
I don't know the answer but
it'd be a great question

00:49:23.976 --> 00:49:25.580
to study which is,
could we correlate

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.970
some of these
differences in language

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:29.280
with societal inequality?

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.529
I mean, this
particular data set--

00:49:31.529 --> 00:49:33.070
that only works for
places where they

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:37.256
have menus online because
that's what I used,

00:49:37.256 --> 00:49:38.380
but that's a lot of places.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.440
Right.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.480
It's mostly the first
World but there's still

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.740
inequality differences
in the First World

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.140
and you could see
if they correlate

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:44.870
with these kind of things.

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:45.860
That would be cool.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:46.870
AUDIENCE: In the
last election cycle,

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:48.070
there was that
famous thing about,

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:49.900
take his latte-drinking
whatever, whatever--

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.110
DAN JURAFSKY: Right.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:50.190
Right.

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.060
It was interesting
how much of that

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.620
was, like you said,
to serve identity

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.030
and self-signaling around.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.530
I'm not a Starbucks
guy or whatever.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.410
DAN JURAFSKY: We pretend that
there is no social class here

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:00.320
but there is clearly
social class here.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.790
AUDIENCE: I wonder,
could linguists

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:02.790
be part of the solution?

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:04.770
Could you find tricks
to turn it around.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:06.360
Does it have to be a populist
revolt or could there,

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.470
you know--

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.261
DAN JURAFSKY: Yeah.

00:50:07.261 --> 00:50:07.930
I understand.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.346
There are linguists-- so,
people like George Lakoff, who's

00:50:10.346 --> 00:50:13.050
a linguist who works with
the Democratic Party-- trying

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:19.890
to think about, for whatever
your message is, how to come up

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:22.630
with the right metaphors
that appeal to the thing

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:25.342
that you're trying-- it's
the same thing as propaganda.

00:50:25.342 --> 00:50:26.800
It's the same thing
as advertising.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.899
It's how do we get our
message across in the way--

00:50:28.899 --> 00:50:30.940
AUDIENCE: Come across as
aloof and professorial--

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.410
DAN JURAFSKY: Yeah.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.410
How do I get someone else
to think like I think?

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:35.150
That's language.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.650
Right.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.290
That's just telling them
a fact because I want

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:38.620
them to know this thing I know.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.287
Really, it all
boils down to that.

00:50:42.287 --> 00:50:43.620
In the bad end, it's propaganda.

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.960
In the good end,
it's persuasion.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.050
Yeah.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.150
Yeah.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.210
AUDIENCE: So you have lots of
examples of food influencing

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.470
language and linguistics.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:57.780
Have you seen cases
of the other direction

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.530
where you have the language
influencing the food more

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:02.319
directly?

00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:04.110
DAN JURAFSKY: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.420
Like a case where, because
it was named a certain way,

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.110
the food kind of evolved to look
like its name in some cool way.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:12.560
No but now I'm going
to think about it.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.220
And It would be a great case.

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:15.350
Yeah.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:18.800
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
your model on the Reddit pizza

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.400
requests.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.130
Using your probability
model, could you

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:28.350
come up with the perfect request
and would you get a pizza?

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:34.660
DAN JURAFSKY: Yes, so Tim
Althoff, the main author

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:38.130
on that paper, did, in
fact, try getting a pizza

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:41.440
by using all of the features
that were supposed to work

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.250
and he got a pizza.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.050
So the short answer is yes.

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:49.249
Of course, some of
these are honest signals

00:51:49.249 --> 00:51:50.540
and some are dishonest signals.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:54.370
So an honest signal is something
that you can't really fake

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:56.110
or that are more
difficult to fake.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:59.360
So if you really do need the
pizza because your true story

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.062
is that you're absolutely
broke and you can't get out

00:52:02.062 --> 00:52:03.520
of your house and
all these things,

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.400
you're more likely
to get the pizza.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.270
So some of these things
make a lot of sense.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:08.441
Others are more
linguistic dressing.

00:52:08.441 --> 00:52:10.190
AUDIENCE: I'm fascinated
by the way you've

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.270
traced the history
of particular foods

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.090
and I'm just curious if you
could tell us a little bit more

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.280
about your research methods.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.821
Where do you find
from those sources?

00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:18.650
DAN JURAFSKY: Yeah,
so the ketchup--

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:21.780
it's absurdly simple now.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.350
It was much harder when I
started 20 or 30 years ago.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:27.400
So, the ketchup story is in
the Oxford English Dictionary

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.450
and it was written
by James Murray,

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:33.850
the great editor of the
Oxford English dictionary.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:37.020
In 1890, he figured out that
ketchup came from Chinese

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:40.310
because a missionary
in China mailed him

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:43.017
an entry from his dictionary
because he had figured it out

00:52:43.017 --> 00:52:45.600
because he was talking to people
who were still using the word

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.920
to mean the fish sauce.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.110
It's, by now, died
out, but in the 1880s

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:52.060
it was still being used as a
word for a kind of fish sauce

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.730
and somebody wrote it down.

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:57.140
All etymology, you always
start with the Oxford English

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:57.800
Dictionary.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.427
But then it turns out that-- the
other thing the Oxford English

00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:02.760
Dictionary gives you is it
gives you the first citations

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.190
of the word.

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:08.890
So when I was teaching
at Boulder 20 years ago

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:14.590
and I wanted to look at that
East India Company guide

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:19.740
to Asia in 1690, I had
to request microfilm

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.722
from some other university, I
had to wait till it arrived,

00:53:22.722 --> 00:53:24.930
then I had to go downstairs
into the library basement

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.180
and read the microfilm.

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.454
And now it's on Google
and you can search it.

00:53:28.454 --> 00:53:30.870
So if you look at the book and
you could just look for all

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.286
uses of the word
ketchup in there.

00:53:32.286 --> 00:53:35.560
So the methods are much simpler.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.920
There's not that many
books written before 1800

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.370
and they're all there so
you can search them all.

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:43.020
So the research is
much more fun now

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.000
because you can do
it in your bathrobe.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.102
It's very exciting.

00:53:47.102 --> 00:53:49.560
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
different languages might have

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.960
different distributions of soft
versus sharp sounds and, if so,

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.355
what that would say about the
origins of those languages?

00:53:56.355 --> 00:53:57.730
DAN JURAFSKY: Oh,
great question.

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:01.720
So yes, there are certainly
different distributions

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.010
of all sorts of things
across linguistically.

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:10.880
I would say sound symbolism
is a cool phenomenon

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.420
but is probably not a strong
factor in language change.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.070
So these two things, the
front versus back vowels

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.859
and the soft versus the
sharp things, they do

00:54:21.859 --> 00:54:23.400
seem to affect
meaning and maybe they

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.820
were important in how
meaning might have evolved

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.750
for language, but there's
so many other factors that

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.304
have much more magnitude
in how languages change

00:54:32.304 --> 00:54:33.345
and how languages evolve.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.320
Simplicity of
articulation in the mouth

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.610
is a much stronger
drive for how words

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:48.300
change their pronunciation,
say, than this kind

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.139
of sound symbolic thing.

00:54:50.139 --> 00:54:51.930
That being said, there
are some differences

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:53.638
but they seem to be
cultural differences.

00:54:53.638 --> 00:55:00.770
So, for example, this
finding that carbonated water

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:04.430
is associated with sharp
sounds and flat water

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:08.440
with round sounds was
not true in a study

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.610
done in a tribe in Tanzania.

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:15.080
So that may be true
only in Western society

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:18.800
where we perceive carbonated
water as sharp, somehow,

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.200
or more acidic than flat
water but that's not

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.030
a universal thing, necessarily.

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:25.680
AUDIENCE: A follow-on to
the Reddit pizza question,

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:31.100
did you find that there was
any upper limit to how long you

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:35.500
could go or how tragic your
circumstances or whatever you

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.870
could go before people
started going like, OK,

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:42.560
this person wrote an entire self
post and then like 20 comments

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.350
detailing how terrible
everything is and how

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:47.999
they'll definitely repay you
with a car or something--

00:55:47.999 --> 00:55:48.790
DAN JURAFSKY: Yeah.

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:49.290
Yes.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:55.760
Basically the question is, is it
linear, or is there a ceiling,

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.790
or is it is there an
inverse u-shaped curve

00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:00.079
where if it gets too
long it dies out.

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:00.620
I don't know.

00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.054
We didn't look for that.

00:56:02.054 --> 00:56:03.470
We just looked for
the main effect

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.440
and there's clearly a
main effective of length

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.300
and evidentially but
it could very well

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:12.500
be that if you carry it too
far, you don't get rewarded.

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:17.510
AUDIENCE: I think someone asked
about food affecting language.

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:20.310
I can't help but think of
the scrambled eggs at Google.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:23.307
I've been comparing scrambled
eggs at different places.

00:56:23.307 --> 00:56:25.140
Sometimes they seem
really, really scrambled

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:27.330
and sometimes they seem
like they were turned over.

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:29.130
The word in Spanish
for scrambled eggs

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.420
is, huevos revueltos.

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.240
DAN JURAFSKY: [INAUDIBLE]
turned over, yeah.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.260
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering
if the person who's

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.860
making the eggs, if they're
thinking in Spanish revueltos,

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.360
they turn the egg over and they
don't really scramble it up,

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.617
like really scrambled.

00:56:39.617 --> 00:56:41.950
So this is like Whorf hypothesis
linguistic relativism--

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:43.980
DAN JURAFSKY: No, that's
a great question and--

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.520
AUDIENCE: My question?

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:44.890
DAN JURAFSKY: Yeah.

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:45.340
Yeah.

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:45.840
Yeah.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.270
If that's true, that's
a great example.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:52.340
There's another hypothesis,
so in some languages

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.690
the word for soup is masculine.

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:55.980
In some languages the
word of soup is feminine.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.690
And so you could look at
people speaking languages

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:01.250
with different genders for
different kinds of foods.

00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:03.380
Are those foods,
in fact, associated

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.510
with masculine or
feminine qualities?

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.480
So there's a cute study
showing that bridges--

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.370
I'm going to get this
wrong-- but German

00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:12.770
and Spanish have the opposite
genders for bridges and people

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:15.070
asked to associate
bridges with things

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.730
in German-- German
and Spanish speakers,

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:19.022
which way does the gender work?

00:57:19.022 --> 00:57:20.260
AUDIENCE: Female in German.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:20.960
DAN JURAFSKY: Female in German?

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.543
How about in Spanish?

00:57:21.543 --> 00:57:22.290
AUDIENCE: Male.

00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:22.530
DAN JURAFSKY: Male.

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:22.880
There we go.

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.380
OK.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.820
AUDIENCE: Portugese
it's feminine.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.320
DAN JURAFSKY: Yeah.

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.817
People gave word
associations for bridges

00:57:30.817 --> 00:57:32.400
very differently in
German and Spanish

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.450
and they were gender-biased.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:35.890
AUDIENCE: Just very quickly,
I think you'd appreciate this,

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.306
next time you're
in a supermarket,

00:57:37.306 --> 00:57:39.435
pick up a can of
macadamia nuts and think

00:57:39.435 --> 00:57:41.060
of the poor graduate
school student who

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.470
had to write the description
for something that

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:46.912
has basically no taste, or is
it very hard to describe taste?

00:57:46.912 --> 00:57:48.995
You can see that the person
was really struggling.

00:57:48.995 --> 00:57:51.280
DAN JURAFSKY: Tastes are
very hard to describe

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.170
and there are actually
huge differences

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:58.670
but languages, in general,
have very few words for smells,

00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:59.300
for example.

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.030
Smelling is just a very
hard thing, linguistically,

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.727
to describe.

00:58:01.727 --> 00:58:03.310
Most of the words
for smells are words

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:07.190
of the thing that it smells
like, like metallic, let's say.

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:08.830
Cantonese, my
favorite language, is

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.672
famous for having like
seven words for bad smells

00:58:11.672 --> 00:58:12.630
that are very distinct.

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:14.671
There's the moldiness of
bread, and the moldiness

00:58:14.671 --> 00:58:18.410
of wet things, and the
stinkiness of-- there's

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:20.077
the urine smell.

00:58:20.077 --> 00:58:22.160
So some of them just do
have more words for smells

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.830
but, in general, this seems
like it's very difficult

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:27.570
to turn taste and
smells into words

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:29.160
except by just
naming the object.

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.224
Yeah.

00:58:30.224 --> 00:58:31.890
MALE SPEAKER: Please
join me in thanking

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.240
Dan for coming to Google today.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.115
DAN JURAFSKY: Thanks.

00:58:34.115 --> 00:58:36.290
