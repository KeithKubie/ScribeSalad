1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,400
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,580
I'm sure by now all of you have seen
the New York Times article on the

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,780
intellectual dark web that ran last week.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,200
The article was a heavy lift trying to
define something that had been previously

5
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:13,861
undefined,

6
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:17,610
but it was a solid foray
into the mainstream for this
eclectic group of people.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,361
But the record,

8
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:22,890
I believe the intellectual dark web is a
diverse group of thinkers, interviewers,

9
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,491
Comedians,

10
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:27,900
and academics who've been thrust together
due to the intellectual curiosity or

11
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:32,190
desire for truth and an absolute respect
for our audience's ability to make up

12
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,910
their minds for themselves.
There's an old Groucho Marx line.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,750
I wouldn't want to belong to a club
that would have me as a member at first.

14
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,840
That was how I felt about
this intellectual dark web.

15
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:47,070
We've had a pretty great thing going
around this loosely associated group of

16
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:50,400
free thinkers, so why muck it
up with something more formal?

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,070
What I've come to see though
is that this alliance,

18
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:55,950
whether we have membership
cards in a clubhouse or not,

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,850
is now one of the most important
forces for reason that exists.

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,170
This crew of people from Harris to the
Weinstein brothers and from Shapiro to

21
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:08,430
summers have all come from different
walks of life and from different academic

22
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,660
and career backgrounds.

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,430
What I believe to be the one unifier in
this group is that we haven't been going

24
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,440
for easy answers to tough questions,

25
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,400
which make great soundbites but
offer little real world value.

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,110
We've all tried with success and sometimes
with failure to communicate ideas

27
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:29,310
that the mainstream media has either
ignored or misrepresented because they

28
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:32,670
often go against mainstream orthodoxy.
For example,

29
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:37,410
Sam Harris has tried to make a clear
distinction between ideas and people and

30
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:42,411
why we must be able to criticize ideas
such as Islam without becoming bigoted

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,300
towards Muslim people.
Progressive.

32
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:50,301
Bret Weinstein has tried to
show a progressive university
that fighting racism

33
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,590
through racist acts,
in this case,

34
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:57,420
a day of absence at school for White
people was actually itself racist.

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,040
Ben Shapiro has brought basic ideas of
conservatism to a younger generation that

36
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,070
is being indoctrinated
with postmodern viewpoints.

37
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,270
Christina Hoff Sommers has tried to show
people that the original intention of

38
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,021
feminism,

39
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:14,850
a true equality for women has morphed
into something about authoritarianism

40
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,140
rather than a quality.

41
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,370
All of these conversations are
important ones to have because without

42
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:25,050
conversation on these important issues,
the only option left is violence.

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,100
It doesn't mean that you have to agree
with anyone or everyone in this group of

44
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:32,490
people and they themselves disagree
on many issues with each other,

45
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,780
but the failure of the mainstream to
honestly and maturely talk about these

46
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,781
topics is exactly what drove so many
of you guys to us in the first place.

47
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,870
Contrary to many of the think pieces
written after the original New York Times

48
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:47,190
piece,
none of us,

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,180
none of us in this dark web
view ourselves as victims.

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,860
Actually it's the total reverse. We
were empowered by our ideas, in my case,

51
00:02:55,861 --> 00:03:00,250
the belief and the individual and want
you to be empowered to fight for what you

52
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:03,280
believe in as well even
when you disagree with us.

53
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,000
I do want to address a few questions
related to my role in all this discussion

54
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,270
as well as how I view myself
and the Rubin report is a show.

55
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,290
One of the criticisms by Barry Weiss and
the times article was in essence about

56
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,550
the gatekeeping responsibility that she
feels the members of the intellectual

57
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,870
dark web should have.

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,670
So where are the lines we draw as to who
we talk to and what are ideas which we

59
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,510
won't touch.

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,950
If a conversation we're having could
lead you down a rabbit hole of unsavory

61
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:30,580
people.

62
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,140
Is it incumbent on us to guard you against
this journey or is it on you as the

63
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:38,830
viewer to decide what ideas in which
people cause you to draw your online?

64
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,890
I think you know my position on this,
but I'll say it again.

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,080
I as an individual make the choices which
I think are intellectually honest and

66
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:48,760
then I believe that it is on you,

67
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:53,530
the viewer as an individual to decide
which people and ideas you like or dislike

68
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:56,290
and then follow up on these
people and ideas yourself.

69
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,650
I've always felt this was the right
way to look at being an interviewer,

70
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,900
but I know that not everyone
agrees with this premise,

71
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,850
including some people I like and respect.

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,410
I also have said many times before
along the way of making these decisions,

73
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:12,430
I may make mistakes, but I'll always
try to do what I think is right.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,510
There's also an interesting guilt by
association situation developing here.

75
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,020
My friend and mentor, Larry King,
the true king of interviewing,

76
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,700
could spend a week in 1994 interviewing
David Duke, Louis Farah can,

77
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,730
the cast of Seinfeld,
Michael Jordan and Frank Sinatra.

78
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,750
Nobody in their right mind ever felt
that that meant he was friends with or

79
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,660
endorsed all of these people's views.
Somehow,

80
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:38,080
and maybe this is just partly because
of Youtube and social media these days,

81
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,730
if we even talked to someone,

82
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,600
a certain segment of people think that
this automatically means you stand by

83
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,190
everything they've said and done.

84
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,610
I view this as patently absurd
and actually quite dangerous.

85
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,110
We have to be willing to push the sensible
boundaries of people were willing to

86
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:53,681
talk to.

87
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:57,910
Otherwise we're just talking to ourselves
and thus furthering the echo chamber

88
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:00,640
mentality that mainstream media fosters.

89
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,640
This brings me to a couple of people
who I've had conversations with.

90
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,450
I seem to get the most guff from having
to specific people on the Ruben report

91
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,090
as well as one interview I
did outside of this show,

92
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,140
I had Mike Cernovich on the Ruben report
in March of 2016 right when the Trump

93
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,930
phenomenon was first breaking through.
At the time,

94
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:18,940
I saw a lot of support online for Trump,

95
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:21,910
but I couldn't find any mainstream
people willing to talk about it.

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,230
Cernovich was one of the few vocal
supporters of Trump was a published author

97
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:27,850
and was catching fire on Twitter.

98
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,540
My conversation with Mike was totally
civil and actually quite interesting to me

99
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:36,490
as I hadn't heard anyone
articulate sensible support
for Trump before that point.

100
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,290
As the next two years unfolded,

101
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,400
Cernovich was a central figure in
conspiracy theories such as pizza gate,

102
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,400
while also being at the front
of Hillary's health issues,

103
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,960
which the media ignored until she passed
out in front of her SUV on that fall

104
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,890
day in New York City in 2016 and
let's not forget the Donna Brazil,

105
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,000
the former head of the DNC,

106
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:59,420
actually confirmed Cernovich's reporting
when she said that the DNC was thinking

107
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,600
about replacing Hillary at
one point during the campaign.

108
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,320
I didn't know about some of
Mike's distasteful blog posts,

109
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,740
which were written before I sat down
with him and I certainly can't be held

110
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:13,340
accountable for what anyone does
after they've been on the show.

111
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,960
What I can be held accountable for is
the way I conduct myself in an interview

112
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,070
with a controversial person,
which thus far I'm absolutely proud of.

113
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,000
One of the reasons I wasn't surprised
by the election of Donald Trump was

114
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:30,260
because that very conversation that I
had with Cernovich led me to believe it

115
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,490
was going to be a possibility.

116
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,380
So while mainstream media ignored figures
which were deemed deplorable and felt

117
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,760
that Hillary was a shoe in,

118
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,500
I dared have the conversations which
allowed me and hopefully you to see the

119
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,990
future more clearly.
The other interview,

120
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,050
which people were upset by was
my chat with Stefan Molyneux.

121
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,750
Stefan is heavily focused on race and Iq,

122
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:54,740
which is not a discussion on a pro at nor
one that I care to focus on that much.

123
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,770
Actually, I asked him this very
question during the interview,

124
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:02,750
what is it about race and Iq that you
feel the need to talk about it so much?

125
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,260
His answer in essence was that he
talks about it because he finds it so

126
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:09,020
troubling.
His answer is for you,

127
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,630
the viewer to either accept or reject.

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,540
Perhaps I could have poked
or prodded in another way,

129
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:19,541
but I felt trying to figure out why he
thinks as he does is what my job is.

130
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,620
The other important one to address here
is an interview that I did on the Alex

131
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,720
Jones show back in February of last year.

132
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,960
This was right after my
why I left the left video,

133
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:34,340
came out from Prager university and I
was getting a ton of press requests that

134
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,300
week. I also did Tucker Carlson on Fox
News and would've been just as happy to do

135
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:41,660
MSNBC or CNN had. They
invited me. My feelings,

136
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,890
as I've said in a bunch of live stream
since was that if I went on Jones his

137
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:48,440
show and it was aired live and unedited,

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,910
I might be able to bring my message of
conversation and classical liberalism to

139
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:53,960
Jones,
his audience.

140
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,370
I know it worked by the way because I've
received dozens of messages from Jones,

141
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:03,200
his fans who said how nice it was to hear
a different perspective and since then

142
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:06,530
they've been challenged by other
interviews that we do right here.

143
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,540
The criticism of course is that I somehow
legitimize Jones by doing his show in

144
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,120
the first place.
I don't see it that way myself,

145
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:19,121
but I'm sympathetic to the argument and
as Uncle Ben said to Peter Parker with

146
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,710
great power comes great responsibility.

147
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,440
I didn't think that a year
ago I had great power,

148
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:28,460
but as things have ramped up around here,
it appears that I do these days.

149
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,050
I should also remind you that there are
plenty of people who wouldn't want me to

150
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:37,850
sit down with Jordan Peterson because
they say he's all right or Sam Harris

151
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,300
because they say he's anti
Muslim charges that I,

152
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:44,810
and you know absolutely to not be true.

153
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,030
This is the dangerous place we're all in
when we all act like the gatekeepers of

154
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:54,050
others' capacity to make decisions
for themselves. With all this in mind,

155
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:57,180
I'd like to offer up three Ruben
report rules going forward. One,

156
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:00,000
I will keep the focus more
on ideas that on people.

157
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,980
This won't always be totally possible,

158
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:06,150
but I'll always do my best to honor that
principle to I'll continue to interview

159
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:07,830
potentially controversial people,

160
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:12,000
but will increase my efforts to shed
light on ideas that they have that I'm

161
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,230
concerned or unsavory.

162
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,770
I'll give them a chance to explain
themselves as I believe that sunlight,

163
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:20,520
of course, is the best disinfectant.
If I'm cordial to someone,

164
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:22,410
it doesn't mean that I endorse them.

165
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,970
I think we're in serious
danger of eliminating
conversations that are necessary

166
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:31,740
to understanding the big picture because
some of us may feel compromised by

167
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,700
simply listening.

168
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,170
Trump's election and Brexit were only
surprises if you turned up your nose to

169
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,870
listening to half the electorate.
Three,

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,340
I'll keep trying to build bridges in some
places where others would reflectively

171
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,210
burn them down.

172
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,590
This is always tricky because I naturally
don't want to legitimize bad actors,

173
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:54,180
but I'll always try to see if there's
room to make inroads with someone where I

174
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:56,760
may have been trained to think
that they were my sworn enemy.

175
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,010
My bridges won't be built everywhere,
though.

176
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:02,820
We've got to have some standards of
decency to make sure that the idea is we

177
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:07,680
want to build upon here are in sitting
on a mountain of quicksand as what we do

178
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,420
here.
It gets put more into the spotlight.

179
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:13,890
I have more of a responsibility to live
up to the ideals that I've laid out here.

180
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,340
I'm never gonna make everyone happy
and it's why at the end of the day,

181
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,500
I can only answer to my own conscience.

182
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,190
I believe that we are starting
to win in the public square,

183
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,640
and this will now bring all
sorts of new people our way.

184
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,080
2018 is undoubtedly the
year of unusual alliances.

185
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,860
The invites have been sent out, so now
let's see who shows up to the party.
