00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:08.584
(soft music)

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:14.227
- [Narrator] We are the
paradoxical ape, bipedal, naked,

00:00:14.227 --> 00:00:18.394
large brained, long the master
of fire, tools, and language,

00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:25.163
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:29.330
aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:34.283
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:37.456
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:39.539
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.764 --> 00:00:42.675
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.425
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:49.842
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:54.009
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.905
an exploration made possible by

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:00.738
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:18.305
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.908
- So, I'm going to extend some

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:39.121
of the points that Rusty raised,

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.973
but in particular, in the
context of this structure,

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:44.035
which is the cerebral cortex.

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:46.121
So, I think most would be familiar,

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:47.637
this large folded structure here

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:49.008
at the top is the cerebral cortex.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.835
It makes up about three quarters

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:54.094
of the volume of the human
central nervous system

00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:56.727
and I think most people in this room

00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:58.671
know functionally how important it is.

00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.675
It is, as I say, this sort of executive

00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:03.415
and integrative center of
the central nervous system.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:06.020
And it's a huge amount of real estate,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.007
it does important things, so it's

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:09.945
affected by a variety of diseases

00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:12.172
that have their etiology, or their impact,

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:14.167
at different stages in age, starting from

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.500
conditions with a very
early onset in childhood,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.521
like autism, and right through
to diseases of later life

00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:22.539
like dementia or stroke
and those kind of things.

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.173
So, what I'm gonna talk about today

00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:28.683
is how do we start dealing with questions

00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:30.246
about how do you control the development

00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:32.293
of the cerebral cortex,
particularly in terms of size,

00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:34.765
as of sort of a simple concept.

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.490
And as I'm sure you've heard
in previous Carta symposiums,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.311
and you'll hear this afternoon,

00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:42.838
there's a lot of debate about
sort of cognitive capacity

00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:46.016
or cognitive ability and
its anatomical underpinnings

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:48.962
and there is bigger brains
make you smarter and so on,

00:02:48.962 --> 00:02:51.085
but there's some degree of
grievance around the idea

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:53.703
that certainly more neurons
give you more processing power

00:02:53.703 --> 00:02:56.101
at its most basic rate.

00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:58.165
Complexity is probably
very important as well,

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.831
in terms of elements that
one can build circuits from

00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:03.827
and what you do with
them, so raw real estate

00:03:03.827 --> 00:03:05.332
is also quite important.

00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:08.580
And that becomes very obvious
when you start looking

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.753
at these sort of three
cherry picked primates here.

00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:15.073
We've also got humans,
chimp, and rhesus macaque

00:03:15.073 --> 00:03:17.221
and what we're looking at
here is the number of neurons

00:03:17.221 --> 00:03:19.697
in each cerebral cortex, where you can see

00:03:19.697 --> 00:03:21.596
that humans have roughly
three fold as many

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:24.884
compared to chimpanzee,
even though, in terms

00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:28.082
of actual developmental time, so you know,

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.979
I could ask how long do
humans take to develop,

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.203
easy one for us to all
answer, nine months.

00:03:32.203 --> 00:03:35.314
The chimp is roughly the
same, but you still end up

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:37.129
with a brain which has a cortex

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.277
with about a third of
the number of neurons.

00:03:39.277 --> 00:03:41.931
Then, macaque, which is shortened again,

00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:44.596
but has you know, ten fold fewer neurons.

00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:46.664
So, there's a very basic
development ability question,

00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:49.019
is how do different organisms generate

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.019
different numbers of neurons
within their cerebral cortex?

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.662
And at what level is it controlled?

00:03:54.662 --> 00:03:56.472
And by understanding
that question of control,

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:59.195
can we start thinking
about how you might then

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:01.183
evolve these differences
between different species

00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:03.552
and it plugs into the kind of genetics

00:04:03.552 --> 00:04:05.455
and that kind of work that you'll

00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:07.165
be hearing about later in the afternoon.

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:09.130
So, to think about this, you've

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.726
got to think about developmental biology,

00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:12.350
which is how do you actually make things

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.689
in the cortex in the first place.

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.892
And this is a picture from a mouse brain,

00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:19.644
where this red thing, this is a

00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:21.037
slice through the mouse brain,

00:04:21.037 --> 00:04:22.331
this will be the outside,
this will be the inside.

00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.780
What all these little red blobs are

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.808
is these are what we would
call progenitor cell.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.638
For the sake of simplicity, I'll

00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:30.018
call them cortical stem cells.

00:04:30.018 --> 00:04:31.618
So, these guys aren't neurons.

00:04:31.618 --> 00:04:33.168
This is before you have
any neurons in your brain,

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:34.645
or in this case, the mouse brain.

00:04:34.645 --> 00:04:36.644
This is a slice this way through

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:38.224
one half of your cerebral cortex.

00:04:38.224 --> 00:04:40.206
So, the skin would be
out here, for example.

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:41.978
There's a hole in the
center of the brain here.

00:04:41.978 --> 00:04:44.125
And these guys are lined up in a row,

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:47.657
and what happens is
these cortical stem cells

00:04:47.657 --> 00:04:49.885
go on, and this is done in black,

00:04:49.885 --> 00:04:52.273
to generate cortical neurons that are

00:04:52.273 --> 00:04:54.983
arranged in layers over time.

00:04:54.983 --> 00:04:57.055
So, you do this inside or develop them

00:04:57.055 --> 00:04:59.352
to make the deep layers where
you make the upper levels

00:04:59.352 --> 00:05:01.866
and so on, and this is a
very stereotyped program

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.430
that plays out in every
single mouse in the same way.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.182
And in a mouse, it takes about six days

00:05:06.182 --> 00:05:08.361
to generate all of these cells.

00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:10.870
So, that's fine, so you've got

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.171
one bib population of stem cells.

00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:13.631
There's a very interesting
biology about them,

00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:15.526
how they diversify, but at heart,

00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:17.872
these guys make all of
this cast of neurons.

00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:21.067
So, when you're thinking
about how you build a brain,

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:22.599
you've gotta think about how they do this,

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.155
but a key concept within
this is what is the output

00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:27.832
of each one of those cortical stem cells?

00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:30.598
And there's a principal
in development here

00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:32.645
where we talk about a clone.

00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:34.449
Now, this isn't Dolly
the sheep type clone,

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.160
this is a different clone, just to

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.763
make your life slightly more complicated.

00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:40.809
At the very basic idea, what
is in a mind experiment,

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:43.668
if you could label one of those red cells

00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:46.699
on the previous slide
with an indelible marker,

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.875
so every time it divides,
it's daughter cells

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.678
inherit the indelible marker and then

00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:52.327
develop and play out over time.

00:05:52.327 --> 00:05:53.769
What you'd end up doing is
labeling every single cell

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:56.279
it made, just passively
by letting it roll.

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.876
So, that's the idea.

00:05:57.876 --> 00:05:59.052
So, you label it all.

00:05:59.052 --> 00:06:00.830
So, if we're doing this
in the cortex, we take,

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.731
we know what the start of
cortical development looks like,

00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:04.563
we've got these progenitor cells lined up.

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:07.463
We call this an epithelium, basically,

00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:09.807
and we know what it looks
like at the end of development

00:06:09.807 --> 00:06:11.770
where you've got these layers of neurons

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.887
and we've got little labels
that let us tell them apart.

00:06:13.887 --> 00:06:16.473
The mind experiment,
and the real experiment,

00:06:16.473 --> 00:06:19.310
is you then label one of these
guys with an indelible marker

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.289
and let time play out.

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:22.790
And you do this and you look at

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.022
thousands and thousands of these.

00:06:24.022 --> 00:06:25.805
What do you find as something very simple?

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:27.236
If you do this before
you make any neurons,

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:29.861
you end up with purple spots
that cross all the layers

00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:31.636
and make all of the cells.

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:33.876
And what that tells you is you've got this

00:06:33.876 --> 00:06:36.546
fundamental principle where
each cortical stem cell

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.849
will make a clone of cells that populates

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.978
all of the different neuronal types.

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:43.188
And so what that tells you then,

00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:45.547
is that your clone is this sort
of atomic unit of building,

00:06:45.547 --> 00:06:47.759
a structure within the nervous system.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.853
So, let's do the cortex
example I've given here,

00:06:49.853 --> 00:06:51.488
it's actually true in your spinal cord,

00:06:51.488 --> 00:06:53.957
your eye, and so on, and what that does

00:06:53.957 --> 00:06:56.405
is it gives you an idea of
thinking about this problem

00:06:56.405 --> 00:07:00.532
of at a kind of comparative
development label,

00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:03.043
how do you make a bigger cortex in, say,

00:07:03.043 --> 00:07:05.241
a human compared to a macaque or a chimp?

00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:07.074
And it's actually very simple.

00:07:07.074 --> 00:07:09.232
So, if you think about it in clonal terms,

00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:12.555
either have more clones,
so increase the number

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:15.060
of stem cells before you
ever even make the structure,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.034
or actually change what
each stem cell does

00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:20.375
in terms of what the
output of its clone is.

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.819
So, make the sort of production
from that clone larger

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:26.033
and it's a way of ending
up with more neurons.

00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:29.183
An example I've done
on here, this is mouse,

00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:31.976
and my mice are, for
want of a better term,

00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:33.379
relatively simple in this respect,

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:34.939
which is, they have phases.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:37.132
This is your starting stem cell,

00:07:37.132 --> 00:07:39.742
it proliferates and then
it has this linear program.

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:42.207
It expands itself, then
it starts making neurons,

00:07:42.207 --> 00:07:44.256
during which, it depletes itself,

00:07:44.256 --> 00:07:46.975
'cause you're eating up
stem cells to make neurons,

00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:48.622
and then they switch to
make these supporting, or

00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:51.080
these second cell type in the
nervous system, the astrocyte,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.189
which is actually
functionally very important.

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:54.648
And it's a nice, linear program.

00:07:54.648 --> 00:07:57.007
So, one of the big
questions in the field is

00:07:57.007 --> 00:07:58.925
when you start getting to primates,

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:00.984
how complicated does this get?

00:08:00.984 --> 00:08:02.671
Do you just take the simple template

00:08:02.671 --> 00:08:04.170
and just make more of them?

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.295
And you just generate
more real estate that way,

00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:08.375
or do you diversify just to
make it much more complicated?

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.378
And how would this work?

00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:12.040
And if you can understand that,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.603
then you can start plugging in

00:08:13.603 --> 00:08:15.938
the kind of molecular genetic stuff,

00:08:15.938 --> 00:08:17.756
like, well how does this
work within all this?

00:08:17.756 --> 00:08:19.455
And the question of how do you study this,

00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:21.706
and labeling single cortical stem cells

00:08:21.706 --> 00:08:23.691
in the human might get you in trouble

00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:25.301
in most jurisdictions at this point.

00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:29.468
So, we did something similar
to what Rusty spoke of,

00:08:30.538 --> 00:08:32.429
where in this case, we were very much

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.072
focused on the cerebral cortex.

00:08:34.072 --> 00:08:36.540
So, we started with human, and we took

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.849
human embryonic stem cells, or these

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:42.199
induced progenitor stem
cells that Rusty mentioned,

00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:44.267
and what we essentially
worked out how to do,

00:08:44.267 --> 00:08:46.196
using principles of developmental biology

00:08:46.196 --> 00:08:49.889
is make the cortical, just
the cortical neural stem cell

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:53.026
and they formed into pretty
rosettes within this.

00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:54.962
And what we found is, we
could put them into the dish

00:08:54.962 --> 00:08:57.571
and they would replay this
generating the layers of neurons

00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:02.027
on exactly a timescale that
they do in normal development,

00:09:02.027 --> 00:09:05.727
but in utero, which was
a bit of a surprise.

00:09:05.727 --> 00:09:07.829
And they actually go on and they make

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:09.613
these beautifully connected networks.

00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:11.730
So, these are neurons which
are firing away happily,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.648
these human neurons.

00:09:13.648 --> 00:09:15.712
So, this was a bit of a surprise to us

00:09:15.712 --> 00:09:17.619
that they observed rules even
though they were isolated

00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:20.273
from the sort of whole embryo.

00:09:20.273 --> 00:09:23.424
So, we then extended this and said,

00:09:23.424 --> 00:09:25.255
what happens if we look at
these different species?

00:09:25.255 --> 00:09:27.659
And so, this was worked on by

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:30.433
Tomoki Otani when he was in
the lab, and this is actually

00:09:30.433 --> 00:09:32.713
collaboration with Carol
Barchetta, who you heard

00:09:32.713 --> 00:09:36.470
mentioned by Rusty, and
actually, Eliza Courno,

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.186
at the Primate Research
Institute up in Seattle.

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:42.811
What essentially we did was
work out how to make pure cortex

00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:46.269
from these cerebral cortexes
from these different species

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:49.131
in the lab and this is
John Gerden, by the way,

00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:51.266
down at the bottom, for
those of you who don't know,

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:53.041
but we don't actually have John's IPSL's.

00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:54.576
We think there's a market for them,

00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:56.654
but a rather dodgy market
for them, but anyway.

00:09:56.654 --> 00:09:58.599
So, this is chimp, and these are actually

00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:00.832
two different species of macaque,

00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:02.192
because we could get access to them.

00:10:02.192 --> 00:10:03.824
So, we could make the cortical stem cells

00:10:03.824 --> 00:10:05.900
and they could replay development

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.295
and what we found was each species,

00:10:07.295 --> 00:10:10.677
just as it does in sort in utero,

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:13.471
has a developmental time scale,

00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:16.510
which it observes in the
lab, by which I mean,

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.232
the green cells here, so the bottom line

00:10:18.232 --> 00:10:21.019
of each one of these graphs here is time

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:23.775
and the green are those
deep layers of neurons

00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:26.065
and the red is these later born neurons,

00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:28.004
so every species makes green before red,

00:10:28.004 --> 00:10:30.604
but what happens is the macaque makes red

00:10:30.604 --> 00:10:33.091
much sooner than the
human does and the chimp.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.335
And actually, the human and the chimp

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:37.370
look remarkably similar at the resolution

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.266
that we can look at with
these kind of assets.

00:10:39.266 --> 00:10:41.403
So, in fact, the rest
of what I'll talk about,

00:10:41.403 --> 00:10:43.425
we just look at human and macaque,

00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:45.172
because actually human and
chimp look very similar,

00:10:45.172 --> 00:10:46.652
which is actually kind of reassuring,

00:10:46.652 --> 00:10:48.472
'cause you'd want them to
look very similar, given

00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:50.910
what you've heard about in
terms of genome similarities.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.524
So, every species has a schedule

00:10:53.524 --> 00:10:55.805
and I should say the schedule
is remarkably similar

00:10:55.805 --> 00:10:57.665
to what happens in utero.

00:10:57.665 --> 00:10:59.152
And we extended this to all sorts

00:10:59.152 --> 00:11:01.080
of other analysis, which I
won't go into detail with here,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.184
including when do they make neurons,

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.746
when do they make different
classes of neurons,

00:11:04.746 --> 00:11:06.515
and the kind of electrophysiology
you heard about,

00:11:06.515 --> 00:11:08.392
when do they mature, when
do they form networks.

00:11:08.392 --> 00:11:10.892
So, what this provides us now,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.821
is a platform to start asking

00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:15.520
the mechanistic questions I mentioned,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.489
which is, well how does the stem cell

00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:19.490
that actually generates the neurons

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.699
within each species behave
in terms of making a cortex?

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:25.634
And what that involved
doing is, in the lab version

00:11:25.634 --> 00:11:28.989
of the experiment I just described,

00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:31.043
where we label just one stem cell

00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:32.857
in a population of tens of thousands

00:11:32.857 --> 00:11:34.830
and actually watch that over time

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.068
and then look at lots of
individual stem cells.

00:11:37.068 --> 00:11:40.286
And to do that, we use a
trick where we take a virus,

00:11:40.286 --> 00:11:43.705
which is essentially,
we've sort of damaged,

00:11:43.705 --> 00:11:45.633
so this virus can infect a cell,

00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:47.838
but then it can never get back out again,

00:11:47.838 --> 00:11:49.906
so it brings the marker,
the marker then stays,

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.923
so these are what we call
replication of common viruses.

00:11:51.923 --> 00:11:54.283
This is a rosette made up of,

00:11:54.283 --> 00:11:56.314
each one of these blobs is a stem cell.

00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:57.708
We labeled one stem cell.

00:11:57.708 --> 00:12:00.354
And then we follow this
thing dividing over say,

00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:02.693
10 days within the lab, and
we can reconstruct the clone.

00:12:02.693 --> 00:12:06.639
And one of the challenges
here is, as we mentioned,

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:09.334
primate development is
very long and very slow.

00:12:09.334 --> 00:12:11.174
So, to give you some kind of benchmark,

00:12:11.174 --> 00:12:13.523
mice will take over the
world, and the reason

00:12:13.523 --> 00:12:15.204
mice will take over the world is they do

00:12:15.204 --> 00:12:17.942
all of their development
in less than 21 days

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.169
and they'll generate litters of, well,

00:12:20.169 --> 00:12:22.298
you know, those of you who've
been unfortunate enough

00:12:22.298 --> 00:12:24.781
to have your garage overrun by mice,

00:12:24.781 --> 00:12:28.160
as opposed to humans, and we
know how long humans take.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.667
So, what happens is,
these, and I mentioned that

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.652
mice will make the cortical
neurons at six days,

00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:34.865
humans will do it over
four, five, six months,

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:37.314
and so you get an idea that
these clones become enormous.

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:39.693
So, we have to look at
them in blocks of 10 days,

00:12:39.693 --> 00:12:42.718
so sort of the first 10 days,
the second 10 days, and so on

00:12:42.718 --> 00:12:46.203
and the first thing we can do
is start measuring, you know,

00:12:46.203 --> 00:12:48.004
what do they make and how do they make it?

00:12:48.004 --> 00:12:49.933
And as biologists, we tend
to think biology's a mess.

00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:53.128
There are kind of rules,
but they're a bit dodgy,

00:12:53.128 --> 00:12:55.297
and it's a bit tricky to make sense of it.

00:12:55.297 --> 00:12:57.395
It's all about extracting order form chaos

00:12:57.395 --> 00:13:00.484
and physicists think
we're a bunch of Luddites

00:13:00.484 --> 00:13:02.135
and that we just can't think straight

00:13:02.135 --> 00:13:04.926
and there are clearly
physicists in the audience,

00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:06.361
I heard some snickering.

00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:09.024
And a colleague and friend
of mine and can be true

00:13:09.024 --> 00:13:11.369
as a physicist called
Ben Simon says actually,

00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:15.446
"You biologists, actually if
you take the complex data,

00:13:15.446 --> 00:13:17.644
you do some very important
principles underlying them."

00:13:17.644 --> 00:13:19.137
And said, "Right, prove it."

00:13:19.137 --> 00:13:20.200
And so, he did.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.198
So, he took all this kind of data

00:13:21.198 --> 00:13:23.265
and he ripped them apart and rather than

00:13:23.265 --> 00:13:25.219
me boring you for 10 minutes
with all the details,

00:13:25.219 --> 00:13:26.444
I'll give you the punchline,

00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:28.131
which is what I told him to tell me, too,

00:13:28.131 --> 00:13:31.324
which is that essentially,
when we start looking at,

00:13:31.324 --> 00:13:33.224
for example, this is how many stem cells

00:13:33.224 --> 00:13:35.749
are within a clone over time, and this is,

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:39.080
in the first 10 days, for
example, 20 days, gray,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.184
the next 10 days, black
is the next 10 days.

00:13:41.184 --> 00:13:42.942
And you see actually in
each window of 10 days,

00:13:42.942 --> 00:13:45.058
humans all look the same, and
what's happening over time is

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:47.918
within the clone, they're
actually expanding the number

00:13:47.918 --> 00:13:49.961
of stem cells in the clone
while making neurons,

00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:52.438
so they're kind of, the whole
thing's growing exponentially.

00:13:52.438 --> 00:13:55.203
Macaque's start off
looking very like human

00:13:55.203 --> 00:13:58.032
and then they crash, and what
that really means is that

00:13:58.032 --> 00:14:02.355
essentially, the macaques
stop making neurons

00:14:02.355 --> 00:14:04.773
much sooner than the humans do.

00:14:04.773 --> 00:14:06.108
And it's a very simple thing.

00:14:06.108 --> 00:14:07.251
What it means is that the humans

00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:08.581
make these big, long extended clones,

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.803
which allow them to make far more neurons

00:14:10.803 --> 00:14:12.456
over a much longer period of time,

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:14.735
so they'll make more neurons per stem cell

00:14:14.735 --> 00:14:16.360
and they do it kinda clever ways,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.406
stuff that I wouldn't get into today.

00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:21.779
Now, that's all fine and
it's very descriptive,

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:24.498
and it raises the second question,

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:26.882
which is well fine, how does this work?

00:14:26.882 --> 00:14:29.490
Now, there's a very broad
distinction we like to make,

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.786
which is, how much of this biology

00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:33.693
is controlled intrinsically?

00:14:33.693 --> 00:14:35.839
Whatever that means in terms of mechanism.

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:38.430
And how much is controlled externally?

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.899
Signaling environment,
you could boil it down to,

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:42.728
you know, this sort of nature nurture,

00:14:42.728 --> 00:14:44.063
who do you know, what do you know,

00:14:44.063 --> 00:14:45.330
but you get the basic principle.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.701
I once heard that one referred to

00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:47.950
the European versus the American model,

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.399
but I couldn't work out which one

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:50.558
was meant to be certainly
not complementary,

00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:54.549
but anyway, so in this
case, what we can do,

00:14:54.549 --> 00:14:56.288
is we can essentially do transplantation.

00:14:56.288 --> 00:14:59.452
Now, clearly, I'm not gonna get a license

00:14:59.452 --> 00:15:01.818
to transplant macaque cells into humans.

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:05.008
And probably not the
other way around either,

00:15:05.008 --> 00:15:07.188
but what we can do, is we can
do transplantation in the lab,

00:15:07.188 --> 00:15:10.323
where we can label up,
say, the human stem cell

00:15:10.323 --> 00:15:12.795
and the macaque stem cell and then move,

00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:15.049
say one and 1,000 of those
into the other environment.

00:15:15.049 --> 00:15:16.634
So, essentially, you're exposing them

00:15:16.634 --> 00:15:18.167
to the other species' environment

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:21.309
and asking, now what will
they do at its simplest.

00:15:21.309 --> 00:15:24.164
And we can then roll them out
over time and do all our maths

00:15:24.164 --> 00:15:26.343
and essentially, all I'm showing you here

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:28.217
is that nothing changes, so
I give you the punchline,

00:15:28.217 --> 00:15:30.291
which is the number of
neurons a stem cell makes

00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:32.486
is actually intrinsic to the species.

00:15:32.486 --> 00:15:34.352
It's got nothing to do
with the environment.

00:15:34.352 --> 00:15:35.795
At the resolution of this assay,

00:15:35.795 --> 00:15:37.553
with all sorts of caveats around it

00:15:37.553 --> 00:15:39.376
with what we're measuring,
by which we mean,

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:41.082
if I move macaque into
human, macaque doesn't care.

00:15:41.082 --> 00:15:43.413
It'll still make what it wants to make,

00:15:43.413 --> 00:15:45.162
when it should make it.

00:15:45.162 --> 00:15:46.295
And similarly, with the human,

00:15:46.295 --> 00:15:47.538
if I move human into
macaque, it'll still generate

00:15:47.538 --> 00:15:49.479
a certain number of cells.

00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:51.877
So, that's quite striking,
but it's about numbers.

00:15:51.877 --> 00:15:54.182
There's a second readout,
which is very important,

00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:56.225
which I've rather glossed over,

00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:58.316
which is this, what neurons do you make

00:15:58.316 --> 00:15:59.818
and when do you make them?

00:15:59.818 --> 00:16:00.836
So, this idea's switching
from the early born neurons

00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:03.283
to the later born neurons I mentioned.

00:16:03.283 --> 00:16:05.638
And this was a think I
mentioned, so we make layers,

00:16:05.638 --> 00:16:08.993
we mentioned this, but
also, the humans here

00:16:08.993 --> 00:16:11.295
switch to making these red guys

00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:14.045
much later than the
macaque do, for example,

00:16:14.045 --> 00:16:16.100
and we can look at this, as
well, within these systems,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.838
and again, what we find is that,

00:16:17.838 --> 00:16:19.417
if you look at these pie charts,

00:16:19.417 --> 00:16:21.852
this pie chart looks similar,
identical to this pie chart.

00:16:21.852 --> 00:16:24.016
What we're doing here is
putting human into human,

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:25.885
or human in macaque or vice
versa, macaque into human,

00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:29.251
or macaque into macaque and essentially,

00:16:29.251 --> 00:16:31.245
the species don't care.

00:16:31.245 --> 00:16:33.067
They're going to do what
they're going to do.

00:16:33.067 --> 00:16:35.243
They're sort of like my
11 year old son, you know.

00:16:35.243 --> 00:16:37.210
In the sense that, it doesn't
matter what environment,

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.359
there's a certain amount of pigheadedness.

00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:42.454
So, what this means is,
and I don't know where

00:16:42.454 --> 00:16:44.552
they get it from, I blame his mother.

00:16:44.552 --> 00:16:49.344
Anyway, so what we've learned
from these kind of studies

00:16:49.344 --> 00:16:53.990
is that the primates do
development certainly differently

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.141
and I should say something,
which I haven't the time

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.251
to go into today, they
also do it differently

00:16:58.251 --> 00:16:59.595
to small mammals like mice.

00:16:59.595 --> 00:17:02.448
So, this idea that you're
early on, you're expanding

00:17:02.448 --> 00:17:04.477
your stem cells while
making your own stuff,

00:17:04.477 --> 00:17:07.796
that's quite different
compared to small mammals.

00:17:07.796 --> 00:17:09.393
So, there's sort of a big mammal problem

00:17:09.393 --> 00:17:11.044
in addition to the primate problem.

00:17:11.044 --> 00:17:12.549
And this is something which, as a field,

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:13.758
we haven't really grappled with yet.

00:17:13.758 --> 00:17:15.703
You know, there are such huge differences

00:17:15.703 --> 00:17:17.293
between the kind of
tools we use in the lab

00:17:17.293 --> 00:17:19.151
and the model organisms we
study in the lab, like mice,

00:17:19.151 --> 00:17:21.100
in term of their biology.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.885
And primates, some of them
aren't to do with being primates,

00:17:23.885 --> 00:17:27.274
they're to do with being large,
slowly developing mammals

00:17:27.274 --> 00:17:28.796
more than anything else.

00:17:28.796 --> 00:17:30.182
But even within this difference,

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.891
what we find is that
humans then are different

00:17:31.891 --> 00:17:33.805
to the smaller brained primates.

00:17:33.805 --> 00:17:35.720
And that essentially, these differences

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.399
I mentioned are cell autonomist.

00:17:37.399 --> 00:17:39.596
And so what that then leaves us that

00:17:39.596 --> 00:17:41.170
and this is where we are now,

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.153
is this provides us a platform to ask

00:17:43.153 --> 00:17:44.580
what are these mechanisms?

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.538
How do we control what a stem
cell does and how it does it?

00:17:47.538 --> 00:17:49.881
And our goal is we can identify

00:17:49.881 --> 00:17:51.475
what those differences
are, what those sort of

00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:53.957
cell intrinsic controls
are, and clearly, yes,

00:17:53.957 --> 00:17:55.909
we all think about genetics and there is

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:57.965
an element to that, but you know,

00:17:57.965 --> 00:17:59.554
we have to be quite broad minded about

00:17:59.554 --> 00:18:01.987
what the kind of cell
intrinsic clocks are.

00:18:01.987 --> 00:18:04.076
The looking at those
differences will give us insight

00:18:04.076 --> 00:18:05.544
into evolutionary differences,

00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:08.095
by sort of thinking backwards.

00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:10.436
I should say there's
another side to this, too,

00:18:10.436 --> 00:18:12.151
which is, the mechanism that controls

00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:14.832
differences between species of brain size

00:18:14.832 --> 00:18:17.478
are also very important
in two clinical contexts.

00:18:17.478 --> 00:18:19.350
One is control of brain
size developmentally,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.140
which has a very strong impact

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.941
on various intellectual disabilities

00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:25.524
and the other side is obviously

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:28.291
different types of brain cancers,

00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:30.401
because it's the same
biology there as well.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.225
So, I'll just finish there

00:18:32.225 --> 00:18:33.607
and just to say, I mentioned this,

00:18:33.607 --> 00:18:36.317
this was led by Tomoki
Otani who was in the lab

00:18:36.317 --> 00:18:38.684
not too recently and is
now with McKenzie in Tokyo

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:41.297
and is carried on by two
other people within the lab

00:18:41.297 --> 00:18:43.999
that I've mentioned here, and just to say,

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:46.478
none of this work would've been possible

00:18:46.478 --> 00:18:49.285
without Ben, Rusty, and
Carol, so thank you very much.

00:18:49.285 --> 00:18:51.535
(applause)

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:55.728
(upbeat music)
