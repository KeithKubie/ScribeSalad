00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.660
This is where the knowledge
representation helps a lot.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.770
The semantic network knowledge
representation provides a level of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.480
abstraction at which the problem
gets represented and analyzed.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.390
So, although this particular diamond
y could have been displaced here or

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.900
a little bit further, it could have been
of this size, maybe a little smaller,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.340
a little bit larger.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.150
The semantic network really
doesn't care about it.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.240
With the level of extraction which
a semantic network is dealing,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.900
y gets expanded, and
that is all that matters.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.280
An important point to note here is
that any knowledge representation

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.440
picks a level of extraction at
which it represents the world.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.010
There's a lot of power in
it because that knowledge

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.820
representation ignores things that
are at a low level of detail.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.010
And therefore the problem-solving
method doesn't have to worry

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.540
about those things.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.570
So it is not the knowledge
representation alone

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.570
that solves the problem, or the problem
solving method that solves the problem.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.080
It is the knowledge representation and
the problem solving method

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.710
coupled together that solve the problem,
that provide the reasoning.
