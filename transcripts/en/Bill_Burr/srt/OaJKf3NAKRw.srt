1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:01,880
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:06,130
Just before Friday.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,190
and ahhh

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,070
just checking in on you. Just checking
in on you. See how you're doing.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,660
You having a good week? Hmm?
Are you enjoying yourself?

7
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:24,380
I hope you having a good fucking week.
Uh, I hope it's going better than my week.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,690
I hope it's going better than my week.
Uh, uh, I don't know if I'll fuck it.

9
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:34,040
I'll get right into it. Uh,
unfortunately a, a great comedian,

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,510
great friend. Just one of the best people
I've ever met, uh, passed away yesterday,

11
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:42,950
Charlie Murphy and um, can't
fucking believe it, man.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,080
Really cannot believe it. I had, um,

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,930
hadn't talked to him in about
a year and I had no idea that,

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,250
um, that he was sick
to that level. So, uh,

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,970
I think it's still hitting
me, man. It's unbelievable.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,060
I'm so sick of fucking hilarious.
Great people dying.

17
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:06,590
I was actually talking with a friend of
mine the other day. I was just like, dude,

18
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:09,770
to hacks ever die.
Like what?

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,570
When was the last time somebody who
truly sucked at standup comedy died?

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,770
It's fucking unbelievable.
What a hex eat this. If I was,

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,740
if I had the fucking money, I swear to
God I'd get, I get to man, you know,

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,190
maybe it's all, you know, it's funny,

23
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,470
I actually realize halfway through
this and I'm still alive so,

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,880
and I kind of shitting on myself.

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,650
Somebody's got to put together
the hack diet, whatever that is.

26
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:39,740
Those motherfuckers
lived to be like 85 90.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,110
Um, anyways, another just giant.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,010
I mean you're talking about somebody who,

29
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:53,330
when I met him in 2004 had
already lived like four lifetimes.

30
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,690
He had four unbelievable books from his
childhood to his teenage years and early

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,350
twenties living in Brooklyn and all this
shit that he did to go into the navy,

32
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,980
to his brother blowing up and then him
getting out of the navy and working

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
security on the tour and then morphing
in to like a screen writer and actor.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,200
And then he gets on the Chappelle show
to just was sitting around is what was

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,100
told to me. Just telling
these stories of, you know,

36
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,250
back in the day, hanging out with
everyone from prince to Rick James,

37
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:36,590
you've seen all those things,
stories about Whitney Houston,

38
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:40,310
he just sugar ray Leonard,
Oj Simpson.

39
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,830
He just like that sketch,

40
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:46,130
which to this day I'm telling you is I
think it's the greatest sketch of all

41
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:49,910
time that Charlie Murphy,
True Hollywood story about Rick James.

42
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,830
And uh,
I remember him telling me afterwards,

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,620
I was just like, dude, how true is
that shit? And he goes, well yeah,

44
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:04,090
obviously we exaggerate. Like, you know,
he didn't, when he hit me in the head,

45
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:08,860
I didn't have a unity, you know,
thing on my head. But he's like,

46
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,640
yeah he did. They were like in
the back of the limo or something.

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,860
And you know, Rick just kind of went
to, he was trying to be like friendly,

48
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,611
but I was like,
ah,

49
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:23,611
they kinda hit Charlotte like hard enough
in their head that I guess Eddie and

50
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,900
his friends were waiting for
Charlie react cause they knew her.

51
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:30,130
Charlie was Charlie Kinda got mind
fuck for half a second thinking like,

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,880
you know, I'd stomped the shit
out of anybody who did this to me,

53
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,540
but it's Rick James. And it kind of took
them like an hour before he was like,

54
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,950
fuck this. And uh, you know, obviously
didn't kick them up on a dresser,

55
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:45,670
but he did fucking rough them up
a little bit in the back room.

56
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,050
And then when the security came in,

57
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,930
he did bring them over to the window
and said that he was going to throw them

58
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:54,670
out. They came anywhere near him. So, um,

59
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,000
yeah, man, it's just really a really
a sad day. And that guy was just,

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,330
he was such a great guy.

61
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:04,510
I told you guys this story before
he saved my fucking ass one time.

62
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,520
Um, I was trying to get in shape,
right as always, as I always am.

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,480
I was living in New York City and uh,

64
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,410
I started going down to Gleason's
gym out in Brooklyn, you know,

65
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,380
cause I didn't want to get all fucking,
you know,

66
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,920
I was Joe billary swank is I believe what
I was calling myself or they will give

67
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:27,400
me shit cause I just went down there and
an actor performer kind of way to get

68
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:31,330
in boxing shape without ever fucking,
you know, getting my head kicked in.

69
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,940
So when I told Charlie that I was
going down to Gleason's gym, he goes,

70
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,830
I just to go going, oh yeah, okay, okay,

71
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:43,660
I'm going to tell you what's going
to happen because you can be,

72
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,480
oh they have about six weeks
and out of nowhere he goes,

73
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:49,880
some dude's going to come up to you
and start telling you and be like, ah,

74
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,710
how long have you been boxing for? Really
are man, you nice man. You know, Shit,

75
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,410
we had a spar some time. He
goes, he's going to fucking,

76
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:00,160
he's gonna amp you all up
to get you into the ring.

77
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:04,090
So he can try out a bunch of shit that
he does that he's not dumb enough to try

78
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:07,450
out on a professional boxer and he's
going to beat the fuck out of you.

79
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,930
And I was just saying, and he just
started laughing at me. I'm like, yeah,

80
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,540
I get the fuck Outta here. Get the
fuck I do. I'm telling you. I was like,

81
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,170
whatever time he said, three weeks or
six weeks, it was like right on the nose.

82
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,230
I'm sitting there,
you know when the heavy bag,

83
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,930
like the comedian slash sometimes actor,

84
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:27,070
I am hitting the bag like
[inaudible] right in this fucking,

85
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,370
this black dude shredded comes over.
He's like, Yo man. He goes, oh,

86
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,720
how long have you been a long
bit box before it was like,

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,410
it was almost like Charlie's
head was on the guys head.

88
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:42,550
He said the exact same thing.
Oh Man, you're nice man.

89
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,170
You gotta to get in the
fucking ring and all this shit.

90
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:48,660
And I just started laughing.
I just started laughing. I
was like, I go man, fuck,

91
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,450
I'll fuck. I'm a fucking comedian. Um,
horrific. I'm not getting in there.

92
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,900
So you can try out all your new shit on
me. And the guy just started laughing,

93
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,680
threw his head back, laughed,
and then walked away. And
it was so weird. I was like,

94
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,360
that guy was going to
beat the fuck out of me.

95
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,790
So then I told him to Charlie
thinking that he would be amazed

96
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,480
that you know, you know, like, like dude,
I called it, what the fuck did I say?

97
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:18,280
And he was just like, yeah, he's like, I
told you he did that like a million times.

98
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:21,760
Like he just had this, um, I dunno,

99
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,000
he had like this fucking 6 cents.

100
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:29,020
And I tell you some of those other
stories, the Oj one in the Whitney one,

101
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,250
but I just feel like those they hit,

102
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,160
those were his stories to tell and if
you wanted to share with me would have,

103
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,003
but um,

104
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,380
so I can only tell you the ones I
remember when we won that Chappelle show,

105
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,180
it was me, you know, Don,
Al Ashy, Larry and him.

106
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,930
And Charlie was the guy who actually
showed me that you could write a new hour

107
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:53,170
of material in two months.
Because I saw him do it

108
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,390
cause he blew up, you know, on
on the second season with that,

109
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:03,490
that Rick James Story
and um,

110
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,900
all this Darnell came up with the idea
for the tour. He was like, you know,

111
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,130
your son, we should go out
on tour, blah blah. So, you
know, we'll have bill open up,

112
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,070
you know, we'll bring you
out Charlie, you can host it.

113
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,640
And then Donna would close and um,

114
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,960
I think Charlie maybe did,
this is the fucking balls this guy had,

115
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:26,961
I think he did maybe six shows before we
did our first show and I believe it was

116
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,280
Dayton,
Ohio.

117
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,310
And we didn't even have an agent
and Donald book the thing. And uh,

118
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,430
so we went out there.
I was like the only white guy in the room,

119
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,700
in the theater and we went out there and
Charlie hosts anyone out and just went

120
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,170
[inaudible] you know,
uh,

121
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,240
I'm Rick James Bitch or something
like that place went fucking nuts.

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,320
He told like two more jokes brought me
out and everybody's looking at me like,

123
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:57,120
who the fuck is this guy? Is this one of
the writers? This is one of the creators.

124
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,630
Is this the agent on the tour?
Nobody had any idea who the fuck I was.

125
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,130
So I did my bullshit.

126
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,210
Charlie came out and told another couple
of jokes and then don [inaudible] close

127
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:09,540
to show. Everybody had
a great time. And um,

128
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,810
afterwards we went into the back room.
Okay,

129
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:15,930
now we're in the green room and there's
like 20 people in there and we don't

130
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:19,860
know anybody. Once again, I'm
the only white dude in there. Me,

131
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,720
Don Allen Charlia sitting at this table
and all of a sudden these two guys come

132
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:27,840
up. What was it? One
Guy, I can't remember,

133
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,900
and just had like a fucking bag
of cash from that night's Gig Ngo.

134
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,670
He had it all bandaged up and just threw
it on the table and it all spilled out

135
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,480
and it was just sitting there and I
was sitting there like, what the fuck?

136
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,510
And Don Allan,
Charlie didn't move so I didn't move.

137
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:48,610
And I was just sitting there
as a white dude, like going,

138
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,650
I guess this is how black
people pay each other.

139
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,280
Give them 20 complete
strangers in the fucking room,

140
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,250
drinking and partying and then just a
bunch of cash because I felt like we

141
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:03,120
robbed a bank or something.
So we sat there,

142
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:06,930
I swear to God for at least one more mob,

143
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:11,400
deep song of whatever the fuck was
playing at that time. The Thong Song,

144
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,950
I can't remember whatever it was.
And uh,

145
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,980
finally I forget it was either done l
or Charlie just soda casually sat up and

146
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:23,610
just took the money, put it in the
bag and then put it down by this side,

147
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:26,160
which made me relax a little bit more.
And I was just like,

148
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,730
I was sitting there going like, I don't
think I'm ready for this fucking tour.

149
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,640
This is not the way you
get paid at the funny bone.

150
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,030
So we stayed there maybe for like another
half hour and then we finally go up to

151
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:47,301
get up to leave and we're just walking
out and you just feel in eyeballs,

152
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,280
honest cause we got this big bay,
it's just cash

153
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,030
and we out go out.
We get into the fucking,

154
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,730
they had rented this fucking Limo Force.

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,760
We got in the car in the second the car
doors closed and we start driving away.

156
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,560
Darnell just goes, Yo, what the fuck?

157
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:09,090
And Charlie was just freaking out and
I just started and I was just like,

158
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,840
just the epiphany that they were actually
freaking out too. And I had no idea.

159
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,310
You'd never know looking at their face.

160
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm sure everybody in the room knew that
I was fucking uncomfortable. And um,

161
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,510
suffice to say, after that we
got ourselves an agent and uh,

162
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,890
we got, we got paid by check after
that. It was just us in the room.

163
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,540
Um, and that was that infamous tour
where they would always make fun of,

164
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,890
that's where that Joe came from. You know,
this motherfucker got five shirts. Um,

165
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,500
that's where that one came from because
they always made fun of my clothes.

166
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:44,310
And that was that time when I was hung
over and I just didn't want to get in the

167
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,700
car and deal with this shit.
And they had taught me about the Itis,

168
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:52,410
which was basically when you eat like a
food that's rich in flavor but low and

169
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:54,600
fucking nutrition,
your body,

170
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,900
you end up taking a quick cat nap
cause your body literally has to shut

171
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:01,350
everything else down to figure out how
to digest what you just put in your

172
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,530
stomach. So I was standing outside this
hotel hung over as hell and I just saw,

173
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:09,120
oh my God, we were doing
that. He used to be the, uh,

174
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,250
it was the Chicago Zany and then
you do Mount Vernon. And then, uh,

175
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,360
Saint Charles who was his three
Gig run through Northern Illinois,

176
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,770
I forget where we go eat.
We just on detainees and I was too drunk.

177
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,840
I had a fucking headache. And I'm walking
out trying to get fresh air going.

178
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,430
I'm going to deal with these two fucking
assholes all the way up to this club.

179
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,610
It's a two hour drive. The nonstop
going to be fucking hammering me.

180
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,170
And I looked down the street and there
was a Popeye's and I just remember them

181
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:39,600
telling me about the itis and I said,
fuck this. And I went down there,

182
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:43,380
I got a bucket of chicken biscuits
with the mashed potatoes, gravy,

183
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:44,191
all of that shit.

184
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:47,940
And I brought it into the end of the
fucking limo and I was like, hey guys,

185
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,630
I got some food that Ah, Greg, you know,

186
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,470
and they dug and they started eating and
I didn't have one piece of it and swear

187
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,340
to God within 20 minutes they
were both asleep. And I had, they,

188
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,490
they slept the entire fucking
ride. I basically poisoned. Yep.

189
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,650
Temporary, well, he's in him and
it worked like a Goddamn charm.

190
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,600
And, um, I dunno, I just,

191
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,860
I had to say something about Charlie.
It's still too sad to really get into the,

192
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,520
the feelings all this, but
um, he truly was one, not only

193
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,780
one of the most amazing just
lives of anybody who ever lived.

194
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,410
He just was truly one of
the best guys that, um,

195
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,673
okay.

196
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,060
That I haven't met in
this business. So, yeah.

197
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,810
All right. That's it. No getting
emotional on the podcast. Okay.

198
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,310
So let's get back to the
rest of this stuff here. Um,

199
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,100
the fucking Bro, what's up? Finally,

200
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:59,890
the first time all year we beat
the auto was senators. All right.

201
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,760
Beat him when it counts.

202
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,170
Like I didn't even realize they
beat us all four times this year.

203
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,490
We'll congratulations Ottawa
capital of Canada, you know?

204
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,260
But unfortunately your full game
winning streak came to an end,

205
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,480
right when it counted. You got the
weirdest part of that game was,

206
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:22,190
was listening to a loud,
Otto was senator fans.

207
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,830
You know,
I actually know something.

208
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,390
I used to think that their
fans would just land.

209
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:29,870
But the real reason is Ottawa is
just like Washington DC, you know,

210
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,410
it's the capital. So there's a bunch of
people from all over the fucking country.

211
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,700
So there's a bunch of cannot fans,
flames, oiler fans, all I bullshit.

212
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,850
They're sitting there, they don't give
a fuck about the senators, you know?

213
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,850
So it's not the people, the
Ottawa, they're great people.

214
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,430
They got a little fucking river
that they freeze over. Yay.

215
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,570
Skate to work does not. They made, it's
like a fucking fantasy land up there.

216
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:54,130
It's one of my favorite cities. I actually
like it for some reason. They say, Otto,

217
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,930
we're the city. That fun.
Forgot. Well, you know what?

218
00:13:56,931 --> 00:14:00,830
I always have a great time when
I write go there. Um, and um,

219
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,790
what a fucking great game though.
Ottawa play great.

220
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,340
I by no means think that victory means
that we're going to win the series.

221
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:09,920
I think it's gonna I
think it was two to one.

222
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:13,540
I feel like the whole series is going to
kind of go like that and it's going to

223
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:18,110
get even uh, not even shippy. I
think it might get a little ugly.

224
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,270
Um, Brad Marshawn back from his
suspension doing what he does.

225
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,100
Score and big goals and
big games. Um, hey nia,

226
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,223
come here.

227
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,880
I didn't know that. Brad
Marshawn. Where are you?

228
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,460
Yeah,

229
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,390
I had never heard this nickname.
Brad Marshawn.

230
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,070
They call them nose face killer because,

231
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,880
and I thought I was being so original
when I called that guy on a fuck.

232
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:54,880
That's because he sounds like Ghostface
killer. I'd call them pot roast.

233
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,890
Pot Roast. Face killer. Is that one
on one? Yeah. Here I am on my hat.

234
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,210
Look at that parallel thinking
parallel thought. There you go.

235
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,580
Is that what it's called? What?
Do you know what more than I do?

236
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,970
Is that what said behind my back?
No,

237
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm doing all right. I'm doing
all right. The Bruins one.

238
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,310
I haven't been on the podcast in a while.
No, you haven't. Once you grab the mic,

239
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,180
grab a microphone. Come on
in here. I'll hit pause.

240
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,560
All right, we're back. I got the
microphone and everything like that.

241
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:32,210
The lovely Nia alo. How they hell?
Hell, how the Hell You Ben? I know.

242
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,300
Long time. No fuck no podcasts. No,

243
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,950
I don't think you've really
been on that much since. Uh,

244
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,000
we had the little princess here.
That's right. Who's sitting here.

245
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,910
You know what's funny is because you know
her hair still shorten everything and

246
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,510
all of our friends had boys and
they just gave us all their clothes.

247
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:51,530
Everyone keeps thinking it's a boy
and she just came in.

248
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:56,531
Now she's got a little shirt on that is
like a classic that looks like a 1955

249
00:15:56,871 --> 00:16:00,740
Chevy pickup truck on itself.
Yeah. So a everyone, yeah,

250
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:03,230
everyone thinks that she is a buoyant,
but that's okay.

251
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,330
She will not be defined
by her gender, right? Yes.

252
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:10,160
She will put on a dress for God's sakes.

253
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,840
I liked the little play close though.
I think they're so cute. Well, yeah,

254
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,640
I mean I don't care either way. You
know you look good to me. That kiddo.

255
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,300
Yeah. She doesn't have to be like
all frilly and princess looking.

256
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:27,470
I'm not really into that anyway. What
are you saying? What do you mean? Well,

257
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:30,830
at some point you mean you've got to put
her with some girls clothes, right? Yeah.

258
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,080
I have plenty of girls clothes for her.
Okay. You scared me there. Okay. Why?

259
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,600
What do you, why? Why are you
scared? Well made at some point.

260
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:42,170
You can't say ever walking around
and like, you know Pete Carroll,

261
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,050
dockers and stuff. You know who
will now we're not going to do that.

262
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,010
But like I think cause
she's daddy's little girl.

263
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,270
Little girls look cute and like little
boy clothes, like the little tomboy. Look,

264
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,380
I think that's cute.
You know what is? Yeah.

265
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,000
As long as she has clothes on and two
diapers clean at this point, I'm happy.

266
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,070
Right. I believe, I don't care what
it is exactly, but now, so anyways,

267
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,990
she wore a cute little dress on
Easter, remember? Oh yes, she did.

268
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,160
[inaudible] she went to East to
west. So these two born it. Yeah.

269
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,030
Suddenly we go to church or anything like
that. We're heathens. Oh, by the way,

270
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:19,970
Leah, did I tell you about that
great band I saw the other night?

271
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,200
Oh you mean the one with
Dave [inaudible]? Yeah. Uh,

272
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,720
gave a ticket drum lessons from one of
the best drummers in the world right now.

273
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,460
Shout out to Davy.
That's right.

274
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,210
He plays drums in this band called the
night game. Or they have a new single out.

275
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:35,550
If you want to check it out its own
iTunes. It's called the um, yeah,

276
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,520
I'll field and uh,

277
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:41,900
I saw them play like a quick half
hour set the other night. Right.

278
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,230
Uh, over capitol records were
across the street from that.

279
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,000
Remember when I walked over and then had
my, my issue, have you done in x period?

280
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,120
Your issue? I've been doing cardio
like a madman. Maybe in some,

281
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,630
some readers can to ease of advice
about this. I blew cardio like a madman,

282
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,060
but like Jordan shorts on and I don't
know what happened. My balls, my ball,

283
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,270
one of them was just,

284
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,270
I just did too much walking in one day
and I had a little chafing issue on one

285
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:12,570
side of the old bag there.
And uh,

286
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:16,500
it did not affect my enjoyment of
the band cause the, I walked like,

287
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:20,520
it's like a two mile walk over
there or something. Right.

288
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,500
What are you doing?

289
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,960
You're looking at me or you're looking
at her two miles over and then two miles

290
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:29,340
back in that way after I'd already done
an hour of cardio. So the next day, uh,

291
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,630
I was walking like I wrote a horse for
like six weeks straight. But anyways,

292
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:37,180
I went over and saw this show and
they have a singer, rr Martin Johnson,

293
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,980
amazing singer, and then
two killer guitarist. I hope
they say these names right.

294
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,460
Uh, Karen, Jay,

295
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,910
you go colonian Max Bernstein.

296
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:51,720
And then they had a guy sitting in
on base, uh, Andrew Peruzzi and uh,

297
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,200
two days solid fucking admit.
It's really like poppy type stuff,

298
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,940
but the level of musicianship, how
great they all sounded live. Um,

299
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,990
definitely check it out.
Once again, it's called, uh,

300
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,810
the name of the band is the night game
in the single is the outfield and that is

301
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,550
out right now.
So can we talk about your chief balls?

302
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,080
Huh? Oh, it's done. It was just,

303
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,520
it was one and done was one
day of uncomfortableness.
Oh, you're okay now. Oh yeah.

304
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,433
Oh good.
Okay.

305
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,910
I was suggesting that bill get gold bombs
medicated powder because I just felt

306
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:27,660
like that was just something that you
just dust on your balls a little bit.

307
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,681
He kept saying,
you know,

308
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:32,800
like when those great chefs put the
powdered sugar on top of the confections,

309
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,770
do that little, no, I think that's
your balls a little bit to keep it.

310
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,590
That's not for chafing.
It's not, no, that's,

311
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,490
but I thought that's what people
who have itchy balls, itchy balls,

312
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,920
and they're sweaty and so therefore
it's all going have like a culture.

313
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:51,840
Like you're going to make bread,
but it's your ball red ball.

314
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,100
That's disgusting. No, this
is just a, yeah. Chafee,

315
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,920
you know what I mean?
Gary Chafee. All right,

316
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,360
chairman in here, the
third Mike. Um, anyways,

317
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,320
anyways, yeah. So that is uh, that is all,

318
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,690
but this is gonna be difficult and he
now when you know, we got the third,

319
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,500
but I don't know, well this is why Peter,
the heads me why, you know, on sweater,

320
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,260
like we haven't been on the podcast and
while, because they, you know, I have,

321
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,480
I have to watch her. Yes, she is. Look
how happy she is. She's such a happy baby.

322
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,170
I'm actually psyched that she's really
chill and so people keep saying she's a

323
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:29,640
really relaxed,
happy baby,

324
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,300
which is unbelievable considering she
lives with me and I've been doing,

325
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,960
I've been going really hard with
the whole trying to be chill. Right.

326
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,320
You want a good job? I'll go and
really hard with the Chili. Yeah. Hey,

327
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,730
go ahead and take it to the extreme.

328
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,410
I know you said to me the other day of
did you, have you been meditating lately?

329
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,860
That's what I know. I'm getting a little
up to the precipice there. Press a piece.

330
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,850
Yeah. So I got a, I got a fucking, I got
to handle that type of stuff. So, um,

331
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,850
hey,
the Celtics got the number one seat,

332
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,740
the number one lead number one seat in
the east. So we get some seed, s, e, e,

333
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:06,790
d c like what I put in you to have
that baby step. This is like, um,

334
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,220
this is, yes, that's a good point. The
balls are going to definitely be tough.

335
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:16,120
We're not trying to look
past him and, uh, it's just,

336
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:19,360
was a great night as far as, uh, you know,
considering the tragedy of yesterday,

337
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,740
the broads when the Habs lose weight.
But tell me what a seed is again,

338
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,220
just like, you know, they'll
have whatever, there's 10 teams,

339
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,160
you just ranked the number one seat
and each other the best record.

340
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,570
Why do they use the word seed?
You know what? I don't know.

341
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,610
All I'm saying that right. It's not easy.
Yeah. The number one seat. Yeah. The uh,

342
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,650
I don't know why they call it
that is what is the position,

343
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,840
what do you want to call it?
And then when you get to the class,

344
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,620
you're rewarded for having your best for
having the best record where number one

345
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:50,680
gets to play, the lowest person
that just made the playoffs.

346
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,700
So you get to kind of go in easier
way to go to class and it's also,

347
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,110
it kind of makes it so when you get to
the later rounds that the best teams are

348
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:04,000
playing in, the stakes are even higher.
This is to go to the NBA final. Gotcha.

349
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,890
This is to go to the, uh, you know,
this is the when the whole damn thing,

350
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,420
except in hockey, hockey of course they
do everything weird where, you know,

351
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,740
for whatever reason, um, like
Pittsburgh has to play the blue jackets.

352
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,640
And I would have thought that
I was like the capital's,

353
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,350
I would've thought they
would've got Toronto. I Dunno,

354
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,710
I don't get how they do it over there,
but that's definitely hockey. But we won,

355
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,000
we won the shit in a, sorry,
I'm all distracted today. Um,

356
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:33,670
I have to read some advertising. There's
anything you want to give me. Shit about.

357
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,190
My balls are better than it
was only one of them. Good.

358
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,210
Well I'm glad you used what I gave
you for them. And I'm also like a,

359
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:44,500
a a, a, I'm like a plane.
You know what I mean?

360
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,060
Like one of those big jet planes, they can
lose one engine still fly. So I'm fine.

361
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,990
I'm fine. Actually. I know. Why was
it only the one ball? I don't know.

362
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:54,910
Why is one ball vaguer than the other?

363
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:58,270
Is that why it's like rubbing
a little bit more? No.

364
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,650
Is it like how problem your
boobs are different sizes now?

365
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:05,530
It probably has more to
be with my awful posture,

366
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:08,230
my back being fucked up on one
shoulder in front of the other one.

367
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:09,070
I'm just a mess.

368
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,150
I'm all for all this year as a hanging
onto the anger and not stretching. Um,

369
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,480
just to twist it up, mess. But I'll
tell you, I have been stretching.

370
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,810
I would go to a chiropractor and of of,
uh,

371
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:23,890
I'm a sous regularly for almost like
a year. And had I not done that,

372
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:26,910
God knows what would have had,
I probably would have lost a nut.

373
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,450
Why still need to know.

374
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,290
Cause I asked you and you weren't
sure what a jock strap is used for.

375
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,110
Jock strap is using as a
cup now control it. It, it,

376
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,350
uh, it holds all your, your junk,

377
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,020
but just has no consideration
whatsoever for your ass.

378
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,860
I've never understood them.
I've never run a storm.

379
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,390
It's sort of the male thong. And if you
don't want like guy underwear lines,

380
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,700
I don't know why your ass is all the
way out. I don't know what it is.

381
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:06,060
I don't know what the fuck sports though.
It's called a jockstrap. It's for a job.

382
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,020
Well, let's look it up. Let's
have this on my search engine.

383
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,570
What's the deal?
What's the deal with what's with y?

384
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,370
Jock straps. Yeah. All

385
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,520
right. A jock strap is also known
as a Jock, jock straps, straps,

386
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:27,170
supporter or athletic supporter.

387
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,300
It is an undergarment for supporting the
male genitalia during cycling sports or

388
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:36,590
other vigorous physical activity. Oh,
it's a sports bra for your penis. Yeah.

389
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:40,610
For your junk. So now flop
all over the place. Yeah.

390
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,530
But evidently you don't mind if your ass
is hanging out and now commonly worn is

391
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:50,420
everyday underwear. Fashion jobs
perhaps appear in variety of colors.

392
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,620
Do they? You say dope when now you
got to go image Nia. Here you go.

393
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,490
Do you want to look at some designer
jock straps? I actually really do like,

394
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,920
oh hey. You'd go, wow, there's one for
you. It's a great asset. And that guy,

395
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,450
I'm like, God, that was like
reversed Victoria's secrets.

396
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,590
That was fucking horrible. All right. And
as your answer, if you had a nice ass,

397
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,910
it's like you have to have a nice ass if
you've got a model, those things, right?

398
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,190
Yeah. It's like if somebody
wants to look at, you know,

399
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,730
the same way a woman with the flat ass
and the Thong is one of the worst things

400
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:23,810
you could ever see.
Yeah.

401
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:27,380
You need to do literally see you
don't like it doesn't disappear.

402
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:31,370
You can see the hole.
He can see the whole thing.

403
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,130
MMM, that's right. All the
way to the front. Okay, well
I got to do some sort of a,

404
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,980
I've got to do a little reading out loud
and I don't want my daughter to know

405
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:41,540
how dumb I am.
So if you guys,

406
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,750
I'm not kicking you out but I'm just
saying if you want to block your ears,

407
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:49,070
ear muffs here. Um, you
read to her all the time.

408
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,520
He reached great. I actually do a good
job with those books, but you know,

409
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,400
he also ad Lib throughout the entire book.

410
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,770
Kind of like the way you do advertising.
You don't have to make weight links.

411
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,660
Let's was like this weird thing
where the guys, the ducks,

412
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,720
like an absent seat father,
he has like six kids with their,

413
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,590
he's that guy taken off going to Boston
common, I'll meet you over there.

414
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,190
I was like, I trust you. You're a good
mother. And she's just like, yeah,

415
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:18,170
well you know, I am. She did
everything but say, yeah,

416
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:19,190
this is where I belong.

417
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,460
And granted the book was working in
like the 30s to the forties and then the

418
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:27,050
little mermaid. Yeah, the
little mermaid anywhere. Yeah,
that whole thing was weird.

419
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,780
It's like she looks up love at
first sight with the prince. Yeah.

420
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:33,590
He's got his own Effient boat.
Can't curse when she's here.

421
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,950
I probably already did though.
Huh? That's okay. That's all right.

422
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,590
Nice little cutie pie girl. Kirsten. I
think it's hilarious. That warms my heart.

423
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:48,750
No. Alright. Upside everybody.
Okay, here's some advertising.
Sorry. Okay. Hey guys.

424
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,900
I discovered something really big.
I'm going to tell you,

425
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,000
I have no idea what this is,
so I haven't discovered anything.

426
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:54,834
I'm just reading this shit.

427
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,160
The best new way for you to buy travel.

428
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,470
It's called upside.com.

429
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,360
Here's why I love it even though I've
never seen it and why everyone I tell

430
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:09,690
loves it.
Every time you buy a trip at upside,

431
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:14,691
you save a ton of money and they give you
an Amazon gift card worth 100 200 even

432
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:21,330
$300 every time.
That makes no sense.

433
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:24,000
How would they make any money?
Like a plane ticket costs 300 bucks.

434
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,550
You get a hundred bucks back.
What are you flying people's express?

435
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,890
He on the old value jet there. The way,
uh, the way they do it is really clever.

436
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,030
Upside bundles,

437
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:40,680
your flights and hotels together for one
low price bundle prices saves money of

438
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,290
the how they do it. Especially
like giving you the secret formula,

439
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,970
especially on business travel,

440
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:48,630
so upside gives you
free Amazon gift cards.

441
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,750
I'm telling you,
if you're a frequent business,

442
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,040
if you're a frequent business travel,

443
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,580
your company saves a ton of money and
you can get f get thousands a year,

444
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,620
thousands a year just for buying your
air and hotel together at upside plus,

445
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,200
Oh God, this is so long. You still
get all of your miles, Jesus Christ.

446
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,000
These guys are given the whole thing away.

447
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:14,100
You'd be crazy not to check out
upside.com if you're shopping the business

448
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,590
pretty for business or personal travel.

449
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,220
It takes just three months to see how
much you saved by buying your flights and

450
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:21,990
hotels together at one low price.

451
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,080
I can't believe it's taken
this long for someone to do it.

452
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:30,120
Evidently possibly possibly discussed
speaking with Jay Walker here.

00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:14,490
why would they give you all of that and

Nia. Is it isis and I don't think.

manipulate me to pick her up. And you know

they don't have to be complicated
with number if you're not crazy.

It's a crazy stitching. Diamonds and
embedded studs. You're not alone.

533
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:39,770
I know they're taking a
shot at true religion jeans.

534
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,790
Are they still in business or now
they are. They must be in Charlotte.

535
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,020
That is still in business at like the
local kitty parks with those are dad jeans

536
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:51,950
now, right? They're all baggy and
shit and all that. It doesn't anymore.

537
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,670
Nobody wears. It's over.
There was only two cut.

538
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,570
There's only two people I knew that
bought those in my, in my, my cool,

539
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:03,040
rich vos rich vos and Bobby Kelly,
both of them,

they're into those disco clothes.
Designer jeans. Absolutely.

541
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,640
I think one of them had their name
in DMLS on the back of his ass.

542
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,483
I swear to God he did.

543
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,140
I think rich vice in the back of his true
religion jeans had first white guy on

544
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:22,090
def jam and genuine Diann Mills. Was He?

545
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,600
Was he the first white guy
on def jam and you just made,

546
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,640
that's what was on his head
shot when I first met him.

547
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,840
Pat hilarious was a picture of them doing
def jam. Oh, there you go. That's right.

548
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,860
To show you making history, breaking
barriers, right. Richard Vase.

549
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,650
This is one small step for a white man.

550
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,050
One giant leap for our white men
comedians. Ah, I Ms. Rich Vos. I don't,

551
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,730
I hope you hear this rich. Go Fuck
Yourself. He's not going to hear it.

552
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:52,810
He's out on a golf course.
Rich Vos has been like officially retired.

553
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:56,690
The way he's been living since I
met him. He lives the good life. He,

554
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,770
she goes more than Trump, by
the way. I love that term.

555
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,680
It's just golf in his ass off.
It's the greatest thing ever.

556
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:08,330
You can just show you how like,
like that job is not that big a deal.

557
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,690
Clearly not to him. Oh.
Oh, are you talking about,

558
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:15,680
you don't think Obama was
playing highlight? He played
some nerd sport. Yeah.

559
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,760
Avowedly basketball. No, he didn't.
He shot one free throw every election.

560
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,400
Every was like, oh my God. Hey

561
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,860
stabbing like he crossed somebody
over. Alright. Distilled,

562
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,630
pronounced distilled offers luxury
grade denim at an affordable price.

563
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,490
Jeans that would normally
cost you hundreds.

564
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Dst GLD has at just 75 bucks
that utilize the same fabrics,

565
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:46,310
factories and wash houses as the best
known brands and designers while skipping

566
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:51,860
the markups and the middlemen. The result,
I was going to say, hey, you little kid,

567
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,990
what brought them
together? The result, pure,

568
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,230
unadulterated denim without
the retail run around.

569
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:03,230

l d.com and see where minimalist design

570

573
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,950
It's like a timeshare for your junk
up your ass. Debbie gets to the house,

578
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:39,630
as on denim clad celebrities
in Gq and vogue or Jay Leno.

579
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,120
Who is it denim,
coed celebrity that you know,

580
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,770
John Travolta during urban cowboy

00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,280
New Light. They were done them all
the time. They're cladded in it.

582
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:56,150
Cladded clad distilled as the only place
in the u s you can get this quality of

583
00:36:56,311 --> 00:37:00,750
denim for this price point. You can find
their amazing selections of outerwear,

584
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,490

the same principles of high
grade materials at low end

586
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,730
cost of a sudden I got the hiccups.
Even celebrities are wearing distilled.

587
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,190
Um, I've got a pair name, the gene
style and they've, the fit is perfect.

588
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:21,090
You know what, I can't fit in them
yet. Really? I thought you did.

589
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,740
Maybe I did when they first gave him.

590
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,530
Then I went up to a buck 90 when we
went over to Europe and it was smoking

591
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:30,490
cigars and he now stands look nice though.

00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,190
Really? What? When does
this album coming out?

610
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,270
June 2nd that's my birthday.
I always forget. I always
either thinking of, sorry,

611
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,610
the second or the third. Do
you really, is that true?

612
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,710
You're not that important to me.
Oh my God.

613
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,550
But you know what I used to think
of your birthday was on the eighth,

614
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,610
but we're not good with dates. No,
we're not. We don't do anniversaries.

615
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,310
Start when's are, don't
tell these people. But two,

616
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,950
can you name our wedding anniversary?
I always get confused. So do I. It's a,

617
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,650
it's fine if we tell them no. Okay.
Something has to be for, I have like, no,

618
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,270
somebody has to do for us Gary. Well,
whenever show pictures from it. Um,

619
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,430
so you don't know. I do. It's either,
is it start with a one or a two?

620
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,360
It does with the two,

621
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,330
but I don't know what
the second and never hit.

622
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,170
This is great because now I can
never get in trouble. You'd be like,

623
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,950
you're on the road on our anniversary.
It's like what did you look it up?

624
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,690
You don't even know what it is
and fairly certain

625
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,450
that I know it. Yeah,
that's it. Do you know it?

626
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,590
I had to think about it the other day.
Obviously we know the month, but yeah,

627
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,490
we got that going right. Does this
relationship work? I don't know,

628
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:01,840
but it's been going for 13 years,

629
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:04,960
so obviously we're doing something
right and we have this one.

630
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:09,070
You skated away from that really quickly.
Um, yes. Let's not try to analyze this.

631
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:13,180
Let's not pull any sticks out
of the popsicle house here. Um,

632
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:17,950
so what's going on today? Am I
watching her at all? Yes. When, um,

633
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,240
when a,
well,

634
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,560
you're especially watching her later
today while I get my eyelashes done. Cool.

635
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:33,220
You want to watch some playoff hockey?
The black cops are playing tonight.

636
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,530
There you go.
No.

637
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,210
And also why I take a shower and try
to feel human. Okay, cool. All right,

638
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,680
well that's it. All right. That's
the podcast, uh, for this Thursday.

639
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:49,570
Have a great weekend. And um,
that's it. Once again, checkout.

640
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,770
Um, all this stuff I told you to check
out that I now don't have in front of me.

641
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,700
Davey Litchi has banned the hell.
Did I say it? The nightlife.

642
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,510
Why am I the worst night game?
Night game.

643
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:04,800
Wheeler Walker jr his new album and um,

644
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,760
was that huh? Okay. That's
it. Like they get it.

645
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,510
We have a baby stuff and uh, yeah,
that's it. That would be the podcast.

646
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:17,140
I will check in up. Not Checking you.
I'll talk to you on Monday. Have a great,

647
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,130
great weekend. You see notes? I
can't say she's here. She's here.

648
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,050
Could you get out of the room please?
Yeah, so I can deliver my tagline.

649
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:32,380
All right. There they go. The
two beautiful lady already
to have a great weekend.

650
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,800
Guts. Hey, what's going on?

651
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:41,801
It's still paper and it is the Monday
morning podcast for a Wednesday,

652
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,240
April 15th. That's when I'm
recording this. Anyways.

653
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:52,340
And a buddy of mine tomorrow is going to
help me upload this fucking thing onto

654
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,610
my computer and then onto the GCAT thing.
And hopefully they did it.

655
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,440
And if they did, you're actually
listening to it, you know? And uh,

656
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:03,560
this is my new recording device. How
does it sound? Huh? You like this?

657
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,970
You'll like it to sound good. It's
stereo mother fuckers. Finally,

658
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:12,971
after years of you people bitching at
me about the sound of my cell phone and

659
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:19,130
you know, the tapping of my
computer and all that type of shit,

660
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,930
I am 90% there to have an,
a really great sounding podcasts.

661
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:28,250
I'm going all out, you know,
I'm getting a microphone.

662
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,460
This thing has the ability that you
can actually stick a cord in there,

663
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,590
have a microphone and a,

664
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:38,300
I'll be able to walk around like
Mike Douglas when I do these. And uh,

665
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:40,760
I think it's just going to help
the quality all the way around.

666
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:44,240
I hope it sounds good. I
hope that, uh, you know,

667
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:47,420
I listened back to a couple of years. You
can literally hear the echo in my room.

668
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,550
Um, because that's the way I
lived my life. Very sparsely,

669
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,290
very sparsely furnished apartment,
you know,

670
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,300
I uh, yeah, that's how I live my life.
I throw shit out all the fucking time.

671
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,950
You know, you ever see like these people,
uh, by the time they're 60 years old,

672
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:08,923
you know,

673
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,740
the fucking sleeping on their roof
because every time they went to a baseball

674
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:17,330
game and it was headband day,
they, they, they just took it.

675
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:21,620
You know, you don't have to take that
shit. I always just say I don't want it.

676
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,290
And they look at me like, what do
you mean you don't want it? I'm like,

677
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,750
I don't like clutter.
You know,

678
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,180
I don't need a fucking Baltimore Ravens
towel to wave in the fucking air.

679
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,891
I don't,
you know,

680
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:38,690
maybe I'll take it and hold jerk off in
the super eight later out. Bill. Why, why?

681
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,670
You know, it was so family friendly
right up until that moment. No,

682
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:47,690
I'm just saying I don't have a, I
don't have a lot of stuff, you know,

683
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,500
but the stuff I have as quality
and it means something to me.

684
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,010
I've noticed something about myself.
Anytime I say anything kind of sensitive,

685
00:43:55,011 --> 00:43:59,510
I have to say it in a gay accent to
mask the fact that I feel uncomfortable

686
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,890
opening up, you know? So
anyways, let's get on with this.

687
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,410
This is the Monday morning podcast.

688
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,620
I do one of these every single week unless
there's a little sort of glitch with

689
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:12,050
my host, which is the first
time it's ever happened.

690
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:16,880
So just bear with me and just go with
this. I do one of these every week.

691
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,170
I think. I think I've earned the
right to say that. All right, Andy.

692
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:26,000
I answer people's questions. People send
me their list of overrated, underrated.

693
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,650
They asked me for advice for
some God knows reason. And, uh,

694
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,050
lately don't send
sending me a stories about revenge,

695
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,160
but here's a new topic that I
guess this guy was trying to say.

696
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:42,510
I introduced and I kind of
dropped the ball on it, but, um,

697
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,940
I dunno. This is pretty good. He's
talking about songs that annoy him,

698
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,880
which are basically any top 40 songs,
just songs you hear all the time.

699
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,690
And uh,
or maybe like,

700
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,940
I think the topic he was talking
about was annoying things in sports.

701
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:02,970
And I brought up how at
the red sox home games,

702
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,190
they play sweet Caroline. I believe
during the seventh inning stretch,

703
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,390
that's how much I hate that song is,

704
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,750
I'm a huge red sox fan and I
don't even know when they play it.

705
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:19,890
I believe that's when they do it. I
always just, I just turned the channel.

706
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,850
I can't, I can't handle it. And you know,

707
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,020
I know I'm from there and I don't,
shouldn't be trashed and red sox fans,

708
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:28,920
but I don't give a shit.

709
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,120
But if you go to Fenway park and you
start singing along to that song with your

710
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:37,890
arm around your girlfriend and y'all look
up in the air and you go, Bob, Bob, Bob,

711
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,640
you're a fucking embarrassment.

712
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,240
You were fucking embarrassments
stopped doing that.

713
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,950
Isn't it bad enough that we have
a mascot now for the Red Sox?

714
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,190
You know what I mean? Maybe it's
because I don't have any fucking kids,

715
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:57,420
but you know, can we be men, you
know, is that like against the rules?

716
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,960
Now do you know a long time ago,
I might have talked about this before,

717
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:04,710
but a long time ago,
back in the day,

718
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:06,420
I want to say it was in the 70s.

719
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,080
This is why the Internet is great because
you can look this up. I swear to God,

720
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,470
they tried to have a mascot.
Okay.

721
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,850
It was called the Fenway freak.
I swear to God. This is true.

722
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:19,920
And the thing lasted about three days,

723
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,670
three days in one trip
out into the bleachers.

724
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,690
And I don't know who that poor bastard
was that was inside that fucking suit.

725
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,890
But uh,
he got pelted mercilessly with any,

726
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,910
now that's back in the day when, when
it was bad day, you actually got a bat.

727
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,920
You've got a full size fucking bat.

728
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:43,370
They wiped out a whole acre of rainforest
for every fucking row of people.

729
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:46,650
And this guy got the shit kicked out
yonder. We got beat up. But he, you know,

730
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,790
it was definitely expressed that we
don't need a fucking mascot. You know,

731
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,870
this is back in the day too,
when a foul ball came into the stands,

732
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,160
he didn't give it to a kid.

733
00:46:56,161 --> 00:47:00,870
You stepped on a kid to give yourself
another foot of height so you could steal

734
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:04,860
it from some other fucking guy. That's
how it worked, you know. But now you know,

735
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:07,890
we've got to give it to a kid.

736
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:14,130
Fuck the kid. Give it to a kid.
He did. He pay for his ticket.

737
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,300
Is He paid for parking? Hasn't
he gotten enough? You know,

738
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:19,950
you have to realize how lucky you are.
I was a kid.

739
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:21,780
You ever think about that
shit when you were like,

740
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,380
remember that when you were like six
years old, you just had no money.

741
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:30,850
You went outside to play with no ID,
no money,

742
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,410
no keys to the house,
just empty pockets and you just fuck it.

743
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:39,010
Went outside and somehow
you know it all worked out.

744
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:42,190
Try doing that as an adults.
Walk out of Your House without your keys,

745
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,470
identity or any sort of fucking money.
And I,

746
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:50,170
I challenge you to walk around the
block away from where you live without

747
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,770
collapsing in a full panic attack.
These fucking kids,

748
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:56,830
I don't know how good they got it and
they're going to get a foul ball on top of

749
00:47:56,831 --> 00:48:00,940
it. Fuck you. God Damn it. I hate that.

750
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:02,620
Okay.

751
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,040
I Dunno. I Dunno if I hate kids or I hate
their parents. I don't know what it is.

752
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:10,150
I like kids. You know what I like?
I like a, I saw a kid the other day,

753
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:12,250
this toddler,
you know what's funny about toddlers,

754
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,480
you know when they're like two years
old is you know, parents always have,

755
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,870
I'm like running around shirtless. They
always have like that little beer belly.

756
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,670
It's the funniest fucking,

757
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:26,740
I cannot not laugh when I see that
shift because what I love is this.

758
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:31,030
So like not even self conscious,
anybody I was a gutter we subsidize in.

759
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:34,690
But when you're two years old,
you know, give a fuck, just walk.

760
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,640
They look like little truck drivers.
I just think the shit's hilarious.

761
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,760
So anyways, what am I
talking about? So, uh,

762
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:47,500
so this dude was basically talking
about, uh, just talk about, you know,

763
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:52,240
the new topic. Maybe it's
things that annoy you in sports.

764
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,670
And for me, I mean, I picked
on my own team, um, and I,

765
00:48:57,671 --> 00:49:00,160
I also,
I think I mentioned,

766
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,550
I can tell that this guy
was bringing it up or if a,

767
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,420
I hadn't mentioned it before,
but let's,

768
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:10,960
I'll give him credit and agree with him
is when they have that old cop come in

769
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,410
and he sings,
God bless America in Yankee Stadium.

770
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:19,470
Like I've never wanted to throw a toaster
through a flatscreen more when he gets

771
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:22,300
up there and he does
that whole long beginning

772
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,880
[inaudible] and just fucking goes
on for like 19 minutes. It's Ah,

773
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,990
it's just the worst. Yeah. I, I dunno,

774
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,710
I hate that whole thing.

775
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:41,330
I will say hate how the Yankees
play New York, New York,

776
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,740
whether they win or loose.
It just seems bizarre to me.

777
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:50,770
And it was really funny the night when
the red sox finally beat him and hung the

778
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:54,920
biggest show can professional sports
history around their fucking necks.

779
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,660
And the second it's over.

780
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,160
The Red Sox had jumping all over their
field and that play in that fucking song.

781
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,240
[inaudible]
sat spread the news.

782
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,880
Is everybody up teary-eyed? I
don't, maybe it's a tradition.

783
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,170
I have no idea,

784
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,560
but I'm speaking of which ESPN recently
did a top 25 chokes of all time and the

785
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:23,210
Yankees of 2004.
We're nowhere on the list.

786
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,900
They had like Greg Norman.
I was really surprised by that.

787
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,980
But I guess it's because you know,
when you dominate an entire century,

788
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,750
you know, eventually you're going to have
a bad year. So I kind of understood it.

789
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,330
And of course the red sox made the list.

790
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,490
I think we were a number seven through 18.
I think we were the top.

791
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,770
We have the top 11 fucking
jokes of all time. Um,

792
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,930
but anyway, speaking of that, did
anybody watch the masters? I actually,

793
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,680
uh, played nine holes
of golf, a par three.

794
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,340
And I've never given a shit about golf.
I never kept score.

795
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,590
I used to sneak into a private golf course
when I was a kid with my buddy during

796
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:10,700
the wintertime.
You know,

797
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:15,620
when it was no snow on the ground and we
would play golf, but it was more like a,

798
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,330
it was more like Polo, you
know, it wasn't a stroke thing.

799
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:23,270
It was more like a who could
get the ball in the hole first.

800
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,850
So there was a lot of uh,
you know,

801
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,530
standing in front of somebody off to the
side as they were shooting and you were

802
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:35,240
shooting two and he fucking slices it
in the hitching your back. Uh, you know,

803
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:35,961
that kind of shit.

804
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:38,810
And then you play like five holes and
then you don't give a fuck and then you

805
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:43,220
just start trying to drive golf balls
at the building next to the golf course.

806
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:47,070
We played golf like that. So
anyways, long story short, uh,

807
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,380
I actually had a good time on this par
three course and I actually part one of

808
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:54,260
the holes and I started to be like,
man,

809
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:58,400
I think I might want to play this
fucking game. So I got fucking,

810
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:01,010
I'll watch the master's, I'll
see what's going on. You know,

811
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:05,900
I bet a little money with my good friend
Keith Robinson, who a, he's part of my,

812
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:10,410
my, uh, I think he made the first row
of my top 9,000 friends. And, uh, he's,

813
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,370
he's a man of African
descent, so, you know,

814
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:16,520
I'm sick of them talking about tiger
woods and I'll fucking Grady is and all

815
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,040
this shit. So I call up Keith and I
tell them that, you know what, I'm,

816
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,710
I'm willing to bet against tiger.

817
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:27,010
I'm willing to put my money on a
fucking white man to a beat the,

818
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,080
uh, tiger woods, you know, so he goes,

819
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:33,760
I'll take it if at 20 bucks I picked Phil
Mickelson and I beat that motherfucker

820
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,640
by one stroke.
So anyway,

821
00:52:35,641 --> 00:52:40,641
so I get totally into this master's and
I'm watching the end of it thinking it's

822
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:43,370
going to be this very cool thing.

823
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,870
It was the most unsatisfying winning of
a championship I've ever experienced as

824
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:51,650
a fan because the Guy Kenny Perry,

825
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,690
48 years old, he had the
fucking thing one. Okay.

826
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:01,040
He burned, he's 16. He's up by
two strokes with two holes to go.

827
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,170
He bogeys 17th.

828
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:08,060
Bogeys the 18th and then
loses a two round playoffs.

829
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:08,923
It was,

830
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,760
it was one of the saddest things
I've ever seen and it's like,

831
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:17,770
what I really realized is golf is the
worst sport to choke in because you choke

832
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,960
in anything else. Let's take the red
sox. The ball goes, who bucked is like,

833
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,530
how long did that take?
How long did that take?

834
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:28,410
Like what fucking two and a half seconds,
dude.

835
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,370
This Guy Kenny Perry
choked for like 90 minutes.

836
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,960
An hour and a half on national
television, slicing it, hooking it,

837
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:40,320
going into the trap in front
of his whole fucking family.

838
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,540
The show in his family
that dying a slow death.

839
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,790
His fucking wife couldn't
even look at them at the end
of it. It was just, it was,

840
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:51,900
it was fucking horrible. I actually woke
up the next day thinking about going,

841
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:54,600
God,
if he just chose a different club.

842
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,470
I don't know if you're a Kenny
Perry fan or, you know, I,

843
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:01,290
I feel real bad for that guy was one of
the worst fucking things I've ever seen

844
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:06,000
in my life. So I don't think
I'm ever going to watch golf
again. I'm done with it.

845
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:11,001
Although I might start playing it and
thus complete the circle of being a a a

846
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:15,800
white man, you know? Isn't
that what I'm supposed to do?

847
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,740
Cross my legs with penny loafers and
start pontificating like I know how shit

848
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:24,600
works as I wait to tee off isn't the
one I'm supposed to be doing. You know?

849
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,860
Certainly by the time I'm 50 dress like
I'm in the in a three stooges sketch

850
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:31,600
level.

851
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,920
They always do address like in there
in the 1920s and they were one of those

852
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:39,270
black panther berets, but it has
a palm palm on it. All right.

853
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,790
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about. Let's get back to this kid's list.

854
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:45,030
This kid made a list of
his top eight which I love,

855
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:50,010
who if people do a top five top three
top 10 who does a top eight I'll tell you

856
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:51,330
who this motherfucker,

857
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:56,760
he's doing his top eight songs that just,

858
00:54:56,761 --> 00:55:00,930
he never needs to hear again. He
basically said, if I were all powerful,

859
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,720
I would begin by outlining these things,

860
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,170
which I think is a great new
topic to another new topic. Okay?

861
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,900
Not only do you got the things
that annoy you in sports,

862
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,810
how about what if you were a
dictator and you could make laws?

863
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:17,880
What would you outlaw? And
this, he's, this kid's just
going with music. All right,

864
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,860
number eight. He said, sweet
Caroline, as I just went off on,

865
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,900
um, number seven, hotel, California.

866
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,470
He goes, I don't give a shit
where you're living it up.

867
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,510
You overrated Pansy. He's got a lot
of anger towards all these artists,

868
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,040
hotel California.
Can we,

869
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:41,250
can we admit that that song
never needs to be played again?

870
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,970
Piano man, horrific song,
horrific song. He know.

871
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,030
What's the worst part of the song is?
I think it's in three four isn't it saying

872
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,390
[inaudible] two, three, one, two, three,
one, two, three, one, two, three, one.

873
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,120
And everybody starts fucking
rocking back and forth.

874
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:03,900
Like the Red October fest as
that's the fucking, you know,

875
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,020
it's a great moment in a
bar and I swear to God,

876
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:08,580
it's right out of a Benny Hill sketch.

877
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,630
You have see somebody with a beer in
their hand and they check to see what time

878
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:16,740
it is and their watches on the
same hand is, it's never not funny.

879
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,060
I saw a guy we would drink
and after an la kings game

880
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,550
and you don't like when you
go to make a point like,

881
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:27,280
you know what the fuck can you kind
of throw your hands out to the side.

882
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,850
He did that with a full bear in his
hand and literally just threw like,

883
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,930
it looked like a lake of bear onto this
table where there was like, you know,

884
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,350
three women sitting at, which made it
even funnier. You know what I mean?

885
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,790
Cause they were all just like, well
I never, um, anyways, anyways, let's,

886
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,960
let's continue weight number number five,
living on a prayer.

887
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,790
Absolutely. I would say the entire
Bon Jovi catalog other than,

888
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:57,970
uh, that wanted song, that's a guilty
pleasure. It's on my fucking iPod.

889
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,740
I'm not apologizing for it.

890
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:04,360
And I actually learned how to play
the beginning on the guitar and uh,

891
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,380
and it made me happy.

892
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,650
I'm such a fucking loser.
All right. Number four,

893
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:15,910
sweet home Alabama and it's
still one that's on the fence.

894
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:19,990
It's such a good fucking song. But yeah,
they've really played the hell out of it.

895
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,320
And I love how, uh, I think
somebody wrapped over that.

896
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:24,820
I think I talked about this before.

897
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:29,520
Some rapper rap to that sample and it's
been in a couple of movies and I noticed

898
00:57:29,521 --> 00:57:32,950
black people kind of start bobbing their
heads when that song comes on. And uh,

899
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:33,971
if you're black,

900
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:36,850
you should really look up the lyrics
to that song and I don't think he'd be

901
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:40,240
bobbing your head. You'd
probably be shaking it. Um,

902
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:48,400
all right. Number three.
Mustang Sally. Yeah,

903
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,730
that song's for like cougars
chicks to start fucking shaking.

904
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,950
They're dusty muffs too.
You know,

905
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:58,810
it's a grind up on some fucking 20 year
old kid who really wants to bang you

906
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,470
because he's got some sort of weird
issue with older women because his mother

907
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:06,580
didn't stick around. That whole cougar
seen is just the creepiest, it's,

908
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:11,410
it's every bit is creepy is the 50 year
old guy date and that the fucking 18

909
00:58:11,411 --> 00:58:15,730
year old chick, that whole
daddy thing going on, it's just,

910
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:19,630
it's really a, it's creepy,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

911
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:22,480
If I was 50 and single and I
could, ah, how long would you go?

912
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,560
Do you ever think about that?

913
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:28,820
Like right now I'm 40
going to be 41 in June. Uh,

914
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:33,580
25, 25 is my cutoff. Uh, maybe 24.

915
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:38,020
She listened to jazz.
She seemed mature.

916
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:44,140
Um, yeah. All I know is
you can't be in college.

917
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:47,510
I remember one time when I was 35,
I hooked up with a 21 year olds in,

918
00:58:47,511 --> 00:58:51,490
in the process of air
quotes here seducing her.

919
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:55,180
I actually said, so what's
your major? And I almost,

920
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,800
I almost pulled the plug right there.

921
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:01,090
But fortunately my dick was running
things at that point and I was able to see

922
00:59:01,091 --> 00:59:05,230
the mission through. All right,
number two, uh, brown eyed girl.

923
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:11,710
I don't mind that song. Fam Morrison,
you know, maybe it's, is that

924
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,280
Fan Lorcen Jamar Brown? I do. Do you
remember when? Oh yeah. You know,

925
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:21,080
that's one of those songs that everyone
sings in a bar and it just makes you

926
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:22,910
hate humanity.
I'll give you that one.

927
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,840
And is number one song is a American pie.

928
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:32,630
Oh yeah, that's the, that's a song that's
like really dramatic for no reason.

929
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,990
Even though I know this,
they're singing about, uh,

930
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:40,850
the big bopper and Ritchie Valens
and a buddy Holly all dying.

931
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:45,570
This wasn't the guy to do the song.
He just,

932
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:49,770
he just really slow. And you know, Madonna
did a cover, that song. Talk about,

933
00:59:49,771 --> 00:59:53,790
you know,
two horrific worlds colliding.

934
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,180
I'll tell you this, if I, if I
could, if I could pick my top,

935
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:02,420
I'll just give you my top three.
Um,

936
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,220
number three is the
entire beyond say catalog.

937
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,020
And that includes all of her work
with destiny child, Destiny's child.

938
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:16,670
I think she's a beautiful woman. She's
a great dancer, but she cannot sing.

939
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:21,920
I think she's singing too high and then,
and then it's just, Ugh, those fucking,

940
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:25,670
I haven't heard hooks like that since
the last time. J Lo had a fucking album.

941
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:29,900
I'll I that song she had out and they
just kept playing that saxophone over and

942
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:30,560
over again.

943
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:35,040
Nah, Nah, it, it did. It did. It
did. It did. It did. It did it.

944
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:39,030
And you just wanted to fucking smash
or glass into the person next to you.

945
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:42,120
Like they like punish you with the music.

946
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:47,100
That's what like Beyonce songs are
like, I don't get it. Like Beyonce.

947
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:52,101
Sing as high as you can and then sing
the same thing over and over and over and

948
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,020
over and over again.

949
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:01,290
Be like an 80 man. Hey Man. I
mean, 20 minutes later, hey,

950
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,770
ugh,

951
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:06,370
all her beauty goes down the
fucking drain. The second
she starts singing Jesus,

952
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:10,960
I'm in a mood. So all
her entire catalog, um,

953
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:16,690
anything by kiss. And I'm going to
pause here to let everybody be like,

954
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:21,430
oh Jesus Christ. Kids. Come look
man. Just Guy Detroit, rock city.

955
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,610
It all sucks. It's horrific. And you
can take fucking Bob Seger with them.

956
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:30,550
It's a lot of bad white music coming
out of Detroit. I'm telling you.

957
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,583
Um,

958
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,300
and the number one would be thin Lizzy.

959
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:42,430
The boys are back in town and uh,
they should be like a contest.

960
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:46,870
Like to just see how long
you can listen to that song.

961
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,200
It's like they just singing
about these fucking,

962
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:54,880
this group of Douche bags that just
like thinks they're bad asses. I guess.

963
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:59,290
You know, I haven't, I talked about this
before. I can't even fucking remember.

964
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:02,750
I've done some of these podcasts.
They got the,

965
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,070
the boys are back in town and
they get that hope the ball.

966
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:09,670
If the boys want to fight,
you better let them really or else what

967
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:11,873
you know

968
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:18,330
man, man, that chick slap Giani in the
face. Man, we fell about the place.

969
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,400
You know, like everyone's just sitting
around this town waiting for these fucking

970
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:28,020
douchebags to show back up. You
know, come back into town, you know,

971
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:30,480
all fuck the boys are back in town,

972
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,780
hide the women least fucking nerds are
back in town and if they want to fight

973
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:37,740
you better.
Let them,

974
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:44,460
whoever wrote that song should seriously
consider killing themselves. You know,

975
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,620
it's right up there with Woodrow Wilson
Pushing through the Federal Reserve Act.

976
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:54,120
That's number one. And number two is
whoever wrote the boys are back in town.

977
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:58,080
That's how I see that shit. All
right, so let's move on here.

978
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,710
Let's get on with the podcast.
Uh,

979
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04,500
what do we got here and what
do we got here? All right.

980
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,640
This here is not really a revenge story.
This is actually a,

981
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,190
dare I say,
kind of clever.

982
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,080
What this guy did to fuck somebody over
he a, this is what he did. He took us,

983
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,570
I don't know a lot of this computer stuff,

984
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:21,270
so I'm going to try to read
this slowly and God knows,

985
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,620
we all know I suck at reading out
loud at this point. All right.

986
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,930
He says, uh, I took us.

987
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:33,350
Basically what I did was I took a screen
capture of my friends desktop when he

988
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:36,120
left his computer on attended,

989
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:40,740
which basically means he took a
picture of, of the guys desktop.

990
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:43,680
I guess he didn't have anything on the
screen. He just took a picture of it.

991
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:44,941
He goes,

992
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:49,941
I then hid all his desktop icons and set
the background as the screen capture I

993
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:55,800
just took.
So basically it looks like all his,

994
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,010
all the folders and icons are still there,
but they're not.

995
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,960
So when the dude comes back,

996
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:05,100
you'll be clicking till his fucking mouth
start smoking and nothing will happen.

997
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,910
May come on, man. You gotta
give this guy an a for effort.
That's, that's pretty, uh,

998
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,270
I think that's kind of ingenious. So
anyways, I guess this is how it plays out.

999
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:15,180
He goes, I waited for the guy to
return to see his reaction. He goes,

1000
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:18,900
I stood off in the distance,
like a fucking stalker. He goes,

1001
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,490
at first I could see the really
confused look on his face,

1002
01:04:23,491 --> 01:04:27,750
but it very quickly turned to
frustration and then anger.

1003
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:31,380
He began mumbling shit
like fucking piece of shit.

1004
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,860
And it escalated to him pretty
much yelling and saying,

1005
01:04:34,861 --> 01:04:38,880
I'm going to smash this mother fucker.
He goes, I couldn't believe it.

1006
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:42,540
He was pounding the keyboard and slamming
the mouse. I was laughing so hard.

1007
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:44,400
That's not what's coming out of my nose.

1008
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:48,330
So they do concluded that he had a virus,
soy.

1009
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:50,730
He took the computer to the it department.

1010
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:54,270
They figured it out in five minutes
and told him he's an asshole.

1011
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,700
What do you think that I do? Good. Or Am
I the Douche bag of the week now? Dude,

1012
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:04,530
you did great. That's fucking
hilarious. That's a great idea.

1013
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:07,500
I wish I knew something about computers.
I would try that on somebody.

1014
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:11,880
I tried that on my girlfriend.
That's the kind of guy I am. Um,

1015
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:16,140
no, you're not a Douche to, that's a,
I don't know if he came up with that,

1016
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:18,040
but that's pretty, uh,
that's pretty ingenious.

1017
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,390
So I gave you a thumbs up on that
one. And everybody at work, go ahead.

1018
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,300
Go try that on your boss.
No,

1019
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:27,640
I don't do to your boss because some will
end up ratting you out. And eventually,

1020
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:28,810
even if they didn't rat you out,

1021
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:32,110
they could figure out that you were
the one who did it because you would be

1022
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:35,590
doing that. You know that laugh and you
didn't in school when you were a kid,

1023
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:38,320
you weren't allowed to laugh
and you would hold your nose.

1024
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,720
So you'd start making those duck noises.

1025
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,050
That usually gives away that you're
the one who fucking did it. All right,

1026
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:49,630
let's get on with revenge stories. Um,
before I get on with the revenge stories,

1027
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:49,970
uh,

1028
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:54,970
some woman was letting me know why
females are better at revenge than guys.

1029
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,510
And she wrote a pretty interesting
thing here. Uh, she says,

1030
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,690
cause I guess I was asking all my uh,
podcast a couple of weeks ago,

1031
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:05,290
how come his revenge only a guy thing?
How come I'm not hearing from women?

1032
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:09,520
And believe me, if you hear
the stories this week, uh,

1033
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:13,750
I really opened the floodgates because
the f the, the women, the ladies,

1034
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,400
they came in strong this week.

1035
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:20,020
So before I read all the women
revenge stories here, uh,

1036
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,500
this woman has this, a little preamble
setup she gives me, she goes, Bill,

1037
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,310
you've only read one revenge story
from a female. And I'll tell you why.

1038
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:30,850
Guys are idiotic and deal with anger.
So stupidly

1039
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,420
is stupidly a word.

1040
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:39,340
Is it a geyser idiotic and they deal
with their anger in a stupid way.

1041
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:43,600
I don't know. I'm too fucking stupid
to know, but that would be hilarious.

1042
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:45,760
If stupidly is not a word,
you know,

1043
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:49,510
because you just made yourself look like
an ass and if you didn't, I apologize.

1044
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:53,200
Let me continue. Uh, fucking
up. Someone's car is pathetic.

1045
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:54,880
This kind of revenge is temporary.

1046
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:58,760
Doing something like that would just
make someone think of you as a cock suck

1047
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,880
and jackass and then I'll
move on with their lives.

1048
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:06,340
Women can and will remember my new details
and situations that guys will forget

1049
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,180
when we want to know, wait,
when we know how someone works,

1050
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:14,650
we know how to use it against them.
Physical is temporary.

1051
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:16,330
Psychological is permanent.

1052
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,720
Women can do the most damage
with the least effort.

1053
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,800
We don't aim to screw someone over or
to do something to piss someone off.

1054
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:25,300
We aim for resentment.

1055
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:30,190
Resentment is much more powerful because
it places you in a higher status and

1056
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:31,480
when someone resents you,

1057
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:36,220
it's most likely that you have something
that they don't and that you are just

1058
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:37,540
better than them.
In some way.

1059
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,740
So my point is that lashing out at
someone as stupid and only makes you feel

1060
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:46,741
better and doesn't really
have or accomplish much long
time effect on the other.

1061
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:49,960
All right, now I want to
tell you something, you guys,

1062
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:54,961
that paragraph right there is why I've
never gotten married because I realize

1063
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,940
that women have that, you
know, they got that in them.

1064
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:06,640
You know that expression Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned. That's the deal.

1065
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:09,310
It's this weird thing that when they're
dating you and they want to know

1066
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:10,390
everything about you,

1067
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:15,900
it's this odd thing where half of it is
so they can love the whole you and the

1068
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:20,540
other half is like, it's collateral
in case the thing goes bad.

1069
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:25,490
They have all this fucked up information
that they can use against you. So, uh,

1070
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:29,480
I don't know, that was pretty
chilling to read that. And uh,

1071
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:33,470
I don't agree with their definition of
resentment saying that it, it, it, uh,

1072
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,910
it means that you have something that
they don't or that you are just better

1073
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:39,830
than them in some way. Uh, I don't think,

1074
01:08:39,831 --> 01:08:43,130
I think they resent you because
you fucked him over, you know,

1075
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,880
not because you drive a
better car. Right. I Dunno.

1076
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:50,130
Why don't I shut the fuck up and read
the first revenge story? All right, his,

1077
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,670
now this is all from the,
this is all from women this week.

1078
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:57,290
And I gotta tell you something.
They really, really take
it to the next level. And,

1079
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,330
uh, yeah. All right, let's just get on
with this. All right. And, uh, this one,

1080
01:09:02,331 --> 01:09:05,600
I'm not going to tell the street. There's
a couple of names and street names,

1081
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:07,580
and here I don't want to get
anybody in trouble. So here we go.

1082
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:13,700
Fill this story is actually not mine,
but, um, I was a participant. Um,

1083
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,260
you know what?
I'm going to say the name squeeze.

1084
01:09:15,261 --> 01:09:17,000
I'm not going to try to
fuck remember fake names.

1085
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:19,310
I'm just not going to say the
name of the street. All right.

1086
01:09:19,311 --> 01:09:22,310
Right after I graduated from
college, I moved to, okay.

1087
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:25,250
I can't say that my roommates
were still college students,

1088
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:27,830
sometimes their friends,
which were also my friends,

1089
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:32,390
we all went to the same college. They'd,
uh, they'd stay over. One of our friends,

1090
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:37,520
uh, Jess, who still lived in the dorm,
was having problems with a roommate. Gale,

1091
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
her roommate knew she had
an eating disorder and was
spreading rumors about her

1092
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:45,860
writing things on our
mirror, like, you're fat.

1093
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,860
We let just stay at our apartment. And
we started plot, started to plot revenge.

1094
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:56,810
One of the things we did was crank called
gale. So in case you got lost in that,

1095
01:09:56,811 --> 01:10:01,190
I guess Jess is the anorexic one
and Gail is the content. All right.

1096
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:05,570
Okay. Let's continue on. One of the
things we did was crank call Gail. We,

1097
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:09,530
we use the voice from my roommates Mac
computer and typed out some evil shit.

1098
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:10,671
There's definitely made,

1099
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:15,410
just feel better and I guess inspired
her to pull the ultimate revenge.

1100
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,870
Jess was a team model before she went
to college. This is the anorexic girl.

1101
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,870
While in college she
worked at a high scale,

1102
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:27,440
a high scale salon on something,
something street.

1103
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:32,470
Shortly after we crank called Gail just
ran into gales boyfriend after work.

1104
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:37,850
According to Jess, she brought Gail's
boyfriend back to her. Their dorm room,

1105
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:43,540
fucked him in Gail's bed and then called
Gail right after to tell her all the

1106
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:45,344
details.

1107
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:50,810
Just ended up staying in our apartment
the rest of the semester and bought us a

1108
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:54,740
$200 bottle of champagne to
celebrate the act of revenge.

1109
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,360
At the time, I thought Gail got
what she deserved. But in hindsight,

1110
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:04,010
it made me realize that women are
evil, manipulative bitches. Yes.

1111
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:07,510
Many women hate being called fat,
but it ceases to amaze.

1112
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,570
But it never ceases to amaze me that
women, what women will do to others,

1113
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,570
other women to get back him.
Wow.

1114
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:20,940
You know what I mean? They
take it to that level. Uh,

1115
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,420
I don't know who deserved
what in that story,

1116
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:28,020
but I think the real winner
is a Gail's boyfriend.

1117
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,380
You know,
you have a one that if you're a guy,

1118
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:38,340
you ever wonder if any girl was fucking
you oughta revenge just to get somebody

1119
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:41,400
back. You know? I don't think
that's ever happened to me.

1120
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:45,030
I don't live that exciting a life,
but I can't imagine

1121
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,870
what is, what do you say is the guys,
she's sitting there banging you. Yeah.

1122
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:55,020
That'll show her flip over
and I'll bust it on your face.

1123
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:58,140
You really taught her a lesson.
Hey,

1124
01:11:58,141 --> 01:12:02,670
anytime you want to teach and teach
her a lesson again, just let me know.

1125
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:04,800
I really, I really, I'm
really down with you.

1126
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:08,520
I understand your point here and I
think you're very justified. You know,

1127
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:12,480
you know, really make really drive
the point home is you, let me,

1128
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:14,430
if you let me bang you again,
you know,

1129
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,910
and did you really want to get
the ultimate, ultimate revenge?

1130
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,410
You'd let me put it in your ass.
You know,

1131
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:23,370
I'm just throwing these ideas out there.
I mean, this is, this is your world,

1132
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:26,820
you know, I'm just, I'm
just here to help. Okay.

1133
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,530
So that's revenge story number
one. Um, and I can see, you know,

1134
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,620
in order it is, it's not that
she's fucked the girl's boyfriend,

1135
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:38,910
it's that she called him up.
I called her up and told her about it.

1136
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,380
You know, that's one of the advantages
of women is for the most part,

1137
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:46,830
they don't have to worry about the other
woman coming over and just beating the

1138
01:12:46,831 --> 01:12:49,350
shit out of her.
Because as a guy,

1139
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:52,530
if you ever tried to get back and another
guy and you banged his girlfriend,

1140
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:56,910
you'd never call the dude because I don't
even care if you could beat the guy in

1141
01:12:56,911 --> 01:13:01,260
a fight on a normal basis.
You know what I'm saying?

1142
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,900
The level of anger that he would have,
he, I think he'd still win. Right?

1143
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,010
Does that make any sense?
All right.

1144
01:13:08,011 --> 01:13:10,100
Let me plow ahead at Jesus
already up to 31 minutes.

1145
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:13,800
Let me get through these here. All right.
Hey Bill, here's my story of revenge.

1146
01:13:13,801 --> 01:13:16,440
Everybody knows that women hate
each other, hate other women.

1147
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:20,070
And I have a great story
about women's revenge. Um,

1148
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,440
I was roommates with two
other women in college.

1149
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:27,210
One was very average looking
and one was very beautiful.

1150
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:31,020
The type of beautiful that makes all
the other girls around our hater.

1151
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,910
Um, she got whatever she wanted throughout
her life because of, because of it.

1152
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:40,530
Guys, money, grades, you name it. And she
was a bitch. She used everyone around her.

1153
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,570
It was never said no to.
Um,

1154
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,430
so I was casually dating a guy
and brought him back to my house.

1155
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:47,550
So both my roommates were there.

1156
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:49,920
We hung out with them for
awhile and everything was cool.

1157
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:52,560
I didn't notice anything unusual.
A few weeks later,

1158
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:54,600
or a year from a mutual
friend and my roommate,

1159
01:13:55,290 --> 01:14:00,290
I guess the hot one was out with my guy
after seriously interrogating my guy,

1160
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:03,840
he finally spills his guts
and tells me the truth.

1161
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,990
I would have loved to have seen
that guys have the worst liars ever.

1162
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:08,760
No one was the to doing

1163
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:16,810
fucking 12 seconds later. All right. All
right. You got me. I was fucking her.

1164
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:21,460
Anyways, he goes, uh, she had, uh,
the hot girl had bumped into the,

1165
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:24,730
her boyfriend on campus one day and I
guess they hit it off and started seeing

1166
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:29,110
each other by my back.
Um,

1167
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:32,920
naturally I dump his ass,
but I'm so much more pissed at her.

1168
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:37,740
I kinda read that weird. So it's her
boyfriend. Um, okay. So anyways, uh,

1169
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:41,710
I come up with a brilliant plan to get
my revenge on her and enlisted my other

1170
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:43,023
roommates for help.

1171
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,470
She agrees because all average
girls secretly hate pretty girls.

1172
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,010
This is really eye opening about the,
uh,

1173
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:57,490
these psycho inner worlds of women. This
is like an HBO undercover. So anyways,

1174
01:14:57,491 --> 01:15:01,450
here's that revenge. Uh, we had an
an advantage because the hot girl,

1175
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:05,530
she drank a lot and we'd get ripped almost
every other night and I mean really,

1176
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,110
really ripped. We'd
wait until she gets, uh,

1177
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:12,160
so one night we waited until
she got loaded one night
and it was the most wasted

1178
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:16,870
I've ever seen her. It was like all
the stars were in line for our plan.

1179
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:22,300
She had beautiful long corn.
Silkair uh, oh, here we go.

1180
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:26,470
Here we go.
She had beautiful long corn.

1181
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,770
Still Care was straight off
the ass of a golden retriever.

1182
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:34,900
I bought two boxes of black hair
dye and after she passes out,

1183
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:38,170
we start in.
I really wanted to make a statement,

1184
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,640
so I part her hair down the middle
and only die half of our head.

1185
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,780
Jesus Christ.
After I start,

1186
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:51,070
I turn into this crazy die hungry freak.
I couldn't stop myself.

1187
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:54,730
I started dying. Any part of her
body that could, that I could find.

1188
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,410
I did our eyebrows,

1189
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,070
the peach fuzz on her chin and
lip her fingers and her arms.

1190
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:06,270
I'm embarrassed to say that we even died
a lightening bolt in her pubic hair.

1191
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:11,530
The funny part was is she kept waking
up telling us to leave her alone,

1192
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:15,670
but we kept going. Jesus, this,

1193
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:19,090
this sounds like a fucking date
rape story. It's just that as women.

1194
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:24,070
So I guess is, it's still funny. Anybody
else getting creeped out here? Um,

1195
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:27,190
let's continue here. Of course,
we were too lazy to wash it out,

1196
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:32,191
so if we just go to sleep and leave the
black hair dye on our roommate for about

1197
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:37,180
seven hours, I wake up the next
day to her in a towel towel.

1198
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,870
Her hair was soaking wet and she was
beating the shit out of me with a shampoo

1199
01:16:40,871 --> 01:16:43,210
bottle.
It was fucking hysterical.

1200
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:46,480
The dye had stained or
skin along with their hair.

1201
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:49,780
So she had dark brown patches
all over her face and body.

1202
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:55,050
She looked like the bastard child of
Cruella Deville and Richard Grieco.

1203
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:58,390
I don't know who that is.
I was so proud of my work.

1204
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,150
You would think that I got my revenge,

1205
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:04,180
but this is a story
about her revenge on me.

1206
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,990
So the fucking long one here,
plot twist,

1207
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:12,050
she actually called cops and they fucking
came and arrested my roommate and me.

1208
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:15,950
The evidence was stacked
against us because our hands
and arms were also stained

1209
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,510
with black hair dye.

1210
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:21,140
Her bed where the crime was
committed was covered in black dye.

1211
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,660
It looked like an octopus
had been raped in there.

1212
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:30,410
She tried to charge us with sexual
assaults. Pump a pubic hair,

1213
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,350
lightening bolt. Yeah. You know,
you pull somebody's pants down,

1214
01:17:33,351 --> 01:17:36,890
start dying their genitals
or at least the area. Yeah,

1215
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:38,420
you're going to get in trouble.
So anyways,

1216
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:40,070
after spending all day
in the police station,

1217
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:42,680
we were finally let out and
the charges were dropped.

1218
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:47,890
But when we got back to the house where
you're greeted by campus security and

1219
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:51,890
our parents were there too, trying
to explain to your dad why you died.

1220
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:54,230
Some other girl's pubic hair,
not fun.

1221
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:58,310
The fucking bitch got is kicked out of
the house and we put on strict probation.

1222
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,580
It was a big deal. We almost literally
almost got kicked out of school.

1223
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,100
The worst part was when we
were moving out of the house.

1224
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:08,960
About a week later she shows up with
my ex boyfriend and she looks amazing.

1225
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:14,090
She had died the rest of her hair black
and cut it in this cute short Bob style

1226
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:18,530
and whack stuff. All the body
hair. She was as beautiful as ever.

1227
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:23,030
And then she writes in capital
letters con I felt like such an ass,

1228
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:27,260
like there was no way to get back at
this bitch. I guess my life isn't over.

1229
01:18:27,261 --> 01:18:31,460
So someday I will get her back.
I'll make sure to fill you in.

1230
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:37,220
Okay,
well I know you haven't asked my advice,

1231
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:42,050
but uh, I think you should just let that
one go there. A sweetheart. I think,

1232
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:46,010
uh, you know, sometimes
you just gotta say fuck it.

1233
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:52,670
Uh, isn't that unbelievable? I
mean, things like reverse that.

1234
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:57,740
And if, if you, if you did that as a guy,

1235
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:00,350
if you did that same thing as a guy,

1236
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:05,351
you would literally be in a prison
shower right now with half a mop handle

1237
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:07,430
trying to fight off five rapists.

1238
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:11,600
But if you know you have a vagina,
all you get it,

1239
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:15,560
you just get kicked out of your house.
Fucking incredible.

1240
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:19,280
I still a bit about that shit. How having
a vagina just keeps you out of jail.

1241
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:24,530
You know, like, like you have us, he
like when a mob boss gets arrested,

1242
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:28,430
you know, they never
take the wife, you know,

1243
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:32,720
like she doesn't know what the fuck he's
doing. Oh, I just thought he was a baker.

1244
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:35,870
I thought he was really,
really good at making cookies.

1245
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:39,950
And that's why I had 20 furs and
lived in a, lived in a mansion.

1246
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,920
You knew what the fuck he was doing,
you know,

1247
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,070
and you spent all that blood money in
you and you don't end up fucking going to

1248
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:50,500
jail. It's a, there's something
about it. Like they just don't, uh,

1249
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,520
like remember that movie monster's ball,

1250
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:56,070
not monsters balled up monster with eight,

1251
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:00,080
literally turned a serial killer
into this sympathetic fucking person.

1252
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:04,610
I just didn't, you know. Yeah. He
had a rough childhood. You know,

1253
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:10,110
you got molested. What are, you know,
who didn't go right? Some fucking jokes.

1254
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:13,470
You don't get a gun. And starts
shooting fucking people. And if you do,

1255
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:14,400
you go to jail.

1256
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:17,940
They don't ever see that movie was the
worst fucking movie ever with those

1257
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:19,260
cartoon character,

1258
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,280
male characters that they had in that.
Did you see?

1259
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:26,610
You remember that part where she goes
into apply for the law office job or

1260
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:30,030
something? She comes in there
looking like this strung out hooker,

1261
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:33,960
and somehow she's not ushered
right out of the fucking office.

1262
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:38,910
She actually gets in to the
lawyers office and he's just like,

1263
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:43,470
let me tell you something. You fucking
skank. He's like, there's over the top.

1264
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,600
I really hated that fucking movie.

1265
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:50,820
Kind of hate when beautiful actresses
don't wear makeup. And then the,

1266
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,390
everybody falls all over themselves
and talks about how brave it is.

1267
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:59,010
He was so brave. He was
so brave. All right,

1268
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,900
let's continue on here. All right. Let
me read the last one here at bill. Uh,

1269
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:05,130
for the past two weeks I've made my
girlfriend listened to your podcast.

1270
01:21:05,131 --> 01:21:06,180
Incidentally,
she loves it.

1271
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:10,440
This past week she told me about how
she got revenge on her ex boyfriend off.

1272
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:14,680
This one is brutal and it's,
it's very, uh, there's,

1273
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,080
there's no fat on this one.

1274
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:20,850
This one's great because she doesn't
get caught. There's nothing, you know,

1275
01:21:20,851 --> 01:21:23,670
I don't wanna ruin here, but just listen
to this. After that messy breakup,

1276
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:28,020
she logged onto their shared
jet blue, a cow, you know,
they're going out. You know,

1277
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:29,400
I give a deadly that taking trips.

1278
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:33,480
So they got this jet blue account and they
evidently, they both had the password,

1279
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:38,780
so she logs onto it and she saw that the
Douche bag and his new girlfriend had

1280
01:21:38,911 --> 01:21:41,430
booked a vacation.
Well,

1281
01:21:41,431 --> 01:21:45,450
the morning of their scheduled trip
on the morning of the scheduled trip,

1282
01:21:45,451 --> 01:21:48,690
she logged on and canceled the flight.

1283
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,060
Can you imagine what a pain in the ass
that must've been for them anyways,

1284
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:55,290
she never saw any activity
on the account again.

1285
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:59,220
I thought that this was pretty funny. A
lot more subtler than king someone's car,

1286
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:02,670
like a little bitch and whatever
and whatever. That other more on,

1287
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:04,351
wait,

1288
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:08,400
I'm reading this wrong and whatever
that other more on girl did on the other

1289
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,350
weeks podcast. Wow, man, that is
dead is dirty pool right there.

1290
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:16,290
If the guy cheated on
you, yeah, I can see that.

1291
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:20,580
But if you just had a messy breakup,
that's uh, that's vindictive.

1292
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,650
That's really fucked up.

1293
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:26,670
A lot of these things are
really a really fucked up.

1294
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:31,560
You know that die in that girl's
pubic hair. That's, that's really, uh,

1295
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:37,080
you need a hobby at that point. All
right. Why don't I stop judging people?

1296
01:22:37,081 --> 01:22:40,770
I asked her you fucking revenge stories.
Now I'm judging you. All right. Whatever.

1297
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:45,870
This gets overrated,
underrated, a overrated karaoke.

1298
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,590
Hate it. Terrible Song Sung
by people who can sing you,

1299
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:52,110
which are usually fat chicks and gay guys,

1300
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:56,160
and the off chance that you and your
drunk friends find yourself at a karaoke

1301
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:58,020
bar singing eighties hair metal songs.

1302
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:02,730
There's always those douchebags
and interrupt the fun
with a serious gay country

1303
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:07,030
song. You know what I love about this guy?
He says, Garrick Karaoke is overrated.

1304
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,610
Like people actually love it.
Okay?

1305
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:13,930
Then he says that it's socks
and then in the middle of it,

1306
01:23:13,931 --> 01:23:15,250
he admits doing it.

1307
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:19,780
But evidently when he and his douchebag
friends go up there and sing eighties

1308
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:23,530
hair metal songs, that's
totally fine, you know,

1309
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,970
but when someone comes up to sing us,
kick a country song, they're gay. Dude,

1310
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,640
I hate to tell you this,
but you're part of the fucking problem.

1311
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:33,880
I'm actually,
you know what,

1312
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:36,880
actually if you sing an eighties
hair metal song and a karaoke thing,

1313
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:40,090
I'm going to laugh my ass off.
And uh, I liked that better.

1314
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:42,850
Just as long as someone doesn't go well,
what are the, what are the fucking tunes?

1315
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,910
Those chicks I always end up singing.
Uh,

1316
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:50,710
what does that song that guy sings
about losing his virginity? That oh,

1317
01:23:50,711 --> 01:23:51,544
what a knife

1318
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:58,000
that sounded lay it is in La Vega and 63
for some reason women love that fucking

1319
01:23:58,001 --> 01:24:02,470
song. And uh, there's, there's
nothing worse than the female voice,

1320
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:06,460
like 12 of them all singing
in a really high voice.

1321
01:24:06,461 --> 01:24:10,300
It's like a car alarm going off.
All right,

1322
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:15,430
I think we're done for the week. And
Are we, what are we up to? 42 minutes.

1323
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:19,810
All right. As bill is. This is
this podcast petering out here.

1324
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,840
I think I'm doing too much reading and
not telling enough stories. All right,

1325
01:24:22,841 --> 01:24:27,460
let's, let's, let's read this
one here. Um, okay. Bill. Uh,

1326
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:30,970
I'm almost 26 and a bunch of my friends
still love going to the clubs at night

1327
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:34,460
and on weekends. Uh, now
I'm not sure that I'm,

1328
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:37,720
if I'm getting too old for it or just,
or if I just can't stand people,

1329
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:39,970
but I absolutely hate
going to these places.

1330
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,550
I know as a guy supposed to
go in there and get girls,

1331
01:24:42,551 --> 01:24:45,490
but I just can't take it anymore.
No matter which place it is.

1332
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:49,210
It always feels like she should get a
mandatory penicillin shout when you leave

1333
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:52,630
because a group of sweaty skanky
people crammed into a room,

1334
01:24:52,631 --> 01:24:56,410
grinding to crappy techno
music is just disgusting.

1335
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,870
That combined with the
guys with the sonic,

1336
01:24:58,871 --> 01:25:01,960
the hedgehog haircut just drives me crazy,

1337
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:06,760
especially when they're the
ones getting all the girls. Um,

1338
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,990
is it me or these places?
Truly horrific. And what stage,

1339
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:17,770
uh, and what, and what age were you
officially the old fuck at the club?

1340
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:24,130
Um, all right. All right, dude. Now you're
being too hard on yourself. First of all,

1341
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,280
you're only 26 years old.
You're in the prime of your life.

1342
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:30,950
You should be going out and talking
to women. You just doing it in a,

1343
01:25:30,951 --> 01:25:34,870
in a bar that's not you.
You know what I mean?

1344
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,840
Like basically everybody's a douchebag.
Okay.

1345
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,750
But you got to hang out with the
same kind of Douche bags so you feel

1346
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:45,250
comfortable. You know what I mean?
Like me, I'm a loner psycho Douche bag.

1347
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:50,140
So I used to hang out in dive bars and,
uh,

1348
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,070
who the fuck am I kidding?

1349
01:25:51,071 --> 01:25:53,410
Did I that I don't think I ever
picked up a girl in the bar.

1350
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:58,060
I always met him at gyms, amend them
on the subway a lot in New York.

1351
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:03,620
Um, I, I meet them when
they're not ready. You know,

1352
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,080
like women don't have
their guard up sometimes,

1353
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,780
like on the train, they have that guard
up to get mugged, not to be hit on,

1354
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:15,110
I guess. I don't know, maybe
I just felt like, you know,

1355
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,260
I would never did well in those
singles bars. Like, you know,

1356
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:21,380
it's almost like as a comedian, someone
goes, you're a comedian. All right,

1357
01:26:21,381 --> 01:26:26,100
say something funny. It's just like
you've ruined the moment. So I would,

1358
01:26:26,101 --> 01:26:30,380
I would still go out, just
find, uh, you know, find,

1359
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:31,700
find the right place to hang out.

1360
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:36,500
You can't hang it up to 26 unless you
live in the middle of Kansas and you might

1361
01:26:36,501 --> 01:26:41,240
as well fucking read a Bible and knock
up some broad and have eight kids and

1362
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:45,920
vote for a fucking retard over and
over again for eight fucking years.

1363
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:52,320
Okay. That was a little mean. All
right. Uh, question of the week. Uh,

1364
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,090
Bill,

1365
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:56,990
I was wondering how you handled two
shows a one night I was part of the lake

1366
01:26:56,991 --> 01:26:58,670
crowd tonight and you killed what was,

1367
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:03,230
was it the same scenario in the earlier
show with a joke said bombed in the

1368
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:04,850
earliest show where their jokes in the,

1369
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:09,170
in the earlier show that bombed
that you skipped on the second show.

1370
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:14,450
Uh, no. You know, if it bombed, I'm too
stubborn. I'm going to keep doing it,

1371
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:18,620
but I'm doing two shows in one night.

1372
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:22,100
I try to switch it up,
you know,

1373
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:27,650
I just don't want the
waitstaff and everybody to
know exactly how am I actually

1374
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:32,210
going to go. Um, because that's a big
thing on the second show and your three,

1375
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:35,840
three days into your weekend gig. If, uh,

1376
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:39,590
you see like the waitresses smiling and
stuff and laughing as they're bringing

1377
01:27:39,591 --> 01:27:40,640
drinks over to the table,

1378
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:45,200
that's like one of the best
compliments you can get because, uh,

1379
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:50,150
nobody sees more comedy or listens to
more comedy than comedy club waitresses

1380
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,810
because as a comedian, if I see a
comic and I don't like what he's doing,

1381
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:57,680
I can walk out of the room.
But as, as a waitress,

1382
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:02,960
you have to, you got to keep going back
in, you know, and uh, so you can get the,

1383
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:06,380
you know, so they get jaded
really quickly as far as like,

1384
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:10,280
what's funny that I'm so, um, I don't even
know if I answered your question, but,

1385
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:11,114
no,
I don't really,

1386
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,180
I know what I'm going to start with and
I know what I'm going to finish with.

1387
01:28:14,181 --> 01:28:15,980
I don't really know what's
going to be in the middle,

1388
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:20,150
but I definitely switch up the
jokes just so I don't feel like,

1389
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:24,920
like that groundhog day thing
where everything's the say. So. Uh,

1390
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,360
all right. There's that. All Right, Bill,

1391
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,620
I've been listening to your podcasts and
I watched you perform because it's nice

1392
01:28:30,621 --> 01:28:32,930
to hear to someone use the
word cunt every five minutes.

1393
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:36,080
You don't seem to curse as
much when you're performing,

1394
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:38,870
but you're getting to be like,
uh,

1395
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,720
some of the other dirty comics
out there on your podcast.

1396
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:45,260
I think it's quite hilarious how you
use the word to describe anyone that's

1397
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:48,770
pissing you off through
unnecessary though,

1398
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:52,280
unnecessary most of the
time. Um, in addition,

1399
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,180
I'll wait a minute. I already read this.
I already read this tonight. This is,

1400
01:28:56,181 --> 01:28:58,650
this lady asked me about Saint
Patrick's Day. That was from Cleveland.

1401
01:28:58,651 --> 01:29:02,040
I already read that. All right, so
I guess that is end of the podcast

1402
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:06,150
for this week. Um, please
give me the feedback. What do
you think about the new, uh,

1403
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:09,120
the new stereo sound?
I know I need to make some adjustments.

1404
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:12,570
I know I might've been too close to it a
couple of times and I know that there's

1405
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:17,571
like an echo in the room now and I'll
put some empty egg shell crates on the

1406
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:23,040
fucking side of my walls, but
whatever. So, uh, so that's the deal.

1407
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,190
I'm just to let you know,
uh, my upcoming gigs,

1408
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:31,290
I'm going to be at Iowa state
this weekend, April 18th,

1409
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,300
and that is a private show.

1410
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:36,510
That show is only for the
students of Iowa state.

1411
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:40,260
You need a student Id to get into the show

1412
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:41,663
or

1413
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:45,250
if you kind of look young
and you have a baseball cap,

1414
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,500
maybe you can sneak your way in, but
you didn't hear that from me. Um,

1415
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:54,940
the following weekend I'm going to be
at the funny bone in Columbus and the

1416
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:58,870
weekend after that it'll be a
Caroline's in New York City. Um,

1417
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:02,770
young Joe de Rosa will be for a
opening for me on both of those shows.

1418
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:06,790
And then if you'll notice
on my, uh, my website,

1419
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:11,590
I had to blow out a number
of dates. Tempe, Ireland,

1420
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:16,210
Cleveland and Atlanta are
all being rescheduled.

1421
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:21,230
And I can't really tell you why as of yet.
I'm going to leave you hanging.

1422
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,360
How do you like that?

1423
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:23,923
Huh?

1424
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,300
Like one of those old fucking Batman and
Robin's when they're stuck in a machine

1425
01:30:29,301 --> 01:30:32,480
and they're going to fucking die and
you got to wait until next week. Yeah.

1426
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,450
I can't really tell you. I can't
actually, I can't tell you for a minute.

1427
01:30:35,451 --> 01:30:36,440
I kind of a,

1428
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:41,480
something may or may not be going on and
I needed to free up my schedule and at

1429
01:30:41,481 --> 01:30:45,770
some point actually in June
I'll be able to let you know.

1430
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:51,320
So that's the deal.
That's the Monday morning podcast.

1431
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:52,970
And if you like this,

1432
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:58,030
the device I'm using is the Olympus
ls 10 this fucking thing is a,

1433
01:30:59,181 --> 01:31:03,640
it's pretty incredible and I'm going to
have a, a my own mic next weekend up.

1434
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:08,670
Me and Joe de Rosa are
going to be continuing our
uninformed show as a podcast

1435
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:13,190
on the uh,
myspace.com/uninformed radio.

1436
01:31:13,191 --> 01:31:15,860
And we're going to be using this
device with a couple of microphones,

1437
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:20,330
and I think we're going to be doing an
episode next week and we're going to put

1438
01:31:20,331 --> 01:31:22,700
it up there and it's going to
sound lovely and that's it.

1439
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:25,790
And I feel like I'm born
yet, so that's it. Everybody.

1440
01:31:25,791 --> 01:31:30,020
Thanks for listening and please keep the
questions coming and feel free to keep

1441
01:31:30,021 --> 01:31:31,910
sending me,
you know,

1442
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:36,890
things from past topics and if you want
to do them for the, uh, the new ones,

1443
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,630
songs,
your top fucking,

1444
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:43,840
your top eight songs that annoy you
and shit in a sports that bugs you.

1445
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,920
All right. That's it.
Everybody have a good one.
