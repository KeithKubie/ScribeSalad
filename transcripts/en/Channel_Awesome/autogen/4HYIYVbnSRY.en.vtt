00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
ends and re only airbenders so there was
 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.330 align:start position:0%
ends and re only airbenders so there was
probably<00:05:36.020><c> that</c><00:05:36.260><c> connection</c><00:05:36.650><c> and</c><00:05:36.979><c> he</c><00:05:37.070><c> wants</c><00:05:37.310><c> to</c>

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 align:start position:0%
probably that connection and he wants to
 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
probably that connection and he wants to

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 align:start position:0%
pass on the whole airbending thing okay
 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.140 align:start position:0%
pass on the whole airbending thing okay
I<00:05:39.440><c> think</c><00:05:39.740><c> of</c><00:05:39.800><c> is</c><00:05:39.889><c> that</c><00:05:40.039><c> maybe</c><00:05:40.430><c> he</c><00:05:40.760><c> was</c><00:05:40.940><c> like</c>

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 align:start position:0%
I think of is that maybe he was like
 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.909 align:start position:0%
I think of is that maybe he was like
training<00:05:41.810><c> him</c><00:05:41.900><c> harder</c><00:05:42.260><c> to</c><00:05:42.440><c> and</c><00:05:42.650><c> that's</c><00:05:42.770><c> why</c>

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 align:start position:0%
training him harder to and that's why
 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.129 align:start position:0%
training him harder to and that's why
such<00:05:43.220><c> a</c><00:05:43.250><c> stick-in-the-mud</c><00:05:43.729><c> yeah</c><00:05:44.659><c> but</c><00:05:44.930><c> you</c>

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 align:start position:0%
such a stick-in-the-mud yeah but you
 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
such a stick-in-the-mud yeah but you
know<00:05:45.260><c> what</c><00:05:45.409><c> knowing</c><00:05:45.740><c> Aang</c><00:05:45.979><c> it</c><00:05:46.220><c> probably</c>

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 align:start position:0%

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:10.670 align:start position:0%
more fillory like i felt like it was
 

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.530 align:start position:0%

very<00:08:11.090><c> it</c><00:08:11.810><c> was</c><00:08:11.930><c> much</c><00:08:12.230><c> slower</c><00:08:12.470><c> pace</c><00:08:12.920><c> wait</c><00:08:13.430><c> it</c><00:08:14.420><c> was</c>

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:14.540 align:start position:0%
very it was much slower pace wait it was
 

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
very it was much slower pace wait it was
slower<00:08:14.750><c> paced</c><00:08:15.050><c> but</c><00:08:15.200><c> I</c><00:08:15.230><c> felt</c><00:08:15.710><c> it</c><00:08:15.830><c> was</c><00:08:15.890><c> okay</c><00:08:16.220><c> I</c>

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.250 align:start position:0%
slower paced but I felt it was okay I
 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.100 align:start position:0%
slower paced but I felt it was okay I
think<00:08:16.430><c> because</c><00:08:16.790><c> the</c><00:08:16.910><c> last</c><00:08:17.090><c> do</c><00:08:17.300><c> we</c><00:08:17.420><c> did</c><00:08:17.600><c> see</c><00:08:17.780><c> so</c>

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:18.110 align:start position:0%

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:26.930 align:start position:0%
wasn't a white or he wasn't a complainer
so<00:11:24.779><c> when</c><00:11:25.200><c> you</c><00:11:25.320><c> have</c><00:11:25.529><c> that</c><00:11:25.740><c> first</c><00:11:26.190><c> and</c><00:11:26.490><c> then</c><00:11:26.550><c> you</c>

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
so when you have that first and then you
 

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.210 align:start position:0%
so when you have that first and then you
have<00:11:27.330><c> this</c><00:11:27.540><c> character</c><00:11:28.110><c> it's</c><00:11:28.560><c> a</c><00:11:28.680><c> tough</c><00:11:28.890><c> act</c><00:11:29.130><c> to</c>

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
have this character it's a tough act to
 

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.430 align:start position:0%
have this character it's a tough act to
follow<00:11:29.310><c> so</c><00:11:30.150><c> I</c><00:11:30.180><c> think</c><00:11:30.450><c> it's</c><00:11:30.690><c> okay</c><00:11:30.990><c> then</c><00:11:31.230><c> sheet</c>

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
follow so I think it's okay then sheet
 

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
follow so I think it's okay then sheet
like<00:11:31.620><c> I</c><00:11:31.650><c> said</c><00:11:31.860><c> that</c><00:11:31.980><c> she's</c><00:11:32.160><c> Robin</c><00:11:33.000><c> she</c><00:11:33.150><c> wants</c>
