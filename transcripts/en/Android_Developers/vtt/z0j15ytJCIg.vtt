ROMAN NURIK: And are we live?

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.190
ADAM KOCH: Hopefully.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.330
ROMAN NURIK: I think
we're live.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.350
OK, so hopefully we're
now live, and you

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.560
all could see us.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.260
Welcome to Android Design
in Action--

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.090
Travel Booking and Planning.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.530
Sorry for the screw up.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.060
We're about five minutes late.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.840
As you can see, we're not in
our normal room today.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.590
There was a scheduling
kerfuffle, if you will.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.280
Anyway, so let's get started.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.056
My name is Roman Nurik.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:31.664
ADAM KOCH: Adam Koch.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.840
Over in London we have--

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.370
NICK BUTCHER: Hi.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.970
Nick Butcher.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.880
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so we've got
the three of us here, and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.210
today we're going to be talking
about a couple of apps

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.540
that fall into the kind
of travel booking

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.880
and planning category.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.760
So let's get started.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.530
Adam, if you could select
the slides there.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.520
The first app we're going
to do is Kayak.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.190
And actually, before we jump
into this, I forgot to talk

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.310
about what the show
is all about.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.850
Since this is only the fourth
or whatever episode of the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.870
show, we should probably
mention, in this show we don't

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.770
really review apps and let you
know what the best apps are to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.750
go download.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.870
We basically look at a few apps
that have been nominated

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.290
or submitted it to us for
review by the greater

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.110
developer community.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.160
And we take a look at how we can
spruce them up visually,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.050
how we can make some
improvements here and there to

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.470
the visual design.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.730
And the apps that are submitted
are actually

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.160
reviewed the previous Friday in
the app clinic where Reto

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.980
Meier and Ian Ni-Lewis take
a look at a higher-level

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.640
overview of the app and how the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.310
overall app can be improved.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.540
But in this show, we look at
the design strictly and

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.440
specific screens even.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.915
So let's get started
with Kayak.

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:48.340
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, and just to
say, today we're having a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.860
special focus on
tablets, right?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.100
ROMAN NURIK: Well, that's
right, that's right.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.820
So today we're going to be
talking about apps in the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.530
context of tablet usage, so
you will not see any phone

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.960
screens as far as I know.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.020
Maybe later down the road where
we talk about design

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.150
news, but I'll be focusing on
7-inch and 10-inch tablets.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.770
So for Kayak, we looked at the
7-inch tablet version, so in

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.520
this case, we have a Nexus 7.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.590
And Kayak is basically an app
that lets you do lots and lots

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.930
of different things.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.230
It lets you look for flights,
look for hotels,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.000
look for car rentals.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.730
It's got a million features.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.890
These are all awesome
features.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.160
The feature set is completely
broad and expansive.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.990
There's so much you can
do with the app.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.470
But we chose to focus for now
on the hotel search since

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.490
that's kind of one of
the key features.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.530
So in this screen here--

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.256
you can't really see
my mouse pointer.

00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:43.640
That's fine.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.250
Oh, you can.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.340
Sweet.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.450
In this screen here,
you basically--

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.590
this is actually two screens.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.410
You have a dashboard, which is
just kind of the landing page.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.690
When you first open up Kayak on
your Nexus 7, you have this

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.960
kind of set of icons that
indicate the different

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.590
sections of the app.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.120
And then you have kind of
extraneous or separate

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.030
functionality, things like
airline directory, airlines

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.390
fees, a kind of random
assortment of other things in

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.780
the action overflow.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.400
Once you select hotel search,
which is kind of this top

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.190
middle icon, you get to
a hotel search screen.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.060
On this screen, you basically
select the check-in dates, the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.310
number of guests, number of
rooms, all that type of stuff.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.170
When you press Search Hotels,
you are then taken to a list

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.790
or a map of hotels.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.710
So basically, you can see here
that to search for a hotel,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.050
you have to go through three
separate screens.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.770
You have to first do the
dashboard, then type in some

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.350
information about the hotel
you're looking for, and then

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.890
see the results, and then
possibly obviously go into the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.680
hotel details.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.400
So do you guys have any thoughts
on Kayak, in general,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.080
or these couple of screens?

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.200
ADAM KOCH: I had a couple
of thoughts.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.215
First of all, I love Kayak.

00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:01.790
I've used the website
for many years.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.770
So it's great that they
have a solid app.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.160
One interesting thing about
these designs, I guess, is

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.790
that they have the parts of
design best practices, but

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.320
other parts are kind of missing

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.940
the design best practices.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.320
So you've got these gradients,
you've got sort of a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.340
semi-ActionBar at the top.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.260
ROMAN NURIK: The
faux ActionBar.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.330
ADAM KOCH: The faux ActionBar,
as we call it.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.000
And you've got-- the drop-downs
spinners have the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.020
little triangle to indicate the
spinner, but it's kind of

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.600
half and half.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.890
And I don't even know if they
would need that compatibility

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.790
menu button down at the bottom
anymore because they kind of

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.790
have the faux action bar.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.120
So simply switching the target
SDK out might actually remove

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.365
that kind of thing.

00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:48.810
Nick?

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.005
NICK BUTCHER: So my first
thoughts when I look at it is

00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:53.985
this says to be it's a web
app masquerading as a

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.620
native app to me.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.570
There's some subtle hints
you can see there.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.630
Artifacts like the gradients
and how some of the screens

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.150
are clearly just being stretched
up to fill the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.290
canvas, which immediately set me
in a frame of mind thinking

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.140
that this app is going to
be perhaps slightly less

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.655
responsive than I might hope.

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:17.190
And it might not follow my
expected mental models.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.730
Certain things like if you look
at like the Up arrow next

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.620
to the app icon on the second
screen, you can see it's

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.870
slightly too big, slightly too
thick, and all of these

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.020
things, which may seem very
subtle, but they just hint to

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.730
the user that this app is going
to function unlike the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.330
standard apps which we're used
to functioning with.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.930
I'm also a big fan of Kayak,
but already there's a few

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.300
uh-ohs going on.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.636
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:43.640
And actually, we'll talk
a little bit more

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.180
about the faux ActionBar.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.510
There's really no reason to
do it anymore, right?

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.890
I think actually Jake Wharton,
who is the author of one of

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.260
the greatest kind of ActionBar
libraries out there--

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.120
ActionBarSherlock--

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.180
mentioned you're doing
a lot work.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.640
If you're rewriting it yourself,
you're doing a lot

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.550
of work to try to get it to look
and behave like the rest

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.995
of the platform.

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:04.710
So there's really just no need
to do it since for backwards

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.330
compatibility purposes, there
are libraries like

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.460
ActionBarSherlock that just
do the work for you.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.670
It's really just a
drop-in, right?

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.350
So there's really no reason
these days to do it.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.490
It's so stylable, it's
so customizable.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.710
Pretty much everything about the
ActionBar is customizable,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.180
so there's really no reason
to have to make your own.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.020
One last thing I wanted to talk
about before we jump into

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.390
the redesign is the branding.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.440
So the branding throughout, I
do love the color palette.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.460
There's a strong kind of orange,
dark gray, light gray

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.520
color palette, and I'm
personally a huge fan of

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.880
single-accent color palettes
where you have a gray scale

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.940
plus an accent.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.910
It's really phenomenal.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.940
And I think that they have lots
of opportunities to use

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.360
that really unique Kayak
orange throughout.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.120
And I think that what they have
here is one possible way

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.790
of doing things.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.750
But I feel like they can
go even a step further.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.860
So let's jump into
the redesign.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.510
This is one possible way that
you can imagine a tablet

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.130
version of Kayak to look.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.920
So in the top, you have your
standard ActionBar.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.410
There's no real need for an
up affordance in this case

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.640
because this is a
single screen.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.680
You'll notice that we combine
three screens into one

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.350
effectively.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.450
At the left, you have the same
kind of hotel search.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.620
And we've kind of redesigned
some of the elements to fit

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.150
better into the Holo design,
the Holo styling.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.130
We've also given more prominence
to recent searches.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.500
This is something that Ian
pointed out last week on the

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.200
App Clinic.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.640
Recent searches is something
that's really commonly used.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.350
You don't want to lose something
you just did, right?

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.990
So if you went into the app and
did a search, maybe you

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.800
did another search, and you want
to go back to the other

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.090
one, you really don't want to
have to rewrite everything or

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.400
reenter all that information.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.770
NICK BUTCHER: Especially if
you've got a property like

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.890
Kayak, which has that
rich web property.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.240
So if you're able to sync that
search history from the

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.060
desktop to your devices
as well, that

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.350
can be a killer feature.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.700
That can save you a bunch of
time, like Google Maps does,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.820
for example.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.650
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, totally.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.250
Totally.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.070
Sync is-- that's like--

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.640
in Russian, we would say
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN].

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.870
That's like a whole
separate story.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.950
But sync, absolutely.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.820
That would make this whole
experience just like seamless.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.270
So yes, I have recent
searches.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.280
We simplified the entry
form and used icons.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.171
Actually, the phone version of
the app uses icons, and the

00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:36.789
tablet version doesn't.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.100
It seems kind of silly to have
to redesign the same screen

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.919
across different--

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.419
or massively redo the
same screen across

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.530
different form factors.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.830
I feel like in this case they
could have just combined

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.275
certain elements from both and
had less work to do when

00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:53.770
porting to different sizes.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.920
But anyway, so that's
kind of this screen.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.740
You'll notice that we did some
touch-ups on the map balloons

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.370
or map bubbles and
things like that.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.030
But one question is, what about
core navigation, right?

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.590
Switching between
hotels, flights,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.760
cars, things like that?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.650
So for that, we decided to
use the ActionBar spinner

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.190
navigation.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.280
So basically, at the top level,
you start off with

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.070
hotels or whatever you feel
is the most common or most

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.950
important aspect of Kayak.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.530
So you can start with
hotels or flights.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.290
We also added notification since
that was in the phone

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.540
version of the app.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.710
One minor point is you can
make it sticky, right?

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.940
So if somebody most recently
used flight search in Kayak,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.780
then when they back out and go
about their daily lives and

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.950
they open up Kayak again,
you can start them

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:45.700
off in flight search.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.450
It's totally up to you where
you start the user.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.210
If you have a strong indication
that they're into

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.330
flights right now, then
start them off there.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.940
And then lastly, you have this
area on the right to put extra

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.580
functionality.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.890
So in the action overflow, you
can put things like price

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.010
alerts or packing lists, stuff
that's not really commonly

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.080
used, probably only like
5% or 10% of the time.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.740
So what do you guys
think so far?

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.740
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, I think
I really like it.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.800
Well, one question,
first of all.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.250
The diagonal up-pointing arrows
by the search history,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.280
I gather that prepopulates?

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.260
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.500
ADAM KOCH: I think that's
a great feature.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.390
I use that all the time,
say, for Google Search.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.710
Especially when you're doing
searches for hotels, you might

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.230
want to just change the
dates a little bit.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.760
You might want to tweak
the location or

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.250
something like that.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.270
So I think that's great.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.360
The other thing I really like is
Kayak's been traditionally

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.890
known for their power
of applying filters.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.590
But on a desktop experience,
you've got a lot of screen

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.010
real estate to fit those
filters in immediately.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.180
On a smaller device, on a mobile
device or even on a

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.360
small tablet like the Nexus 7,
there's not as much screen

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.730
real estate, so it's being
collapsed into that action

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.180
button at the top there.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.540
I don't think you actually
mocked up how the filters

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.280
would look out.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.350
ROMAN NURIK: No.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.490
ADAM KOCH: The nice thing is
that the screen remains clear

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.620
and easy to read.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.745
And then engaging that can sort
of unfold the power of

00:11:13.745 --> 00:11:15.340
the Kayak filters.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:15.930
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.060
So filters actually in landscape
in their current

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.710
app, when you tilt it into
landscape, it shows the

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.240
filters as a left pane.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.280
It seems like that
may make sense.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.100
In general, we try to maintain
something called functional

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.810
parity across portrait
and landscape.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.020
So if you switch from portrait
into landscape, your view of

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.980
the world, your view of the app
won't drastically change.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.240
And the things you can
do with the app

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.520
won't drastically change.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.705
Showing filters may
be appropriate.

00:11:43.705 --> 00:11:48.320
But at the same time, filters
is almost always kind of a

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.960
separate action, like filter
what you're currently looking

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.310
at or sort.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.386
So if you have both sort and
filter, for example, if you

00:11:54.386 --> 00:11:57.420
had a list here, if you had both
sort and filter, then you

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.590
should probably have those side
by side since they're

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.860
very commonly used together.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.270
Since we're kind of running
low on time, let me must

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.880
quickly jump into this
next screen.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.790
So once you get into the search
results, what I thought

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:16.380
here is on a 7-inch device, you
can't really show both the

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.380
map in its full fidelity
and a left pane in

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.570
portrait side by side.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.130
So one option is you can
actually collapse the left

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.690
pane into this collapsed left
pane, I guess, if there's a

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.670
better name for it.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.690
This is similar to what Google
Talk does on a 7-inch or a

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.760
10-inch device.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.470
And then if you're on a 10-inch
device and you have

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.580
this space, then you never
have to collapse.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.760
Or if you're in landscape on a
7-inch, you also just don't

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.010
have to collapse.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.495
Lastly--

00:12:45.495 --> 00:12:47.190
I know we're running a
little low on time.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.850
The last thing I just wanted
to talk about--

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.490
this point that Ian made.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.000
Actually, I think either Ian
or Reto made this, but last

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.090
week they talked about this
concept of let me book my

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.730
entire trip.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:04.260
If you're Kayak and you have
access to hotels and flights

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.020
and car rentals and stuff to
see around you-- and we'll

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.030
talk about that in a second
with TripAdvisor--

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.730
do more than just give the
user the option to choose

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.780
hotels and flights as separate
parts of the app.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.680
Don't necessarily separate
your app

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.690
into separate sections.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.590
So what if you combine this
entire trip planning, booking,

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.750
itinerary experience
into one flow?

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.860
So this is something that
we mocked up here, where

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.240
basically your sections are no
longer hotel, flights, and

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.450
cars, and whatever.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.340
Your sections are now
just your trips.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.290
This is kind of similar
to what Tripit does.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.535
And Tripit has a great model
of giving you an itinerary.

00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:46.730
It shows you all of your hotels,
cars, and everything

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.230
all in one chronological flow.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.530
And people are really good
at dealing with time or

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.880
chronological flows.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.980
So in this case, we have the
hotel search, which is part of

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.530
this left pane, which is
basically an itinerary.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.500
So as you scroll up, you get
earlier in your itinerary, and

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.830
as you scroll down,
you get further

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.120
down in your itinerary.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.600
So your arriving flight is above
the hotel search, which

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.970
is above the departing flight.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.990
Once you find and book hotel,
that hotel search card, in

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:20.540
this case, it kind of turns
into a hotel booking card.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.490
And then if you're not
interested in getting a car

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.030
rental, for example, or a hotel,
you can just swipe it

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.040
away to dismiss it.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.720
So what do you guys think?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.570
Does this make sense as kind of
like an itinerary planning?

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.520
NICK BUTCHER: I want this app.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.300
I love what you've done here.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.190
I completely agree with what
you say about the grouping

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.840
making sense to me.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.760
Rather than having to go in and
out of different apps or

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.070
different sections of an app,
you're kind of putting it on a

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.020
timeline instantly.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.530
I just get it, and
I really like it.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.630
And it must simplify your
workflow as well.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.230
If I've entered the dates of
my flights, surely you can

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.310
infer the date to the
hotel stay as well.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.680
And kind of grouping it
all together makes

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.860
that completely obvious.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.450
So I think that's one of my
major takeaways from this

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.310
redesign is the way you've
simplified the workflow to

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:11.630
remove steps, remove dialogs,
and have it easier to access.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.370
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, totally.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.310
And you opened this up to other
possibilities, right?

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.410
So if in the future you expand
to restaurants or something

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.140
like that, you can add kind of
placeholders for restaurants,

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:29.130
let's say, every night of your
stay or right before your

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.440
flight, or something
like that.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.780
You have really a lot of options
a fully managing a

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.410
flight or fully managing
a trip.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.800
Actually, one thing I wanted to
call out is Adam and I were

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.110
talking about this, and we
struggled with how do add

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.550
stuff, right?

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.630
So we have this extra action in
the top right that's kind

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.670
of add a card.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.220
But, Adam, you mentioned
like you can just

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.270
place that in line.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.470
You don't have to necessarily
have that.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.930
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, I mean, you've
already got the Add Car

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.430
Rental there, so there could
be just an extra button or

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.210
something that triggers adding
a segment to the trip.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.145
Either way, I mean, that would
just be something that would

00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:04.100
be discussed before actually
implementing this.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.240
But overall, I like it.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:06.720
It's cool.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.040
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, I think
that's a great thing about

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.750
this type of thing.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.930
There's so many different
options.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.640
And one thing we should caveat--
and then we should

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.080
probably get on to TripAdvisor
very soon.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.290
But one thing we should caveat
is these are just visual

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.250
design mocks.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.920
You won't really know until you
actually have a prototype

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.500
in your hands whether or not
all this really works.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.180
But these are just some ideas
that we threw around.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.330
So take all of our mocks with
a grain of salt, I'd say.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.680
So with that, should we move
on to TripAdvisor, Nick?

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.100
NICK BUTCHER: Let's.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.440
ROMAN NURIK: So first, Nick,
you want to talk

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.580
about what we see here?

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.900
NICK BUTCHER: My messy desk.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.670
So I've really enjoyed doing
this Android Design In Action

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.745
show, where we're trying to
quite quickly turn around some

00:16:49.745 --> 00:16:54.570
redesigns from throwing around
a few ideas on how we might

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.560
change things based on
playing with the app

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.440
for a little while.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.560
So turning that into a mock to
give you a good understanding

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.960
of what that might look like.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.250
So for me, one of the biggest
takeaways has been more

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.829
sketching the better.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.490
The more time I spend in
low-fidelity [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.069
tools like you can see
here on my desk.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.780
I find it saves me tons of time
down the road, actually,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.293
in Photoshop or whatever your
tool of choice is for

00:17:19.293 --> 00:17:21.560
producing high-fidelity mocks.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.720
So here's a couple
of examples.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.119
You can see ideas I've played
around with and the

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.460
scribblings out and refinements
here, there, and

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:27.720
everywhere.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.470
And it just saves you tons
and tons of time.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.610
So I'd say, paper, pencil,
sticky notes are

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.930
your friends here.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.010
And for me, I found, as
well, bouncing ideas

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.060
off of someone else.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.900
The minute you try and
articulate an idea to someone

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.276
else, you find yourself
sketching out, trying to show

00:17:41.276 --> 00:17:42.450
it to someone else.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.260
You get so much better rather
than sitting down and kind of

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.000
plan the way on your own.
so it's been fun.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.150
ROMAN NURIK: And just to call
out, a few episodes ago, I

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.680
think it was maybe in the second
episode of the show or

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.290
maybe the third, we actually
provided links to some of the

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.130
great templates that you can
download and print out.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.790
So you don't have to

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.390
necessarily start from scratch.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:08.150
You can start from one-to-one
size templates that you can

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.360
just print out and
start drawing on.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.005
So that's definitely
a good start.

00:18:12.005 --> 00:18:15.140
Better than if you decided to
just go straight from pen to

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.135
paper starting from
scratch, right?

00:18:17.135 --> 00:18:19.370
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I found the
templates are great when

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.210
you're trying to get a
consistency between screens

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.220
because you can get rough sizes
of elements lining up to

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.450
get you that consistently.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.320
But if you're just doing it
single screen, I often find

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.240
going even lower fidelity, just
a blank piece of paper

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.540
can be lighter weight.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:33.900
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.350
All right.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.410
So let's move on to
the app itself.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.870
So this is TripAdvisor.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.786
And this is the dashboard
screen.

00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:44.500
Nick, thoughts, comments?

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.070
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.400
So this is the first thing
you're presented with when you

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.720
open the TripAdvisor application
on a tablet, and

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.490
it's kind of sparse.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:58.030
I mean, we do advocate a kind
of a minimal look and feel.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.450
But I feel like this is taking
it a little bit too far,

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.490
especially when you consider
tablets might have a slightly

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.310
different use case.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.900
Well, most studies have shown
that tablets are used in a

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.180
much more discovery mode when
you perhaps have a longer

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.000
engagement time, and you're
looking for something a little

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.870
bit more engaging as opposed
to perhaps a mobile phone

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.086
experience when you're looking
for snacking experience to get

00:19:20.086 --> 00:19:21.640
in and out quite quickly.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.350
So for me, this design felt a
bit flat for a few things.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.590
So just the sparsity at first.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:32.670
Next up is laying out all the
kind of different verticals

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.520
which Trip It offers is--

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.960
it's kind of like exposing the
way that they internally

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.260
classify the information.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.620
I know whenever I go to the
TripIt service , and I

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.940
actually-- sorry, TripAdvisor
service-- and I absolutely

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.720
love TripAdvisor.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.390
I use it all the time.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.590
I used it to plan
my honeymoon.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.550
It's fantastic.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.160
But I never have gone and
drilled down, oh, I want

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.620
hotels, now I want hotels in
East Asia, or whatever.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.510
I always just search.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.730
Like for me, search is the
key way you can navigate.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.890
So I felt like having the
top-line verticals called out

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.400
was almost misleading.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.800
And lastly, as with most of
these redesigns, it doesn't

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.520
quite fall into that natural
Android look and feel.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.000
Already the height of the bar
at the top is kind of

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.350
nonstandard.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.066
There is some gradients
throughout the application,

00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:21.300
and the padding is
kind of off.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.160
The text boxes aren't quite
as you might expect.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.420
And also throughout the
application, I found lots of

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.390
extra stuff, which you kind
of get with websites.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.485
So, for example, there might be
links to legal information

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.130
and privacy policies, and so on
that you will quite often

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.320
see in perhaps the footer
of a website.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.620
But part of the beauty of an
app experience [AUDIO LOST]

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:48.090
can achieve by simplifying and
really concentrating on doing

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.810
one or two things really,
really well.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.860
So i found there's a lot of web
metaphors which had been

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.520
carried over into the
application, perhaps through

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.450
reusing code in WebViews, for
example, that really detracted

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.810
from my experience and didn't
really offer any

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.200
kind of added benefit.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.780
So we tried to reduce
those distractions.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.700
Any other thoughts, guys?

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.960
ROMAN NURIK: I'm at
a loss of words.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.690
That was very well
articulated.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:16.380
Yeah, I mean, this is almost
similar to the Google Search,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.450
like google.com.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.810
When you go on the website of
google.com, you're just

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.340
presented with a search box.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.260
But google.com, when you want
to Google something, you

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.070
generally actually want
to do a search.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.430
That's the one thing people
think when they think-- the

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.290
average person, when they think
Google, they think of

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.220
search, right?

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.540
But for TripAdvisor, to me at
least and I'm guessing most

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.000
people, they don't immediately
only think of search.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.440
They probably think of
search as well as

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.570
discovery, like you said.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.060
What are the great things that
people are saying on

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.400
TripAdvisor?

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.090
It's a network.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.785
It's a community of content
that's rich and that you may

00:21:50.785 --> 00:21:52.030
not really know about.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.310
You may not know what you're
looking for when you get to

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.700
TripAdvisor.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.230
So bubbling that up I think
is very important.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.360
So do you want to talk about
the redesign Nick?

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.110
In three, two, one.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.250
Wah!

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:06.830
NICK BUTCHER: Wow.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.970
That's some lovely effects
going on there.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.970
Wow, look at that!

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.340
OK, so here is what I've done
with the redesign this week.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.020
So there's a couple of things
we've really tried to achieve.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.420
The first off is adopting the
Holo look and feel as we

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.420
always tend to do.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.765
So you can see this in the
flatter gradients, the use of

00:22:27.765 --> 00:22:31.020
the color palettes while still
retaining the TripAdvisor

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.620
accents is a much more standard
color palette, taking

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.530
quite a lot of inspiration from
the Google+ app, in fact,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.210
and using standard familiar
iconography, which the user

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.940
should instantly be able
to go and pick up on.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.390
But what we've done
here is we've--

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.110
while emphasizing search, so you
see we've made the search

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.430
box stand out from the rhythm of
the rest of the application

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.300
to give it prominence, as well
as like really enlarging it--

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.460
I know that's a huge search
box, really--

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.850
as well as floating up other
relevant content.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.290
If you go to TripAdvisor's
website, it's full of lots of

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.730
discovery mechanisms, so be
that social from what your

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:18.770
friends are up to, to curated
lists of things you might

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.390
enjoy or would like to discover,
so we tried to

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.940
bubble up that information.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.240
While again, though, it also
retains the information which

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.360
is most important to the user.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.560
So just starting from the far
left, we have the user's

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.140
information.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.330
So they have this kind of My
Saves area where you can save

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.470
information for later
retrieval.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.260
As well, it's similar
to the Kayak.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.070
We've given recent searches
some more

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.140
prominence here as well.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:43.410
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.670
Yeah, then nearby, right?

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.590
Like if you're near something
that's really important, you

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.500
want to bubble in up.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.510
So if you're on a tablet, let's
say, and you're in a

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.730
hotel in London, in this case,
and the Big Ben is having some

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.775
sort of event or something, or
there's some sort of event at

00:23:59.775 --> 00:24:03.676
the Big Ben-- clearly I know
nothing about London events.

00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:04.130
NICK BUTCHER: Every
hour, Roman.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.930
It happens every hour.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.100
ROMAN NURIK: That's true.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.090
So you can kind of bubble
something up like that in a

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.330
really visual way, right?

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.970
Actually, this is very
interesting what you've done

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.500
with the Friends.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.450
So these activity stream where
a friend did something with a

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.390
place, like reviewed a place.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:29.500
I like the interesting usage of
that square space where you

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.050
basically made two triangles
overlapping.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.530
This actually works quite
well with OpenGL

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.900
meshes, as far as I know.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.480
But anyway, it's kind of
interesting to kind of show

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.590
half-avatar, half-thumbnail
of the place.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.760
Really interesting
treatment there.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.250
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, if you look
back a couple slides of

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.600
my messy sketches, you'll see
a couple of post-it notes of

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.040
ways of doing that.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.640
Because I had tried pairing
these two images together, and

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.040
you could have some overlap,
or may be have it slightly

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.860
indented, but it ends
up looking kind

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.820
of uneven and jagged.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:04.255
So that was a suggestion from a
friend, actually, going for

00:25:04.255 --> 00:25:06.790
the diagonal wipe, or whatever
you want to call it.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.570
And I quite like it.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.850
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.890
NICK BUTCHER: And just a
couple of notes here.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.535
As Roman said, we're not going
to be showing any phone

00:25:13.535 --> 00:25:14.270
redesigns here.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.000
You might end up either
reprioritizing or showing

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.540
slightly different content on
the phone because that might

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.480
be a different context that
users in-- like I can imagine

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.830
saying that my stuff-- the
Recents, the My Saves-- is

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:26.900
going to be really prominent.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.660
But some of the big visuals
might be a bit

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.820
too heavy for a phone.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.650
You might want to de-emphasize
those slightly or perhaps even

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.200
not show them.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.570
I think the approach I've really
taken here is thinking

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.480
about this from a tablet point
of view so you're thinking

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.810
about these big visual engaging
experiences, so lots

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.360
of visuals.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.705
ROMAN NURIK: One other minor
thing, we're running super low

00:25:49.705 --> 00:25:52.090
on time, but I just really
want to call this out.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.610
In general, when designing with
photos, some folks may

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.980
think, oh, my photo is a certain
aspect ratio, so the

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.990
UI element also needs to
be that aspect ratio.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.100
Don't lock yourself
in that way.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.925
Especially for photos where the
subject is in the center,

00:26:08.925 --> 00:26:12.040
feel free to use something
called Center Crop, which is

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.300
scale type on Image views, where
basically you select the

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.390
aspect ratio, and the image is
cropped within the UI element.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.900
So you'll chop off either the
sides, the left and the right,

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.550
or the top and the bottom to
make sure that the image

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.610
itself maintains its aspect
ratio while fitting within the

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:30.440
UI element.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.120
So I think this works really
well for things like avatars,

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.500
like people avatars, where there
face is usually in the

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:41.610
center and photos of Big
Ben, for example.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:42.108
ADAM KOCH: I know we're
short on time.

00:26:42.108 --> 00:26:45.530
I just want to say, I like it.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.340
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:48.720
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.240
So let's move on
to the detail.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.360
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.876
We have one more screen.

00:26:53.876 --> 00:26:56.660
So seeing as Ian was having so
much trouble in searching for

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.440
Venice in the App Clinic, if you
caught it last Friday, we

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.630
decided to take a little
look at Venice here.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.010
So this is what happens when
you search for Venice.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:07.600
You just get a generic
city-level result.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.910
And I think the original
is a lot better

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.160
than the landing screen.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.415
I think they're doing some
good things here.

00:27:14.415 --> 00:27:16.550
They're sharing some appropriate
information.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.930
But I also think they
have a problem

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.155
with information density.

00:27:19.155 --> 00:27:22.860
I think they're showing too
much information as well.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.135
Now I know for me, when
I think TripIt--

00:27:25.135 --> 00:27:26.940
TripAdvisor, I keep saying
that-- when I think

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.080
TripAdvisor, I think the beauty
of the service is in

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.300
the sheer number of
reviews, right?

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.910
It can give you this very
intelligently weighted list.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.900
I don't want to get 1,000
results which other search

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.990
engines might offer.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.380
I'm mostly interested in setting
a couple of filters

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.300
and then just seeing the
top five or ten.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.600
I'm trusting those reviews.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.590
I'll browser the reviews and
make sure they're OK.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.650
So I've really tried to draw
that out in the redesign here.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:55.340
So we tried to decrease
[AUDIO LOST]

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.300
isn't helping and just float
up the things which

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.720
TripAdvisor does really well.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.740
So you can see in the design
at the bottom here, we've

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.690
retained the same kind of look
and feel, so that kind of

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.400
flatter look.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.350
But we've really bubbled up the
user ratings, and you can

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.560
see the ranking is given quite
a lot of prominence with each

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.040
listing on the side.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.880
And straight away, we've exposed
when you select a

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.295
result, you'll see the graph
and the photos and more

00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:25.650
information about that place.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:26.840
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.230
And another thing is that you've
given just more white

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.290
space around all the results
on the left.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:34.600
Again, I think this is something
I bring up fairly

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.620
often, but use of white space
is just really important,

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.680
especially on tablets.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.110
And I think that the bottom
screen that you've designed

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.220
here just makes better use of
white space throughout all the

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.954
three panes that are visible.

00:28:45.954 --> 00:28:46.860
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.816
I didn't get time to muck it up
this week, but I was toying

00:28:49.816 --> 00:28:52.350
with the idea of having a third
pane off to the right,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.280
as it were, so when you went
to click on those reviews,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.720
like the little bar charts or
the photos, you could have

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.480
that slide in or perhaps
collapse the left-most panel.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.790
Think what Gmail does on a
tablet, for example, where you

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:09.140
might have your labels in the
message, a subject, and then a

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.660
message details kind of on an
axis which slides across.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.870
I was thinking something along
those lines but didn't get

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.280
time to mock it out,
unfortunately.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.130
ADAM KOCH: Just one very quick
thing is I'm looking at the

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.210
designs from across the table
on another computer here.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.260
And looking at them side by
side, small versions, I can't

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.680
really see the text or
anything properly.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.020
But the redesign just strikes
me as very clean, and I can

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.720
actually almost make out a lot
of the components even without

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.140
being able to see exactly
what's written there.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.070
So I think the design looks
really good from that

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.730
perspective.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.980
It's very easy to make out the
most interesting pieces of

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.380
information.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.910
ROMAN NURIK: It's just a
generally good technique.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.700
Take your screenshot, or if it's
an APK, install it, and

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.430
put the tablet 10 feet away from
you and see if you can

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.260
just roughly make out
the structure.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.740
You don't have to obviously read
the text because that's

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.490
probably impossible.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.900
But it should be clear to you
what the screen does, what

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.372
it's information is about.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.450
Here's--

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.590
sorry should have
got to do that.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.895
ADAM KOCH: Now I can read it.

00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:15.170
ROMAN NURIK: Now you can
actually read it.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.730
So this is that same screen
just blown up.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.920
OK, so since we're super low
on time, let's fly through

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.830
Android Design News.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:23.920
All right.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:29.510
So first, Juhani Lehtimaki
released a book on Android UI

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.625
called Smashing Android
UI in collaboration

00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:33.370
with Smashing magazine.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:36.255
I don't believe it's shipping
just yet, the physical book,

00:30:36.255 --> 00:30:40.620
but I think the e-book is
available on Google Playbooks.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.320
I think that QR code takes
you to the book on Google

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.580
Playbooks, or the Google Play
store, so check that out.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.280
It's super awesome.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.500
Oh, and Nick gets
a mention in a--

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.750
was it in the forward?

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.850
NICK BUTCHER: Juhani recognizes
the awesome Google+

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.010
community who talk
about Android

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.830
development and design.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.830
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:08.110
Next, somebody else want to talk
about the Books update?

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.950
Anybody use Books?

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.410
I actually don't really
read books.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.450
But anyway, OK, fine.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.550
So Google Playbooks.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.460
The official Android
app was updated.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.700
Actually, the contextual
ActionBar, if you long press

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.960
and select something from the
book, like some piece of text,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.550
if it's a location, if it's
a place name, then it will

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.050
automatically do a Google Maps
search and show you a little

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:36.910
Google Now style card at the
bottom, which you could then

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.090
click and get taken
to Maps for.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:40.830
It's pretty awesome.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.630
You can also highlight things
and do cool things with

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.420
selections and playbooks.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.300
NICK BUTCHER: I think
it's just really

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.840
cool little UI source.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.130
It's like a zero or one-touch
interaction.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.170
It's not very clunky.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.345
I don't have to long press
copy or go to the browser

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:55.440
place, whatever.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.490
It's just really taking digital
books and showing you

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.770
why digital books are more
useful than physical books.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.970
And I think it also speaks to
the fact that Google Books

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.850
doesn't really use too much
skew off the queues.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.920
I mean, it allows for this kind
of interaction, like kind

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.570
of using the very heavy skew
off crutches, kind of limit

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.720
the scope of what you can do,
how you can extend people's

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.660
very well-established mental
models, so I think it's just a

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.050
really nicely done
implementation.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.550
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:29.680
Adam?

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.570
ADAM KOCH: So very quickly,
this is an app-- full

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.730
disclosure.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.845
I've worked with Michael
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:34.845 --> 00:32:35.710
before in the past.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.320
But I thought it was a really
neat little app.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.580
It's got one purpose, just
to look up stock quotes.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.130
It's implemented our design
guidelines and the Holo

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.930
theming very nicely.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.910
It's also got this sort of card
pattern which you see

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.810
around the place quite a lot now
and that we talked about

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.790
quite a lot with these
travel apps.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.280
And check it out.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.840
It's very nicely done.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.580
ROMAN NURIK: Much to my and
Nick's delight, I believe

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.870
Michael is using either Roboto
Thin or Roboto Light for the

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:03.260
stock quote.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.265
I think it's just--
mwah-- eloquent.

00:33:05.265 --> 00:33:06.035
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:06.035 --> 00:33:07.680
NICK BUTCHER: I was indeed
delighted when he

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.150
created this light up.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.540
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.196
NICK BUTCHER: And not just
at the stock price.

00:33:14.196 --> 00:33:17.410
ROMAN NURIK: Nick, do you want
to talk about the OP redesign?

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.740
NICK BUTCHER: Yes, so Marie
strikes again, really, who

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.500
featured last week's redesign.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.470
And the ultimate stopwatch
app has spent one hour,

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.550
apparently, mocking up some
redesigns of the popular

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.030
European travel app.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.470
Offi, I believe it's
pronounced.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.770
So this is an app I've used
when I visited Berlin this

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.920
summer and found it
quite hard to use.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.730
It was very dense in information
and she's really

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.340
sprinkled it with some
designer's love all over it

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.900
and just really, really help
with the information density,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.330
and it's so much easier
to read and cleaner.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.644
I very much like what she's done
there, so follow the link

00:33:48.644 --> 00:33:49.850
if you want to read a
bit more about that.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.720
ROMAN NURIK: One thing I want
to call out is in the right

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.500
screen, you have shuttle stops
or bus stops that are

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.230
connected by a line
with circles.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.940
I think that's a great way to
tie together chronological

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.810
information.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:08.150
You can just have list items
that say number one or first,

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.560
and then next do this,
then do that.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.030
But tying them together using a
single form, using that line

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.830
and then the circles, as just
an example, I think that's a

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.460
great way to tie them together
and further inform the user

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.242
that these are actually
parts of a sequence.

00:34:24.242 --> 00:34:25.639
NICK BUTCHER: Good job.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.040
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.400
So that does it for us.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.090
I think we're about
five minutes late.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.840
That's not too bad.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.370
But anyway, thanks
for joining.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:35.020
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.320
ADAM KOCH: Adam Koch.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.370
NICK BUTCHER: And I'm
Nick Butcher.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.739
Don't forget to tune in to the
App Clinic this Friday when

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:44.360
you can see which apps are next
in line for perhaps being

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.850
redesigned.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.860
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and like we
said in the very beginning,

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.429
we're going to be focusing
a lot about on

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.449
tablets this week.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.254
So I believe they're looking at
tablet apps at that clinic

00:34:53.254 --> 00:34:56.376
or the tablet versions of
apps in that clinic.

00:34:56.376 --> 00:34:57.570
Again, thanks for joining.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:57.870
See you all later.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:58.770
ADAM KOCH: Bye.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.020
NICK BUTCHER: Bye.
