00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Curious how good your eyesight is?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.320
Take a look at this Image Who do you see?

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.960
If you're at a normal viewing distance from the screen and have decent eyesight you should be seeing Albert Einstein.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.620
However if you see Marilyn Monroe you may want to consider wearing glasses or contacts.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.020
Wearing your glasses right now? Try taking them off and the image may change or if you're near somebody else ask them what they see,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.300
the effect can actually be seen by anyone if we change the distance or size of the picture.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.720
If it's far away you're more likely to see Marilyn Monroe as our eyes only pick up the broader strokes of an image from a distance

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.080
but as you come closer to the image you see the finer details of Einstein

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.520
We promise we haven't changed anything digitally, in fact  pause this video now and try walking away from your computer screen

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.220
chances are the image will change and at a different distance than your friends because our eyes are all slightly different.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.940
The further away you can stand and still see Einstein the better your eyes likely are.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.220
You can achieve the same effect by squinting your eyes to blur the photo.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.440
So what's going on? Well this image is an example of a hybrid image

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.200
whereby a low spatial frequency of one picture is combined

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.860
with a high spatial frequency of another but

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.360
depending on how well you're able to focus or pick up

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.120
contrast your eye will only pick out certain details

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.140
Up close we're generally able to see fine details like Eintein's moustache

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.520
and wrinkles but as the distance increases

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.720
or if your vision is poor and thus creates a more blurred image in the first place

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.160
your ability to pick up details fades away instead you only see the general features like

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.060
the shape of a mouth, nose and hair

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.120
making it seem like Marilyn Monroe.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.500
