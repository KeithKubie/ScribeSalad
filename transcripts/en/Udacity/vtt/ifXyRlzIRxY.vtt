00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.260
Once again, here's the design
we're looking to create.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.527
What's great about this view is that
it uses mostly UI elements we've seen

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:09.060
before.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.570
In order to prevent the number
of complex layouts from growing

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.300
explosively, we're going to
take advantage of three Android

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.520
layout features.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.240
The first one we've seen before.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.470
The only difference between
a forecast list item on the phone and

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.390
on the tablet is padding and
margins around the list items.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.860
Fortunately, it's easy to add
this to the forecast list.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.960
We can use dimensions to give the same
layout more space in tablet layouts.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.720
In forecast list item layout, we can add
a padding dimension to the outer layout.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.710
We use padding here instead of margin
because we just want the content in set.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.580
If we used margin,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.110
the row selector wouldn't be drawn
across the entire list item.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.970
We also use a different dimension for
the space between the two temperatures.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.480
Note that we use both right and

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.260
end to make sure that this layout is
ready for right to left mirroring.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.110
So then in our resource's file we
create a dimension that updates

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.860
the extra padding and
the space between the two temperatures.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.670
And that layout is updated.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.430
I'm using sw600dp-port.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.100
Which means that these changes will
only be applied Portrait Orientation

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.130
with devices and a view sides
with at least a width of 600 dp.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.890
The second thing we take advantage of
is Layout Reuse using the include tag.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.430
We can see that our portrait and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.840
landscape detail fragment
use the same views.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.730
The fragment detail view contains
these included lay outs already.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.520
Note that we can assign new lay out
parameters when we include the lay out.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.310
We're not using this in sunshine.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.150
But we can avoid adding an extra
container when we include the layout by

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.900
using the merge tag in
the layout to be included.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.810
Finally, we're going to
continue to make use of Refs.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.930
Refs allow us to make aliases for
resources.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.150
As you can see,
in tablet landscape mode,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.250
the detail view should point to
a vertical version of the view.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.850
We're going to create a Ref that
points to fragment_detail_start and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.720
make sure that it points to the correct
detail fragment for all configurations.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.290
This will come in handy
in the next lecture.
