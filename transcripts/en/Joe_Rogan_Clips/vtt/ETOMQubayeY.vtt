1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.690
That's another thing that freaks me out as climbing.
Did you do much climbing?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.680
That was a lead climber up until the point where I don't have a use of my ankle

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.830
anymore because of the nerve injury.
Oh.
And it's funny is I'm actually,

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.490
I don't like heights.
You Free Solo at all.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.320
Uh,
as long as I wasn't more like thin three feet off the ground.
Yes,

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.960
I'm totally comfortable free soloing and moving laterally,

7
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.000
but not vertically away from the ground.
Cause I see,
oh my God,

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.490
I watched it three times in a row.
And here's the thing,
I know he's alive.

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.800
I know he was on your podcast.
I listened to it.

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.030
And in the final scenes I realized I was sitting there white knuckling my

11
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:40.380
recliner,
like my hands were sweating.
I'm like,
I know he lives,

12
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:44.490
but it still freaked me the fuck out.
Wow.

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.860
I mean that guy.
Yeah,
he's something.

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.270
But you know what's interesting about climbing as you get,
uh,

15
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.830
the more exposure you have,
the less it bothers you.
Like I,
uh,

16
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:54.270
so lead climbing is interesting,

17
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.390
especially if you are placing your protection as you go.

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.410
If it's drilled in bull saying league or lead Lea de like someone's in front of

19
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:07.230
you,
you're a rope.
As a lead climber you are probably setting the ropes,

20
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:08.130
at least in my old job,

21
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.590
you're setting the ropes for the people who are going to follow them.
Okay.

22
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.800
Most of the time when you see people,
well if not most of the time,

23
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:17.950
but one of the disciplines would be,
there's bolted routes that go up a rock.

24
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.050
So you can just bring,

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.350
you know karabiners and put the Caribbean or through that and you loop the rope

26
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:23.460
through it and you're good to go.

27
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.600
Another aspect would be is you don't use the bolted and stuff and you basically

28
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.240
carry on your climbing harness,
a rack of gear.

29
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.980
So as you're holding onto the rocks,

30
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.460
you're trying to wedge a block or a stopper in or a cam system that it rotates

31
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:41.070
to be smaller than as you release it opens up and if you pull against it,

32
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.540
it locks itself into the rock.

33
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.490
So you're setting your own protection and trust those things.

34
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:49.050
So that was the point that I was getting too.

35
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:50.850
Sometimes you get to the place and you're like,

36
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:52.350
this is the perfect piece of gear.

37
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.500
And of course you're only like six feet off the ground when the perfect piece of

38
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.710
gear.
And then you'll get multi pitches up in the air.
She'd be two,

39
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:01.740
300 feet up in the air.
And you're a lead climber,

40
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:05.730
so there's nobody above you and you're setting your own pro and you're starting

41
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:08.040
to get emotionally involved in the situation that you're in.

42
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.510
And you set a piece of pro and it's,
it's rattling around a little bit.

43
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.090
So I don't know.
We don't know how good that one's going to be,

44
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:17.280
but we're going to keep climbing.
And then the next piece of pro,

45
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:21.660
you said not the most awesome piece because you're worried about the one beneath

46
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:23.160
you and you don't want to fall.

47
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.930
So you get it in there and then you just keep climbing.

48
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.260
So sometimes it's awesome and sometimes it's terrifying.

49
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:31.320
And then you've got to think that if you do fall,
all that force,

50
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:35.910
if one pops and then the second one pops you,
you've got a lot of distance.

51
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.410
Well you gotta think it's double the distance.

52
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:40.620
If you're a 10 feet above the last piece of protection you put in,

53
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.360
you fall the 10 feet to the protection,
then the 10 feet past the protection,

54
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.120
clink,
clink,
clink,
and then it pulls on the PR on the pro.

55
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.590
So it's actually double the height that you are above it.
It's not,

56
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.570
I've been probably more scared out of my mind actually.

57
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:02.260
The scarcity scares I've ever is that you are lived in Boulder,
right?
Yeah.

58
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.050
There's a client,
they're called the best steel crack.
Uh,

59
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.150
it's in one of the national parks and I was there with a buddy and it was just

60
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.040
me and him and a world class climber.

61
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.800
And I was at the East Coast Command at the time.
So budget was no option.

62
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.750
I had the newest shiny stuff.

63
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:22.690
I'm like taking plastic off of climbing gear to go climb this rock.

64
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.370
This guy pulls up in a van with a Marlboro hanging out and you know,

65
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.820
tennis shoes that have laces probably on one of them,
one of the,

66
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.820
one of the shoes and a,
and an old pair of pants.

67
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.740
And he's climbed like every mountain ever.

68
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.400
So it's me and my buddy were climbing our way up.
I'm leading this pitch.

69
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.010
So you switched,
one guy will climb,
he sets an anchor,

70
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.010
the other person comes up and they pick all the protection out so you can just

71
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.950
switch and then the other person leads the way on the next one.

72
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.550
So I'm like halfway up this pitch and I can't move because I'm losing my shit.

73
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.290
I'm like 15 feet above the last piece of protection that I just put in.

74
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.790
I'm convinced that I feel my feet slipping off of the rock I'm holding.

75
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:07.210
I had my hand jammed into the rock and then you make a fist to like,
you know,

76
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.200
prevent it from falling out.

77
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.650
You can actually see Alex doing that in free solo as he's climbing up those

78
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.660
slide their hand in and then they'll manipulate the shape.

79
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:15.950
So it pulls and as I'm,

80
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.670
my world is collapsing on me and I'm just sitting there,

81
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.730
I've got full sewing machine leg just sitting there just shaking.

82
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.160
I hear a voice just over my shoulder.
He's like,
hey man,

83
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.630
just put the piece of pro right there and I look over and this professional

84
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:33.631
climber is right next to me with no rope in his fucking tennis shoes,

85
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.700
smoking a cigarette,

86
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.090
which is what he was using to point to where I should have placed the next piece

87
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.000
of protection.
Cool,
calm and collected.

88
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.130
And I almost fell off the rock because he scared me so bad.

89
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:49.180
I was so freaked out of what he was doing that I almost fell.
I'm like,

90
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:53.260
you need to get away from me immediately.
He's like,
yeah,
no problem.

91
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:56.560
Just scurried up the rock and tennis shoes,
tennis shoes,
tennis shoes.

92
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.380
But you're not supposed to use tennis shoes,
right?
I don't think it mattered.

93
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:03.820
I think the guy like he was a partial complete monkey.
He just,

94
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.530
when you're around worldclass climbers,

95
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.090
I mean they can hang on an edge that is like a couple pieces of paper and this

96
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:11.920
and the steel crack is not a difficult route.

97
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:16.660
So I'm sure there was one right next to it and he just,
as I'm freaking out,

98
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.770
he's just sitting there just hey buddy.
And I didn't know he was there.

99
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:25.570
I literally almost fell off because he talked to me smoking a cigarette.
Yeah,

100
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.250
he was asking,
he was like,
put a piece of pro right here.
Get away from me.

101
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.480
Different kinds of heat.

102
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.430
But I guess it's one of those things where it's like you're better at it.

103
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.340
You just,
yeah.
After a week of climbing,

104
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.090
you will not feel bad about walking up to the edge and just standing there.

105
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.230
Alex Honnold was telling us a story about one time it was free soloing and he

106
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:45.130
was halfway up and he,

107
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.510
well he was in the middle of this journey up this fucking mountain.

108
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:53.940
He realize he didn't bring any powder,
so didn't have any chalk with them.
Whew.

109
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.800
So his hands are sweating and he's just climbing within the no powder.

110
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:02.801
So he met a guy halfway up these guys that were using ropes and you know,

111
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.470
they were doing it the right way and he's doing it with no ropes.
And he goes,

112
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:09.350
Hey man,
can I borrow your chalk?
And the guy gives him a chalk bag and he goes,

113
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:12.680
I'll leave it for you.
At the top of the mountain.
So he takes the chalk bag,

114
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:14.500
passes these guys.
See Ya.
Yeah.

115
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:17.780
It just keeps going and then leaves the bag for the guy at the top of the hill.

116
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:21.080
I'm like,
what in the fuck man.
How could you start something like that.

117
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.740
Like an apparently said that once you start climbing,

118
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:29.210
you are committed to climbing.
It's harder to climb down than up.
Fuck Ugh,

119
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.513
look,

120
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.130
there's not enough money in the world that would make me attempt this stuff that

121
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:37.730
he does and if I was a climber had left,
I was like,
you know,

122
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.520
feeling like I'm kicking ass on man.
Fill my head,
sweaty,

123
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.820
fill my hand just talking about it.
I sweat like a pig.
I'm telling.

124
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:44.750
I was watching it,

125
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.320
white knuckling and if I was a climber and he passed me and was like,
Hey,

126
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:50.270
do you mind if I borrow your Chuck Chalk?

127
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.460
I would finish that climb and never climb again.
Yeah.

128
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.730
I would realize that I am a complete and utter bitch in comparison to what he is

129
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.540
like if that's what's possible.
And I'm sitting here like struggling,
I'm like,

130
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.770
I'm out.
You're also built wrong for it,
you know,
I think the thin wirey guys,

131
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.490
it's the way to go.
He also has like these three elements.
Yes.
Fingers man.

132
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.240
His fingers are just used to occur.
Yup.
Just grabbing.

133
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.200
But he also said that he had gone through a series of injuries for the first

134
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:21.220
time in his life,
like recently over the last few years.
Yeah.

135
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.260
That was in the movie actually a like a compression of his disks and then a

136
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:29.420
really bad strain on his ankle and he was telling to take six months off since

137
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:31.680
we just started climbing in a cast.
Sure.

138
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.460
So it's a different kind of human,
I mean he also lives out of a van.

139
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.790
I mean he's world famous guy who's living in a van traveling around just fucking

140
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:47.390
climbing rocks.
Did you have him on after he had completed that climb?

141
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.440
Like they were,
yeah.
Okay.

142
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:50.990
So he had been successful and they were just probably editing the project.

143
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.880
I had them on earlier,
like years ago.
Yeah.
And then I had them on again recently.

144
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.250
Okay.
Yeah.
It's uh,

145
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.920
the guy I would want to talk to is Jimmy Chin,
the,

146
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.990
the photographer who is capturing all that.
Oh,
he's up there with them.
Right.

147
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.420
That's the thing I would want to talk well,

148
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.270
and he talks about it a little bit more so in the promos for the film,
but the,

149
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:19.450
how sketched out he was to actually be involved and sit there and film and how

150
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:24.080
much of a burden he felt to like stay out of the periphery and not engage,

151
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.430
get engaged in the headspace and make Alex do something different because the

152
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:30.560
cameras were there.
That would of course cost him his life.

153
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.270
I can't imagine the pressure of doing that or just,

154
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.680
I wouldn't do it.
Like if a buddy of mine was like,
Hey,
will you come fill me?
Uh,

155
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:41.120
you know,
free.
I would say no,

156
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.910
because that would be so afraid of just watching them peel off.

157
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.830
Oh can you imagine if you were up there filming and you watch the guy and fall,

158
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.810
that'd be rough.
And there are,

159
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:57.360
of course good friends and this guy,

160
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.340
yeah dude as maa savage,
he's got his hands on a camera only.

161
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.030
Well he's,
he's got a bunch of stuff.
So you see his foot,
his left foot is in,

162
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.660
he's kind of sick.
Yeah,
he's kind of secured down there.
He's got that carabiner.

163
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.830
He's got one going to his harness is actually,
you've got two ropes,

164
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.230
go into his harness.
So he's kind of angled and there's like a triangle,

165
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.020
but he's a world class climber in and of himself.

166
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.090
We also has a giant ass camera bag.

167
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:25.920
Look at that big ass bag hanging from his hip.
Look at that position he's in to,

168
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.430
oh fuck all this Jimmy.
So that's how they get in.
That's I,

169
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.870
they get into position for a lot of it.

170
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.760
He's Giumarra instead of climbing the rock,

171
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:36.000
he's got basically a senders that will lie to push it up and then they lock on

172
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:39.630
the rope.
So he's got one leg in there and one arm and he's Kinda Giumarra.

173
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.100
We use those a lot of the times as well,

174
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:43.770
but he is a world class climber in and of himself.

175
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.760
I can kind of think you'd have to be right in order to be able to capture that.

176
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.410
Yeah.
Yeah.

177
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.480
The team that I think they put together was like five to seven worldclass guys.

178
00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:56.100
But there's a movie of him called Ma.
Yeah,
no thanks.
What does that,

179
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:56.970
what does that guy doing?

180
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.060
He's hanging probably 3000 foot over nothing focusing on capturing the shot.

181
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.700
I would be focusing on the urine streaming down.
My leg would be,
yeah.

182
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.030
Oh my God.
Soaking your socks.
Oh God.

183
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.620
Like I couldn't do that,

184
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.980
but I could go to the edge of that cliff and zip up my suit.

185
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.030
Absolutely no problem.

186
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:20.370
And send that off there and I bet you he would want a piece of that.

187
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.880
It's so bizarre.
Yeah.
If you shoot an Alex who's shooting him to,

188
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:25.763
good question,

189
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.400
is there a third prayers out around like this Mike Mikey shooting Jimmy in the

190
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.370
Free Solo movie?
I think they had a team of like five to seven people they had,

191
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.230
so they had long lens,
they had people up there,
they had remote cameras.

192
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:43.510
I mean it's a whole,
they obviously had drones flying around.
Yeah,

193
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.910
well there was a film that,
you know,
that besides this film,

194
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:49.500
the recent documentary,
which is a thing,

195
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:54.501
it's called Solo presale presale though before that there was also a late night

196
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.560
one of those new shows like ABC world news tonight or something like that.

197
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:02.490
They did a whole piece on him and they had this one guy who was a,
you know,

198
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.940
world class climber instead.

199
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.780
It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when he falls,

200
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.580
every innovator in the wingsuit world yeah.
Is Dead.
Yeah.

201
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.630
It's uh,
I mean,
but at the same,
I mean,

202
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:17.130
I say that I would totally agree with that,

203
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:19.320
but I also understand why he's doing it.
I mean,

204
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:24.321
the end state for all of us is predetermined and I would suspect having never

205
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:27.840
talked to the guy that he would rather meet his end like that than at 80 years

206
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:32.780
old as a geriatric.
Yeah.
I would imagine.
Yeah.
Says,

207
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.250
but that doesn't ease the burden on the people around him.
And that's the,

208
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.000
that's the piece that was the toughest for me,
uh,

209
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.760
when it came to the wingsuit base,
jumping him there.
It's insane.

210
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:44.790
There's wrong with that,
man.
But meanwhile,
he's such a nice guy.

211
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:48.120
When you talk to Alex in real life,
he's a sweetheart.

212
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.280
You root for him to quit.
Like,
look,
man,
you already did it.

213
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.270
Stop.
I have yet to hear him express desire to do so though.
He's not quitting.

214
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.730
You know?
I mean,
I don't know,
man.
Everybody is built different.
