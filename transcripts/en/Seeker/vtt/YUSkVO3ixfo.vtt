00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.460
One of my favorite experiences was climbing
to the second highest peak in the state of

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.480
New York and gazing out across the wide Adirondacks.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.370
It was literally awesome.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.590
But what is about awe?

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.140
And why do we get that feeling?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.160
Hey wonderers, Julia here for DNews

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.630
When was the last time you felt awe?

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080
Standing under a canopy of soaring sequoias?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.490
Staring across the vast and endless sea?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.060
Looking into the eyes of a newborn?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.050
Awe is something that makes us feel connected,
part of something larger than ourselves that

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.329
maybe we can’t quite understand.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.431
And for us that’s sometimes difficult.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.329
We like ourselves.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.010
that big important I.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.570
We like ME over WE.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.500
But we need to get over that real fast, because
awe, is well… awesome.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
but why?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.600
Why did we ever evolve this feeling?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.829
Maybe to help other people, so say some researchers.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.980
So when we experience awe, what happens?

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.500
Well for one, it might make us healthier.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.699
In one study published in the journal Emotion,
researchers found that awe reduces the levels

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.489
of pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.690
These proteins tell the immune system to work
harder.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.619
And prolonged inflammation can cause all sorts
of issues, like heart damage, diabetes, Alzheimer’s

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.770
and even depression.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.039
Which of course depression might lead people
to be less likely to explore and seek out

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.170
such awe inspiring situations, so the researchers
aren’t sure what came first, the low cytokines

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.770
or the positive emotions.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.521
My bet is on the positive emotions, because
other studies, like one published in the journal

00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:26.569
Psychological Science found that awe might
make us prefer experience over things and

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.439
even be happier with their lives.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.159
Awe can even change a person’s perception
of time.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.031
After being awe-struck, some people feel like
they have more time according to the study

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:36.810
published in the journal Psychological Science.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.340
In this study, students watch a commercial
designed to invoke awe, stuff like whales

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.399
and waterfalls.

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.459
Afterwards, the students filled out a questionnaire
in which they responded positively to questions

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.649
like “I have lots of time in which I can
get things done".

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.049
And they were more likely to use their time
to help other people.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.369
Seriously awe can make us be more generous
to other people.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.729
Another study published in the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology says the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.219
experience of awe makes us more willing to
help someone else.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.549
In several studies people who thought about
the last time the felt awe or watched awe-inspiring

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.200
nature videos showed more ethical behavior
than people who thought about other positive

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.560
feelings like pride.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.970
In one particular clever set up, researchers
had participants either stand gazing up at

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.719
tall Eucalyptus trees for a full minute or
stand in the same spot but look at a building

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.719
instead.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.329
After the minute was up, the researchers “accidently”
dropped a box of pens.

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.319
Those who looked at the trees were more likely
to help the researcher than those in the control

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.319
setting.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.020
So why does awe make us more helpful?

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.530
Well because big things make us feel small.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.650
And that’s a good thing.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.849
The researchers think that by feeling smaller,
our focus shifts from ourselves and towards

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.170
the greater good.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.680
So wanna feel happier and more helpful?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.090
Head to the woods!

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.269
Or if you’d prefer to stay inside, and still
want to experience Awe, Jason Silva explores

00:02:51.269 --> 00:03:04.030
the idea in one of his first videos on his
show Shots Of Awe

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.019
