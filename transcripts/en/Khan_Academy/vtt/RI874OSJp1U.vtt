00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670
 

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.110
So far, we've been dealing
with one way of thinking

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.170
about probability, and
that was the probability

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.310
of A occurring is the
number of events that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:20.470
satisfy A over all of the
equally likely events.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.350
 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.800
And this is all of the
equally likely events.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.360
And so in the case
of a fair coin,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.200
the probability of heads--
well, it's a fair coin.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920
So there's two
equally likely events,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.630
and we're saying one of
them satisfies being heads.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.230
So there's a 1/2 chance
of you having a heads.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.100
The same thing for tails.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.980
If you took a die, and
you said the probability

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.060
of getting an even number
when you roll the die.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.680
Well, there's six
equally likely events,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.660
and there's three even
numbers you could get.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.020
You could get 2, a 4, or a 6.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.010
So there's three even numbers.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.219
So once again, you have a
1/2 chance of that happening.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:09.760
And this is a really
good model where

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.650
you have equally likely
events happening.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.204
Now I'm going to change
things up a little bit.

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:17.620
So I'm going to draw a line
here because this was just one

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.036
way of thinking
about probability.

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:21.040
Now we're going to
introduce another one that's

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.910
more helpful when we can't think
about equally likely events.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.770
And in particular, I'm going
to set up an unfair coin.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.670
So this right over here is
going to be my unfair coin.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.270
So that is my coin.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.460
Well, I could draw the coin.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.830
So it's a gold coin this time.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.570
It is unfair.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.031
One side of that coin is a
little heavier than the other,

00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:44.530
even though it's
meant to look fair.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.190
So it still has that picture
of some president or something

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.710
on one side of it.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.460
So this is the head side.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.160
This is heads, and then,
obviously, on the back,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.870
you have tails.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.470
But as I mentioned,
this is an unfair coin.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.450
And I'm going to make
it interesting statement

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.700
about this unfair coin and
one that really doesn't fit

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.544
into the mold that
I set up over here,

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:07.460
and this interesting
statement is that we have

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.620
more than a 50/50
chance of getting heads

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.520
or more than a 50% chance
or more than a 1/2 chance

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.580
of getting heads.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.350
I'm going to say that the
probability of getting heads

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.380
for this coin right
over here is 60%.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.110
Or another way to
say it, it's 0.6.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.950
Or another way to say
it, it is 6 out of 10.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.000
Or another way to
say it, it is 3/5.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.750
And this might make
intuitive sense to you

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.800
and hopefully it
does a little bit,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.770
but I want you to
realize that this

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.420
is fundamentally different
than what we were saying before

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.340
because now we can't say that
there are two equally likely

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.850
events.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.174
There are two possible events.

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:43.590
You can either get
heads or tails.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.860
We're assuming that the
coin won't fall on its edge.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.020
That's impossible.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.120
So you're either going
to get heads or tails,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.070
but they're not
equally likely anymore.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.300
So we really can't do
this kind of counting

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.180
the number of events
that satisfy something

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.210
over all of the possible events.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.980
In this situation, in order
to visualize the probability,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.070
we have to kind of take what's
called a "frequentist approach"

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.280
or think about it in terms
of frequency probability.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.500
And the way to conceptualize
a 60% of getting heads

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.510
is to think, if we had a
super large number of trials,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.110
if we were to just flip
this coin a gazillion times,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.770
we would expect that 60% of
those would come up heads.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.570
It's unclear how I
determined that this is 60%.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.350
Maybe I ran a
computer simulation.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.850
Maybe I know exactly all
of the physics of this,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.870
and I could completely model how
it's going to fall every time.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.350
Or maybe I've actually
just run a ton of trials.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.760
I've flipped the coin a
million times, and I said,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.220
wow, 60% of those, 600,000
of those, came up heads.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.780
And then, we could make a
similar statement about tails.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.320
So if the probability
of heads is

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.030
60%, the probability
of tails-- well,

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.870
there's only two
possibilities, heads or tails.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.270
So if I say the probability
of heads or tails,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.819
it's going to be equal
to 1 because you're

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.360
going to get one of
those two things.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.770
You have 100% chance of
getting a heads or a tails,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.780
and these are mutually
exclusive events.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.500
You can't have both of them.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.990
The probability
of tails is going

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.529
to be 100% minus the
probability of getting heads,

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.030
and this, of course, is 60%.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.050
So it's 100% minus 60%, or
40%, or as a decimal, 0.4,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.220
or as a fraction, 4/10, or as
a simplified fraction, 2/5.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.560
So, once again,
this probability is

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.270
saying-- we can't say
equally likely events.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.645
We could say that,
if we're going

00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:43.970
to do a gazillion of
these, we would expect,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.790
as we get more and more and more
trials, more and more flips,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.715
40% of those would be heads.

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:50.590
Now, with that out of
the way, let's actually

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.610
do some problems with this.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.140
So let's think about the
probability of getting heads

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.720
on our first flip and
heads on our second flip.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.020
So, once again, these
are independent events.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.659
The coin has no memory.

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.450
Regardless of what I
got on the first flip,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.090
I have an equal chance
of getting heads

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.930
on the second flip.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.530
It doesn't matter if I got
heads or tails on the first.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.170
So this is the probability of
heads on the first flip times

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.980
the probability of heads
on the second flip,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.860
and we already know.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.605
The probability of heads on
any flip is going to be 60%.

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:23.730
I'll write it as a decimal.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.360
It makes the math a little
bit easier, 0.6, 0.6,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.796
and we can just multiply.

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:31.920
I'll do it right over here.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.200
So this is 0.6 times 0.6.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.060
Now, it's always good
to do a reality check.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.530
One way to think about it
is I'm taking 6/10 of 6/10,

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.170
so it should be a little
bit more than half of 6/10

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.067
or probably a little
bit more than 3/10.

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:51.650
And we've explain
this in detail where

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.060
we talk about
multiplying decimals,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.934
but we essentially just
multiply the numbers,

00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:56.740
not thinking about
the decimals at first.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.696
6 times 6 is 36.

00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:00.320
And then you count
the number of digits

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.820
we have to the right
of the decimal.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.110
We have one, two to the
right of the decimal.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.735
So we're going to
have two to the right

00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:07.280
of the decimal in our answer.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.010
So it is 0.36, and
that makes sense.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.100
We're taking 60% of 0.6.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.380
We're taking 0.6 of 0.6, a
little bit more than half

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.390
of 0.6.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.630
And, once again, it's a
little bit more than 0.3.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.350
So this also makes sense.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.702
So it's 0.36.

00:06:21.702 --> 00:06:23.160
Or another way to
think about it is

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.570
there's a 36%
probability that we

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.070
get two heads in a row,
given this unfair coin.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.380
Remember, if it was a fair
coin, it would be 1/2 times

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.350
1/2, which is 1/4, which
is 25%, and it makes sense

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.027
that this is more than that.

00:06:38.027 --> 00:06:40.110
Now, let's think about a
slightly more complicated

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.610
example.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.654
 

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.100
Let's say the probability
of getting a tails

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.160
on the first flip, getting
a heads on the second flip,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.163
and then getting a
tails-- I'm going

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:56.620
to do this in a new
color-- and then getting

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.400
a tails on the third flip.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.220
So this is going to be equal
to the probability of getting

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.870
a tails on the first flip
because these are all

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.287
independent events.

00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:09.370
If you know that you had
a tail on the first flip,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.828
that doesn't affect
the probability

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:12.760
of getting a heads
on the second flip.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.540
So times the probability
of getting a heads

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.640
on the second flip,
and then that's

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.560
times the probability of getting
a tails on the third flip.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.510
 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.970
And the probability of getting
a tails on any flip we know

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.750
is 0.4.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:35.150
The probability of getting
a heads on any flip is 0.6,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.870
and then the probability of
getting tails on any flip

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.060
is 0.4.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.210
And so, once again, we
can just multiply these.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:52.777
So 0.4 times 0.6.

00:07:52.777 --> 00:07:55.110
There's actually a couple of
ways we can think about it.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.910
Well, we could literally say,
look, we're multiplying 4 times

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.550
6 times 4, and then
we have three numbers

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.790
behind the decimal point.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.800
So let's do it that way.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.980
4 times 6 is 24.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.400
24 times 4 is 96.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.130
So we write a 96,
but remember, we

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.100
have three numbers
behind the decimal point.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.897
So it's one to the right
of the decimal there,

00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:24.480
one to the right of
the decimal there,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.770
one to the right
of decimal there.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.790
So three to the right.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.740
So we need three to the right
of the decimal in our answer.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.070
So one, two-- we need one more
to the right of the decimal.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.730
So our answer is 0.096.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.400
Or another way to think about it
is-- write an equal sign here--

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.630
this is equal to a 9.6% chance.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.680
So there's a little bit
less than 10% chance,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.130
or a little bit less
than 1 in 10 chance,

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.330
of, when we flip this
coin three times,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.680
us getting exactly a
tails on the first flip,

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.150
a heads on the second flip,
and a tails on the third flip.
