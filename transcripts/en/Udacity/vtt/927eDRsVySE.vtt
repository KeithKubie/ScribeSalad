00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.029
So what we build are robotic gripping systems.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.660
So that means both the hand itself which has

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.914
soft actuators and the assembly that holds them and all of the systems that go around it.

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:18.445
Now, how do you supply air to that system?

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:20.265
How do you control that air?

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.630
You know software AI, you name it.

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:25.419
And what that gets rolled into is

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.825
an incredibly capable system that offers desk wrist

00:00:28.824 --> 00:00:32.589
gripping of objects of variable size, weight,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.870
shape that you can then deploy on

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:37.899
a conventional robotic arm in an industrial environment,

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.429
where our typical customer is someone who has a bit more of

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.810
a chaotic manufacturing packaging environment

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.579
than the sort of rigorously controlled environments you'd find in auto manufacturing.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.409
So robots work incredibly well in, let's say,

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.174
in an automotive plant where a car rolls by and

00:01:00.174 --> 00:01:04.075
a welding robot puts down a weld and it's going to do the same job all day,

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:09.075
everyday, all year in the exact same way because you heavily structured the environment.

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:15.204
But the the broader world of human endeavor is incredibly chaotic.

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:18.969
And as a result, you haven't seen robots truly

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.230
penetrate the vast majority of kind of manufacturing,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.820
and packaging, and order fulfillment,

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.459
all these different jobs because of that chaos.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.564
And so what we're trying to do is build these remarkably capable robotic hands,

00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:36.519
leveraging the fundamental soft actuator technology,

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:39.489
such that you can actually start doing

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:42.599
this kind of work with conventional robotic systems.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.244
A conventional gripper that gets highly adaptive grasping,

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:49.915
the way in which you accomplish that is, you know,

00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:55.090
so kind of imagine a Terminator style hand where you have all of these hard linkages

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.895
and motors and cables and you can get

00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:00.864
an incredible amount of dexterity out of that construct.

00:02:00.864 --> 00:02:04.299
But it comes at the cost of a high degree of complexity.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.519
Normally, in order to be able to get it to

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:09.025
get a good grip on an object without damaging it,

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:13.474
you need to skin it with sensors and have all of that feedback.

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:15.939
You might use artificial intelligence systems to

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.699
identify grasp points on an object so that you can

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.429
appropriately apply normal force to it and pick it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.685
up in a way that you can then translate it.

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:28.210
We don't need to do any of that in soft robotic systems.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.129
So our systems are inflatable air bladders of, you know,

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.314
very very specifically designed to the task,

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:37.944
but fundamentally inflatable air bladders that

00:02:37.944 --> 00:02:41.185
move inward until they strike the surface of an object.

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:45.685
And because of all of the passive dynamics in our actuator structures,

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:51.759
they know fundamentally when to stop gripping and apply good force to an object to move.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.849
And that can all be done in a very open loop manner.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.989
We don't necessarily need for speed back sensor on the tip of a finger in order to

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.700
know it made contact or to know that it's applying too much or too little pressure.

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.599
All of that intelligence that would normally be done by software and sensors in

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.079
the conventional robotic system are now being done innately in the materials themselves.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.170
So that's a fundamental difference.

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:21.149
What that then means for the user is that it's very easy to deploy our technology.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.689
So if all I need to do is strap a robot hand on

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.210
a robot and command a particular pressure to

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.075
go in and grip and it grabs the object the first time,

00:03:31.074 --> 00:03:34.189
you can program up a new application in an afternoon.

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.229
And many of our customers can with our technology you know,

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.250
they have a problem they haven't been able to solve for

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.240
a very very long time using conventional mechanical systems.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.100
I can think of one that was struggling with

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.544
the problem for two and a half years because of the hand.

00:03:47.544 --> 00:03:51.189
And we showed up in an afternoon and did their project.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.150
And that had to do fundamentally with how

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.762
our actuators interact with objects innately through the mechanics of the design.

00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:05.645
Now, you can add sensors to soft robots and very very cool things happen.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:09.865
But what I would say is now you focus your development effort

00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:14.430
not on trying to nail down the grasping portion of your application,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.560
you can apply the sensors in the AI portion of your project

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.079
towards all the other things that you need to control.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.289
And so it frees you up to focus on

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.000
the big picture as opposed to just trying to get your hands around the target.
