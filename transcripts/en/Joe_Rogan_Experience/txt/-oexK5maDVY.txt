Speaker 2:          00:00:17       Tour buses. He came so close to the weight loss. Do they come close? And then I'm really only have one year where it was like socialist. It was like a Marxist. No one could lose. Yeah. Even if you lost it didn't matter. I like that. That was coming. Yeah. There was a good this year. This year. It's gotta be a good way. Listen, last year almost killed myself. Yeah, we've got to do it differently than that. Your Ping fucking purple wasn't purple, but it wasn't the right color. What color was this word? I had brown though. I was worried, but it wasn't, it was just dehydration. Severe Dehydration. There was days where I would drink literally fucking gallons of water. Yeah. You don't want ice. I try it without personally. You're crazy. Um, I was drinking so much, I was drinking water and I was adding salt to it. I was that in Himalayan salt to the water was cause I know I was dehydrated myself so much. I would have puddles on the ground. You still, that still wasn't sufficient? Like did I set up a set off an alarm? I remember that set off a fire alarm in the gym from my sweat.

Speaker 1:          00:01:17       Uh Huh. Yeah. I even never heard of that. Of course I still have PTSD from last year. So Brock Tobar Dude, like I get texts from you guys and panic sits in my heart and I go, wait, what does he like gets it? She thinks I'm crazy for sure. I moved and it just sets wives. You're the only one who that dad. You got Lou in the home life? Yeah. If I come to New York or would have been, I mean la would have been terrible to be for an extra month, but like, uh, I saw that fucking stupid device when I was moving. I opened up the drawer and I was like, I didn't want, I was like, get it out. Get out here. I want to Chucky. Chucky the little dog. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       Yeah, man. I think Leanne and push, you're going to podcast this entire sober October. She threw you under the bus in the fucking radio station. Tell us you guys didn't hear that story. You guys should have white swaps. Tell that story. They were asking about drugs and how hard I party and I was just talking shit. And I was like, you know, I go, uh, I go, I spoke a little bit of weed. I'll every now and then if cocaine's on a switch blade, I'll hit it. But for most part, I only, I only, I only do mushrooms once a year. And Leanne just heard me and she was making breakfast for the girls. She goes, he doesn't do mushrooms and he doesn't do cocaine. He's got high blood pressure. I'm like, bitch, I'm trying to move tickets and Dayton, you under the bus tour. Fall dates available now, but right now, dude. Yeah, we do right now. Right now. Right now. Right now. [inaudible] dot com is weird. You sound like you're coming off a coke bender,

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       Torin, hard food. But saying, think about Tom, like when you first started going on the road with me, you're way far further ahead now than it was as a future. Oh, right when he was opening for me, we were doing, yeah, we were doing clubs. We're doing all clubs. Did you make, we started do theaters when you started to headline your own places. That's true. Yeah. That was pretty crazy. Tid was quick. I was thinking about it, about that level you were at that we all thought was like damn. Well, yeah, I mean it's like you, you know someone you're like, it's accessible. Yeah. Right. So you're right. It seems normal. You make sense. Like, Oh, I could sell out this whole weekend too. Yeah. And then when you do, you're like, oh shit. Like what a fucking comedian. I'm a real comedian. I sell that a club and just, just because we've got in shape, I didn't even think about just because it's so rocky.

Speaker 2:          00:03:30       That's just because I didn't think about theaters back then. Like when we were all in the club. I never thought we were just doing clubs. Like I had done a couple of theaters here and there, but for the most part it was just about just working. Yeah, that's what I said. We was like, what do you want to do with the curves? I can, I'd like to have clubs. He was of the theater. I was like, I couldn't do theater cause why? Cause you said you could do whatever you want. And I was like, all right, dice caught me to go on the road. He really planted a fucking seat in my head one day in the back parking lot at the comedy store. So why don't you do the road? I said, I dunno. He goes, hey, don't fucking just hang around here. And he's like, you can make a good living.

Speaker 2:          00:04:07       He goes, you don't need these fucking TV guys. And I was like, wow, he's right. Oh I was thinking about it and I was like, he's right. Does change my life. I've said this a million times, but you and bill burr in the back of the store telling me it shows not that good. You should just stick with, stand up to Congress and knew that you are way better than that. I'm like, you're not even doing your standup justice. Like I'd see you do stand up, but it's like he hadn't done it in five months. He'd been fucking Thailand or some shit swinging off of a tree by a roller coaster with special people. I was worried you were going to get killed. Like you were doing so many different things. There's so many different places. I called him up once. He was drunk on a motorcycle in Vietnam.

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       It's like what he did, he learned these uncomplete Lee unnecessary life skills can apply to any man. You remember everybody a unicycle and be like, what is like I learned in Rome, I could do whatever I want to know. Okay. He's a harder than when them hoverboards what's harder? Oh, the dude, those hover for in the, in the, uh, in the ocean. Oh No, I don't mean that. I mean the things that the kids wrote were out on just the wheel in the middle. And those are, we all in the middle. Rich rebuilds, you know that youtube channel. Do you know which putting why he's a, he's a youtube host and he also, he fixed his, he's like the first guy to ever build a Tesla. He bought a junk Tesla that somebody had let get flooded with water and he's just a really smart guy and he's a tech guy. So he's like, okay, what the fuck is in that thing? Like how do I fix this? Like, so all the wires were fucked up. The battery was toast. So the bought it crashed one and he took the battery in the engine out of the crashed one and put it in the one that he owned and then rewind and went through this crazy process to get a Tesla to work that he eventually did. And now he has his own, it's what's

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       called the electric garage in Massachusetts where he rebuilds these Teslas. But uh, what was my point? Oh, he had one of those with a big ass fat tire. When you ride on it like a skateboard. That's hard. That looks hard. That's hard to do. [inaudible] was killed someone on a, on a segway. One time I was in Rome and we were on segways and I was just screwing around and then I just hopped off and then realized that when you hop off, if you're lean afford, it's the heaps going and this thing started whipping around me just and we're in like a big Piatsa and I let just let go of, it didn't hit anyone, but everyone around us was standing dead still. Like oh my God, I would have been bodied right there. You're supposed to dive on it like a, like a good hero.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Yeah. Do you know what our funding the made? There's no way you're doing that. I'm on it. No Way. You'd have to take it. 1315 people die. Just walk out casually. So I don't know what happened. I don't know those Hubbard, those hover boards that are, cause I should jet skis where you go like 40 feet up in the air. Oh those are crazy. Those are fun as fat. Cool. Look cool. I like the guys who'd like cut it turned over. I'd like to know present and then it starts to go down and they just start with extra speed. Just shooting where the Macola, what are they doing? Those things are fun as fuck. Legit. Yeah. I could do a back flip on one. All you gotta do is like fall backwards and then kick your feet around. I picked up on that one quick.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       Hmm. Yeah. There's a lot of useless skills I have from travel channel. Did you traveled so much? Oh my God always bothered me. You know why I bothered me? Because I would've probably done it too if I was you. And I was like, God damn it. How do you get out of that? Cause I know that feeling like it's, you have the best job ever. You were on a TV show. You're like, oh my God, I have the best job ever. I'm gonna fuck I'm on a fucking TV show. But yet you're still like, fuck, I've got to get out of this. Yeah. It's weird cause you do get to go to really cool places and get paid for it. Yeah, that was cool. But you also mean you weren't thrilled or can you miss stand up more? I missed it. I missed Hannah. What was happening is Tom's career was exploding at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       The day I fell off a waterfall. Do you remember that was in aspen and push called me. She's like, I'm talking to Tom and he's talking about these one nighters, but I want to do the funny bones. I was so far removed from stand up. I didn't even, I didn't even know you could do one nighters. I didn't know that theaters were an option and I think I was at a store a week later and you were like, you know Tom's doing like legit theaters. And I remember just going, I missed, what if I just missed it entirely? He could have in some people do. We all know guys that were really funny back in the day and then they somehow or another quit. It fell apart. Dude. What if you had been like, I'm going to lean into travel channel? Dude it was, I was like, you became a Christian, like Super Christian. Got a cross tattoo on your arm just to let them know I'm really down with them. I'm sure your reps told you all those third church. Go to church with a fucking golf shirt on. When I got fired from travel channel, I, my world melted down. That was right when we were getting fat shamed. I was fed getting fashion named Leanne scheduled. Uh, uh

Speaker 3:          00:08:58       hello. Can you say we were getting cut [inaudible] on a second. You're saying you saying you were getting fat shamed, but you got to let people know like you don't really believe in fat shaming. You weren't really getting fat [inaudible] at the time. It was very one sided deal at the time. I got fired from travel channel. I was die definitely. It was one sided and I felt it hard as fuck. Your friend was fucking with you because he was worried you were going to die to do it though. You did on a major platform. There wasn't like a morning radio. He was on another level, put it on his fucking special on Netflix. Dude, imagine taking a coated appearance which was massive at the time and you go up now I'm going to use this for fun. I'm not going to try to promote myself. Dj Dad mouth is my favorite character that anybody's ever to more than maybe show.

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       When do you do that? I love that you were doing that because I hated those shows. I was like, why would he do those shows? TV is terrible. You do morning TV dressed up like a fake wrapper. She's no cigarette created a character called Dj dad mouth and he would just show up places and the people did not know what the fuck to do with them because the lowest rung in all of show business is morning television. I'm so sorry if you listen to this and you're a local morning television, no slick ice delivered newspapers. Okay. We all way better than morning host. It's, it's one of the lowest rungs in all of Showbiz. It's so weird. Wrong where you're trapped. It's like you're broadcasting out of like a Christian convenience store or something. It's very strange because the worst part two is that the four of us plus like 90% of the ax working those clubs do not have a fan base watching that show. What? I mean you, you put it together, you're like, this is definitely a waste of time. Like we're wasting our time. Right? Yeah. That's the only one that morning. I'll be up at fucking six to do this. To do. Good morning. Hartford ain't good.

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       Only works when you, when you get in trouble. Yeah. Like I, I remember one time I got shirtless and went up and the in the weather and started saying, there's thunderstorms. Tom Did DJ. Have you ever seen Mark Norman's? Mark Norman's is great when he just goes up and she goes, how are you doing? He goes, kind of gay. Let's get this started. Hung over horny. Look at you

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       don't, but totally ruined it. The relationship for the club. Oh, 100% now I went in there, Tracy Morgan, Tracy Morgan's was my first one was fucking legend. That's the one where he talks to some go get pregnant, pause. That's my mating call. Dying. They are dying when he does that big one in Chicago. He was in Chicago for sure cause I know you kept hollering at bulls to have to get him in the middle of it and squirt it. Come up. Just trashed him. He just crashes. $2 million Bugatti today. Today. Yup. A Honda sideswiped him. Whoa. Hell's kitchen. I get here, I already got hit by mortar truck driving savage ran into a $2 million Italian sports car.

Speaker 4:          00:12:02       I saw, I did a show with him like a year and a half ago. One of the odd ball shows and he came in a all white Rolls Royce with a professional like with a driver, you know like a chauffeur and he came in all white and had like a fucking enormous gold chain with a medallion TM. And I was like, I chant looks crazy. He's like like 600,000 something. Some crazy shit. Look at this. Look at this guy sideswiped Tracy Morgan's convertible. $2 million Bugatti. What he's letting people know. Well

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       what's he the highest? The Gut in the Honda's defense. It's a very low car. He has a high car. He probably looked over, saw nothing. Fuck no, it was the car that was like two feet off the ground. It's such a small car. These cars are so hard to see if you're right next to him. What does that do is insurance say when he calls, I don't know if we can cover this like fuck they probably, that'll probably be like the final Straw. Probably kick them off the contract for sure. What's that Tracy Morgan interview that was kind of uh, had to be an inspiration and doing the Dj dad mouth right. To me that was the first one I remember like, whoa. I guess. I mean someone could fuck

Speaker 4:          00:13:12       you can fuck with them in that way. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean it was funny because some people would be really into having fun with you. Like the Tracy Morgan people. They laugh and they have a good time and then some people the neat like I could see how the club relationship could be, cause we left one of the clubs when I told him I was coming out as nonbinary and the lady was like, what? This is like on the air and I was like different genders. And she was like, all right and she's turning the TV and she was like, Ugh, she's was, and then she called in like we called the PR person that drove us to the club or to the vents and realize she's in the congress. She goes, what the fuck was that? She was like, that was, that guy is so weird. Don't bring stuff like that in here.

Speaker 3:          00:13:54       I like, that's the whole point. We don't want to come in here. They, they think that what they're doing is serious. We're providing a wonderful morning show for downtown Pittsburgh. You're showing them how to make fucking, I tried to try me sandwiches so it's so dumb. What a great sandwich. Hey, thanks a lot. We've got [inaudible] going to sing for us next. I tried shitting on the last time I went to Cleveland. It was the normal, that's why another relationships still fine. Um, but I was like, there was a doctor, but for me, I was like, why does he wear his fucking doctor outfit and do this on the way out? He put a sweater on and left. Why can't that be him? And it goes like, I don't know. It's feels like you're stepping into like Truman show stuff. So contrived. There's nothing real about, she went there, there's like a 22 year old PA or associate producer. One time I went in and I said, yeah, I'm already drunk from doing radio. I can just put the mic on my necklace. And she goes, why? I go, I'm going to take my shirt off. She goes, you will not be doing that. And I said, no, you don't tell me what to do. She was like, excuse me, I'll be right back. And it came back and she goes, what does in your

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       cup? And I said, whiskey. And she was like, oh, he's drinking, he's drinking ace and told on you, oh my God. And I was just like, I was like, we should probably leave. So he just left his left. I was like, I don't want to get anyone fired. She's telling you you can't take your shirt off. So their drink. Yeah. Or have a drink. I love how it's like she's telling me like she found something out. You're like, all right, I was poor you in front of everybody. I don't want to drag out of the bottle. She'll, she's at an insurance company. Yeah. It's hilarious. And people don't know what job they're in. Tried to take it more seriously. One of those morning shows fucked off like the way we're talking about. It'd be like the best morning show. So much green had a great, great, what I remembering now, back when he was like public access, I was trying to promote the public access to Tom Green show and he just took over.

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       He did some crazy highs in the face. Yeah, exactly. Amazing. He's like him. And then that other dude, Jamie Kennedy, they did their best shit where they were like pranking people jackass and then they just stopped. Yeah, man. But Tom's blew up so crazy. So crazy. Tom Green was on. I couldn't, it was stuff I couldn't even believe green did. Oprah. Wow. Yes. Oprah was like, we're going like this. It was such a phenomenal, what was going on. Show was so big. He milked that tight with his mouth. Yeah. He puts slept mobile on his dad's calling parents and then hitting the bushes. He didn't just like, let me fuck this man of people like my mommy and Daddy. He put forget did people forget Tom Greene? What happened too, but for now he, he's fall cancer. Had to take a break, came back and tried to do like a more serious show with a Humperdink.

Speaker 2:          00:16:23       What's this guy's name? But people forgot how big it used to be. Oh, they may have forgotten how big it was. What he ended up writing one of the man, what he did was he did what we're all doing way before any of us, but it was when bandwidth was too expensive. He did. He had his own podcast. Did it? You did. I did it at his house. It was part of the inspiration for me doing one. Yeah, and I even talked to his, yes, I even talked to his company. They were based in Denver. I was in Denver doing the comedy works. I talked to the company that was doing it for him and I was seriously considering doing something like that, but the problem was that it like the bandwidth is crazy expensive. He had cables running from the desk all the way through his living room into a server room.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       He had a server room in his house and it was crazy. I don't know how much money is involved in this. He's like a fuck load of money and he goes like, I have to have all these people running it too. That was Tom Greens. That's me and Tom Green and he so he, what essentially was was he decided to try to do a talk show host. I remember that Joe Rogan, the fucking logs sleep under the short sleeve. I left Joe Rogan and am I look for awhile with the torn jeans you like, I'm not coming here to Hollywood and given up.

Speaker 2:          00:17:30       That was all based on one switch he had in his house. I know he just go on and flip a switch and the show went on and one life. So me and red band looked at it and we're like well how much is involved in this? Like what would we have to do to do something like this? And then you know, eventually it just led to that and Kumiai Anthony Kumina was, and that was big thing. Yeah. He had that live from the compound in his basement. And then the way that opie and Anthony ran their show was an inspiration too because it was just a hangout and it was my favorite show to listen to. Yeah. Cause it's just a bunch of guys hanging out talking. I was like, that's like that's what I want to do. Four hours of them eating oatmeal. I remember they just eat oatmeal and you'd be like, Oh yeah, I was a big fan back then on the show that would eat oatmeal.

Speaker 2:          00:18:11       Oh you tune in early on an already there and they'd just be eating breakfast and just go on. Jim would take a shit and be gone for 30 minutes because they didn't have any, when they first talked to him, fat chat nor day back in the day, they didn't have any advertisers, so they had to fill four hours of content. So they literally, I mean everything went. Yeah. When they first started on Sirius Xm, they had to fill four hours of content. We had no commercials, no commercials. That was the pitch crazy. That's serious. Said, hey, we don't have commercials. You're paid for. He paid for it and then they just started solid commercials. Like, wait a minute, I fucking paying for this. And you've got commercials to ask, is Howard got to get to that paper kid? It's where people are at the helm of no fucker.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       Integrity goes down. He gets kicked up sell no matter how. I mean he's, he's locked up in a contract for, for Liz. I've son thought he was done. So I got to come up. He wants more money on shore. That's what Howard would do, you know. But he makes up ass load of money. You know, there's no one even close second second places. He's just huge. Like he's a huge shareholder during that lawsuit too. If we can get over, let's say the number was 100 million subscribers, I get this gigantic bonus whether they bought serious, serious and like that took us from 60 plus another 40 is a hundred so I get it [inaudible] we acquired that pay me mother fuckers. I don't know what happened with it but well [inaudible] right there. He's respect you guys are done with the beef and be with them. I just think it's should retire.

Speaker 2:          00:19:45       But the point, the point is what is, he did a good thing for this, but he basically, what he was saying was that the only reason that deal took place at all was because he was a, was it Sirius or Xm? He was serious. Serious. Right, right, right. So the only reason why serious was kicking ass at all was because of Howard fucking stern period and there was nothing on Sirius [inaudible] him. He started wired, it wouldn't have acquired x. Also the model was like, so you know, suspect at the time you're there, you're gonna get a terrestrial radio and go to a place where people have to pay for what they just turn on deserves it. Here's why no one else could have carried that. No one else he was radio and especially at that time, during that transition to satellite, no one else would have got people to commit to having a fucking satellite dish in your car.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       Maybe you had those stupid fucking antennas that you said to put on your car to get to get serious. The wire went all the way through. Your car is gross to sue and they would stick up like a pig tail out of the roof of your car that she goes. Yeah. Yeah. And how I would cut out for like every turn, any corner, anytime there was a building in New York City, any fucking tunnel tunnels dead. The city that existed it. Yeah, whatever money that country, that company makes. The only reason it's still or Howard stern for sure. Only reason. Yeah, for sure. This say no, I had XM and it was until Bennington and opie and Anthony showed up. It was painful or listen to yacht rock. Yeah. Oh yeah. It was cool though. You like nineties rock, three different channels of a hundred different channels.

Speaker 2:          00:21:19       It was, yeah. It was worth a dollar a year. Great. Best through. He's been doing on stage lately. I hated my storytelling show too. Recently. Did the same thing, just talking about the good old days, a fucking drug addiction of yours to get down. He describes this city that you're like, oh my God, I want to be there. Go what year? What first time in the city? I went, I left. I went there six years. Oh, first time I've ever been in there. Yeah. Oh, like do you see times square when it was time square? But I was like, what's up when we're wearing a bra? Just a Bra. My mom, what they did at Times Square, they turn times square into like Disney mall is, it's New York's version of like 12 like Disneyland. It's disgusting and it's a nightmare whenever you're visiting. And also like when you're visiting, you're in a car, you don't need to go to this and all of a sudden you look up and you're like, oh, we can fucking time.

Speaker 2:          00:22:13       Like you're just driving through it. I'm like, we gotta get Outta here man. Like the chaos, the, and it's just like, it's too commercialized. No commercial, no reason. It feels like you're, yeah, everything that makes New York amazing is like gone. God, you're gonna just do a funny joke about it with your coat for a meeting and then like you're walking in and people just looking up and he's like, why is that? What gonna fuck yeah. Who says that? Jim Gaffigan. Oh, that's funny. That's funny. Yeah. Well it's like a, it's very Vegas ask. It's like walking down the strip. Yes it is. It's like are the lights and the total control? It's fake. There's no M and. M's. That's not where it was invented. So why is a giant m and m store and when you knew used to know what it was like with like peep shows and xxx everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:22:52       And it was, it was seedy and weird, but every dangerous, it was dangerous, like legitimately dangerous. [inaudible] I mean the worst time what? Seventies eighties right. That was like the worst crime time, late seventies into the, to the mid to late eighties I was hanging out in New York in the 80s when I was, that was my pool hustling days and uh, I was doing a lot of gigs. I guess it wasn't the 80s it was the nineties the early nineties cause by 91 was I think the first time I ever performed in New York. 91 or maybe 90 of them really? Well, this is like, you're just starting out though, kind of. You are going to Amsterdam barriers then. Yes. What was this Chelsea Chelsea billiards. Chelsea handler's. There was where we would go to Amsterdam, but Amsterdam is on the west side. Back then it was on ams moved. That's why it was called Amsterdam Pemex since it was on the west side.

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       It was an awesome place, I call it. That's why I became friends with Don. My rera played pool with him in [inaudible] 94 at Amsterdam billiards. I didn't know he like when I, when meet a pool player, like a comical actually plays like dom could play. He called me today. I can't wait. I'm going to back off that guy. I love him so much. But uh, New York was a different place, man. I was around a lot of these like Weirdo homeless, grifter type characters. A lot of due to get arrested for doing three card Monte. Like the pool hall was the best education of like street culture. Like people who live on the street, I mean home people, people were basically homeless. Like sometimes it's still here. They're like my friend Johnny was always like staying in people's, hey stayed at my house for, sometimes he would stay in these weird little hostels and flop houses in New York and places that didn't have a roof. Like you have walls, but there would be like no rules. So like everybody can hear everybody. Remember as a kid in that era, the perception that you had of New York is like, this is nothing but crime. Right? Like they say, it's dangerous. You're not allowed. Giuliani, you know, clamped down on all that shit. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       I remember when I moved and I, I found a place, I came back to get my stuff and I told Neil Brennan, I was like, I don't think they have bars in my back window door and need that. It goes, I'll do read the crime stats. It's a different city though. It's just not that city anymore. Yeah, it was sitting in the war was already safe. That was, I mean, I don't remember any crime, which although I did get taken and three card Monte a number of times, but they didn't force you use all three card money. You know my brain, I'm like, I fucking got this fucking put money down. Larry is too high. So that, and they used to have this game where they had a a nail in a piece of board and yet a hammer and you had three shots to get the nail in that they had that in Thailand.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       Dude, I do that over every fucking time. There was so much so hard. There's so many hustlers right back in those days in New York. So many people trying to get off some kind of scam. Yeah, I guess I've been scammed by a driver in New York. How, what? It's like, this was not even that long ago. I mean it was probably like seven, eight years where no, like you get in the cab and you're like, you know, if you don't live there but you kind of know like the layout, you're just like, basically I want to go up, uh, you know, 20 blocks this way. Right. And the guy just goes across town and starts going up like the opposite highway, like one where we were, I'm like, which, what are we doing exactly? There's already that you can track yourself on your phone. Just looking at it like what are we doing?

Speaker 1:          00:25:59       And he's like going up to the, I go, couldn't you have just gone up that avenue that we were on? And he was like, I don't know what's going on man. I'm like, I go, well this is fucking outrageous. And then we pull up, I see like the meter go and go and I'm like, this is crazy. That was supposed to be a a 10 minute drive and it's taken 40 minutes. He goes, just pay me what you ever, you want to pay me what? Yeah. And I go, okay. Because he didn't want to get caught. Yeah. And I go, okay, that, so I go like the things had like $68 and I was like, here's 20 bucks. He's like, that's it. I gotta use my pace, but I want to pay so I'll see you man. Yeah, I bet it was. He was totally cool with it. Yeah, because he scared me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did that Israel wants in Jerusalem. When I got there, I took a, I was like, take me to belay Brock. And it was, I didn't

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       realize I was three blocks over. He could, he just told me like, oh, that's right there dude. But it took me around the city and then let me off. And then when I wanted to go home afterwards, I was like, what? You right here? Find out. Yeah. That's how you find out that out on my way on that cab ride, because I started texting people at the next place. I was like, I was just leaving here and I'm going to see you. Should I be on the fucking passport? And they were like, no. So you didn't speak Spanish in that moment. He was a rush from that. I would've taken, I would've taken, I would've gone right to Spanish, got into a language that makes me feel powerful. Nigerian pocketed it and uh, in Florence and I went into Russian, everything, every word I knew in Russia, my yelled at the guy and he ran because he was like, I don't know what I'm doing. Like Russians are fucking animals. She yelled out, America, you fucking trader Shitty, yelled out America and take your fucking shirt off and said, I'm the machine. And started running after her mother fucker one my wife yells up by me, he's scared. More scared of you than [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:27:47       Ah, I should write that down. Write that down. You should write that whole thing down about you talking about on the radio. That is hilarious. And then went downstairs then because the audience is going to be like, so wait, what do you do? Then you pull out coke and you do a bunk [inaudible] everybody and then you start making no sense and then the blood comes out of your nose. It's an awesome show. Yeah. You could do math if you want. If you don't want to do the coke that night, you take your high blood pressure medication on stage. That crowd. Yeah, I would. I would love to know what I'd love to met. Start growing this cocoa plants. The kind where you just chew the leaves. You can grow them here. Climate suitable. You can get there. Yeah, you could. You could organize a closet with some heat lamps and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:28:30       Do you think so? Yeah, for sure. And I just have just to like chew a little bit. Well, let's find out how many people are growing their own cocoa leaves in the United States. I don't think I ever want to walk you hot. Why wouldn't you have? I would love to so much of it. That's why those female cocaine, Peruvian leaves, those just want to be like one of those bears. I would love to talk to Aubrey Marcus. It's the crazy happened. You chew those leaves. It's actually not bad for you at all. And the team coca tea is great. I've had that. Yeah, that'll Seattle. Your nausea. You know what can we especially you get to like, I'm serious. Like everyone starts drinking it. You still have to sign me up. It's great. Isn't it crazy that everybody just thinks that this one thing as the processed chemicalized fucking version that Scarface and clocked me. How many people have died because of cocaine? Oh my God. Oh Lord. How many murders? Is there another drug on the planet that is inspired more murders than cocaine? Yeah, right. I would, I would love to know murderers versus number of Dick sucked for it. Oh, that'd be so funny man. If everybody got murdered every time they did coke, they don't. But a lot of people get their dicks poke like

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       [inaudible] might not be everybody, but it's like 30% so the name, cause girls can't afford coke too. If they're young and they're partying and they're out and in some fucking guy comes along with a fat Tracy Morgan like gold chain. That's how good coke is though. Yeah. That's how good it is. Right? That that people are like for sure I'll just blow this stranger. Oh yeah I have that. I knew a guy. So who would get coke that didn't do coke? They would get coke just so they have coke. So how it around for those whore women if girls want to co cause some girls when they want coke [inaudible] I am calling somebody and I'm going to get some fucking coke and I'm gonna leave here. Hold on, hold on. We got some coke. So though she knows a guy damn orgy going on. Why? Some of it's just girls are like, oh I know my blow job is worth stuff, so what can I get out of it?

Speaker 2:          00:30:25       What am I looking for? My brother in law told me that he went to Woodstock too, you know, like what, 20 years ago, whatever it was. Yeah. Had he said this guy got one of his friends got of a long line, this is an orthodox Jew, kind of a long line with a bunch of food. Like it took forever to get through concessions and she goes, look at my waiting in a line. I'll blow you for that food. And you go, yeah, sure, let's do it. Wow. Absolutely sucked his dick for food. Food. That's like your chips. She got a little extra protein. Wow. Wow. We had a, uh, be real from Cypress Hill and he was showing us the footage of him on stage crowd surfing. He was onstage in front of, in Woodstock, half a million people in the fucking crowd and then, and then goes out into the crowd, crowd surf and they stole a sneakers.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       They took his sneakers and uh, both people both left and the right sneaker. They came to the, one of his shows and he signed it in the future. Your shoe from Woodstock, we sign it. It's like, fuck. Yeah. And he signed. That's crazy. That's wow. It's the video of him on stage in front of half a million people. It is insane. I love how they, the Sandra's house have not wavered at all from their day one. Not like we smoke this shit all day too. Like if you open their Instagram right now it's just like check it out. Yeah. Fucking 30 years deep into this shit. Like they don't fuck around at all. Cypress hills, Instagram, like half of it is we'd videos with like Cypress Hill music in the background. It's just videos of people doing wax and Dabs and bong hits with Cypress Hill in the back of the first album is so good.

Speaker 2:          00:31:53       So good. They get high the way we get high. But you and I know they do. I went with them. They get way higher than that but I'm saying do they like, are they out of it? No Man, look, he's fine. He's got that show called the smoke box. You can see the car get a car by the way. Can I just say, I thought you would all Chinese Guy Barbecue. That wasn't even there. Are you serious? In another dimension? Yeah. To be, to just have a pass us a picture of you and it looked like you were, I was like, oh, he smoked so much before we ever got in the car. I was like, I can't believe we're going to keep going. And he's like totally normal. Oh, it's normal as could be. That's guys, professional stoner sen dog. They're just fine. Yup. That's not me. That's me with booze though. Yeah, I could definitely, I could definitely probably like I was, I was trying

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       to think of like the celebrity I could go beard a beer for and then really hurt them. Most of them. Most Post Malone Post Malone and then you can take them down. Dude, who do you think he's a young guy with scribbles on his face. He's an awesome, he's a great fucking musician. Musicians. Awesome. His tattoos requesting a, they're odd. What is a who taught choices really fucking take it down. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like drink heavily. And I think if you, and now this is, I've thought about this a lot, if I go for their cocktail and I got to match them cocktail the cocktail, um, I can keep pace with Stan hope. Uh, that's a big one. Key of stand up. Jesus. Stand up. Doesn't drink as much as everyone thinks he just drinks every day. Yeah. Like, like, yeah. Like he's not like a lot of it's left to right. Yeah. Thanks a lot of light beer. Oddly enough. A lot healthier than I think people assume Ron white would be a tough one. Oh yeah. Wrong white, white goes. He gets fucked up every night of the week. That's possible. Like every night of the week. Every, not every, not every night. It's all know how to do. Damn. But he's, it looks like $1 million and he did 10 years ago. Happy man. I'll tell you that. That's a happy dude. He looks great. Yeah. He's 38 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       So boys were brought here for a reason, not just to talk shit. Jesus. We're trying to figure out, um, how to do sober October this year. What are we going to do of October? I will already have the answer and I think it's early for me to say it now, so I'll wait until the end. Oh, you sound sounded. You have your, your thought. I know exactly what we're doing. Okay, so this, just tell her this happening though. Gloats over. Tom's got an aggressive schedule. I think we should go. No coffee. Okay. Really stepping up. Stop Sobriety. But if I were with us on a coffee because I think we should make it harder. Like, no, no booze, no alcohol season. No coffee is on thick. Ooh, no water. It's Tom Sober sober. You're on a mild stimulant. I think it's cheating. I think we should go. No coffee.

Speaker 1:          00:34:51       I like no coffee. I like no coughing, no coffee on wait, wait, wait. Should we realize you can only drink water the whole month? She no other drinks. I'm fucking in no other drink. Sparkling water. Bob Brown. Come on. Carbonated water. It's just water. No, that works. I like where you, Oh, I'm ramping up. I'm ready to go to war. Wait only water and carbonated water. Yep. I'll do that. I'll do that. I'll do that. Oh, so no coffee. So what do you wouldn't have milk in their coffee. Wow. Yeah. We should go carnivore diet all month. Nothing but Ribeye steaks. All right. Relax. Why not? Because you're going to get that fucking [inaudible]. I'm willing to negotiate and I'm willing to negotiate with what I think our challenge should be for what you think our should be. Well, what do you think the challenge would be? I know I have an idea of a challenge to be [inaudible] is about health, right?

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       Yes. Yeah. Health. It's not, what do you want it to be? I think it should be, if mental health is a, is a legit part of health, you should give up your fucking dopamine fucking addictions and get rid of cell phones. Yeah. Get rid of your cell phones in your social media for a month. I get your, uh, I get why you wouldn't do it. Cause your career. You can email your fucking ladies to fucking post shit for you ladies. Enjoy social media. Yeah, I know. Oh, it's boots enjoying it. I think you have a good point with this. I do. I really do. I think about you sometimes when I, when I feel like I've been on like a flight or in a hotel room and I'm like, I think I've been looking at my phone for like three hours thinking about having gone out.

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just being like, just think it takes the, the um, the connective tissue away from this, this challenge to the people that enjoy watching this challenge. I think a lot of people enjoy that will be, that will be a problem. I mean, I'm going to be able to join in with those. The Rock. Let's do it. And then November 1st everyone's like, oh yeah, you guys did sober October. I forgot about that. I could get each of you and I'll could tell. No, I understand. I'm not like Joe who says do what I do and then I'll just fucking have an easy time of it. I will go with no cell phones. I will do beyond what I already do. Let's, let's, let's, you didn't do what you guys did though, eating, doing yoga down to join us. That was [inaudible] I'm saying it wasn't a challenge in that like there was no contest.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       If it was, I had to do a yoga the most like I do it. Right, right, right, right, right. That's it. That's it. Maybe it's the most 90 minute yoga class showing that most elks tend to go to war or kills the most Alex and can reverse to Garcia here. His mental health. It's a good point. We, uh, we definitely look at these fucking things. You can also get a, like a legit real camera if you wanted film stuff, give it to your fucking assistance that you could have the post to figure this out and post whatever you need to be. How about this? How about this? We run the most miles in a month. Track it track. Let me just go for my baseline right now. How many miles a month to run right now? It's up there, man. Okay. What about you? Bart has to be real running. I wanted it on the glass. I don't want that bullshit on a fucking treadmill. Running shoes with a Bluetooth capability in them will wear the wrong shoes. So we're going to listen. We're gonna run from miles, but it's not fair because already doing, I'm only running hills, man. Oh, how many of them when you go for a run now, it's no more than an hour, hour and 15 minutes. Same. Same

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       number. That same marathon right there? No, no. Up Hills. Up Hills. He's probably running six miles. I'm running some steep shit. It's more like, it's, it's more a sprinting. It's like there's a lot of plyometrics. It's more like that. Like you're, you're, you're not just flat running at a steady pace. So do you sprint, run out chasing my dog too. We're having, I'm trying to make it hard. I mean, I pretend things to chase in me. I played a little bit and games in my head. Yeah, that's nice. That pretend to have to get to the top where everyone and no dyes. Yeah, you're good at this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       Give me a hint. Whatever you got in your brain, give it to me a little bit. When I work

Speaker 2:          00:39:11       you don't want it. Um, cause it ramps up, ramps up that's ready to go and listen. Crazy. We were going guys, we were working at like six, seven hours a day. It was terrible man. But the whole time I was like, man, I do zero working out. So this is called [inaudible]. Great. All right. When you were here, when we were like three weeks into the month and you were here, we did a podcast together and use my fucking rower. You did an hour on the rower and you were ripped. Do you have a six pack? I was like, look at this mother fucker. I know. It was pretty impressive. An hour on the rower is real work. That's real work. You are not going to not get second or was not gonna not go last. That's why would you not want it?

Speaker 1:          00:39:50       Here's what I, here's what I, here's what I'm hearing already. Wants to do a challenge that he already excels at. I get it. No, no, no. But you're already off and you're complaining about Joe. Is that he is, is that he keeps logging in things that he is good at. So yeah, I will take care of this since you gentlemen, are you ready? Oh Sir. This year, sober October. Physical challenge like you're presenting it like presidential candidate. It's like an apple when it's going to be good hip hop dance hip hop in. Joe, hear me out. Just hear me out. Hear me out and spin. Let me soft sell you. Let me stop. [inaudible] okay. We each get a choreographer and we work dance classes as much as we can. Dance classes are pretty aggressive. We leave it to the audience to vote here. Listen, hear me out when I'm sorry. When I liked that idea Joe. We can do that now. Hear me out. Starting with each my 1st of October. That's what you do on a pitch. You make them think it was their idea. Yeah, we got this right. I want you to look over at that belt. You'd never getting that but hold on. Hold on one second. Hear me guys. Hear me out. Everyone listen to me. Yeah, you should watch out for this shit. Is putting the fuck his belt on.

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       Oh, okay. All right. I haven't even touched this thing since October. Same as me with any sort of rough belt man. We each got to go to dance classes to get our skill set up. We each worked with a choreographer to create our own dance to the exact same song. Let me know when you're done at the end. At the end, at the end. By the way, I'm selling this to the room, like threading that through your genes get popped, like snaps in the bag at the snaps at the end of the, I have a hard time putting belts on too. If at the of the month

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       come November 1st, we each submit our one minute hip hop dance choreography, choreography video and the fans vote on who the winner of sober October is. Gentlemen, I would like to hear your bottles starting with Thomson [inaudible]. I gotta tell you are watching this, the rebuttals punc holes in it. You put, you put, you sort of mentioned that. Here's what I'll tell you. What I like about it is easy to say what I don't like about anything that comes out of your mouth. So what I don't like about it or what I do like about it is that no one's great at it. I do like that it is a workout because those, those dancers are unbelievable. I'm one dancer right now. Me obviously first Joe seconds, not even close. What are you talking about? It's definitely me. What? I'm way better dancer than you guys out of your fucking mind.

Speaker 4:          00:42:21       Just cause you see Spanish doesn't mean you're a better. Do you like to dance? No, but I know I'm better dancer than you guys. First of all, I want to fucking listen. I could do a lot of crazy shit with my body. You guys can't do and that's true, but I'm saying rhythm to them. You have rhythm. Yes. All right. Wait, hold on. You have rhythm. I know I do. I'm fucking phenomenal at dancing. Well here's okay, but know what I'm saying is that nobody Xcels I mean obviously I'm better than you, but nobody excels. So I like the idea of working at something that, you know, no one's great at and all this meat dancing. Oh, that's right. Yeah. So movie. I was in the movie zoo keeper. Yeah. I, I, I took dance classes. Oh, all right. Uh, dance my ass off bitch.

Speaker 4:          00:43:13       I love problem movies. Make it seem normal that that guy could get back. Girl. I know. Ever so often. You, oh wait, hold on, hold on. Let's see Joe. Okay. Like legitimately, I mean I'm not good anything. So this is hip hop dance we're talking about. Look at his face. Yeah, it's intense dance. Come on son S. Oh yeah, you did pretty good there. Actually. I took fucking dance lessons. I didn't do it for weeks. So you're dancing with Nikki Glaser? Leslie Bibb. Oh, she's from uh, Talladega nights. Yeah, she's great. She's great. Very, very funny person too. I think that sounds like a done deal. And else have any, here's the last thing, the last thing. That is great. Okay. So everybody gets to work at it. Nobody excels too much at it. I think it's funny that we're comics and we get to look silly doing something.

Speaker 4:          00:44:03       Yeah, I could not look great at it and I'm on board with, I think it's fun that people that watch that or get really into it would have a say in it. I'm the only one of the three of us. There's not obese, so it would look the least silly for me to doing it. You're calling Joe fat medically obese, so I think that's, sorry, I'm about to be on my son. Yeah, it's all about the BMI. BMI is off the chart as you're saying that you are into it or not. I would look at least silly just in terms of that,

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       but you guys, I get why you look silly. Just moving at all. Mm, well you also need these silly, yeah, I'm not a fucking fat, but you don't make yourself always, you're always breaking. Break yourself before you break ankles and elbows and shit owns breaking through and breaking stuff. That's super fucking vulnerable. I am. It's a good point. What about injury? What's intriguing not do at this point? No, no, no. Dance classes are intense. Do you really think you the current best answer easily. I think bars most I the most out of all of us. I agree. And so the dance classes are taught, we get each get ourselves choreographers and we create our own dance to the exact song hypes up. Wait for me to talk about this. Okay, but the amount of Molly I would have to do to, to enjoy that dancing, but you can't be sober.

Speaker 3:          00:45:14       Can't be solid, but you can't November 1st is that when we posted it, you can be ideas that dance partner dancing, sober, sober fencing. Strober here's, here's problems with it. I'll never want, it's subjective. You can't have something subjective you can't have. So the other thing to him dance better. We to think over dance better. You can't have a bunch of morons vote for it. Okay, let me, let me break this down. Finish up. I'm going to write to what if, what if? What if the dance pros got together? That's what I was sec. Perfect professionals judge. Well yeah, they're, they're out there and they like Burt better. They like me better. You don't want that. No. Judges choose it. The most corrupt people that all sports [inaudible] they literally go to jail, but so we have to upgrade O'Brian and Olympic judges. No, no. Nothing subjective.

Speaker 3:          00:46:06       We gotta grind dances. We got up. We got to make it uncomfortable there. Make it super uncomfortable. Do you want to make her comfortable, comfortable hands classes? It's all right. Teen dance, dance classes. Hip Hop does something. It's something about the fitness challenges that are more exciting to me. Cause this daily fitness all the time and wonder what that is. I'll do something that you guys don't do a fitness challenge you guys don't do. Yup or that I don't do. Rather than write that. Okay, that's you're trying to say that I don't ever do, I'll ride bikes. I'm gonna give a fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       Bikes, bikes everywhere, right by store. Accessible ride bikes. But Tom's in Europe ride a bike pitch as you go to your ride bikes over there in Europe in October for a lot of those countries. Are the scheduled in Australia sort of cancel yet. It's coming up. Oh, come on. I'll take a sip. When do you cancel it? I can't sell clothes. Why are you gonna cancel it? I've canceled before. Just once. I think it was Dwight. Couple of times you get sick. Australia. The only time he's been to Australia was opening for you with UFC ticket. When also at another time I went, I did the Melbourne festival. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I'm in Oakland. June 5th takes this Sydney June 20th give out dates. Oh, that's all right. I'll be in Columbus. I know there's a bunch people that are doing, we will [inaudible]. We want to be able to vote well then not gonna water.

Speaker 3:          00:47:34       No one's stealing this. You're going to have to earn this motherfucker. So you're saying this, you're thinking this hip hop has, this is mine. This is mine. I like it. I like it. I'm going to keep it. I'm going to keep this. This is mine. The flaw he saying is that there's not like a clear right that it's, yeah, you can't leave it in the hands of the judges. Get the fuck Outta here. That's rule number one for fighting. Never leave it in the hands of the judges. Rule number one. It's probably like rule number of guys down there first. It's like watch out further like or sometimes perhaps up to number one, smile as celebrities in the audience. Do your cardio. Donate like shit. I would love to see those guys they wanted to do too. It's like, can we leave this to the judge was like, dude, just fucking worry about [inaudible] to the judges. I need to know.

Speaker 3:          00:48:24       Oh my God. That's funny. That was really behind your dance idea. Dancing would be tough. I do have a gym for you. Home was a place right near by me. Joe. Joe, I think you're overestimating your dance skills. Hip Hop, dance, not dance skills. I'll learn them. Would it be an amount of time in my body better? I learned them. You know how to move your body. You better for sure. You don't lose moved. Moved my body better than you can move yours. Do you think we get Shakira to just even say that? Do you know crazy? It is for you to say that my physical dexterity in your physical death. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:49:04       talking about Joe, Joe Kelly Ripa wobble. If I got through that challenge and you didn't prepare, you came in last like you did with this last one. We read [inaudible] put a sock in a fucking with a lock in it like a bike lock and beat your ass punishment for this. I'm cool with punishment. That's a good idea. Barrio punished, right? Like, like full metal jacket. Borrow Code Right. You out with a bar. Soap in a sock dance. I think that even Matthew Modine got in on this number. Yeah, he did. That's right. Yeah. Until he felt bad about being, I don't know if this is the real thing.

Speaker 3:          00:49:42       So you don't know if, what's the real thing? I think you need to keep pushing her hip hop dance works. Stick with your challenge. If you like. I could see us going through all these fucking things and bird the as like, Whoa, you guys beat me. I can't believe it. Like you motherfucker. You're talking shit the whole month. Yeah. Talking Shit the whole month and you came in last. That's my game plan. That's a good point of sandbags. Next challenge. No sandbags. Fucking October. You be fell apart. Dude, I fell apart. Okay. When are you started posting these giant? He, he was on the bike for four hours. Like what? Oh Fuck my head up. Todd got bad. Jeff fucking, we started, we started off with like 200 points was a good day. It was like, it was like that scene in big when, uh, when I'm uh, love it. So tell us, uh, what's his name? Like, Hey, slow down. Slow down somewhere. You can make us all look bad. You know, we're all doing as an easy, easy, easy, easy, crazy. Anybody was going to take it. We don't know how much or how much we hated each other to the really drive us to not be, well, I don't know how you looked at it, but I love you guys. I just thought it was a fun competition. She's flipped the fuck aring stand by it.

Speaker 3:          00:50:55       I was the most amount of points you ever put in a day. My biggest point day was you ran 13 miles one day. Yeah. Oh, broken up. No, no, just, I mean like just going and going. I did it in the hills and you know, just kept up, ran like to another city, came back since he ran 13 fucking miles. That was after he was sick for a week. That's what I almost dropped out. I was like, oh he's done. Cool. Yeah, we got home, we took the photo thing, Gash, sandbag dust. Why did you take the foot off the gas pedal? We should've waited till he was for sure. Tom was like, I'm sick. I'm out. I was like Thompson last. I don't have to worry. I'm not in the last oh is that what you were worried about? Cause I was like, I was competing with Tom.

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       Tom and I were neck in neck. Ari was a fucking cunt. And we just post the numbers in the middle of the night. You'd go to sleep like two thirds in. Oh he didn't start like that. I posted the Middle Lane Cause I, my gym, blink fitness would allow me to work out 24 hours a day. So I'd cut off for, it was fucking ridiculous. Fucking go work out three items that was fucked my head up, man. I'd wake up, you wake up and you're like, you play Masti play nasty. Forgive me late spots. It's not my fault. It's all St. It's tricky, right? [inaudible] gameplay. But here's what I realized. You guys woke up like, Oh, what? Yeah, I'm not in first. We'll give this. I like this. Here's what I've, okay, keep this. I think you guys should do a dance off anyway. Well, he does have that incredible physical dexterity.

Speaker 3:          00:52:22       They would need a way for judges to decide, but that's not about working out though, right? Hip Hop dancing, no hip hop dancing. If you're going to get good, you're going to be dancing every single day. Dot. That's how you, I don't like doing it, but that was a good restaurant. Why is, somebody showed me a tweet I made recently a year ago. I'm like, how did we get from Burt can run a marathon to all gonna go straight edge for a month. What the fuck happens. Exactly what we got from [inaudible] couldn't run a marathon. He couldn't do it faster than your dad did. Suddenly we're all straight US holocaust survivor and then he was, but he was also like, I can run a marathon tomorrow easily. Technically kind of did. Yeah, you did. I tactically dead. I did blow the doors off. You guys. You were really, really amazed. But I think the real test was that Tom was going to try to rollerskate and marathon fashion, but he didn't take into account going uphill or the fact that he has never rollerskated.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       Yeah, but that's easy to learn. Kids are flat four wheel like. It's like fuck, look out for us. What do you think would have happened on the roller skating part of it after running that marathon? Yeah. Uh, you are crushed. You, you probably would have beat me. Yeah, it was a flat. You don't have la [inaudible]. No, hold on. La Marathon was uphill downtown, but once you got past the store, you would have been hauling fucking ass down Luciana guy. I would never call him from seller to them. Nobody is checking them off and he got hurt a couple of rollers getting people and they like, no. They said like, your feet are going to, you're going to be in rough fucking blow out as cash. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:54:08       lightly. We're, we're warriors. I get it from people that have been doing it for years and also like, what does that, the Roller Derby people, they were like, yeah, you gotta be careful with it. Just think about skiing for five hours. If you had a school of greatness, that would be [inaudible] ski for five hours straight without going up lift hills, going into the lifts, up the hills. If you just skied all we only on your feet for five hours, I bet you it'd be hurting. Oh yeah. Bird. Anyway, it's, muscles are all sore. My feet are always hurting after a day of skiing like Jesus. Cause you're always like, yeah, yeah, no. It would've been, I would've been fucked up for sure. You got fucked up. Did you see me crash Bert? Yeah. Yeah, I did. I did. And then I pulled up and you were like, oh, it was, I don't think it's broken shark rocket is it?

Speaker 3:          00:54:54       Put It, put a pin in it for Comcast. I saw you with the big dam down to this now so up you got pen in there like a metal piece broke off. Got some sort of pen. You know what's good about that? It give one more reason to fuck with the people at Tsa. You're going to go fucking might have a sacrament there that they're like, how come something's going off to everything? You're talking like the sector meetings, like anything in your pocket. I'm like the sec to me they're like, what about belts? Vasectomy and the like, what? What?

How does it know you out of a sector?

Speaker 3:          00:55:30       Because it's a little inconsistent. It's like a hard thing in there. Peanut you want to feel it? No, it's your choice. Interesting. So it's calcified. You've got like a little rock that rock new Dick Hole, fucking terrorist threat dance. So I want to ask you one thing about your challenge. You say, no, we're not doing already. No, no, no. I just wanted to ask her something, but like there's not enough of, it has to be a second part to that, right. For the month. What do you mean? Like, yes, there's nothing physical. Really a good point. You know what I mean? Like is there, it would just be that would, we would need a second part because right. That is just a mental problem. Yeah. Well, would the guys, I'm telling you, you're not going to do it. I know how addicted you are. Ours, you're never going to agree to this dancing videos. It would make your lives. You'd be happier and you wouldn't know why. Hm. No, I've been off Twitter pretty much and it's, I'm an exponentially hopper. Twitter just makes me sad and angry.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       You don't touch you at all the court stuff and post it, but I don't read comments and stuff that can fuck your head up. Twitter can be aggressive sometimes. Find out great. Used to be, oh dude, remember that? Fun Jokes. Yeah, I can't. I can do. My whole thing's about, I only use stuff to promote toward. That's it really. SORTA.

[inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       wait, wait, wait. Let me preemptively say, oh sure. I was on a bus for the last seven days. Sure. So just a good, definitely I'm saying at home, not home. We're checking them or amount of usage on the online, on our phones, down a bus. This is, by the way, this time could be spent reading a book or doing something, but go ahead and even today, 30 minutes I think is pretty low. Six hours and 34 minutes a day. Lastly, on a bus. On a bus. But now, but that is on, but no, I get your board, but there's a far better way to spend your time. Here's the, but you have to bit to kind of look at it like this too. I'm sitting on this bus with a fucking thousand movies you can choose from and I do this all the

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       time where I roll through like I'm going to watch a movie which is like a normal thing to kill an hour and a half, two hours and I'm like, none of these interests me. I'm going to spend that time doing this. Right. Looking at emails, looking at social media, looking at youtube videos. It's if I'm saying that you can knock off easily two hours. Yeah, and there'd be two hours spent just mindlessly staring at something else or that you wouldn't be

Speaker 3:          00:59:44       have a record of free writing or that's true. Or like you're saying that none of that occurred or learning hip hop dance. No, I'm saying that I will say this, when you're bored and you're looking out a window on a tour bus eventually, not the first time minutes button that maybe puts in 10 minute, 30 minute, 40 your mind's like, fuck, we're so bored. And then you start writing big ideas. That's true. True. And you're just not even thinking about those times because you're on there. That's true. It's 100% true.

Speaker 4:          01:00:13       Wait, so what's yours like eight minutes?

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       Uh, I would have to get my iPad out. No, yours is. Yeah, take it out and see. Ariz is surprisingly high because he uses, is that when he's not at lights your seven day though? I have no idea. Seven Day was 30 minutes. Yeah, today was three hours and a half to seven day was 30 minutes a day. Average 30 minutes a day. Wait, how's that possible second founder. Yes. Hold a second. Phone. Use the search part. Split screen test. They're going to make sense mathematically. Good. John and Tommy, you're absolutely right. That three hours, 35 minutes today would be, you would have to only abuse that out there. It's a brand new box. Would use that 30 minutes. I was like, I'm a fuck. Is that possible? I'll show you. Where is it? Oh yeah. Oh, two hours and six minutes. That's, that's too much. What's too much advisor's office today? I want to find it. This, what is it?

Speaker 5:          01:01:08       Uh, fuck no man.

Speaker 3:          01:01:14       What'd you do? What'd you get the fucking here. I love the one guy that doesn't have behind high phones walking you through your iPhone. That's true. Oh, five hours and 30 minutes for 51 minutes a day. Wow. That's a lot for hours and 51 minutes of your day. Five of your 16 hour waking day. And Joe's defense not to, but like, he's got a new people all the time and I'm sure there's times he's like, tell me about that guy. Dot Dot, dot. Okay. Definitely a lot of that. I keep hearing that in my defense, my defense, but I'm never in an authentic, where am I? That's too much. It's too much. It is too much. You do do some work on your phone, but more than that, you fuck off. I have every nope transcribed in my phone. All my notes from my writing, my laptop, it's all on my phone. Um, all my sets are on my show. It shows your productivity on their decision. What you using a timeline. Yeah. It won't be, you want it to sound like it's going to be four hours in 35 minutes of productivity at 20 minutes of fucking off. No, no. A lot of it is also watching stuff. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:02:14       safari and let's take it. Let's play a game. Or I can go, hey, tell me about.dot, dot. What you'd googled? Fun fucking game. I am. I got my computer here. Give me your phone. I got my computer. Give me your phones. Give me your phone. No one can go back while, um, I have my computer here. It's a lot of time when you look at it, when you see a lot of hours, a lot of waking time spent looking at a screen instead of your surroundings. Wow. What is the last things I googled the driving part of that. You can't, you're not using it. You're fucking me and it's you. And then it's just some porn.

Speaker 3:          01:02:51       How much does that go? I only like anal scenes. You beating off every day? No, I just started again. Interesting. Take some time off. Yeah, I took some time off. I was having a hard time with it. And now I'm now his phone. This is always fun. I gotta call you back if he's got a laptop that has a CD drive. Oh it does it. That's the right year to buy honestly. Cause a good keyboard. Yeah. All the ones, the ones that got an hour fucking horrible. The problem is with that, you can't do the same things on Instagram. We can't post stuff from your fucking computer. No, I have to send it to my lady. You can't post it for a mom. An iPad. Yes. You probably could lock myself out of my out of my account and I'm like, I don't know the password.

Speaker 3:          01:03:33       Hilarious. SMART, smart. It's a monopoly. Does not make for a great sober October challenge in my opinion. Just to watch people do nothing is not because he's saying that it would still get posted. Everything will still get posted. No, no body camera lady legit like digital camera of this challenge. Is that some you enjoy like following along with it terms of what we're doing. It's not our normal thing. Rogan clearly is the, it's the working out so he doesn't have to change his life that much. All you do is promote the worst for you to not have. Where you're already doing is promoting nonstop. Oh, he has his hip hop dancing. Did you knock something over again? So then what's Tom Bad at? What pig? A father.

Speaker 3:          01:04:21       So we've got the, what if we switched kids? How do you handle this? What? What do you do? How do you handle this? How do we do this? I didn't say what I hear you, but what are those pronouns you mean? I mean I'm saying like I like the idea of a, some sort of social media challenge, like staying off social media. It's kind of stuff that I did something. That's the thing we were missing. The second poll. 100% you're, you're dead on dead on with that. The Birkin go fuck himself with this hip hop dance and shit. So Joe, I do have a hip hop dance place right near my apartment that I could go to all the time. I told you I'm in mandate. You're in a Maori or do you think social hip hop dance would be a good one? I think it, I think, let's put a pin in that. I think for Real, put a pin in it. That would be at some level of acceptable. We'd have to get judges who dove is active. No judges. Judges can go fuck themselves. We want real hard numbers. Let's put in parameters.

Speaker 3:          01:05:23       You can't have a bad decision that causes a ride amongst our fans to feel like someone unfairly got the belt. Even if we don't do this. There was something so real about how good you are. You said you're a better mover than him. That I would love to see. I feel like part of the month you have to do something with that. You know what I mean? I think the, the audience would love it. It makes sense. Oh, it's gotta be, here's the deal. Let's just put parameters on worst rubber tube or it's going to be taking place. Thomas touring through Europe in our hall for part of it yet. Yeah. How many days? 10 days. That will cripple you. You're going to get sick. [inaudible] fitness. I'm Cardi landed down. Forget about any fitness challenge, son. 10 days in Europe, all that traveling or with those weird European diseases, that's how they wiped out most of the American people. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Easy to find there. His foot's gonna have wiped out Europe. People. Graham Hancock says that at one point in time, the Amazon jungle had 20 million people and thriving civilizations, beautiful cities, and that the Europeans, they're dirty diseases. Yeah. Came over and wiped everybody out. Let's heal the thousands. That's actually your parents. Yeah. Your Dad was one of those in run away from a virus. True. Getting rid of his dirty bugs. Your mom was down washing or laundry next to a caiman alligator. He came up his sleeves that are pussy.

Speaker 3:          01:06:50       Hey, tell me this. Uh, the creek and the cave, the Legion of skanks are not doing what the fuck they're doing. Not doing their show at the creek and the cave anymore. First of all, you guys coming to me on this is worse than Ainslie being coming to you about the comedy store. Milo, I think it's directly related. Yeah. Yeah. Right. But that's why that's what happened. No, they were trying to do it at the creek and the cave and the lady freaked out. Right. She buckled under pressure. That's not why they're moving. They're already going to move it. They're already gonna move it. There's new standards opening up though. I'll use this as an excuse maybe, or people will say that's the reason they were already going to move it from the beginning. For somebody who doesn't know what you're talking about. [inaudible] booked legion of skanks. You know who they are legit people who hold the rose and Luis, right? Luis, Luis Gomez and Gomez and uh, Dave Smith and they, they're hardcore guys except when they come on this podcast plus out. But like, um, the hardcore guys for the most part, so they booked, they bitched out on the day. I don't understand that. I thought we just had a conversation. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:07:51       that's fucking, I'm actually jackass in that heyday of jackass and them all sitting here politely and not trying to fucking shave their heads in front of, it's like, come on dude. Obviously they need a second chance on this podcast. Thanks. Not now. Not on you. I wouldn't get one. These expectations come up and do something crazy. I'm like, come here. Had a good time with you. Yeah. Fun. Nice car. Nice conversation. But it's funny. [inaudible] I know it's traceable to drink some tea. They said, let's talk a Milo Yiannopoulos and Milo said they cooked down. So now ours running with the narrative. Listen, so they booked Milo. They're like, oh, we have this guy who's been fucking whatever. And then uh, and then everyone started going doing the thing with the attack, the venue, if you have that are ready, the problem is not enough that they can miss, analyze the person or say, I want nothing to do with that guy.

Speaker 3:          01:08:40       Then if you put him up, then you're the issue. Or a woman who gave birth to tons of fucking great LGBA and fucking black performers. She's an issue because she's not stopping or a performance from happening. And then soon it will be like if you're performing at that venue, then you're an asshole. Right, right. You know, it's nonsense happening. What's the ACF for lesbian, gay, bisexual alliance. Oh, they have a lot more since I left college, but that's what I was told. Yeah, that's a problem is when you look at LGBT, which is like the accepted use of those letters. We didn't have to add college to a, in the end we were like, oh, a is now asexual and fin Taylor does a great joke where it's like they're included, but it goes, the reality is the asexuals hate the other ones. But like you're disgusting.

Speaker 3:          01:09:26       I don't care what kind of sex or having lesbians are not really excited about transgender men or transgender women rather true. There's that. There's turfs you know trans exclusionary radical feminist. No, I don't know. Busy fucking live in my life and trying to fucking dominate. You're trying to dominate. Try to dominate. Damn. I didn't know you were trying to dam. Can you fill me and more on this though? So tell me about Dominic not leave dominating. I want to write that down, but there was a big uproar. A lot of comedians started trying to like show how they were woken up and they're like, I don't think you should do it. Who have penguin very publicly quit putting her, Becca in this position was going to be in. Here's how you can tell someone who's a fucking white knight virtue. Signaler when they don't go to you saying, Hey, Tom, I'm calling you on the phone.

Speaker 3:          01:10:11       Don't do this, but I get it. I might not have your number, so if I'm tweeting at you, I'll just write at Thompson Guerra. Don't do this. If I really want to virtue signal, I'll go dot. At Thompson Goro Hey, at Thomson Reuters. So it's not just me and your followers. Everybody, anytime anybody sees, if you're listening, you see somebody not start with the APP. That is them virtue signaling on purpose and all these comics, unless they're saying something positive, they just wanted it. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's you're right. Good point. Like, hey everybody, come see Tom. You know? Yeah. You don't want to say Steve. Suppose fear. I loved you knew Netflix specials. Yeah, I'll let her the Jew hour. Yeah, it's coming. Um, it's great. It's great hour everyone. I saw it. I saw some of like tower. He's been working hard. You Buddy Milo, he's going to appear on the show. All these comics, all these people started saying, I will never go to the creek again. She put unbelievable pressure on her. They call him a Nazi club owner, Jewish. And he's also married to a gay man who's black Mack who was black [inaudible] his ass opens it up gently.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       So wait a minute, what ends up happening? So they go, we're not going to happen. Okay. So they said, we're doing this, we're not talking about, they started going to war with these fucking virtue signaler comics. Okay. Um, and then at some point, Rebecca, I talked to her a bunch because I don't, this is not my thing. I don't even want to do it. And I'm like, Becca, what you do is you stand by your comics and so you let them do whatever they want. Obviously I've been on the road, I mean I've been on the wrong side. I've had venues cancel me. Yeah. Cause of Shit like this. So I'm like, you don't want to be involved. Then Milo's people said, oh guys, you put out the, the time and date of where I'm going to be, I can't go anymore. So they moved it. So they moved to instill, did it and still did it somewhere else. Yeah, we did it. And then, okay, it's a shout out to her for not caving then. Yeah. Consider names a creek in the cave.

Speaker 6:          01:11:59       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       yeah. So that, did it go out? Oh yeah, 10 no, no. Okay. Yeah. And it's, it's, it's all, I didn't watch the whole thing, but the part with you and Milo pouring booze, it was, it was pretty funny. The next time somebody calls Milo a Nazi and me and Nazi sympathizer, they said to my face, oh maybe I'm just weird, weird cause I just saw my dad speak at the memorial. But Mike, if you're going to tell me the people who took his father, and so you need to say goodbye to your son and son, you've got to take care of the family down and watch the rest of your family fucking disappear in death is the same as that political analyst. I'm going to slap you. You should slap. I should. It's so, it's so derogatory and offensive in a way that I'm not okay with it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:41       So you can say that away from me, but if you say it to me, I'm going to, there's a lot of Shit [inaudible] that we're saying that there's not enough of those guys. You're getting smacked smack and that's what he has always said things we good snap, delirious, delirious. Completely ridiculous. It's insane. It was crazy. Is a provoca tour. He fucks with people. He pushes buttons and he does. So in the age of the Internet. Yeah, he's great troll. The thing that they got him on, which is where it all got really weird, was essentially him saying that it should be okay. What happened to him when he was molested? That he was abused, sexually molested by priest and this priest, he, you know, he would joke around and say that he was the one that pursued the priest and he was, trust me, I was the Predator like that.

Speaker 2:          01:13:32       That's how he said it is. He's hilarious. And that's what got him. It was talking about that on my show and then talking about it on this other show, wasn't it? The amazing atheist show was right. The point is that anybody who says like you shouldn't be allowed to put that person, she can't be heard anymore. That's what you're saying. But that's what it was. But it was really just his harsh critiques of Liberals and feminists that were so biting. And then you know, he actually did a podcast with Jordan Peterson recently. We talked about the, the, the molestation. I didn't see it but from Jordan's explanation it's like he's understanding now as he's older that yeah, he was

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       a victim of this thing and he was making it less and less full. Yeah. Yeah. That he was giving this guy like, like a pass that he did it to him almost. Yeah, I agree. The cricket, the cave was a great place for your comics in New York because there's always like, I hear nothing but great fun. Plus it's like they, they, they bring together young comics and like give a place to perform with no one's, it's, it's, it's, it is what the comedy store was. If you take away the side effects of the 12 plus your cost, how many seats is it? 80 on top and 1520 on the bottom. Jesus. Oh, do I walked in, I walked him.

It's like a fucking 90% chance. Oh, how much? Shit. You know, dude, that's what he told me in Hong Kong. They're like, listen, if you see, hold on. Not every man lander from mainland China shits in malls, but if you see shit in the mall, that's a mainlander. Yeah, like they're disgusting. They just shit in the mall. They just shit. Mainland Chinese people just shit in the mall, like told him I like him in the bathroom. So the ground, the ground's whole case. You're walking through the mall and you see human shit on the ground.

Speaker 3:          01:17:19       They don't know how to be Chinese doors are underrated. There's tourists in the world. Chinese stores, the worst tourists when they're, when they're saying the Trump, we're going to hold up tours and back. All the fucking travelers like please keep. They are so they just, some folks who live in rural, China's aligned to the children. You've been there but it hot these shorts. He's wide shorts with a cut down the middle. So when you're open, stand up, the cut comes together when you squat, so you don't have to fucking lift your shorts out. It comes out and then just shit away. Shit. Where they're walking. 10 year olds wearing his shorts. How do I get those pants for Sundays? What is this? Why kids keep crapping in public in China is part of their culture. Dude. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:18:07       Shit. And you can find anything online. These shits. That's true. Let's look at Burt with the fucking common sense, dude. I'm getting treated and worse doors, flip sides, acid, Chinese, tourists and not poop on the ground. Oh my God. Rolled down that for a second. Five words. Tourists. Chinese far and away number one like, like fucking Richard Pryor. Chinese replaced Americans as the worst tourists in the world. We never work. They're obnoxious. Oh my God. This is a terrible article. Although, although, have you ever been a shit in public? Apparently. Oh my God. This is on Vice Uk, vice UK vice. How care but that we're so we're reading this folks, if you hear those words, I have not said that. Yeah. I'm reading something off of a UN. The title, I'm not saying technically are, he did say everything by Chinese towards it. By far the worst tourist next day is, I don't want to say this is real and Russians tide. Why Israelis? [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:19:10       I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm missing Australians. The bogans, ours garbage people serious. I have fucking inflicted him into the world. Like go learn on their turf. Wow. Bogans row off. Why is just get drunk? I don't know. How can I get out of the army and they think they can fucking go nuts. Yeah. I don't know. But people don't like Israeli tourists. Really? Yeah. They got a reputation about him. Didn't know that Americans are way down the line. No. Americans are not celebrated in a lot of parts where you traveled to man. Very celebrated a lot of who were the only ones who tip consistently. Hardcore people like our money and the ones who travel or not the fucking fat rednecks gone and gone to the world, but sometimes they are. That's the church sometimes. So there's a lot of merit. Saves. Plenty of obnoxious Americans traveling. Yeah, but we're not in this top five. Really interesting. I would have felt, I would have assumed we'd normally shitting at the mall. I that's around town. It's a big doors. Is Insanity Dude,

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       like for you to think that other people are going to be like, oh yeah, just got to take your shit too still right here where it's like I gotta Piss it public. Things like block me, make block me around the time so you don't have to block me. I'm just gonna shit real quick. It's like we're in the woods that I got to Piss I, there's no like embarrassed I level. That's how they feel. I didn't feel, dude, they don't even worry about who cleans it up. Let it stay there. Do they lie? There's no wiping. Everybody knew that. If ever way you look to buy shit, ah, Jesus. Oh wait, you're walking. If you were to confront somebody, like right after you look the fuck did you just do, they'd be like, do you think that they would confront you with like what you just got in your car?

Speaker 4:          01:20:49       Like what do you think that it's where they're living is so overrun with people that they just shit anywhere and they don't think that anybody has an [inaudible] environment. Well now you're asking me to speak with an expert and I will not lie, but this is all night interpretation and yeah, I think they have no expectation of privacy because they're so fucking on top of each other. Their homes extremely clean. Take off your shoes before you come inside. The homes are fucking touching about is this thing like mark? I'm not, I'm saying main but there's an on the mainland, you know China is over a billion people. So you have a lot of like really poor Sean educated rural parts and like saying that somebody in that area does this. I'd be like, yeah. Are you saying that like even somebody that lives in Beijing or Shanghai who has a job or Wall Street?

Speaker 4:          01:21:36       No they don't. No they don't. So that's why the tech, not all mainlanders were shitting malls. But if you see shit in the mall, it's amazing man. Very clear. When they say kids, what age group is it? High school kids who were trying to fuck or is it like just shit talk, I'm trying to shut, I wasn't in shock. I was in Hong Kong, Singapore, in Macau. So now the mechanical, what's funny is when you were in Macau, which is obviously big casino kind of tourist destination, all the people there, they eyeball immediately who they'll tell you who's like a, a mainland Chinese person, you know, cause they can tell by the, well, that's a different type of thing where if there's, if somebody is like, do you see dudes in Macau in like Versace shades and like a Fendi and Gucci and like, I mean outfits, crazy outfits and you're like, God, what's up with that dude? And they'll be like, that's just a mainland dude who a new money. He just got rich. Wow. It's all over Macau. And we just know. And then you see that the uh, the understated person, they're like, that's a Hong Kong guy. That's old money. Yeah. Right. Oh it's like England almost. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you don't like, you not like England. They got guys that are like this or like tracksuits and water. And then you got the old posh money. All right. All we can do accents, accent, challenge. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:23:02       don't fucking side Florida. What's up guys? And fertilizer.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       I got tornadoes. Laurie. I'll say a country. You do the accent without saying the words. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Russia don't say the words. Just make the noises they make. I'm not great at accents holes.

Speaker 2:          01:23:28       Oh, don't wish. Don't do anywhere else. Any words?

Speaker 1:          01:23:36       You just heard it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:40       The Samurai speaking, Sasquatch footage. No. No. One of the dumbest things that Duncan and I did when we were doing that shot. No, no, no. We went and studied bigfoot. One of the dumbest things like Ari did the show with me and one of the things that we did when we studied bigfoot was talked to a bigfoot expert. Those plaintiffs, some audio and some of the audio. It sounds like a Samurai. It sounds like what the what and the guy was claiming that this was like a secret recording of big foot. I'm like, you can ride. It was the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life. Anything. By the way, in your conspiracy theories and like what you challenge, was there anything that you ended up going, oh, like, oh, good question. Not Dumb. Yes, really more challenge. Disease or shower Gel Jaylin's diseases.

Speaker 2:          01:24:27       A disease where people, is it more challenges? I was called [inaudible] thank you both for it. Yeah. I thought it was bullshit before cause I had read that it was bullshit and what I read was that the people would think that they had things grown out of their skin so they'd be scratching themselves and they would add fibers to their skin and take pictures of it and say, look, I've got things growing out of my skin and that, that it was a hoax. But um, then talking to a doctor who had more Jerilyn's who explained to me that there's some sort of neurotoxic effect of Lyme disease and that everyone who has more challenge also has Lyme disease. And he was a legitimate doctor in a, in a very smart guy. And he was essentially saying that mainstream science, it's rushed to prove he's going to Piss

Speaker 1:          01:25:12       [inaudible] he's already starting to be, come on man.

Speaker 2:          01:25:21       Yeah, but you're going to get us kicked off of Youtube with your dick out balls. Just cut straight to his day. Anyway, what was I saying? That that is a real disease, that this more jealous disease is what it is, is, is Lyme disease, the, there's a bunch of pathogens that come with Lyme disease. You know, it's not just the Lyme disease, it's not like a pure one, you know, like one or a zero. You have or you don't, it's a dirty tick as a bunch of fucking horrible diseases inside of its nasty little body. Would you know if you had Lyme disease? Yes. You get a bullseye like well, like looking um, uh, red mark around the area and the area hurts and then you start experiencing terrible

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       symptoms like flu, like symptoms and okay. You got to kind of bring up the re supposed to catch it quick. Oh yeah. On your show you want to brush his teeth. And he's like, he couldn't like go back and forth. It was like, what the fuck? My friend's kid got bell's palsy where his face went and don't get me started on my teacher that, that had bell's palsy in high school and they kept him out and then he came back and he was okay bro. No. But he, he came back while he still had the face paralysis. We're all like looking at this dude. We had a student a year older than me or bell's Palsy and we mocked them relentlessly. Look very [inaudible], haven't got it on stage, on stage. And his face started going on him and he had to hold his cheek over to finish his jokes that he called his brother in law.

Speaker 1:          01:26:51       He was, I think I'm having a stroke. I'm about to get on a plane and I think I'm having a stroke. The next morning his face was numb and drooped in his brother in law goes, go to the fucking doctor. Right now you're having a 20 hour stroke and it was bell's Palsy. And so what did they do about that? Nothing. Fucking nothing. Just she just wait. Just wait. If Tad it, dude, I get, I wake up. Eddie if had it too. I think it's a virus. You'd be good at it because policy palsy every fucking morning. Why? I came home later that morning. Every more ritual. Why you think of that? It's my ritual. Every morning. I got up early, I left, I thought he was doing Stallone impression. He said Bell's Palsy too. He's got it when he was young and it sometimes it doesn't go away. Whoa. And so he wrote, so we're at about 40 moths.

Speaker 1:          01:27:41       So is it affects the spelling or, yeah, I don't know if he knew how to spell it doesn't help. So basically I, she looks better now, so I hung out with him this weekend, but uh, so easy back on stage and he's back on stage and he spent like three weeks in his sister's basement just being like, it's never going to come back. My career's over. I can't go on stage. Like he tried to do a show and he said everyone was just staring at it like this. Like, oh, oh mom. So what do they do to fix it? Nothing. You just wait. You just wait until it starts coming back. He said reboot was like right your your face. So you got to get code. Um, so why do you think about this every morning, dude? Yeah. Especially when I'm getting ready for a special.

Speaker 1:          01:28:25       I think like what if I got bell's? What if? What if I get jokes to tell? The morning, the morning of my special secret time, I woke up and I smiled and I went, I beat bell's Palsy. So first thought I had Jesus Christ. How am I involved in this conversation? I can't believe I'm involved in this conversation for bell's Palsy. You know what else I forget? I think of Alopecia, this hair falling answer, everyone gets out every, there was a hanging out. I was little. Every comic at the store had it burn, had it. I met, I met at it. Everyone got it at one point and I was just was like, don't give all the hair fell

I think about alopecia to Tyson had it. Remember that's why he fought over and Mike Tyson out of like a weird circle and in his head for awhile. Yeah. Wait, you said you were going to dominate earlier. What do you do? What you're saying through like to dominate you gotta give me the context again. I know when I get up. You like dominating, dominating life. Yeah. Crushed. You have time to dominate because you don't, you know on your phone. That's what it was. Yeah.

If you're like, why the fuck do we have plastic cups? Lids, why do we have plastic?

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       You're going to show water bottle. No, don't look, why don't we have plastic straws? The reason why is because there's a fucking video of a turtle and they have a clamp. I don't know if this is the main reason, but it is for a lot of people clamped this straw in this turtle's mouth and they eventually pulled it, pulled the turtle's nose, rather it was deep in his nose. So this, watch this. Yes, she can. One of those. So see that's a, that's a strong to tell you. They got stuck in his seat. Turtle is harder. It is so much harder to watch. Things happen to animals into people. How do we not know this wasn't a night of cocaine gotten wrong? Look at that. Poor Turtle. So he inhaled, oh he's fucking good one. Oh fuck. So they realized that the straw was stuck and apparently this is not bleeding.

I was thinking it might be a fun idea that like the board no out. But here's the thing, it's like I don't live anywhere in New York. Fucking you're going to be in the and got your own shoe. You live near New York and you live near La Long Beach, but like you're going to be on the road. Oh fucking whatever. Where do people, we were dancing, art, dancing, dance.

Yeah. That's not what I'm doing. I'm pulling my feet up so that I can push down with my hips. Like, I'm the Washington Post and the other toes assume in a quadrant form. Like I'm foreign language on this, I'm doing this, I'm spreading. If I spread my feet out like more played out in quadrant, lifting my toes up instead of pointing them down. That could be you at doing that so I can lean in with my crotch. So you stretch the abductor adductor muscle guys, guys gymnastics.

Speaker 7:          01:45:25       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:45:27       Good luck. This guy breaks his hip every time he fucking gets out of the shower. Yeah, I would delay to try. How's the Israeli gymnastics? He can't do gymnastics. He won't be able to do anything with that hand for like a year. They second squeeze a ball at about 19 months. Yeah. Are you serious? Wait, where's your break? Where's the break? It's okay. So on this side it's the bone here. Chipped off and just free falling. [inaudible] it's Tom Petty there and the other one on here that they have a up con I can push in break that they're normally only see in like young children. Uh, I told him I a lot of gummy related products and he goes, that might be, that could be for sure. That could be part of it. So two different breaks. And this is from a fall or was it pretty? It was pretty useful in one children and young children.

Speaker 3:          01:46:09       They've unformed the bone. Dark, dark, developing. It's like a, it's like a compression pounds don't form, right? Possible break at 13 months. Yes. Our fold. Yeah. Sorry, what already was hauling ass? Okay. Gymnastics is out. Literally. This is good challenge. Let's look at this. And he broke his arm. Yeah. Ski Challenge. Fucking shredding shit in front of him. Shutting the normal would be the challenge if we had a ski challenge. We couldn't do it in October. I guess it was how much you guys could eat my dust and a black diamonds. Do you go down both times? Yes. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. You like a legit skier? No, I'll skip this for you. Ari. Ari is already in the woods, is fearless and he can go down anything but it looks disgusting. It's like, it's like watching your parents fought. It is like he snow plows the entire time just like pizza pie like this, but he hauls fucking ass.

Speaker 3:          01:47:03       You haul, ask no plan. Six hours. The miles and hour Joe. I see a bubble. I'm like, I'm hitting there and I fucking jump. Get Air.

Speaker 3:          01:47:46       Ah. Oh my God. I'm gonna Pass. Ah. Oh my God. We have to, we have to figure what out, man. I really think that that direction I'm going in with hip hop dancers the right direction because it Joe, it puts you on our plane field. What is your planes? Hit play, dance explained to me this. No one's playing field. They don't like it. It's something someone's already done. That's why even if I did this, I would have to go further. I don't like about the uh, hip hop dance challenge. No, I liked that one. We play that again. The running one. Yeah. I feel like we already, we already know how it's going to go. We know how it's going to go dominate true track miles. Is that what we would do, right? Yes. We get the rocks or no, it's going to go. Yeah. So that's, that's the way, way down. How do you guys think it's going to go? No, there's just no thinking. We already know how it's going to go. Thank you. Nope.

Speaker 3:          01:48:40       Cycle over here would fucking do. He'd logged. I'd be, which one? 2100 miles. Everyone's going to die and then he weighs a fucking buck 35 so halfway through the month he'd be like, you know, I can actually do 10 out of fucking chop now. And then you'd break down and they get mad at me for doing steroids. He brought me up at the comedy store. So that was the Lance Armstrong comedy. There was so wrecked over contest cause he was on steroids. That was your introduction. Is that what you said? The room just this comic. So funny. He wanna he want to fit fitness challenge by on steroids with his friends. I remember being with already when he realized you were using steroids in the car and he goes, not steroids, testosterone replacement therapy on top of that, if I actually use steroids, it would be even more ridiculous the way. What do you fucking chick drinking over here that will take it? Let's do

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       this. I said we do an archery chairman now. Hear me out. Oh my God, we could have the least amount of time spent with your kids aren't wins. Uh, I'd probably beat him. Hang out with your kids. Okay. I honestly, I'll, for real, for real. No joke. I don't mind the phone thing. I'm stepping out catching on. I don't mind the fitness hip hop challenge. Oh, it would be a good weight loss thing. Just the same as yogurt was like a ridiculous thing about doing it to get you actually want to lose weight. Huh? Lose [inaudible] just tell you what you you, yeah, my skin and it's probably a lot of cause the booze too and whatever else I do, but like my skin looked good, I looked good, I look good. I didn't hate the yoga. Yeah. To be honest with you. For you.

Speaker 4:          01:50:38       I'll tell you that. Another component you mentioned earlier that was, I did this for like maybe 12 day stretch at the end of the weight loss challenge was nothing but water and that makes you feel fucking amazing after it. What do you mean? Because I just wasn't, we were doing the weight loss battle battle and I just didn't drink anything but water for like almost two weeks and like everything changes the way you look, the way you feel. Only drank water. Terrible things dragging him right now.

Speaker 1:          01:51:06       Should see. I want to, I was making a joke about my, my right arm, just put shit in my body that I don't want it to do is got a mind of his own. He's just like, Yo, what the fuck you doing? Asshole drinking.

Speaker 4:          01:51:17       Yeah. Diet coke, coke, orange juice, anything but water. Right. Most people. Yeah. I mean you're, you're, you're usually for me, I mean I can get by on a lot of combination of coffee and water, color, water be fine. I mean I still will have some other things but I don't do it a lot. Jessica, when you just do water though, we you just drink water. You definitely, after you get over the, what's it called, like the, you know, withdrawal or whatever. The other thing is, you definitely feel good man. I went a day without caffeine by the end of the dad headache. I'll get, I get, I remember that. I have a headache. Yeah, me think I got a real headache, which are all symptoms. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. I'm telling you not this year, next year, whatever. When when you do get off your phones, you're going to have those same withdrawal symptoms. No, you're right.

Speaker 1:          01:52:03       You're right. For sure. I got back on my phone. I was on the tour bus off my phone. We were texting about some bullshit and then I was like, I'm hopping on Twitter and I got on Twitter and it just, it became my life. Right. Again, like it just, I like dipping. I cannot dip tobacco. Why? Because if I do, you're right back, right back in.

Speaker 4:          01:52:20       Yeah. For a long time. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I miss it so much. Florida. We'll do it to you. That's why I started to it. But you drink. But people who are dealing with after you dipping's worse for you then, then definitely not good for you. Good for you. I love that fucking burn right here. Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:52:40       you slap people know you ain't thinking that good. It's a nice little signal. It's a, you got a big fat and fat lip, a dip. You let them. People know you're making a rash and people know you're strong. You're ready for anything. Zach Galifianakis used to go on stage at the Improv of the dip in his mouth did. Anyways, Carolina got a fucking, I swear to God, he'd go on with a big dip and it's not just spit and he tells the people that he had didn't get [inaudible] was so much fucking fun. Yeah, he was a great though. Miss him as a conduit is hilarious. Did you see him at Brody's? Oh my God. And Oh, he brought Brody at a party. Nobody's calling. Jeez. Probably past, yeah. I got Zach to tack was amazing. And he was, how exactly how king, yes, but go ahead.

Speaker 1:          01:53:29       No, his, I mean, his stand up was, it was all amazing. I used to love watching him super tight with Brody, Miss Air Jack, my wife. My wife doesn't think anything's funny. Zach Alpha next had a joke that I, to this day, I think is just a great joke. You know, it's time to get lunch. You know it's time to do laundry when you get out of the shower and dry off with the shoe to fucking just great. Then I'll never forget where he was. Like dork fabrics, like, what's your name? Joe called and it's like, uh, what, what's your name, Bert? Fuck you.

Speaker 1:          01:54:02       I don't know where at the Improv go. Paul Shat. He was funny. It was at Brody's ceremony. Not as funny. He's Jeff Roberts, Jeff Ross, Jeff Ross, Mike God. Jeff. Well Jeff, but, but well Zach's was like touching and sweet and funny and it was like everything you'd want at Ross just came up there and just see everybody was so kind of, you know, sad, intense and emotional opened. His opening joke was so savage and hilarious. Brody's Brody's Brody's high school friends had gone up like seven of them and their school and then friends from baseball, like telling all these like, so there was, you know, you see Zach and then like three of these friends and then another comic and then like three of these friends. And then Jeff just went up and he goes, uh, you know, after hearing so many of Brody's high school friends come up and speak about them, I know why he killed himself, the place of just his body.

Speaker 1:          01:54:58       He had to wait like 30 seconds to talk cause everybody just fucking, it was easy. It was much. That's the, that's what really comedy is best at. Definitely Jeff is, he's so good at so yeah, that's his world. Boston the best. He's the best at it. Yeah. Fuck so no hip hop dancing boys. But I don't know dude. I honestly, what you're going to see Joe, is you're going to see an onslaught of people online going to Joe hip hop dancing, thought about I, this is where you and I differ. I'm not going to see shit. That's why I'm so happy. Go ahead and give him positive and locking. Let me see. Pop and lock to pay its way out the door.

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       You ain't got to like vanilla ice. Hey, take my care much about that with you. Ah, so it should be something that none of us are happy with. Not at all. I'm not happy with this show. I think, I think the fun thing about Chubb Rocktober when we first did it was that we were all miserable together. Joe Wasn't so miserable, but like me, you and Tom would all just commiserate. That was fun. Well, I didn't like being sober. It was weird and uh, I didn't like, um, the, uh, the weird dreams and I was having, when I was going through Tfa, THC withdrawals when my rem sleep was kicking in, that's what I've realized. That t that TAC definitely suppresses rem sleep. Definitely. You think it does 100%. It's proven. It's proven. It does. It does something weird. Your sleep and a math doctor, Matthew walkers, a sleep doctor.

Speaker 3:          01:56:37       It's best way to describe it. Right? So I listen to that podcast, crazy podcast, but you know, he did, you talked about it. The mechanism, like what, what THC does, it helps people go to sleep, but there's certain parts of the sleep that you're not getting booed. I'd love to. There's an officer, there's an argument that, that not getting it, that not getting that sleep is okay. That you're, you're getting plenty of sleep because you're, you're the reason why THC puts you in that dream. You recovering and you get, there's an argument that somebody made online that, I don't know if it's correct. Some someone wrote an article about it that, that that is okay to not get that. That's a good point. Whatever kind of sleep that came from the THC or let's see who can sleep the most in October. I think leave that idea.

Speaker 3:          01:57:17       Love that idea. Most of the hours sleep and you take ambien. No, no, no. Do you take anything to go to sleep? No. I'll take a Xanax every now and then. My, my cardiologist told me never to take them. So I'll get a prescription for 30 for a year and I won't use them. He tells you never take them cause I take 30 no, no, no. He gave me a prescription. But you didn't use it. He goes, I'll take them. They melt your brain. Oh my God. Yeah. You know what's so funny is they do melt your brain. You can tell. So if you take one the next two days, you know when you're young, I remember morning radio, like old school morning radio. When you go in, you have to be on, on to go to the next subject and slide your joke in and you're like leaving and going, God damn and I'm sharp.

Speaker 3:          01:57:57       Take a Xanax and that doesn't happen for two days. You can't jump in and conversation like that. Oh Wow. So I won't fuck. I noticed it because I was taking them and I just stopped and I was like, Oh, I'm a lot sharper. Just fucking nothing. So like if you would go on stage and have to ad Lib something, you just wouldn't have it in. Yeah. First time I ever took one I got on a plane. I'm thinking, cause I used to have a drink on the plane and start writing jokes. I took a Xanax and all these are going to flow out of me and I just sat there staring at the paper going like my brain's turned off. All the fucking scary thoughts are gone. Fuck taken. What? Xanax? Yeah, that's a great one. I believe I have to pee again for real. Yeah. I do too many podcasts in a row. We'll I do two in a row. I drank like 18 bottles of water. I'm in love with lamps, Armstrong's fucking coffee. It's Laird Hamilton's quality coffee. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:58:47       coffee I've ever had. How's he? So it's, it's actually as an r in there. Turmeric, turmeric, turmeric and what else is it? I didn't know it at an r in there until like a week tomorrow. It's always sounds like tumeric. That's, I thought it was termed rubric. I thought it was too Marette. Yeah, come by in the morning. Coffee and take off. Is that cool? Yeah. Yeah. Anytime. So good luck. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, let's, let's put parameters around them because there's so many times I want to come over here and just do bench press for anytime you want. Where Road here? Yes. Joe says every once in awhile, several take advent. He'll be like, whatever, come to UFC or whatever you want that someone would be like, can I get every single one this year? Like fog. But that's a [inaudible] have been people who do abuse things. Like I've had people to say, hey man, I want to come to the UFC.

Speaker 3:          01:59:28       Oh yeah, sure. Can I get eight tickets? Like, hey for eight fucking tickets now. Fine. I wish there was a gym membership here. What to Rug in enterprise and let me know. Let me know and I know, but you can do it at what? Journal? Podcasts. Like the guys, the security guys, they work out. Just go work out and see them on there. It's like fuck it. It's like watching alien here. What do you like? Where are they in the ship? You can like see them everywhere. It's so cool here, man. Rad. Dude, I want to create this for myself. You can. I'll help you. I'm talking to my promoter about it. That guy, what's his name again? Roger. Gotcha. He's a great guy. His name.

Speaker 3:          02:00:17       Oh, you know what? This place was missing a gun range. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm going to go to one like one of them gun ranges where the fucking paper comes out. Yeah, we do. There's a, there's a place here that does a, what's it called? Laser tag? No, no, no. I placed it does, what's it called that does a training. Tactical training. Yeah. Watts. You're going [inaudible] going. Yeah, and Simi Valley. You guys want to come? Yeah, I think that might be the place to go training. That might be any of that. But that's it. Yeah. Reggie and I are going to do it and then we're going to do a podcast afterwards. So did he invite you to do it at Reggie's from Montana? You know, he's like, he knows God. Can I tell you something? Have you ever seen him perform live? It's crazy. His music just perform. Yeah. Just like on a 13 him, you ever see him do a show? Crazy. You will feel like what you do is nothing is not a talent. Like is not as skilled. I'm not kidding. Yeah, I've seen, I saw this dude do a, this is years ago. This is like at least seven years ago. Yeah. Maybe eight years ago he did that 10 at most 15 minutes set and it was so unbelievable that he got a, like a prolonged standing ovation. I fucking 10 minutes set like, you know crazy. Your 10

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       minutes set has to be, what was he doing dude? He was like just improvising songs on the spot and then you know, he, he would do that thing where he would make a certain sound and then with the machine you tap it and then loops and then start building it. And he would do that and then he would just have like a funny aside about something then take it back. But the, the songs he was building in the moment, we're so like, it wasn't like he was going like, you like that. I mean it was like a full orchestra. Yes. And it was like you see it and you go, there's something about musicians that when you can see a certain musician where you like, you don't view a comedian where you go like, oh my fucking God, I cannot believe the level of talent to that person.

Speaker 4:          02:02:22       You might think they're really funny or laugh a lot, but you're not going to be like, I've never seen something like that. Right, right, right. With music, I think that that can happen and he's that everybody up at Bonnaroo, a place where everybody was bombing, just attend. It's not for comedy anyway. Got Everybody on their feet. Like he just has a power. Yeah. He's like, he's like that. Yeah. Super Nice guy too. But you're super [inaudible] puts you in the crowd. Like it was not talking to you. You're just, you're also like now you're standing up and doing whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I talked to somebody that went on a tour with him like around that time and it was like four, four of them a night, you know, like doing like 10 cities together. And I was like, what order did you guys pick? He was like, what do you fucking think last fall?

Speaker 4:          02:03:08       Someone who's like really good at music. Cause if I go just talk. Yeah. They used to have a problem with that, with middle acts like that. That was one of the things that happened with um, with uh, Mitch Hedberg said Mitch Hedberg was on the road and he had the Middle Act was a guy was doing like wraps. He had like wraps and songs and sync things. He would sing and he was crushing. And then Hedberg we're going afterwards and Edward's like super deadpan and that is the worst scheduling ever. Like who fucking book? Do you ever have a Middle Act who in a club who just stayed in middle act but for like 15 years but became super proficient at doing 20 minutes and you're like all that stress I can do. Oh yeah, it'd be like a guy who was like, you know, he became an older guy. You know what I'm talking about? Oh Man. But it's like two days.

Speaker 1:          02:04:04       Johnson, Roy Johnson, Roy [inaudible]. I don't think he's not standing anymore. What's your promoters? [inaudible] was a Munster all stage in Tampa and you could no fucking follow that guy. He was a monster. He quit doing comedy celled cars and Tulsa now. Yeah, he was. You could not the bottles that mother fucker saved Tripoli, Tripoli and him had beef because they did a show together and there was a secret shopper in, in the audience. He's hired

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       secret shoppers to rate the community. Tampa and then Roy Roy aid, I mean, yeah, no, he does. I remember I had him, he was a hard guy to Paul. You've worked with them and to those guys like I'm better than the headliner and you're like, dude, I can't disagree with you 100% right. Yeah. Well that's usually the things don't go right when you're keyed into that, like why don't you get in and on Thursday you see that it definitely raises your game for the whole weekend. Yeah, for sure. Oh for sure. Because you'll see it and that guy will have that. He'll be the guy that stayed in that city. Fuck. Did he quit and start selling cars? If he's that funny, cause it was a feature [inaudible] on the head. He probably, he probably, if I remember, I probably didn't start at like 20 or 22 and he was a little older.

Speaker 4:          02:05:20       What kind of also it's like wanting to stay in town. Well I think, I think, I don't know, relationship always make it happen, Tom Friends with Roy. But no, I think that it was the thing that you get addicted to murdering. Mm. And you don't grow past murdering and you don't go like, I'm going to go up and take chances. Someone above the headline or off stage. No, I'm not shitting on Roy, but he just destroyed. But I don't think he ever took the chance was like, I'm going to go out and bomb tonight and see if I can figure something out. You know? I think that's ultimately what happens with the features. There's a lot of the men I worked with all of them. Yes. Some pro features for sure. And prophy. I had one, I remember who he was. Uh, he, he's the story of the guy who was headlining in those clubs for like a decade or more.

Speaker 4:          02:06:03       Didn't like break out, break out, but obviously it was, he was like a proficient comedian then like you know, has like always has like somebody has like personal stuff happen and then it's like family stuff and you know, for whatever reason then they're like still in it. But now they've been doing it like 25 years and then just needed to work. So it would take middle weeks. I mean, you know those dudes would fucking hurt you. Oh yeah. Dude, for sure guys who really knew how to crush knows basically they knew local references and then they're just like, and they've been doing it for imagine 25 years and they're like, just do 20 and and do it for like 10 weeks in a row of those things are assassins foster care. If you're tired of the material that I was like, I'm sure kill, kill, kill your cocktails. Yeah. The Boston guys for sure, because those guys do 15 to 20 a night. They do 1529 and then they would do it like three times.

Speaker 2:          02:06:50       I'm in a row and then bring up Billy crystal flip. I'm not joking. Like Billy crystal ain't shit. Next calm. He stopped that way. A lot of guys did. They set them up. It's rude. They set up these like big name headlines because Dale in a lot of it was like jealousy. This fucking guy thinks she can come here. Yeah. Yeah. And they would, they would set them up, Bang, Bang, Bang. They would put their biggest hitters, Steve Sweeney, Kevin Knox, Don Gavin, Bang, Bang, Lenny Clarke, boom, boom, boom. And then these poor bastards would come in from out of town and these guys will talking all this Boston talk and then you've got a bullshit ass act anyway. You know you're just kind of drifting on you just in between movies. So you do a little comedy. God, make yourself feel good. Go Up, see your adoring fans. Hey yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       I'm just going to fuck around in Boston. I'll just go down there and I don't really have an act right now. Piecing it together and then he watch Gavin slash Sweeney smashing. The fucking room is falling apart and you see these poor guys like the look in their eye knowing they were going to certain death. Nothing worse than following a crossover black act crossover like crossover black guy criss crossed up played a white audiences. Oh were you just go up and, and you're young and you're like 32 for the race. Taking the marketing fields where it feels right. I don't know if it is, but I'm still listening. I'll just say his name across bt would fucking, I can't hold my piss anymore. Sorry. Can't push a bottle right there. Do you think, do you think the hardest that you like the hardest active fault, would it be like bt, bt guys? Hardest hos. Okay. Hardest Act to follow this [inaudible] always do this but also the place, so just to give you an example, when I'm talking about falling, Mike Marino got a fucking fucking cop convention, you know what I mean? I got it. Okay, go ahead. I'm going to tell you the hardest weekend I ever had in my entire fucking life. Yes. I go to, I go to Miami and still believe you. Nope. Already. No I don't because like I always saw him fucking like, he's one of those guys that could

Speaker 1:          02:08:51       just at least kill. Let's do well afterwards. I get booked in Miami, it's my first headlining week for the Improv's and I don't sell any tickets and they give me a call and they said we need to bring in another comic who is already in town to help you sell tickets you doing right now. What are you doing? I'm just taking my shoes off. And your socks off. I don't know dude. These fucking mushrooms.

Speaker 3:          02:09:11       She started, I thought they were [inaudible]. Okay. I was like, I'm sorry, I forgot that. I was like, this is insane. And they're like, oh yeah, the shoes and socks off you pissing at the table. You're taking the fucking socks off. Oh, all right. Sorry. So you're in Miami please. I do want to hear this. I just was super strapped again. Keep going. So you're in Miami. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. What happened?

Speaker 1:          02:09:36       They got another, here's another comic in town and you got, and he's going to co head line with you. But the problem is he's already brought his own feature cause he was, had, he thought he was going to headline. So who was it? I'll tell, I'll just tell. I'll give you the line. I, okay, so they go. So we've cut the host. So we got your feature, his feature him than you in Miami in the heyday of Miami. Yeah. The first day, I don't know him, I've never met this. This is like 85 yep. They go, the breakdown, the host is going to do a 15 the feature's going to do 15 he's going to do 40 you're going to do 40 okay. Right. That's a long show your life. This was the intern announcements. And imagine that the hardest guy was to follow, especially in Miami where everyone's Spanish speaking. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:10:21       Steve, could I be in y'all, Bert Kreischer dude, I bombed harder than I've ever bombed in my life. I mean Miami sweat dripping off my chin onto my shirt. I don't say that to enable to bring, I failed on that whole set and I brought a black guy on stage and I brought a, a Cuban guy on stage and I fuck, I go, this is where the guy pulled his dick out. No, that's the different night. But I said to him, I go, Ugh, I'm going to just, I go, your people don't understand me. So I'll say the joke and you translate it to your people. And so then she was sitting on stage with me. So I go, I was talking to this girl and the black guy goes, man, I'll spin game at this bitch. And the place went nuts and I sent it to the Spanish guy. He just said it in Spanish. I mean I put up, I put blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever, and it's fucking destroyed my whole act that way. Whenever I had a joke I'd have them translate it. They said and stay with you. The whole sat on my stage for 35 minutes and drank Tequila with me. That's good. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:11:20       you're not going to figure it out, man. I've seen for being you to straight course. He did. Of course Freud number that you have with your palms and you played it for everybody. Tom's kind of have a half memory of that and you know me, I'm selling hot. Yeah, but I mean I played like clips or like I'm better than anybody. I wouldn't think it was good. Tom. Tom, you've ever sat in the back of a room with that was not good. How about Sacramento? That's the fucking worst though, was the fun punchline with it. What does it, no, it was called the laugh laugh unlimited last five minute ones. Yeah, I like that place. Good spot. When I was there I was like, like you know what the worst thing about I got bomb a bomb on a Friday night is and that you bomb on the early show and you can't believe how hard you just bought.

Speaker 1:          02:12:11       Like it's life altering. He bomb hotter on the late show. Oh my. They're both sold out. So it's not like eight people. It's like Oh my dad to the gills man. What was the catalyst? The catalyst. I mean he got me out cause I remember that. I was like, I remember everything my life tonight. Like after you know Jesus, it was that bad. But then what was, what started it? What started the bus started? The bomb was the opening joke cause I was just like, by the way, by the way, before you tell your opening joke, Tom is great with feeling uncomfortable in the moment and taking it to the next level. We're in Hawaii with Russell Peters. The one thing they say is, do not mention negative shit about the Hawaiians. Tom's opening joke. Do you remember it? And they said, island life slow. I didn't know they were talking about your metabolism's.

Speaker 1:          02:12:55       Holy Shit. You guys are fat. You do the same shit in Australia. Richard. He's like that first word. Don't mention Japanese people, man. I got lost on base today. Luckily I ran into a Japanese guy. He pointed me out. They know everything about this base is over there drinking his own pissed. Oh my God, you got me for fucking fraction of a second. I was like, no, he didn't at it. I was like, he's really locked, is fine. He's drink his own piss. So wait, how did your mom go in Sacramento to the Sacramento bomb was dirt. It was the month after the month after hurricane.

Speaker 4:          02:13:31       So I opened with a joke. I don't remember the wording of it, but it was like how there were, um, there's reports of people raping people in the aftermath. And I was like, yeah. I was like, I opened, I was just like, you know, nothing like, uh, seen dead bodies float by that makes me want to fuck somebody, you know. And then I just kind of like riff about like, you know, dead people and then being like fuck. And it would eat so much shit and then I would go, you know, you have the thing, you're like, well I just go to my act now. Like I'll just go to like, cause it was like, it was already too late and I would bomb for the full, the patching. And the funny thing is they made the bowl shows. Yes. Tell you what are you going to go?

Speaker 4:          02:14:12       There's something to this. This is funny. I was like, turn, this is the why and nothing like seeing a dead person on a TV floating by them. It's just the timing, the timing is off that fucking, the club lady came, Leslie, you don't like your new feature at a Clem. I remember she came up, she goes, they man, the bomb feels so bad. Then you're sweating so hard and you're like, man, this emotionally just taxing. Right. You're just like, God damn right. And I walk off stage and I run like indoor. She goes, I thought you were supposed to be funny. Oh fuck she, she goes to music read and I go, what? And she was like, you're supposed to do 25 you did 23 and I was like, I fucking all right. And then like that's the first show. Then the second show literally is worse and an inconceivable way is worse.

Speaker 4:          02:15:01       Did you try to save that joke again or try to open with it again? This work and then I ate so hard. Then I, here's Iheart, I eat it. I eat it so hard that I'm middling and the MCS like, damn dude, you fucking suck. Like he's like, he's like, he's like, you're like, he was just like, it was that big dude. Yeah. He was like, he was just like, God damn, I've never seen anything like this. Fuck. I was like, yeah, he was jovial. You're, you feel like big lots. Yeah. It wasn't my God. And then the next day I was like, I don't know how I'm going to do this, man. And Burt coast couldn't give you one piece of advice and I go, yeah, he goes, open different, just do whatever you want, but just opened on a different joke. I was like, all right man.

Speaker 4:          02:15:45       And at the time I swear to you, that fucking first show Saturday by the best set that I've ever had, like unbelievable set did. The lady goes, oh, okay, no, no, no. She goes, uh, I, I was, I felt redeemed, right? Like I fucking destroyed and I will, I mean like the MCS, like Jesus. He said, I've never seen a turnaround like that. You know? It's like when I'm like, this feels like I walk around and I see her and I go like, then she goes, what? I didn't hear anything. I go, she pretended like she didn't know shit if she watched, I remember I grabbed her. She kept coming up to me going, you said he was funny. You brought them with you. And I was like, trust me. The best part about his bomb was Tom used to have about, I lost amount of weight. I lost during the sweating, all show you some longer

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       hair. And comb it back so it would be up right. And as he bombed, it starts to fall and then it starts to get wet and then to run down, I'm soaking wet. He's great. He was like, I jumped in a pool, like I was fucking soaking wet that feel when you're eating shit, it's not like anything else on earth. I remember that. I remember that. Like he was up on stage and somebody yelled at him like some late and he's like, well you're a fucking dumb cut. You said that. Yeah. And the, and the room was like cut room turned out. Yeah, they'll turn on your car then you want come back. I remember him winning the back. I was like, God damn. I used to have some uh, some uh, quick go tos on that. Yeah. Favors. Hey honey, your mouth, uh, God made your mouth for one thing and it's not talking.

Speaker 3:          02:17:13       That's good. God. What does that mean? Math, I suck. So we say that's a joke. It's a irreproachable. I would love to hear like a feminine. This you say, I should know this thing's flashing. Flashing red. This one is too. Oh, the recording is on. You guys both had mushrooms said no, they don't usually flash. Yeah, I'm really do much. Oh Ass. Are you the shoes off his shoes off? I said the mushrooms are to be shoes or something. Then they got me a little bit for eat them during the show ended right before the show. Right before you start. Right. I wasn't enough though. What it likes essentially the Mo. It's nice. It gives you like a little nice thing but like my palms are sweaty and I'm fucking out of it. Yeah, definitely sweating. Huh? Is that what it is? You get your palms get sweaty guys. Arm Spaghetti, Spaghetti rap battle rap battle rap battle rap daddy for help. No, listen guys, I'm serious. It's either, it's either type, no hip hop challenge.

Speaker 3:          02:18:14       Physically difficult though. It's not totally different, but nobody do nothing. That's the point already. You want to watch people do stuff. Have your play the hurt since when is it about anybody else other than us? No, but people did tune in. If they like it, they like it, but you don't do it for other people like, yeah, hold on, joke. Don't send to an artist talk and shot at first watching, watching, doing yoga. I use Instagram challenges is you're holding your breath challenge like goes, he really holding his breath. I don't fucking know. Well Burt, everyone doesn't have to be in on every goddamn thing you do everyday until you get a shirt. Hey guys, going to bring you in here. Ooh, Shit. Champion. This

Speaker 8:          02:18:57       the, she used be shit on Instagram first ever. Probably.

Speaker 3:          02:19:05       What did the girl say when you're, you're boasting when I pose it like dad's mom [inaudible] funny that you don't use the n word. Oh my God. He's got a girlfriend and just trying to stream and provide for the family. Yeah. Fuck them. They don't realize I've leveraged their futures for our income right now. Yes, that's what it is. Yeah. You paid a hefty price. Oh Dude. Yeah. My kids do not like that. I've talked that much about them. Well, you should probably not have done that. I'm trying to, he's like 20 fucking 20 Joe early on. He was like, really? You mentioned your kids. You're like, yeah, what's the, what's whatnot? I was told to wait a long time ago. My kids are fucking stupid. He said, that's what he said. He said, they're not even gonna know. I go, what if people come out to in the mall and they said, Hey, your dad was talking about them like idiots.

Speaker 3:          02:20:03       Oh my God. I called George on the phone on stage the other day. Everyone was yelling island. They're like, no, I'm Georgia. The smart ones. Oh, don't, don't look. Hey [inaudible] 20 I was being honest. I didn't know another way to do stand up. I get it. I get it. Yeah, you do it one way is just fine for most of the world. That's the thing. Like most things are fine for most of the world. It's just a small percentage of people that are just wired all fucked up. I guess we gotta. We gotta go. I gotta go soon. It's up to 10 to six. Yeah. We gotta go. No, I think you're going to see the law online. Can we see anything? Well, I'll stand to you and I'm not going to look. They walk your number. I'm telling you. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:20:47       look at it. No music. Just show her videos. If we're going to do it, we should break dance. Go to stance elements. Stan. Tell events and what's, watch some of these guys do it. Here's a video shot. Faker. Chet faker. Oh fuck. This is great. Yeah. Some dance. Look, I'm a real dance glazer. It's, I'm telling you this. How will shoot it. I'm a fan of this girl. Dee Glazer's her name. She's a choreographer. She got blonde hair. Give her Nelly, Nelly, uh, uh, from the loop and I'm proud of you can't, we can't play it. Play the music. Just watch her dance. Okay, let's watch it. [inaudible] we'll be doing Joe. And I really think you're gonna like, what are you selling this? I'll get this. I'll get this job. I'm already out. No, Joe. Yeah, right here. Fuck the glazer. She's like cardinals fan. Yeah. Country Grammar first. This is us. Joe, anything that doesn't require you to lose weight. I'm not looking for bodies in fucking great show. This is us doing these. Her name? Her name's Dee Glaser. Okay. She's great. She's great. She's great. And this will be us. Imagine how much fun it would be when you do it though. Cause you're fat. Yeah, I'll be, do you think you could learn to do this? 100% you do things. You can do a fucking split. You remember that thing?

Speaker 3:          02:21:57       You could try it. You get a hold on. You think you could do this. I could get my body to move that way. If someone taught me and I spent the amount of time on a month to month one month, no, not as good as her. I think in one month you could be better than all of us. Oh, I would definitely be better than you. And that's all that counts, right? Oh Jo Jo Jo. Come on. This is me and Tom and you and Ari. We do a s one altogether. I'm like, he likes the belt brow exit from a, what's it called? In the back. All right. Do you think you could learn to do lists? Look over here, Bert. No. Huh? No, not getting rid of this. So tell me a challenge that you think is fair for that fits everybody. Everybody should weigh in right now.

Speaker 3:          02:22:36       What do you think it should? You don't have the parents in this cause that place, that place like that. It's right near my apartment. I walk by on the way home from not working out and I looked through the window at them doing crazy dances like that. I understand the challenge would be I'm crazy and I'm going to keep the grandma mobile moment. I'm going to keep this. This is mine. I liked this. I liked having it. Look at that. Let's go for it at that. You never can get this bird. I'm getting it. If we do hip hop, you think so? You're not with the weight loss challenge you by man. By the way, if I may, you should get a weight loss challenge belt and I think we should probably make one. That'd be a great idea. Horrible fucking idea. It's a great idea.

Speaker 3:          02:23:16       Um, get on it, Jamie. Order it up. We need a weight loss challenge with branded tour bus champ too. I want a marathon bell. Okay. He's the only one I've tried that they give you like a button or something when you, when a man or you run it. They do you know why? Cause your promoter had one. I saw him when I was one of them erasers that go on top of a pencil that nobody ever uses. Triangles through writing. Pens are so crazy and you use up that erase or boy you need an external check cam hands on the phone call campaigns right now. He'll be, he'll tell you how it's spirit now listen, what about, what about, uh, if we let this hold on and I had the fucking greatest idea, the greatest idea, whole bracket. When you remember if, if we do with the hip hop challenge we need, no one's going to be there to cheer anybody in Queer that the judges, it has to be just us if you want.

Speaker 3:          02:24:16       Yeah, you care. Can't quit the judges. Are you allowed to say that anymore? Yeah, I think that's probably language. I don't know. It's in the, my friend Miriam Nakamoto snacks snack, a Modo snacks. So just us and then you get actual judges don't know us to decide. Yeah, you have to really make a place. Three people learned it with Joe. I think you just gotta say alternative alternative. Let's come up with something where we don't need judges. I don't want to bring judges in cause then we have other people like then it's going to get gross weight. Maybe it's a bad idea to bring in judges one judge, because it just happens the power over to other people in our organization too. I don't want to even talk to other people. That makes sense. I'm trying to cut people out of my life. I'm not trying to add to hip hop dance judges.

Speaker 3:          02:25:04       I don't have the time. The only debt, the idea. I like Ari's idea. No social media for a year. Except I have an ambulator run. You could run it. Just go Jamie, post it. We have no video post it. I don't trust him. No, you'd have to. You'd have to give it up. I'm going to be in charge. I got him over there. He's sneaky. He's sneaky. He checked my dms. Why don't we eat it for Tony [inaudible]. Who's the best? I'll see you at the STL. Them Dick Pics. Common my way. Yeah, the judges is a real thing. You're right. Judges is a real thing, but I think we're in the right direction with hip hop dance. Why? Cause it's your invention. No, no, no. I just think it's something silly. [inaudible] you lose again. There should be a real penalty for how it be a real repercussion for you in the first place. I don't like Jolan top dance and we'll put in the word. This is a good one. If you come in last, you give us, spread it out collectively. $1 million.

Speaker 3:          02:26:03       Well, you're doing better now. It's 12 bucks, champ. You've got that blog tour, bus champ. You have to think about that. Just sign up for, you're not going to lose if those are the stakes. What is the common division? Wait, hold on. Hold on one second. Let's let aside, let's talk tour. Bus Champ comes at a price. Dude, my bus was so fucking sick. You can't just be tour bus champ. His or his fight. I was taught about chip. Listen, listen, but Bert, do you understand that this is strange, that you keep failing at these things and yet you keep bragging every time we get together, contemplate, have so much success when it comes to you guys that I think sometimes you guys forget about it. I was trying to share, hold on a minute. I was talking about sham admitted. Admitted me. [inaudible] Nelson Alive, don't you? What do you don't talk to?

Speaker 3:          02:26:52       You're not the tour bus champ. The bus that I was on this week is better than anybody else on the tour bus championship was going on already asking me who's tour bus trip. Let's say why it's me. Of course I'll come cause I have the better bus. Did you ever take a picture of your bus and put it online? Yeah. Oh really? Yeah. You and you had fucking Photoshop to a hundred times. No. The outside of your bus doesn't count. Tom, the inside of your bus that looked like a prison yard. It just looked like a prison yard too. Did Not, did it not have a broken transmission? No Internet TV's that didn't work. You had no internet on your toy box, and I want you to pause for a second and imagine a world where the thing that you're bragging about when you have been called out for failing to challenges in a row heart, first thing you talking about is this.

Speaker 3:          02:27:40       We're not even in the shape of the bus that you drive around debt. I didn't start talking about champ. He started tour bus. Much is prepared. What's was the transmission bad? We'll then I win a flat tire. Well then I had a jazz show. I'm Leonardo Dicaprio at the front of and titanic. We, we had a challenge who came at last told me somebody who was like, what are the repercussions for you fucking pussing out. Well, I'm not putting out fucking founded. The reasons why I have this right here is because I read about you saying that you're going to put it on your mantle piece and I'm like, that's never done. You're Mickey mantle piece. That's [inaudible]. Joe, can you entertain?

Speaker 1:          02:28:25       Can you entertain a circumstance in which you think Burt could beat you? Hip Hop may make again like the old hustler make an even game. It could be anybody's at this point

Speaker 3:          02:28:35       look a pool games or no, no, no. When I play pool, but like I'm not going to finish up on the challenge that where it's like you've got to make it the way back to be. I'd have to have some form of lymphoma really wrong with me, a physical thing, but he'd moved so well. Maybe you move like the wind is something I've seen. You move that Christopher Cross on Terry. Shiloh couldn't move better than you and you really can meet with Matt de Berg. There was days where I was, I was like, man, I'm tired. And then I thought about you already standing there. You took your socks off, you fucking mushrooms. We took some mushrooms and you forget. Or both. I gotta go, man, it feels good. That's what are we doing? What are we going to have? We don't have a agreement. Yeah we should.

Speaker 3:          02:29:23       And also you do need some repercussions for fucking blowing it back. [inaudible] I forget. I'm the only one that ran a marathon too, but it doesn't seem like you are willing to face reality. Tell me what reality is. I'll fix it. Well, of reality is Ari Shaffir didn't work out at all the other ways. Did Marathon Ari Shaffir I didn't work out at decade. I agree with you. He's smoked you like, why are you stressing anything in life? And not just like, okay, I'm probably you talking shit to Ari didn't work out for 10 years. I'm the only one that came in with this checkpoint point. What did you sit down? Do you ever see the video of him on my fucking Rowan, Michelle, I saw, here's the deal. We teamed up against you. Listen to my second place guy. Let him use my teamed to go. Can we team up? I literally, he's convinced that he was gone. Give me this. My closest competitor I told you day off. That's true. I did. I just don't, I've

Speaker 1:          02:30:34       said, I've said Ad Nauseum. We're not, I can't believe we're covering this. I've just had it at nauseum. Uh, Culligan on Joe's Tiger's tail is a big mistake. Ari was a massively surprising and Tom was a fair, fair competitor. Now I will say I am just giving up ideas of what to do next October and I need ideas and I believe that Ariz idea was, I think us not doing something is not fun to follow. If you are a fan of the podcast, us not doing it like, hey guys, let's sleep. Wouldn't be really fun. It would be, it would be how many hours of hip hop dancing and we put in, there we go. Now we're talking about something. Why hip hop dancing? Not Klezmer. Let name it. You guys want to do river dance river dam. Fuck no dance. It sucked when it was invented

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       dancing. It's just hitting me right now. Fast forwarding to [inaudible] say another idea I'm in. I'm in, but like I liked what we did was with the hot yoga, the easiest thing to do is something that you don't need a lot to like take with you or do you know what I mean? Like it's not bad. I like running a lot. I do raclette I'm running, but I don't want to be the one sitting here promoting running. I'm trying to think out of the box. Running is a great idea. Great about running is that if we did do it for the whole total miles of the month, it would get savage problematic. Would you? Do you work? Uh, what burden? I will seriously lose like 40 pounds. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:32:07       name. What's the guys? You just had an insert and he has you do a marathon a day, Joe. Well, I think it's physically possible to do a marathon a day. I know you could well be way easier for me than for you. They're much easier. Once again, I'm too drunk to even talk to them. By the way. I bet you looked at me like you're like, I'm going to do that. Listen, are you going to do a marathon a day? It's not. It's not healthy for you to keep living in this world that you've created, which doesn't even make sense, but are you talking about my drinking or my no, no, no. That's normal. The drinking along with this proclamation of awesomeness.

Speaker 3:          02:32:48       You know what? I'm saying it's like just, it's not the drink. The drinking is fun. It's fun. You're fun running. [inaudible] on rolling. Michelle, you need to be punished if you lose [inaudible] you want some make sense? We got way more. There's a whole table full of whiskey over there and then we got cast monkeys. Tequila here too. Let's do running then. If everyone, if everyone agrees on Monday I'm in, I'm running. Can I ask you that? Someone's going to get ugly guys. I'm just going to get ugly. I'm going to do a marathon and where are we going to wear to track are so that everybody has the same thing to track the shoe. Well you could wear the rock shoe or you can just get an apple watch. No, no, no. But that way we could do or watch only for phone calls and then talking to it if you have a of text messages and then I'll do Ari's challenge at the same time.

Speaker 3:          02:33:35       So it will be doing our need for social media for the month. So wait, hold on. Running on an iPhone. We'll do as many miles as we can for the month. And the whole thing would be how many miles can you run in a month? Am I tell you I'm going to open up the first day with 30 30 30 miles. I'm going to open that up. Yeah, hold on. No. Are we talking 30 miles in a day? That day I need to do 30 miles. Can you, here's the thing, cause it earlier today that that part I believe, I do believe that. I believe that. Here's what I want to know. This makes a huge difference. Can you, cause if we're tracking those miles, we all have to track the miles. We have to track them out with the same APP, 30 miles, which we're off to track the mileage.

Speaker 3:          02:34:19       The with the same APP. No, again, don't, we're in front of us but not so that you have to agree. No growth hormone, no test or on. So it's a great, great, great [inaudible] but you should get off high blood pressure medication before you get on anything. What you should kill yourself first and then figure out the rest. Yeah. Her shit she should see as large as you. Hold on. You got all the way down to like two 12 or something like that. What did you weigh? The impulse problems first search. What did you get up to on this tour? Tell them 500 euro tell you a secret. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:35:00       picture showed it and it was such a fucking disgusting picture of Burt and Burgos was a shellfish reaction. Denmark. Shellfish reaction in Denmark. That's hilarious. Okay, wait, wait. Here's the way. Now this is important for the challenge. So we all, I think we all have to track the miles the same way. Right? Is, is there going to be a stipulation that these miles can only be tracked outdoors on pavement? Yes, because it's, you're on a treadmill. If it's GPS treadmill's not gonna show anything on GPS. It has to be movement. Okay. Actually a surgical move. Mead we're talking about, no, it just distance run verse walk this. There's an app I saw recently that tracks walking and it takes a lot longer to walk. A mile done to run a mile. But you walk all day because you know you should be, if you're tired and you're running and you want to walk for a mile, that's fine.

Speaker 3:          02:35:50       You remember this little lady all distance walking around silver lake. Do you ever that guy? No. Silver Lake Walker. This dude looked like a fucking lizard. He just walk around Silver Lake Dude. He would walk. I'm not kidding. He was all from, yeah, from like 6:00 AM. And you would see him at 8:00 PM schizophrenia. He was a doctor? Yes. He, there was like a little scandal there. He died in this hot tub. So you would see this guy in a hot tub somewhere. There he is the guy that's him. So he would just walk around and trying to slink Dick. I don't know what guys slings, debt. And he would hold the newspaper. I used to see this dude [inaudible] around like that. Yes. All Day. So he would read it, said click on that lower picture again. It said he killed himself. Look at that. Killed himself. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:36:34       Oh my God. That's wow. This has conclude hailed himself. La Corner concludes. Yeah. Well see had there, but that wasn't initially the, the report about story, story, story, that it was a mystery how this guy had died while there was a history song. Yeah, I guess of about Rutgers. Yeah. Can I tell especially where like, well who says, oh, the corner. Okay. Toenails, driveway. What you did there? Can I tell you to tone? It was late. I was late to his stuff. Yeah, they're pretty, he has his toenails painted. They're all pretty, he's got like really beautiful. I'll take a picture with Kathleen and Kathleen Madigan. No Mcgee. Yeah, in Calgary. Uh, can I just tell you this? I was late for the stand. This is like about a year ago when the Stan was still open and I was like fuck. And I started running, how was it second?

Speaker 3:          02:37:24       I was at 16th Street and second avenue. I started running and eventually I was like, I was out of steam. I had to like stop and I stopped. I was at 16th Street, not yet to third avenue. So I, I tire out under a block show. Really enjoying the idea of going into this and just totally to run a position last year. I don't know why you got into like a fucking zone. You got to know zone you. He thought he was going to wait at one point. The other runners body, he, there was a, there was a moment somewhere around week when you said, I got to go. No, when you said I got to go hunting them offline for a second. I was like, oh, I'm close. Yeah. I had to go hunting for but I shot an elk on the second day. We have been a little more like you think it would have been a little easier on us if you had hiked hunted for five days.

Speaker 3:          02:38:12       Yeah, but that was wearing my thing, so I was hiking. I was, I got 600 points one day hiking, hiking, man, your heart rate didn't use you fuck up. You're going to came back from hunting. You did more than that. Can you just put yourself as a thousand in a day on one day it's going to happen yet. One day, 100 I did 900 and then I came in here and worked out for another hour after I was done. So I did. That was hurting. I was hurting that last day, man. You guys shot. Remember? Okay, October 18th you wait, you're going to wake up and you go, fuck. I have to just run a bunch now. Christina's like, let's hang out. [inaudible] I know, I know, I know. Yeah, it's not going to be a mom puts a bad month and you're all going to die. I'm cool with it. There's that too. You'll come in for a second for a second. First of Cyrus probably first, but um, maybe second something spectacular. It seems outrageous that I'm going to be getting on growth. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:39:11       we'd love to do growth. I should go do that, but let's sign off on this. That you should definitely lose some weight. Shouldn't just get on stuff. You should stop drinking so much speaking. It's going to be easy to dude what Australia, you're not going to drink at all when you're over there. You definitely won't drink. I mean they don't even like drinking and Australia and they'll set a good example. Dog kind. They don't accept, you're not tricking people go hard over. Yeah. Maybe you're not doing this fucking cut up coke we're doing tonight for your or for shirts right there. You can have to do shoeys over there. You're going to have to drink beer. She would see me do the show either on TV. I don't even want to know. Pull up chewy. It's still good friend picture. Yeah. Um, I like running.

Speaker 3:          02:39:56       I just, uh, I'm cool with it. I'm cool with those social media. Your ledgers walked into his own thing. Again. I'm the only one that came up with an idea that was fun. It was like jumped on board with it, man. I think it's a good idea. I told you I like durable. I do. I like it. I like the hip hop it in terms of none of us have any experience that's on par with the Cam. Brent. You, that's great. That's judging part is a true problem in parts of real problem. It's, it's an untenable issue. You're going to bring in these people and they're going to go the reason why I thought Burt one the fuck outta here. Yeah, get the fuck Outta here. I see from different story points, work, even mixture points for that. Fuck you Bert. Fuck you. You can't win like that.

Speaker 3:          02:40:41       If you're going to win, it's going to be you have to win and that's what you're scared of. You're scared of. We usually straight up when something or wins for sure. Sure. Definitely 100% I love that you had or to redline into my brain where you hit. You can tell. You can see what gets my heart rate. See anxiety forming. I could see a forming in the air above you is the order. If we do the running thing, go ahead and you get first. Okay, you're promoter gets a second. Let's just get third. What's the promoter's name again? Fuck. What's his name? The one guy. The only use only. I came in here today thinking I was going to tell you guys like I'm out. Really? You're doing it. You're doing all right. We did mushrooms. You can't go. You are doing this to doing mushrooms for the show.

Speaker 3:          02:41:28       Might have been the fucking best way to start this show. Feels good. I'm gonna have to do that in November I bought, my whole body is tingling. It's like a nice match from high. It's like it's, it makes you realize what you really like about mushrooms. I've got November 3rd off. Are we, are we gonna do a Gig together? The four of us? Yes. I, Shit, I won't be here. Where are you going to be? What? The five flied back in November, November 4th in New York all week. You know what we should do in your work? Let's go to New York all week. We could two people down. Okay. Are you still doing winters out here? Are you still doing the window? I could do it in New York jobs. I could do it in your show. Your show. I know a venue or should know about [inaudible] suggest that Jesus Christ. So are you not coming out this way at all?

Speaker 3:          02:42:17       Uh, no. I, I, I come at it, you know, it'd be fun if we decide like the four of just decided to do a destination. Like I'm drunk some crazy thing in Vegas, but that's not like really a destination like Saskatoon, you know, we should do, we should do some shit that's like, that you don't normally get on a tour like somewhere in Wyoming, you know what I mean? Or Ida. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I do Boise, Boise. I love boys. Um, maybe we could do something in like, um, slick guy, Boise break his Ankle Co. Yeah, Mexico or New Mexico, Not Mexico. Mexico, Bro. New Mexico. I had ed called her on the podcast of the day. That's where I got this. Oh yeah, he's Super Mexican. He's a border patrol guys. He was describing the whole cartel wars and how it all went down while it all was happening.

Speaker 3:          02:43:08       Right when he signed up to be a cop and he basically became a para operator, like Jesus just trying to fucking deal with shit that was going down the border to try to take that and then how to space it out. So it's crumpled up trying to get greedy hands, Montana. What it is my [inaudible] Montana just for us to hang out for the weekend show to do it. We'll do show and hang out or we say November or November of Montana. No. Yeah, as far as I go there in November. Whew. All right. Unless you like skiing. Well that's when people go there for, yeah, November's a season ready. She'll, yeah, for sure. My Tommy in New York, two days in big sky. Saturday you're going to be there anyway. Saturday. It's snowing in big sky. He's going to be there that weekend anyway, in November, New York. Yeah. I'm going to be New York and I got November.

Speaker 3:          02:43:54       Third off is my only weekend off from standup all fall. Great. Right after that weekend you come back while hanging out Nila we and by the way, we could just do a comedy club to who gives a fuck? Yes. That might be really fun, man. Just book get charged so much. We can charge their normal amount. The Bertram, it's usually [inaudible] shake your hand. Yeah. Have your promoter. I've never charged. He didn't shake my hand. You don't do that anymore. I've never charged for meet and greet in my entire life. That's fair. Who says I'll never once I do. I do a raffle. People that do to take goes. I think it's gross too, but I bet you know what teaches own friends to do it. I get it. I told everyone agreeing on running. Is that really going to be as easy as crass what we did last time.

Speaker 3:          02:44:41       We've got plenty of time. You have to agree to something Doug, just because it was like, oh, fucking time is running out of the podcast. Okay. Hip Hop dancing and obviously my first shirt fighting. It's weird like that. Let's split this roommate believe this right in here for every show I do from though like it look so pretty bird. Huh? What'd you do? Running the bed. He wants it back and bad. Who made that? Joe? What is the company that made it pro and belts pro. Amp Bell. Can you add an add on that shows a bunch of pills on the side? Yeah, no weed, no booze. It's like that's all there is to try to keep it clean. It looks nice. I can't wait for him. The belt. You're going to have it, bro. You have November 1st for sure. Listen, I'm, I'm, I'm well aware of what the training that needs to go into this if we do running.

Speaker 3:          02:45:32       No, I personally think something silly or would be benefited us, but I'm cool with whatever you guys pick because you're happy coming in last with no consequences. Are you? Are you saying you'll win either way? No matter what it is. He just comes in last. It doesn't matter. That's the thing. Collapse all this shit. He riles you up and I'm saying this is a guy who won. It's not, it's not. It's not right. Is it? W wait, do, wait. How about the million dollar pair? Are you going to do the million dollar [inaudible] promote? It's not right. Not Right. You fake bragging's no shit. Bullshit. I believe in my own fucking abilities. That's the, that's horrific. I believe a moment of those horrific thing you said, I believe in my own abilities. I believe in myself. Yes. Las Vegas. We'll open the action on this this year, which we might be able to get them to do. I'll say I know, I'm betting I how many things be honest challenge. Just one every day he's got to dre and today three weeks. Seven mile. Four, three, seven on that fucking bullshit.

Speaker 3:          02:46:39       That fucking awesome, right? God, it's so hard at the air runners, assault runner. I used to hate it. Now I'm like that's going to get you in shape for the real running that you have to do when you come in last. Oh Man. Cause that is harder than actually wait, wait, wait. Those things are harder than running. It's like 15% or 13% I think he'll do come in second again. I think so. Yeah. I'll come and second. He'll get crazy. You're doing the thing that you're kind of doing the opposite. You guys are already better than you guys know. All right. Cause Ari and I have done Jujitsu together so I know how competitive he gets. Like when you're, when you fight and for your life, which is what you're doing when you do what you did. So you know what a guy's got inside of them are extreme fears.

Speaker 3:          02:47:15       A little savage [inaudible] life and running is a little different. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's his mind. That's why I knew why I knew was going to come second. I knew he was going to come in second when we did this sober October thing. I was just, yeah, it's two fold. I'm running. I'm cool. He gets crazy with stuff. Let's go. I'm gonna Change my brain. I'll switch it over. Let's go. Thank you Bert. He doesn't, yeah, he doesn't give up. Oh, oh, oh yes. Now you to feel it. God doesn't fold. This is already set up. What? I feel like the only thing that's not settled is led to, right. That's not good for you. What's a good, it's not good to talk shit and then talk, listen, Talk Shit. And then just to say, wait, what is the big numbers comment?

Speaker 3:          02:47:58       I am Conor Mcgregor. Nope. Sometimes you talk shit and you lose three years by Connor. Sometimes you talk shit and you lose. Okay. What's the punishment? You just said I'm Conor Mcgregor. Like kind of guy get knocked out. Josie Aldo with one. Conor McGregor was going to pick one person on this podcast to get behind. Who Do you think it would be be? Breo it seems weird. He compensated and be like my guy. I'll bet [inaudible] he would do one on the window. Can I tell me what he would do? Let's team up. Let's help. This is what Connor would, they got them on mushrooms. If there was a fucking, if there was an audience, he would get them all going about how it's you and then when it's like press the button to vote. Right. Then he would go, Ciao. [inaudible] Rogan. Talk about your showmanship and you'd like to, do you think you would lose money? Just cause he likes that you get drunk? That's a good point. It's a good question. He loses money cause he loves that you brag and then fall down and then get back, get back, get back, get back out of a man who doesn't think with his liver. Yeah. I think with my heart hurt. What is the punishment [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:49:10       group on it. But I'm saying, let's say let's start with you. You come in last. What is the punishment for coming in? Last name it $1 million. So happy right now. I can't even wrap my head around the last. No, he's happy. He's looking forward to it. Comfortable. He's looking forward to coming and lasted in front of a fireplace, curled up.

Speaker 5:          02:49:35       Ah, no, no names.

Speaker 1:          02:49:40       Look at him, dude. This whatever's wrong with me, but if it got me into comedy, all the things that are wrong with me, this is the base of it right here. I set up my therapist on there. What does that mean? Because content, I believe I genuinely, oh, are you believe in me. Believe in myself in this moment. That's great. I genuinely believe in myself. I believe that you do that. I do. I believe that you believe in yourself a hundred percent to a hundred percent thank you. Also, I know on some level you'll come in fourth in anything we don't know about him or set forth, but I'll tell you, I'll be, I'll be very honest. Yeah, please. As much as I believe in myself. I know there's something wrong with Joe. I know that Ari has this fucking have no interest in you Gehrig's disease. That's already this year. Whatever it is, Mickey Mantle and I know that Tom is going to call me on the last day and go, who you're done running, right? You're not going to throw me under the bus on this one.

Speaker 5:          02:50:33       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:50:35       how did you do that on the last day I called him

Speaker 5:          02:50:36       but I fought him on track. Now I'll try calling them on a treadmill,

Speaker 1:          02:50:41       Jim and I was like, I was moving. I was like, are you doing? He was like, man, I swear to you, and then I, he's like doing, he goes, I'm with my family right now. I'm with my kids and I heard like kids laughing and pds like roasting a thing. I stayed on that trip. I was like, I still on some part of my mind doesn't believe you. I didn't believe I stayed on. I stayed on and he goes, I swear to you, I'm done. And I stayed in that gym probably 40 minutes. He's still put up good numbers that day, but I did go like I couldn't do it. It was a weird thing. I didn't tell you guys. I got up. I flew across the country then. Yeah, no, you did tell me. Did I tell you that? Yes. So I was like, Oh shit about it. What I loved about it is that we were seeing everybody's numbers and he's high on mushrooms, but I'm just thinking about this. It's like, can't we start slow and have like a art? You did five miles call for the day. It's me out. No, that's not it. That's not how it's going to work. Going to the dark place. Here's what I'm well aware of.

Speaker 1:          02:51:35       Oh, I'm going to give you the cards in my hand right now. I've run a 26 miles in a day. Yeah, and I know that Joe's first day of running 26 miles is going to put him back for a couple of you said really hard to go right into that. So now he's going to train ahead of time in October 1st you moron. No, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know when I know for a fact, I know for me to leave this place, its start. If we make, if that's the agreement I'm to get down to a 180

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       pounds. I'm going to lose 2100 I can do that. Nobody. I mean like like in your head. Oh I'm sorry. 20 pounds. It's already done. Yeah. I'm going to lose 20 pounds and I'm going to run. I will start off like with 10 I'll do like 10 every other day and then by the time October ramps around, I'll be doing a marathon a day. It's kind of suck. It's going to suck. You'll do that every day. Yeah. I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to show her what the fuck is up then. I'm not gonna talk to him anymore. I don't like how the end of the it lasts. I'm going to block his number. I'm just like, I can't do this anymore. Fuck hip hop dance is so much more fun. All right. This shouldn't be fun. I got to pee can be fun. It shouldn't be fun. She'd be terrifying. Last year was terrified. If I come in last this year and there's all these fucking repercussions, and then he came in last and had nothing wrong with that. Right. It's super unfair. It's unfair. Right? Someone should punish you. You should be punished. Birth. Wait, why do I get punished? So give me a punishment. Punishment APP. Eat your own shit. How much I spoonful Jesus Christ. Oh Shit. What happens? I don't know. Why don't you just give us each 300 grand and it's settled?

Speaker 3:          02:53:26       Ah, fuck. Ugh. Can I just say that? I'm going to be Columbus next weekend so you guys will come out and see where the fuck I love that place. Even bigger, right? Yeah, but don't do strokes when you come to see my show. Just don't do it. Great. Club Columbus. Yeah, that's great club. It's a great town for stand up to. It's not as good as the met. July 27th in Philly. Oh my God. Oh, I'm announcing a shitload of dates tomorrow. Are you ready? Yeah, I know some. No, I can't. I don't know where I'm going. In Cardiff, Wales, June 25th for Ari. Shapiro [inaudible], shapiro.com all of them will be announced tomorrow. I'll put it, but um, I got some dates coming. Let's do your presale. So there's some, there's still a hundred tickets left for Chicago this weekend too. Where are you at in Chicago? Some arena. Jesus to Rogan eyewear at Chicago in Salads.

Speaker 3:          02:54:11       And they were like, this is fucking super sweet. The Salad. And then we asked, some lady were like, couldn't believe it. And we're like, did you put sugar on the salad? And she was like, is it too sweet for you? Why would you put down your chicken and salad? And we looked around, the fittest person looked like Burt. It was like everybody there was massive day. Love that fat deep dish pizza. Those are hardy. Midwest folk. Yeah. I love San Diego. Yeah, I love Chicago. Yeah, but they put sugar on their salad. One moment. Take a break. Nope. Get into it for just one extra pop with your pop. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:54:47       Want more sugar on your shout sugar? Where are you playing there? A massive place, Huh? Yeah. Some big ass place. Damn. Is it different than this? Like, how different is it than the store? This is different. Yeah. Explain to people the difference between a small hundred seat room to it's five, six. But here's the problem is the same material you're gonna put on a special deliver. When you deliberate a 6,000 people realize you're delivering to one person on the couch. Is it like, do you, it's different kind of show. Do you find yourself talking louder or like stuff like that? It's different. I mean if you're there, it's fun, but I don't think it would translate correctly if you're at home. And that's one of the reasons why I think like I did my last one at the Wilbur, which is pretty tight. He's like three comedy clubs stacked on top of each other.

Speaker 3:          02:55:29       It's 1100 seats, but it's pretty intimate. Like the people are on top of you. I think that's how you're supposed to do comedy at a special because specials, it's hard to be in that room. And I, I've been saying this, I don't see if you agree with me. Um, I think that a special is only at its best, like maybe 80% of what it's like to actually be in the room because you miss the feeling of being in the crowd and I tried to get my shirts and I haven't ever gotten as close as possible to love experience, but you can see a show at a Mexican restaurant on a Tuesday with a bunch of amateurs and you'll laugh. You'll laugh harder than watching any of our specials on loan in your apartment. Yeah. Comedy has you really being there live, it's amazing. What makes it, that's what makes, I think a lot of comics mess up and they do their special for the room and they go like, oh, what's up?

Speaker 3:          02:56:19       What's up here? The place I'm at, I'm at Dell, but Kat Williams, the best part of his special was the 10 minutes he did on Tallahassee or checks and jack die hard disagree by the way, shout big fucking Katt Williams fam that I loved that he was John Williams stuff, but we talked about that, about doing it, not for the rooms. You've got to do it for the people. You shoot a special for fucking Jackson, but his window, you guys especially are doing these massive, massive, massive rooms. But then when people are going to see your special almost hold them are watching like, you know, really tough doing my special in a big room up to it's like less than a thousand. I'm thinking of doing a, at the icehouse I've been thinking about doing that, talking about for a while. I'm pretty far out and doing special. I'm, I'm at least a year away from even thinking about it.

Speaker 3:          02:57:05       I think the most important thing about other special is doing in a place that has not seen you do stand up. That's the number one most important thing. I would do a special at the store. Uh, I would find that to be a mistake because you're there all the time. You've been working on this material in front of those people. If it fucks your head up. What about the people who, well, I got it on the level of like some of the jokes are surprise ending and they kind of like know what's going there and they're like, right, right. That's true. You don't want to do a special for people that have seen this material ever. You want those people to never have seen this material the same way. The people that are home never seen that 1 million people in their labor. You have a job.

Speaker 3:          02:57:37       A lot of them will show up. A lot of your two mega fans are going to show up and go, dude, I just saw them like six months ago. I want to come and see it. Well, what's interesting about the store right now and say you get comedy tourism there, where are you getting a lot of people that come to visit the store from all over the world? Yeah, true. Let's see. I met some dudes, they're just the other day from England and Ireland. They flew in for the weeks while stand up stories in massive right now, great stores everywhere, man. Really is. But I, but I, I'm the, the two things I have in my head is, Oh, like a rock venue and I'd like a place I haven't done, I haven't done this material in front of you announced it yet. Where are you doing or no? Yeah. Cleveland 23rd of November. Everybody special. Yeah. Oh, Shit. And Cleveland and keep it short sided shirt on. No, no, no. I'm going do shirt on the super skinny after this marathon doing it shuts off. Come on Bro. I'm not fucking knee brace on orthopedics challenge sunburn on a walker. You're like Forrest Gump. Hi everybody. I'm in there running. When Ariz around you open up a Kombucha. You instinctively smell it first. Move that thing man.

Speaker 3:          02:58:46       I got thirsty too. I would, I could do an entire podcast on specials cause I feel like I'm obsessed with how they, the good ones. Like what makes a great special? Yeah. Anthony. Jessalyn. Nick's first. Jayson, the best joke I've heard in a, like this first jokes that come out really strong. Got To have a first joke, man. Anyone, anyone who says hi, any of that bullshit fucking walked in states like Jeff or nick or like Norm Mcdonald and tell fucking Jovi's see it now. No Man, I'd like Katt Williams got Jack Town. I liked that. It wasn't their incident. He's really great. He's really great. But he, um, when you see being real man, I'm a calming. I'm not a fucking, I'm being real. I did this [inaudible] pussy foot, the guy, but like, I didn't like it man. I'm not from Jacksonville and I'd been to Jackson and I, and I know Jay.

Speaker 3:          02:59:38       I know. Come on, come on, go to it was fucking brilliant man. You know what Michael Jackson had? He had this, this, this, you know what I got? I got this. I'm trying to fuck bitches, man. It doesn't matter why. It doesn't matter where he is today. I doesn't, I want to hear your new goals bow, but he, no dude. Uh, and this podcast, no conclusion because otherwise we'll be just fight with Jon o'clock in the morning. Cat night did Steve Drunk Cat Stevens is a Muslim. Don't get in a fight with him.
