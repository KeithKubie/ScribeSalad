00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.780
Consider the functions f and
g with the graphs shown below.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.210
If capital G of x is equal to g
of f of x whole thing squared,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.700
what is the value of G
prime, capital G prime, of 5?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.560
And I encourage you to
now pause this video

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.330
and try to solve it on your own.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.280
So let's try to think
through this somewhat

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.930
complicated-looking function
definition right over here.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.070
So we have capital G of x.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.312
And actually, let me
write it this way.

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:31.270
Let me write it this way,
I'll do it in yellow.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.850
We have capital G of x is
equal to this quantity squared.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.970
What we're squaring
is g of f of x.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.810
g of f of x is what
we're squaring.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.950
Or another way to
write G of x, If h of x

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.880
were to be equal
to x squared, we

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:05.690
could write G of x is equal
to h of this business, h

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.952
of g of f of x.

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:08.452
Let me just copy
and paste that so I

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:10.180
don't have to keep
switching colors.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.550
So copy and paste, there we go.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.110
So this is another
way of writing

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.000
G of x, where
whatever g of f of x,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.470
we input then to h of x, which
is really just squaring it.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.600
So there's a couple of
ways that we can write out

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.882
the derivative of capital
G with respect to x.

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.340
And you could
imagine this is going

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.280
to involve the chain rule.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.080
But I like to write it
out, just to clarify

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.520
in my head what's going
on and to make sure

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.010
that it actually
makes some sense.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.730
So one thing that
we could write,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.310
we could write the
derivative of G

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.340
with respect-- I'll mix
notations a little bit--

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.610
but I'll write the derivative
of G of x with respect

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:05.770
to x is equal to the
derivative of this whole thing.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.560
So let me copy and paste
it, copy and paste.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.590
It's equal to this derivative
of this whole thing with respect

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.350
to what's inside of
that whole thing.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.880
So if you wanted to treat
g of f of x as a variable,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.210
so with respect to that.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.770
So copy and paste.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.730
So it's going to be the
derivative of this whole thing

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.680
with respect to g of f of
x times the derivative of g

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.970
of f of x with respect to f
of x, with respect to-- I'll

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.030
just copy and paste this
part, whoops-- with respect

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.830
to f of x.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.490
And I like to write this out.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.820
It feels good.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.600
It looks like these are rational
expressions with differentials.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.560
It's really a notation more
than to be taken literally.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.120
But it feels good, or
at least in my mind

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.620
it's a little bit more intuitive
why all of this works out.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.680
So with respect to f of x times
the derivative of-- and I'm

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.080
using non-standard
notation here,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.070
but it helps me really
conceptualize this-- times

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:28.040
the derivative of f of
x with respect to x.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.930
Or another way we
could write this

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.930
is G prime of x is
equal to h prime

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.100
of g of f of x, h
prime of-- actually,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.580
let me do it here--
h prime of this.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.330
So copy and paste,
h prime of that,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:05.186
times g prime of f of x,
times g prime of this.

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:09.530
So copy and then paste.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.600
So times g prime of that.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.190
Put some parentheses there.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.969
Times f prime of x.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.800
And I like writing it this
way, because you notice

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.370
if these were-- and once
again, this is more notation,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.070
but it gives a sense
of what's going on.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.580
If you did view
these as fractions,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.880
that would cancel with that.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.410
That would cancel with that.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.940
You're taking the derivative
of everything with respect

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.000
to x, which is exactly
what you wanted to do.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.820
And let me put some
parentheses here

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.950
so it makes a little bit
clearer what's going on.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.590
But this thing, in
my brain, I like

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.006
to translate that
as, well, that's

00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:48.720
just h prime of g of f of x.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.420
This is g prime of f of x.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.370
This is f prime of x.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.152
And going from this
to try to answer

00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:56.610
your question, the question
that they're asking us actually

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.420
isn't too bad.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.110
So we want to know,
what's G prime of 5?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.770
So everywhere we see an
x, let's change it to a 5.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.080
So we're going to say, we need
to figure out what G prime of 5

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.840
is.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.480
G prime of 5 is equal
to-- and actually,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.770
let me just copy and
paste this whole thing.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.950
So copy and paste.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.620
And so let me, everywhere
where I see an x,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.315
I'm going to
replace it with a 5.

00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:29.340
So let me get rid of that.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.680
Let me get rid of that.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.660
And let me get rid of that.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.890
And so I have a 5, a 5, and a 5.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.021
So what is f of 5?

00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:47.110
f of 5 is equal to negative 1.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.340
So this right over here
simplifies to negative 1.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.410
This right over here
simplifies to negative 1.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.860
And what's f prime
of negative 5?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.960
Well, that's the slope
of the tangent line

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.370
at this point right over here.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.244
And we see that the
derivative, or the slope,

00:06:03.244 --> 00:06:04.960
of the tangent line here is 0.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.820
So this right over here
is going to be equal to 0.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.540
Now that's really interesting.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.910
So we could keep trying to,
well, what's g of negative 1?

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.340
What's g prime of negative 1?

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.707
You could see g of
negative 1, g of negative 1

00:06:20.707 --> 00:06:23.290
we see is negative 1. g prime
of negative 1 is the slope here,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.750
which is also negative 1.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.023
Then we could calculate
h prime of these values,

00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:28.190
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.750
But we don't even
have to do that.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.583
Because this is the
product of three things,

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:33.760
and one of these things
right over here is a 0.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.390
So 0 times anything
times anything

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.470
is going to be equal to 0.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.880
Another way of thinking
about it is, f of x is

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.100
isn't changing when
x is equal to 5.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.480
If f of x isn't changing
when x is equal to 5,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.060
then the input into the g
isn't going to be changing.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.980
So the g function isn't going
to be-- in the composition

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.110
g of f of x-- isn't
going to be changing.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.470
And so h of g of f of x
isn't going to be changing.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.440
So g of x isn't
going to be changing.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.150
And so the derivative of
capital G of x at x equals 5

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.630
is going to be equal to 0.
