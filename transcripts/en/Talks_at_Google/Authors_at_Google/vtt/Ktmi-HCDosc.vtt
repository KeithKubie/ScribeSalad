00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:07.290
MALE SPEAKER: Professor Gibney,
he's an expert on

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.830
human nutrition.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.950
He served on several EU and
United Nations health

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.370
committees.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.320
He's been a professor at Trinity
College and at UCD.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.950
That's interesting politics,
both sides of the fence.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.410
He's currently the Director
of the UCD

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.795
Institute of Food and Health.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.290
And actually, one of his huge
accomplishments, probably his

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.850
biggest one, is his daughter,
Sinead, who's here in Dublin.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.870
And so we kind of declared the
whole [INAUDIBLE] familial,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.500
and Sinead has actually driven
the whole of our social aging

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.560
policy, which has been actually
a tremendous success.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.060
Also then, just to declare my
interest in the whole area of

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.880
the food services business, I
actually-- if you all remember

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.400
from sandwich gate a
couple years ago--

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.540
I serve on the board
of Green Corps.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.140
So I'm obviously deeply
interested in this area, and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.070
have actually spent most of my
evenings in the last week on

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.480
board meetings related
to this.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.870
Mike's book is called "Something
to Chew On." If you

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.580
had a chance to read it, you'll
know he has some pretty

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.989
controversial views.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.950
If you haven't, I think what
you'll do is you'll hear,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.290
during the course of
conversation, those

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.270
controversial views.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.890
It might encourage you to go out
and actually get the book.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.530
We probably have a couple
of copies here, as well.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.380
So first of all, Mike, let's
see if you can convince us.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.817
Mike Gibney, welcome
to Google.

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:24.661
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.310
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: Good

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.710
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.330
It's a pleasure to be
here as part of the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
Google Author scheme.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.700
I'm here to talk about a book
I've written, and I'm also

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.380
going to mention a blog that
I operate, gibneyonfood.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770
I used to upload once a week,
but I found it too much.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.570
So the most recent one I
uploaded was "Dietary

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.180
supplements--

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.770
useless or useful?" That
was this week.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.620
So I have about 35,000
hits and about 200--

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.150
it's rising up to about
100 a day, 150 a day.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.130
And I wrote both of these
because I'm sick and tired of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.640
rubbish I read in the media,
sick and tired of people who

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.840
are being confused by quasi
experts in the media, in the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.195
print media and in the
electronic media.

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:11.370
And very often, when I give
talks to the general public, I

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.650
try to leave as much time as
possible for questions, the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.020
reason being that people rarely
get a chance to talk to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.320
someone who is, technically
speaking, expert, and neutral,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.620
and willing to say
it as it is.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.690
Quite often, the people who
write books are writing from a

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.670
very narrow, sensationalist,
and poor

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.490
science-based point of view.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.110
So that's my take.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.270
So what I'm going to try and
do today is to say the book

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.290
covers a wide variety of things,
and I can't possibly

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.080
cover them all.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.770
What I've tried to do is make
a list of seven myths.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.540
And I'll go through these,
and if time allows,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.900
I'll finish them all.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.380
And if it doesn't, I'll
stop wherever I feel.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.380
But I'll try to go for
about a half an hour.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.870
The first one I want to look at
is whether or not obesity

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.620
is a uniquely modern event.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.930
On the right-hand side of this
screen, there's a book there

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.390
called "The End of Overeating."
It's by David

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.870
Kessler, who is former head of
the FDA in the United States.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.610
He's a pediatrician, or
was a pediatrician.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.630
He wrote this in his book.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.090
For thousands of years,
human weight

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.130
stayed remarkably constant.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.740
Throughout adulthood we
basically consume no more than

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.630
the food we needed to burn.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.200
People who are overweight stood
apart from the general

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.900
population.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.790
Please remember that, that
they stood apart from the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.180
general population.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.080
Millions of calories passed
through their bodies, yet with

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.690
rare exceptions, our weight
neither rose nor fell.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.460
Rare exceptions.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.825
And everything changed
in the 1980s.

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:40.890
Now, if Kessler is correct,
then the solution to the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.170
problem of obesity will
be around the 1980s.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.290
Something happened in the 1960s
and '70s, or perhaps

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.740
into the '80s and maybe '90s,
but he's got a 40, 50, or even

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.430
a 60 year period to look
for the solution.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.890
But if he's wrong, as I'm going
to show you, then he's

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.330
going to make a mess
of things.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.580
I'll go back to Hippocrates.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.620
He wrote, in relation to the
Scythian race, about their

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.820
children, that the male
children, until they were old

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.390
enough to ride, most of the time
were sitting in wagons,

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.680
and they were talking very
little since they were often

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.680
changing their place
of residence.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.010
And the girls get amazingly
flabby and podgy.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.300
But that's not a rare event.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.390
Then one of the greatest writers
of Roman time, Lucius

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:33.070
Columella, he wrote that, "The
consequence is that ill health

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.420
attends so slothful a manner of
living; for the bodies of

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.600
our young men are so flabby and
enervated that death seems

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.680
likely to make no
change to them."

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.120
Then you go to the city
of Florence, the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.140
city-state of Florence.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.600
And this gentleman, Cornaro,
wrote this book, still

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.920
available on Amazon,
by the way.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.040
He wrote it at the age of 94.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.880
And it's pretty important
to read what he says.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.090
"Gluttony kills every year as
great a number as would perish

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.430
during the time of the most
dreadful pestilence or by the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.560
sword or the fire of many
wars." Rare event?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.625
I don't think so.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:14.250
And then finally, I'll take you
through to the 18th and

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.860
19th Century to Sir William Wadd
in London, who pointed

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.690
out that the increase of wealth
and refinement of

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.160
modern times, have tended to
banish plague and pestilence.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.260
They have probably introduced
the increased frequency of

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.395
corpulence.

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:30.320
For every one fat person in
Spain or France, there are 100

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.860
in England.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.510
Though that's still
the case, I think.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.030
Apologies to my English
colleagues.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.130
Now, this is a modern
analysis.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.323
It's interesting to look back in
history, but we really need

00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:46.300
to do some science here.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.620
This is a study which has
looked at birth cohorts.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.930
Now, birth cohorts are very
important because you take a

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.110
group of people born in a
certain period, and you follow

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.110
them throughout their lives.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.930
And then you take another group
born 20 years later.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.200
You follow them through
their lives.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.230
So you take a group in 1880,
1900, 1920, '40, '60, and

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.380
follow them onwards.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.110
When you put it all together,
you get a picture of the rate

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.390
at which obesity has grown.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.800
In this particular study, you'll
see that from 1880

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.850
onwards to 1980, there has
been a linear rise in the

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.720
level of obesity.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.430
It isn't something that has
happened at a flat rate, and

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.190
then suddenly appeared
in 1980.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.850
And if you look at the rate of
change, you'll see that it

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.140
comes in waves.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.940
It starts, it slows,
it rises again.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.676
I call this the tsunami
of large.

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:41.900
Now, if you take a different
approach to this-- this is

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.130
started from the US military--

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.390
and they've looked
at four periods.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.770
I've taken the 45-year-old
military personnel there.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:59.120
They showed an increase of 3.4
units of body mass index.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.370
The increase was 7% for the
first 30 years, 17% then for

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.050
the next half century.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.070
The next one should
read 17 years.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.790
Half of it took place in that
17 years after the war.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.725
And then again, it slowed down
in the 1960s to 1990s to only

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:15.750
a quarter of it.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.200
So again, you have this
undulation and growth.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.790
It's best seen in some studies
in Denmark where they took

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.060
children in the 1930s.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.380
They had seven, eight, nine,
10, 11-year-olds, and they

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.340
followed them on a six-monthly
basis.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.670
As you can see, there's a slow
gradual rise, and then in the

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.010
1940s, there's a spurt, and then
it drops off again, and

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.012
then there's another
huge spurt.

00:07:41.012 --> 00:07:45.140
And then if you take the Danish
military recruits, just

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.920
start at the end of the Second
World War, again you see the

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.110
same pattern--

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.970
a slow rise, a sudden
rise, a dip, and

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.410
then a very fast rise.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.940
So basically speaking, the
authors of the paper I

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.500
referred to-- and many of them
I could have shown you, but

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.040
this was one I particularly
like--

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.120
they make two conclusions.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.780
"Insofar as BMI values have been
increasing gradually over

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.780
a century, researchers
attempting to understand the

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:16.350
causes of the pandemic need to
reflect or focus on the 1980s

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.290
and thereafter to a much longer
run process of social,

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.270
technological, economic, and
cultural change." And then

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.470
they go on to say that "the
finding also implies that the

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.220
policies to attenuate or reverse
the trend would have

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.040
to reach deep into the social
fabric and take into

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.700
consideration that such
socio-economic forces

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.039
generally change at
glacial pace."

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.260
So Kessler has it wrong in
thinking that it all happened

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.570
in the 1980s.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.500
When he looks around for a
solution, and he will identify

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.470
sugar sweetened beverages as one
of the causes, he'll have

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.230
gotten it wrong.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.030
The problem is with obesity is
that I see there are two types

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.350
of people take a scientific
approach to obesity-- the

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.090
solutionists and the analysts.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.180
I'm an analyst.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.030
I like to find out why.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.140
The solutionists have an idea
of what to do, and they

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.111
justify doing it, such
as taxing sugar.

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:10.750
Now, this is the second
myth, and it's about

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.210
the stigma of obesity.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.940
I'll just go back and say that
I'm going to introduce you to

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.760
a number of impressions that
most of you people in this

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.270
room will have about
obese people.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.580
Most of you will have these.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.010
If you're really truthful
to yourself, you'll

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.830
admit yes, you have.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.480
First of all, you'll believe
they're lazy.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.760
Then you'll believe that
they're dishonest, that

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.670
they're untidy, untrustworthy,
unreliable, can't manage their

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:42.050
time, have poor self-control,
possibly low IQ, and low

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.380
self-esteem.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.350
Now, that view is widely held
by professionals who look

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.940
after obese people.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.410
It's held by obese people.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.080
And sadly, it's held
by obese children.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.420
The only thing that's true on
that is the very last one,

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.010
self-esteem.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.370
Self-esteem doesn't happen
because you are born with bad

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:02.800
self-esteem.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.780
It happens because you got
overweight or a little bit

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.190
fat, and you experience
all these prejudices.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.600
And your self esteem suffers
because of them.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.510
So if there's one thing I'd hope
that would happen after

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.310
this talk, the next time you see
someone that's overweight,

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.130
just be a little bit
sympathetic.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.890
Just be a little bit
sympathetic.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.490
So don't always imagine--

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.560
I'm going to show you a study
that was repeated twice--

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.130
and this was done
with children--

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.200
that shows you the scale
of the problem.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.770
Boys were shown drawings of
boys, and girls were shown

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.690
drawings of girls.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.520
And there were six types.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.050
The first one was healthy,
nothing wrong

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.290
with them at all.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.480
The next one was a
disfigured face.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.750
The next one was on crutches
with a brace on one leg.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.130
Then there was one with
a wheelchair--

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.320
one with no left hand.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.000
Sorry--

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.290
one in a wheelchair covered
by a blanket, and

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.020
one that was obese.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.330
The children were asked to rank
them, who they'd like to

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.350
be their friend most.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.430
Five was the one you didn't
want to be friendly with.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.732
One was you wanted to be
friends with them.

00:11:03.732 --> 00:11:06.110
The results are staggering.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.560
Nobody wanted to be friends
with the obese children.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.860
They'd rather be friends with
people with all sorts of

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:20.100
physical impairments, but
not an obese child.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.190
This is ingrained in children.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.560
It comes from their parents,
and it's part of the way

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.530
society thinks.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.220
So again, I say to you, the
one thing I want you to do

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.560
when you leave here is be a
little bit considerate.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.620
Here are some people
that are not lazy.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.050
They're not all of the things
you think about them, and

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.520
they're all fat and famous.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.660
Some of them are very
rich and famous.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.740
The third myth is that obesity
is uniquely caused by the

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.470
environment, and genes have
nothing to do with it.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.910
I was explaining last night when
I was down in Cork that I

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.300
gave a talk, a lecture once.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.150
I gave the opening talk to the
World Congress of Public

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.270
Health Nutrition.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.370
They asked me to pick four
topics, any topic

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.015
I liked, hot topics.

00:12:08.015 --> 00:12:09.910
And I picked four,
one of which was

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.880
genetics and obesity.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.390
When I was finished talking,
there was a queue at the

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.440
microphone by eminent public
health nutritionists, each

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.970
vying to condemn me.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.370
How could I possibly say this?

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.580
Genes have not changed
for centuries.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.290
The environment has.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.060
Therefore, it has to be the
environment, stupid.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.110
It can't be the genes.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.360
But I'll show you
that's not true.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.690
These are two Maasai tribesmen
from Kenya.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.800
They look after cattle,
and they're nomadic.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.300
They walk long distances,
so they've

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.430
huge physical activity.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.400
They eat berries
along the way.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.180
They drink the milk.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.400
Occasionally, they'll bleed the
cattle, and mix it with

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.560
the milk, and drink that.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.390
They live in a non-obesogenic
environment.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.360
It's impossible to get fat
as a Maasai warrior.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.230
Impossible.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.280
You spend so much energy walking
around after your

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.620
cattle and eating
so sparsely that

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.320
obesity just ain't possible.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.520
This is a food emporium in some
shopping mall or other.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.180
You'd be familiar with them in
airports and what have you.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.690
And this is an obesogenic
environment.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.170
This is cheap food.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.750
This is tasty food.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.950
This is abundant food.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.470
It's immediate food.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.790
It's every cuisine
food you like.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.352
And this is an obesogenic
environment.

00:13:27.352 --> 00:13:31.540
Now, if I was to take 1,000
Kenyan tribesman and bring

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.980
them into this obesogenic

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.740
environment, what would happen?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.630
Well, I would predict some
would get fat very fast.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.880
I would predict some would
get fat, but very slowly.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.600
Some would get overweight very
fast, and some would get

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.540
overweight very slowly.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.870
Some wouldn't gain
weight at all.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.550
That is the difference.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.040
The difference in those people
is due to genes.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.760
Put them in the same obesogenic
environment.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.890
How they respond to that
environment is genetically

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.050
determined.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.670
So we live in an obesogenic
environment.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.250
Those of us that gain weight
are gaining weight because

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.550
they have a genetic
predisposition to do so in an

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.170
obesogenic environment.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.660
Take away the environment,
the genes don't matter.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.920
Put the environment there, the
genes tell you who's going to

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.173
get top of the league, middle
of the league, or bottom of

00:14:21.173 --> 00:14:22.530
the league.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.640
So genes matter.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.510
I'll show you some
data on this.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.500
This is an old study carried out
in the 1970s and forgotten

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.430
because it didn't suit public
health nutrition.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.820
It involved overfeeding twins,
identical twins.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.820
And it also involved
underfeeding identical twins,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.870
all carried out in clinical
conditions.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.240
In other words, in a ward, where
they were supervised.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.400
So if I take some
examples here--

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.700
let's take the overfeeding
one--

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.510
and we have a green
circle here.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.000
That dot represents two twins,
two identical twins.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.690
If you go down the line to the
change in body weight for twin

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.400
B, it's around about 11 kilos.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.580
And if you go across to the
weight gain on twin A, it's

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.770
about 13 kilos.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.960
So they've gained more or
less the same weight.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.620
Whereas if you go down
to the red one, they

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.970
resisted weight gain.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.100
Those two twins resisted weight
gain more or less to

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.650
within a kilo of one another.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:22.300
And then if you go on to the
period where 1,000 calories

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.100
were taken away from them every
day, they lost weight.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.080
But look at the ones in green.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.280
They lost very little.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.060
They resisted.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.570
Both twins resisted.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.080
In red, both twins showed
huge weight loss.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.140
So again, you can see the
genetic component is

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.340
determining who responds
to the environment, the

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.920
obesogenic or the non-obesogenic
environment.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.350
Now, the criticism of all of
that was it was carried out in

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.990
the 1970s when we didn't
really have the highly

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.750
obesogenic environment
we have today.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.900
This lady, Jane Wardle, at the
University of London has done

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.430
some incredibly good work with
twins, identical and

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.320
non-identical.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.910
And the thing about identical
and non-identical twins is

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.070
they have a mathematical model
which allows you to work out

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.000
what part of the trait
is heritable.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.400
In the case of obesity, BMI, or
Body Mass Index, or waist

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.950
circumference, three quarters,
roughly speaking, is

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.620
accountable for it by
genetic variation.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.920
That was exactly what they found
in the 1970s, as well.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.440
About, you could say, of the
remainder, a little bit more

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.930
than half was in the non-shared

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.060
environment of the children.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.180
So one child went off to play
hockey, another going to go

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.560
swimming, another going to
drama, another going to do

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.840
something else.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.590
And the shared environment
was the whole.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:41.470
Now, just to take this a little
bit further, this is a

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.450
longitudinal study
of 428 twins.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.580
They were from 100 obese
families and 100 non-obese.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.290
Both parents had to
be obese, or both

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.290
parents had to be slim.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.230
They were followed from four to
11, which is a seven year

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.860
follow up, and they had an
81% retention, which

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.770
is very, very good.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:06.280
This is obesity at age
four and age 11.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.980
The gray bar represents the
children of slim parents.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.020
There was no change in the
rate of obesity in those

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.810
children between the
age of four and 11.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.619
The black bar represents
children both whose parents

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.290
were obese.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.720
You can see that there
was a dramatic rise.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.870
Even by age four, there was far
more obesity in those that

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.180
had obese parents, and by age
11, it was through the roof.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.850
Of course, you might argue that
that's due to the home

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:38.370
environment.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.360
But what I've shown you is that
when you study twins,

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.320
identical and non-identical
twins, and you're able to take

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.245
away the effect of the home
environment, the environment

00:17:48.245 --> 00:17:53.960
comes out at less than 25%, the
genes accounting for 75%.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.380
I just want to bring in social
class, because this is also

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.320
another myth, so to speak.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.930
On the bottom, you see that
we've broken this up now into

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.340
two groups.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:09.110
We still have the children who
were born of lean parents, and

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.570
over the seven year period, they
showed no weight gain.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.910
Now, we've divided them into two
colors, blue and sort of

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.130
red, and they're different
social classes.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.320
And social class makes
absolutely and utterly no

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.930
difference if you happen
to have two

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.080
parents that are slim.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.330
But if you go to the top of
this where we have the

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.310
children whose parents were
overweight, then you see that

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.860
social class becomes
important.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.220
So what you have here is the
same environment, but if you

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.000
have the genes to keep you slim,
you'll be slim in that

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.110
environment.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.800
If you have the genes that make
you fat, you'll get fat

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.900
in that environment.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.110
And that is the reality of it.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.380
Once again, I say take away the
environment and you take

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.070
away the problem.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.630
There's nothing to
do with genes.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.150
But if anyone thinks they can
turn this city into a

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.390
non-obesogenic environment in a
decade, you're a better man

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.310
than I, Gunga Din.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.930
To add to what I've been saying,
this is a recently

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.040
published study of a huge
number, 12,000 twin pairs from

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.280
birth to 19 years of age.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.670
Basically speaking, the black
line represents the inherited

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.220
component of obesity.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.570
And the bottom line represents
the environmental side.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.490
At birth, the genetic
side is quite small.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.500
But by six months,
it's dominant.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.580
It drops at four or
five years of age.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.290
I don't know why that is.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.770
Maybe it's going to school.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.820
It drops again at seven.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.580
I don't know why.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.130
But right through adolescence,
it's the dominant determinant

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.220
of weight in an obese
environment.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.180
Once again, we have an
obese environment.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.360
We have winners that win the top
of the league, the bottom

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.670
of the league, and the
middle of the league.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.960
And that's determined
by genetics.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.680
Your position on the league
table is determined by

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.210
genetics in an obesogenic
environment.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.170
Many people think that if
you're talking about the

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.060
genetic control of obesity,
you're talking about metabolic

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:00.620
parameters.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.530
You're talking about
how muscle, liver,

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.570
adipose tissue behave.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:10.340
But in fact, in man, we have
such a complicated system of

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.570
selecting food, unlike rats,
because we've got a big

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:17.230
cortex, so we can like things
and dislike things.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.270
It's quite likely that the
genetic variation applies to

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.910
behavior as much as it
does to metabolism.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.220
Jane Wardle did this study of
nearly 4,000 or 5,000 twin

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.950
pairs, and she was looking at
neophobia, whether children

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.230
like new foods or don't
like new foods.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:40.570
What she found was that 78% of
the variability was genetic.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.170
This is beginning to open
up an explanation of--

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.620
why is genetics important?

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.170
Well, it's only important if it
influences something that

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.960
influences obesity.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.010
She's shown now that neophobia
is strongly inherited, and not

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.710
necessarily taught.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:01.740
So we're making progress
in that direction.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.790
OK.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.240
Moving away from obesity to
things to do with the food

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.570
chain, everything that's
synthetic is considered by

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.840
people your age, roughly
speaking, as being bad for us.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.690
And everything that's natural
is considered

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:15.880
very good for us.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.560
So let's take a look at that.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.070
It was this chap by the name
of-- he was Swiss--

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.250
Philippus Theophrastus Aureolus
Bombastus von

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.240
Hohenheim And even if I had
his name, I'd change it.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.020
But he changed it to Paracelsus,
which is equal to

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.680
or greater than Celsus, who was
a Roman physician at the

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.630
turn of the millennium, and
quite a famous person.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.210
So Paracelsus gave us
this one statement.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.170
"All subjects are poisons and
nothing is without poison,

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.090
only the dose permits
something not to be

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.430
poisonous." Swiss Alpine
air injected into your

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.270
veins will kill you.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.740
Pure Kerry water taken wrongly
will kill you.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.200
Everything is toxic.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.120
Only the dose and the
circumstances make the

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.130
difference.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.620
So the dose alone makes
the poison.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.260
If you look at the human food
chain, we have food divided

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.270
nutrients and non-nutrients.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:14.630
Nutrients are either added
or they're natural.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.110
If they're added, they can be
intentionally added, or they

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.800
can be contaminants.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.890
The naturals are what we
call phytochemicals.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.170
And I want to talk about
the phytochemicals now.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:31.420
Basically speaking, plants
have a lot of colors and

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.240
things like that, and smells,
and tastes, for their benefit,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.290
not for ours.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.570
So the fact that the coffee bean
is nice for us, it has

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.650
nothing to do with
the coffee bean.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.820
The coffee bean is
designed for the

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.730
coffee bean's purposes.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.590
They're not that
philanthropic.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:52.840
This is a bird now, pollinating
a flower,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.480
attracted to it by a scent.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.890
The bees are humming around
the other one.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.770
There's nothing on the third
flower because it's quite

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.140
toxic, and the birds and
bees don't go near it.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.650
It does its own
cross-fertilization.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.820
And then you have, on
the bottom left, two

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.570
little shoots appearing.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.560
Did you ever wonder how a seed
knows when it's springtime?

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.480
How does it know that
it's springtime?

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.960
It detects temperature.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.800
So there are compounds in the
seed designed for the seed to

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.120
detect temperature.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.590
They detect water also.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.200
And when there's enough water
and the temperature is right,

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.160
they can germinate.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.500
But how do they know
which way to go?

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.900
Could they make a mistake
and go down the way?

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.620
They could easily.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.500
So they have oxygen centers
which tell them where the

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.440
greatest gradient
of oxygen is.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.650
So they have all these molecules
in them, helping

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.086
them to solve problems,
including the seedling.

00:23:44.086 --> 00:23:46.340
I put the rabbit there
because plants can't

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.000
run away from you.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.780
Plants have to stay there.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.700
So simple things-- they sting
you or they have thorns.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.170
But in addition to that, they
have many, many nasty

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.500
chemicals in them, which the
birds, and the bees, and the

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.990
sheep, and the dogs have learned
not to touch because

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.410
they're poisonous.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:08.150
So the final reason why plants
have these beautiful colors

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.100
and so forth is that we can go
to the toilet and get rid of

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.570
metabolites we don't want.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:13.210
They can't.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.490
They have to accumulate them.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.190
They just save them up.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:21.770
And so we eat them, and that's
what makes plants so lovely.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.190
The color, the taste, the smell,
the texture, the aroma,

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.780
all come from these compounds
that the plant has to

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.570
make its life easy.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.080
The fact that we find it tasty
or good to look at is nothing

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.050
to do with us.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.570
The plant is doing it
for its own benefit.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.330
Now, if you look at these
phytochemicals, these are

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:44.740
three illegal and poisonous
activities from

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.640
phytochemicals, and these are
three which are legal, but

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.310
they're bioactive.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:54.350
So that tobacco is bioactive,
coffee is bioactive.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.250
This is a [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.630
painting of an onion peeler, who
cries instantly when cut

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.556
into the onions.

00:25:02.556 --> 00:25:07.650
So plants have compounds in
them that do things to us.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.500
The best example I can give
you is this Bulgarian

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.420
dissident, Georgi Markov.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.960
Are there any Bulgarians here?

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.300
Remember this?

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.060
No?

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:17.460
OK.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.042
He was a dissident, you see?

00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:21.170
He was living in London,
and he was

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.130
murdered with an umbrella.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:27.200
The umbrella had a secret tip
on it from the Bulgarian

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.890
secret service, and it contained
a compound called

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.140
ricin, which is derived
from castor beans.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.740
That's how they managed
to kill him.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.210
The photograph you see on the
top right-hand side is a group

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:42.010
of British police raiding an
Al Qaeda factory where they

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.200
were extracting ricin
from castor beans.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:53.080
That led to all sorts of jokes
about ricin beans.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.040
Now the point is that, of
course, castor beans, like all

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.460
beans, soaked for 20 minutes,
it all goes away.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.730
You don't have a problem.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:04.020
But the point is if I wanted to
put ricin into burgers, let

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.800
alone horse meat into burgers,
I wouldn't be allowed because

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.350
ricin is quite dangerous.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.930
But Mother Nature doesn't have
to answer to anybody.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.180
Mother Nature doesn't
have to do it.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.980
The last one I'll show you
here is quite important.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.680
This is the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:25.090
They have 590 chemicals, of
which 139 are natural and 451

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.700
are synthetic.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.040
They use a thing called a
rat carcinogen model.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.790
Now, in this model, you get as
much of the chemical into the

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.870
rat as you can.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.880
You let the rat live until
it dies of old age.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.640
And then you try to see, are
there any cancers around?

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.260
Now, it's not very pleasant
and it's not very nice.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.750
But it saves lives because
we don't have to be

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.570
experimented on.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.360
But basically speaking, what
they find here, of the natural

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.100
compounds, 50% do produce some
sort of cancer at some stage

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.490
or other in these rats.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.710
And 61% of synthetic do.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.895
Or 60% of synthetic do.

00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:01.550
No difference between them.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.160
So there's no inherent reason
why something that's synthetic

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.470
is bad, particularly given
that we regulate it.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.330
And there's no inherent
reason why something

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.720
that's natural is good.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.350
Because if you really like it,
I can give you a bowl of

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.750
hemlock after this dinner, or
inject you with some botulism,

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.180
both of which are perfectly
natural, and you won't see the

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.350
afternoon out.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.530
Don't worry.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:27.444
So natural is not necessarily
the best.

00:27:27.444 --> 00:27:28.950
Now, I come to organic
farming.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.500
The argument is that organic
agriculture produces safer,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.390
more nutritious, and more

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.760
environmentally friendly foods.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.090
Basically speaking, they say
they don't use pesticides.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:43.540
You say, wait a minute.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.180
Wait a minute.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.820
You cannot grow crops, even in
your back garden, without

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.980
using something to control
weeds and pests.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.700
Everyone who grows cabbage
or lettuce knows that.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.550
The slugs will have it if
you don't watch it.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.310
So they use it.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.050
They say, oh, yes, but
ours are natural, and

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.690
organic, and so forth.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:07.140
So there's a growing interest in
examining pesticides from a

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.100
holistic, environmental point
of view, looking at a wide

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.660
variety of things.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.940
At the bottom part of this
slide, the things that are

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.350
important are dermal toxicity,
toxicity to bees, fish, and

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.830
birds, run-off into the soil
and leaching potential, the

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:26.760
residue that remains in the
soil, and the half-life of the

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.430
surface of the plant.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.460
Basically speaking, what
you have here are two

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.760
conventionals that score
over 30, and then

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.810
you've got four novels.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.760
Two of them are synthetic,
and they range

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.250
between eight and 34.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.880
And two are organic, and they
range between 17 and 30.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.910
So if you are going to take
something that's going to kill

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:52.650
a slug or kill a plant, remember
it's a biocide, not

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.860
sort of water.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.670
It's designed to kill.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:02.620
So don't expect it to be way
down the grade here.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.070
It's going to have effects on
birds and bees because that's

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.841
what it's supposed to do.

00:29:07.841 --> 00:29:10.280
Now, we look at the
environmental impact, and it's

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.590
argued that organic agriculture
is much more

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.610
friendly to the environment.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.700
In fact, when the British
government commissioned this

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.940
study, the conclusion
was as follows.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.690
"There is no clear-cut answer
to the question.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.360
Which trolley has a lower
environmental impact, the

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.060
organic one or the conventional
one?" Let me just

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.620
explain that.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.980
In order to grow plants,
you need nitrogen.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.770
And a conventional farmer
will use chemical

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.100
nitrogen from a plant.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.560
In this case, there's
two options.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.770
One is to grow a cover crop.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:47.070
A cover crop is of a species
of plant that actually

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.800
extracts nitrogen
from the air.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.800
Clover does it, fixes nitrogen
from the atmosphere.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.780
Then when it's fully grown, you
plow it into the field.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.570
But what that means is 50% of
your land is not used when

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.980
you're doing this.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.330
That's inefficient.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.020
That's not contributing
to the environment.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.350
You then have to plow it in.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.410
Plowing is one of the most
environmentally disastrous

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.730
things on the farm.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.740
On the other hand, you can say,
ah, but we won't do that.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.690
We'll just use manure.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.160
Where do you get the manure?

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.365
From the dairy farmer.

00:30:16.365 --> 00:30:17.020
Thank you.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.930
You got to buy some of his
carbon footprint now because

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:21.450
you're taking his manure.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.740
So when you look at the
complexity of organic farming,

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.230
it's not so straightforward
at all.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.880
Finally, when it comes down to
nutrition, there's been many,

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.650
many reviews.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.360
This is from the University
of London.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.940
And basically their conclusion
is "that there is no evidence

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.960
to support the selection
of organically produced

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.210
foodstuffs to increase the
intake of specific nutrients

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.430
or nutritionally relevant
substances."

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.830
Basically speaking, a
carrot is a carrot.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.460
It has the DNA to make
it a carrot.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.390
It can't decide halfway through,
oh, I think I'll have

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.725
a little bit more protein,
or I think I'll

00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:52.720
do something else.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.320
It's hard work to be a carrot,
and it can do nothing else.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.510
So it doesn't matter what
you put in the soil.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:01.640
You can stop it growing by not
putting enough in, but if you

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.410
put organic in or inorganic in,
it will absorb the ions,

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.570
and it will never know
the difference.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.650
I haven't got time to go into
the cooking side of things, so

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.900
I'm going to leave
that one out.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.900
I don't think I'll have time
to go into genetically

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.000
modified foods in detail
here, but this is a

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.230
very emotive subject.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.230
Basically speaking, there is
what I call the "agromantic"

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.000
side of plant breeding where
it's all very lovely, and

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.280
going out, and mixing with the
birds and bees, and so forth.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.680
But this is worth reading
because this guy won the Nobel

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.410
Prize for this.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:38.710
He was working with
Drosophila moths.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.170
Basically speaking,
he used x-ray

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.860
radiation to zap the flies.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.550
What it does is rattle their
genome to bits, and then it'll

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.280
all fall back together again,
causing mutations.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.680
He was able to speed up breeding
of these flies by

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.180
tens of years because he could
play around with the genome in

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.900
a way that you couldn't do it.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.900
So that was extended
to plants then.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.540
Although this is in Japan, it's
no longer used, because

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.380
there are much smaller
versions of it now.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.470
But basically speaking, what
happens is the plant is hit

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.520
with atomic radiation.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.610
And it goes something
like this.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.400
The radiation hits the
genome of the plant.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.090
There's the healthy plants in
a circle around the genome.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.000
Then the genome was wrecked.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.870
The vast majority of
plants are useless.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.760
But the one in the circle, the
one in the circle has some

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.620
trait that's good.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:40.010
And they back breed that with
the original plant and hope to

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.450
achieve something.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.760
And this is promoted by
the United Nations.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.980
To speed through this,
examples--

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.550
all the rice you eat in the
United States is grown by

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.050
atomic radiation.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.175
All the grapefruits you eat in
the United States is grown by

00:32:53.175 --> 00:32:54.590
the radiation.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.140
All the whiskey you drink in
Scotland and Ireland comes

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.590
from barley that was mutated.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.990
The figure is about 200,000
varieties have been released

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.940
by the United Nations using
this technology.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.340
If you compare that
to GM technology,

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.530
it is cut and paste.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.320
So here you have, in the blue,
you've got a gene.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.920
You've got an enzyme
that splices the

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.170
precise gene you want.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:23.300
It then goes over the red gene
and the enzyme takes a part of

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.800
that out, puts the gene
in at another end, and

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.950
stitches it up again.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.450
Highly, highly precision.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.910
If you make a comparison between
trying to get the same

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:38.080
trait in a plant using atomic
radiation versus genetic

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.020
engineering, you find that you
have about 30 genes with

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.030
changed expression in genetic
engineering compared to 1,000

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:50.440
genes changed in atomic
mutation.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.410
You can sell the atomic mutated

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.930
plants at your leisure.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:55.590
No rules.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.470
No regulations.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.700
No nothing.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.660
You cannot sell the GM crops.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:08.130
Coming to the end of my talk
now, just to say that there

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:13.719
are two types of resistant crops
so that the herbicide

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:16.040
doesn't damage the crop.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.380
Both of them have the resistant
gene inserted.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.530
One is done by GM.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.600
One is done by mutation.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.949
One is very tightly regulated,
and the other is not

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:26.199
regulated at all.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:34.080
In my view, if you're going to
regulate genetically modified

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.810
foods as we do, then you must
regulate all of the atomically

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.690
or chemically mutated foods,
as we don't but we should.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.650
In my view, neither of them
need the attention they're

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:45.670
getting at the moment.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:50.764
And I think that the day will
come when consumers will find

00:34:50.764 --> 00:34:54.269
that it's not nearly as bad
as it is believed to be.

00:34:54.269 --> 00:34:57.100
Now, this is basically the
last part where I talk.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.280
Locally grown food is favored
for environmental reasons.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.240
Here's two apples.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.120
The first one is grown
in Ireland,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.360
harvested 10 months ago.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.485
It's on the shelf.

00:35:05.485 --> 00:35:07.980
And right beside it is one grown
in New Zealand 10 days

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.545
ago, and it's on the shelf.

00:35:09.545 --> 00:35:13.795
The one came from New Zealand
on a ship, and the one that

00:35:13.795 --> 00:35:16.650
came from Ireland was kept
in pristine condition,

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:20.950
controlling temperature,
atmosphere, and various other

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.740
devices to keep it fresh.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.500
Which one has the biggest
carbon footprint?

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.780
The one from Ireland,
of course.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.430
Miles have of nothing to do
with carbon footprint,

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.680
absolutely nothing to do.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.216
Here's Irish tomatoes grown
in a greenhouse.

00:35:36.216 --> 00:35:38.100
That's the only way
we can grow them.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.330
There's Spanish tomatoes
grown in the sunshine.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.980
Those are going to have the
best carbon footprint.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.250
OK.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.435
We have to import them,
so they've got miles

00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:47.180
associated with them.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.220
Their environmental impact
is much less.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.020
This is just to show you that
when people talk about local

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.570
food, and we should go for
local food, it's fine for

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:58.630
individuals to do it.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.270
It's fine for restaurants
to do it.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:04.440
It's not possible for
big cities to do it.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.010
It's wrong to think that
you can grow everything

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:06.950
everywhere.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.140
This is a plot of where soybeans
and wheat are grown

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.220
in the United States, and you
can see soybeans are all in

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.220
the mid to the East Coast.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.460
That's because the soil and
climate favors them.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.220
Nobody in the west of the United
States grows soybeans

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.690
because it just doesn't
suit them.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.110
On the other hand, if you look
at wheat, you'll see that it's

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.720
tending to go from the Midwest
right across to the West.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.370
And nothing on the East, because
the soil isn't suited.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.280
If you look at wheat itself,
and you look at different

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.700
types of wheat, you'll find that
it's grown in different

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.980
parts of the United States.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.070
This is the second to last
slide I'll show you.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.740
If, for example, this city was
to decide, we're going to get

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.770
all our vegetable oil from
locally grown rapeseed oil, we

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.430
would need the entire County
Louth just to provide Dublin

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:52.610
with that oil.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.160
I don't know what Cork,
Limerick, Waterford, and

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.070
others, and Belfast would do.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.270
But basically we've got Louth.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.590
Thank you very much.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.010
What we do for the rest of
our foods, I don't know.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.860
But it's very easy for
individuals to

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:04.970
go after local food.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.110
It would be impossible for a
city like the size of Dublin,

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.550
or even Mexico-- take a really
big city-- or Beijing,

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.840
impossible for them to think
about local food.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.760
You are going to require
a huge food chain.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.560
You are going to work
trade and export.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.160
And finally, this little fellow
was born yesterday,

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.406
exactly 24 hours ago, so
he's our new grandson.

00:37:26.406 --> 00:37:29.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.410
So thank you.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.550
Thank you very much.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.760
I'm very happy to answer
questions, if there's any.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.050
I know you've got to go
back to work, as well.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.300
By the way, the boss is here.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.170
SINEAD GIBNEY: First of
all, thanks very much,

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:50.040
Dad, for the talk.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.722
I know that some people were
having difficulty seeing the

00:37:51.722 --> 00:37:52.680
slides, so I'll make
sure that they're

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.080
available to everyone after.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.950
We are recording this for
YouTube, so if you do have any

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.310
questions, just put you
hand up and I'll

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:58.560
bring you the mike.

00:38:08.294 --> 00:38:09.580
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.460
Thank you for the
presentation.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.320
So far, I've got the question
that recently was subject to a

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.670
discussion between me and
a few other people.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:22.190
Is it good, or bad, or
acceptable or neutral to eat

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.802
meat every day?

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:28.575
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: Well,
it's acceptable.

00:38:28.575 --> 00:38:29.810
You can get away with it.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:30.750
It's not a problem.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.650
A lot of people don't
like fish.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:36.270
My view would be that you
should be able to have a

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.170
little bit of variety.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:41.420
So I would be going for poultry,
and I would be

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.200
looking for a little
bit of fish once a

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.520
week or twice a week.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:50.210
And maybe some dinner with
no meat in it at all.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:53.860
AUDIENCE: For the diversity
and enjoyment reasons,

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.960
naturally, you'd do that.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.980
However, the question is, do you
have any doubts, or have

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.940
you come across any doubts in
your experience that would

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:08.830
support the health consequences
of either eating

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.800
meat every day, red meat
every day, or not?

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.360
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: There are
studies which suggest that

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.170
high intakes of red meat might
not be good for cancer of the

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.590
large bowel, but there's
a big botch with this.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.720
It's not so much the
red meat as the

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.830
doneness of the red meat.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.933
It's whether you mutilate your
red meat on your barbecue and

00:39:29.933 --> 00:39:31.180
burn it to bits.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.650
Because the things which are
carcinogenic, or potentially

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:38.670
carcinogenic, are not the
proteins in the meat, but the

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.700
way in which the proteins react
with the sugars to cause

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.240
the browning, and the darkening

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.230
browning, and so forth.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:50.390
So the more sort of cooked it
is, the more likely it is to

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.650
be a problem.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:56.090
I'm not convinced that the
data is terribly strong.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.990
But the World Cancer Research
Fund would say that we should

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.330
reduce our intake of red
meat, especially

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.580
well-cooked red meat.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.780
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
when you said that basically

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.655
your genetics determine whether
you're going to be

00:40:19.655 --> 00:40:21.720
obese or not, whether you're in
an obesogenic environment

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.590
or not, does that mean that you
kind of think people can't

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.750
make their own choice?

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:30.090
I mean, like they can make
choices, but is it kind of

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.935
predetermined by your genes
and your environment?

00:40:32.935 --> 00:40:39.080
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: I mean
in a sense, the environment

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.520
will play a role, but the genes
will tell you which one

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.910
of us is going to be the weakest
and give into the next

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:49.180
serving of pudding.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.830
The big advantage of going down
this road, even though we

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:57.890
can't change our genes, is that
if we can understand what

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:01.930
combinations of genes are
responsible for helping people

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.050
to get obese, then we have a
chance of going to people

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.910
early in life and saying, look,
you have a higher than

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.750
average chance of getting
obese for

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.730
the following reasons.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.780
In your case, it might be that
you're going to be tempted to

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.960
eat a lot of food.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.340
Others have different
metabolism.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.380
But we'll begin to know why.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.730
And, therefore, we'll begin to
target solutions to these

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.220
people earlier on.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.910
And that's the big advantage.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.910
Of course, it would be great
if we got rid of the

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:32.550
obesogenic environment, but it's
never going to happen.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:36.330
So it's much better to accept
that this is the way we live,

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:40.610
good or bad, and to try and
understand how, by a knowledge

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:44.290
of a person's genomic makeup,
that we can help them

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:45.630
to deal with it.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.140
And there is data coming out,
for example, that is

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.880
suggesting that certain genetic
makeups mean that the

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.180
type of diet you use to lose
weight is best determined by

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.000
your genes.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.010
So we'll know what's best for
you when you go to lose

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.260
weight, as well.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.730
AUDIENCE: If you can go back
to the carrot example, what

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.480
would be exactly, precisely
the difference between an

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.986
organic carrot and a
non-organic carrot?

00:42:15.986 --> 00:42:18.600
Like I read over hear about
a lot of stuff about the

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.350
difference, but what is exactly
the difference?

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:25.390
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: About
50 pence a kilo.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.990
And after that, nothing.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:29.750
Nothing.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.640
That's the thing.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.870
I mean, it is just not possible
to make the carrot

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:38.120
anything other than
the carrot.

00:42:42.112 --> 00:42:48.000
The mistake that the organic
movement have made is to try

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.040
and embellish their approach to
agriculture with advantages

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.570
that don't really apply.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.790
You don't, for example,
hear vegetarians.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.420
They just get on with their
lives, vegetarians.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.310
And they buy vegetarian meals,
and they live a vegetarian

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.670
life, and they don't moan
and groan about it.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.630
You will see the organic
movement not doing that for a

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:06.460
very simple reason.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.420
Absolutely everyone in the
organic movement has a vested

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.630
interest in it.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.520
They're either farmers, or they
own shops, or they have

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.972
processing units, or
what have you.

00:43:12.972 --> 00:43:15.740
They are in the value of
organic, the business of

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.820
organic food, and they want to
pump up its value, and its

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.370
worthiness, and so forth.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.750
So they will make out that
it's better for the

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.520
environment, better for
this, better for that.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.310
But it's just not true.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.470
The carrot is simply
the same carrot.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:33.790
Because if you take the
transmission of zinc from soil

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.060
into a plant, there's nothing.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.750
There's no border police in
the carrot saying, sorry.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.450
You're organic zinc, and
you're inorganic zinc.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.190
It's a zinc ion.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.540
That's it.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.550
Like there's no difference.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.490
It's impossible to say there's
a difference between the two.

00:43:49.186 --> 00:43:51.640
AUDIENCE: So build on
his question here.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.530
It's basically one big marketing
scheme that is

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.532
misleading us, and why are we
paying extra for it globally?

00:43:58.532 --> 00:44:02.320
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: Well,
the way I view this is that

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.800
people who buy organic food know
that they're buying into

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.720
a form of agriculture in which
it is laid down exactly what

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.750
can be done.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.850
So this issue of the horse meat,
maybe if you had organic

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.030
burgers, I don't think
that could happen.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:19.240
Because they have a far greater
stringency about it.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.080
So what you're buying into
is a certainty about an

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.155
agricultural production
system.

00:44:24.155 --> 00:44:27.450
Now, if that's all that you
do, that's terrific.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:33.450
What I find is that people who
purchase organic food make

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:37.110
people who don't purchase
organic food feel guilty about

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.100
what they're doing to their
kids by not giving them

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.850
organic food.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.245
That's when I step in.

00:44:42.245 --> 00:44:45.600
Now, if they want to buy organic
food and say, look, I

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.430
just like the idea of organic
agriculture, I trust organic

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.420
food, I trust their production
system, terrific.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.830
I have no problems with
that whatsoever.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.040
Where I do have a problem
is when they start

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.590
to make other people--

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:02.780
"would you dream of giving
conventionally farmed carrots

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.744
to your baby" kind of thing.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.030
AUDIENCE: There is a lot of
pressure on moms to breastfeed

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:16.120
now, and I was wondering if it's
true or if it's a myth

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.740
that the advantages of
breastfeeding are as many as

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.970
they are advertised when you
go to a baby center.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.656
Everywhere, they
are everywhere.

00:45:26.656 --> 00:45:28.350
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: It's
probably the most dangerous

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:31.120
topic in the world
to comment on.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.550
But without doubt, without
doubt, breastfeeding has

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:40.050
enormous advantages, not just
biological advantages, but

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.350
psychological advantages,
as well.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:44.450
In the developing world,

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:47.070
breastfeeding is far more important.

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:54.290
I mean, really, really, it
really has to be the case in

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:56.330
the developing world that
children are breastfed

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:57.660
exclusively for six months.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.140
Has to be.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:03.740
Now, here, in this part of the
world, the reality is that a

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.600
fraction of women cannot
produce enough milk.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:12.630
And if you look at dairy cows,
and you look at the output of

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.370
dairy cows, it is distributed
exactly like any other

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.370
parameter in life.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.680
It's bell-shaped.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.350
Some are good.

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:20.480
Some of bad.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.700
They breed up the ones that are
good and get rid of the

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.010
ones that are bad.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.350
So it's exactly the
same in women.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.020
Some of them will be excellent
lactators.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.476
Some will not be.

00:46:29.476 --> 00:46:31.710
Nothing you can do it.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:37.410
The problem is that to make
women who can't breastfeed

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.770
feel guilty about using
a bottle is

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.030
shocking, in my view.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:46.010
Now, there's another interesting
area about if

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:50.860
women have the right to choose
or to terminate a pregnancy,

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.450
say, in many countries, surely
they have a right to choose

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.902
not to breastfeed.

00:46:56.902 --> 00:47:00.420
Now, the counterargument to that
is the child is born and

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:04.140
the child is entitled to the
best food, and therefore, the

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.810
mother should breastfeed.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:08.940
There's deep philosophical
issues there.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.330
But basically speaking, breast
is best, for sure.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.120
In the developing countries,
it's absolutely essential.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.760
In our part of the world where
people are busy working and so

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.260
forth, sometimes lactation
is not so easy.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.780
In which case, formula feed
is perfectly acceptable.

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.640
And they should not be made
to feel guilty about it.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.720
AUDIENCE: I just want to ask,
what are your views on diets?

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.060
Because now, people kind of
feel that they go on diet,

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.590
they lose weight
in two months.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:40.050
And then they want to eat even
more and gain all of it back

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:41.160
plus extra.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:41.620
This is first.

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.810
And second, if losing weight
can be linked to

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.260
psychological--

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.150
so you want to lose weight,
and you kind of imagine

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.230
yourself losing it.

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:52.420
And you kind of have bigger
progress than you

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.510
would go on any diet.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.210
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: I'm not
too sure about the second part

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:58.640
of the question, but the first
part, you're absolutely right.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.750
I mean, look at me.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:04.840
I've been on more diets than
I care to talk about.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:09.980
There is a wonderful statement
from the American Medical

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.840
Association's Council on
Scientific Affairs where they

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.030
talk about the five-year
cure rate for diseases.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:21.060
Now basically, the five-year
cure rate for the worst cancer

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.840
is better than the five-year
cure rate for obesity.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.870
You can take 100 people and
cure them of cancer.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.320
Come back in five years, and
ask how many are free.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.630
So if 20 are still free, your
five-year cure rate is 20%.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:36.140
Obesity will be worse
than that.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:46.730
It is a disastrously difficult
thing to get rid of it easily.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:48.150
It's very difficult
to keep it off.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:50.130
It's really, really hard.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:52.340
It requires lifelong
dedication.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:55.430
Take your foot of the tiller
for one minute, and whoop.

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.700
You'll be back.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.950
So the advice is never
to gain weight.

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:01.590
My advice, then, to people who
are going to lose weight, is

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.350
don't lose weight until
you really,

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.360
really, really want to.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.630
And know why you want
to lose weight.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.430
So for example, if your blood
pressure is fine, if your

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.730
blood glucose is normal, if
all of the other signs are

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:16.630
perfect, ask yourself, well,
what am I doing it for?

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.010
I would strongly recommend
that nobody starts a diet

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.660
until they have built a little
bit of physical activity into

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.730
their lives.

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:26.570
Because that is the most
important thing, is to get

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.690
some level of physical activity,
walking for 40

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.520
minutes a day.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.610
Once you got that in,
only go on a diet if

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:33.400
you really have to.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.470
But be prepared for very
slow weight loss.

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:41.500
And you need to be at it all the
time, watching it all the

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:47.396
time, because it'll come
back unfortunately.

00:49:47.396 --> 00:49:49.970
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
genetically modified seeds and

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.550
Roundup resistant seeds.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.810
My understanding is that
Monsanto produced a lot of

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:55.250
these seeds, and they
also sell Roundup.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.210
So they've invested
money both ways.

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.496
Do you think there are health
risks to eating food--

00:50:01.496 --> 00:50:05.210
apparently, the corn and wheat
in the US is genetically

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:07.482
modified to be resistant
to Roundup--

00:50:07.482 --> 00:50:10.530
health risks in eating that
corn as a result of poison

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:11.865
being sprayed?

00:50:11.865 --> 00:50:13.740
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY:
I can't see any--

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:17.290
there's no evidence that in the
United States or in South

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:21.900
America, where genetically
modified foods have either

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.290
been fed to animals or fed
directly to people, that

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:27.060
there's been any adverse
effect whatsoever.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:32.250
And I'd go back to the point
that you have been eating

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:37.230
atomically mutated plants
all your life.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:42.250
They are a blunderbuss compared
to the precision and

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:47.120
accuracy of genetically
engineered foods.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.640
It's not always Monsanto.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.990
It's not always big
corporations.

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.360
Many of the breakthroughs
have come from--

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.440
for example, the University of
Leeds have developed a potato.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.330
There's a protein on the leaf
of the potato which weevils

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.910
don't like.

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:07.480
They get sick, and that goes
back to the point that plants

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.320
have to protect themselves.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.090
The weevil doesn't like it.

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:16.190
Now, if you get the plant tuber,
the potato, none of

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:19.230
that protein is present,
so the weevil has a

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.300
field day on it.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.200
So what they did at Leeds
University was, they took the

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.150
protein from the leaf.

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.860
They genetically engineered
it into the potato.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.510
Now, the weevil won't
go near the potato.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.760
Now, they can only take
that that far.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.040
They can't take it
beyond that.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.870
They need the Monsantos, or
someone else with the

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:39.890
resources, to make it happen.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:43.080
It's the same with golden rice,
where they've introduced

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:47.380
the pre-vitamin A type beta
carotene into this rice, which

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:51.930
will now go on sale next
year in South Asia.

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:55.470
But for example, the Greenpeace
movement completely

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:59.710
wrecked the University
of Leeds plants.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:05.000
They have to start doing their
work in safer places.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.410
BASF Plant Science, one of the
biggest GM forces in the

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:12.790
world, have moved
out of Europe.

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:19.170
So a lot of the technology
will come from labs, and

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:21.295
they'll have to be taken by big
corporations because no

00:52:21.295 --> 00:52:23.170
one else can do it.

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:26.330
I can't see any dangers
whatsoever in genetically

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.410
modified foods.

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:33.450
Every cheese that's on sale
in this country--

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.530
in the old days, they used to
take rennet from a calf's

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:38.740
stomach and use it to help
curdle the milk.

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.930
And because of the price of
beef, calves weren't being

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:42.820
killed young.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.610
They were bringing
them [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:47.905
So they got a yeast.

00:52:47.905 --> 00:52:50.830
They genetically engineered the
yeast to produce a protein

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:54.480
that did exactly what the
calf's stomach did.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.940
So for the last 30 years, every
piece of cheese that you

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:01.440
ever ate in your life has been
curdled using genetically

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.540
modified proteins.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.030
And you're not mooing,
are you?

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:10.530
So it's very emotional.

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:12.480
It's been made very emotional.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.360
And it's quite interesting that
Greenpeace are rowing

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.300
back on this.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.650
Greenpeace have begun to say
that it's not always bad.

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:25.040
You will find people saying that
they rubbish genetically

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.450
modified foods on the grounds
that it's not

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:27.590
going to feed the world.

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.770
Nobody said it was going
to feed the world.

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:31.895
It might contribute to
it, but it's not

00:53:31.895 --> 00:53:33.373
going to feed the world.

00:53:33.373 --> 00:53:34.340
It might help.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:38.590
So I don't see any dangers
in it at all.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.200
SINEAD GIBNEY: We're running out
of time, so I've got one

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.450
person with a question
here, and maybe just

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:44.096
one more after that.

00:53:44.096 --> 00:53:45.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks a
lot for coming.

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:49.190
You gave the example of a tomato
from Ireland versus the

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:50.460
tomato from New Zealand.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.960
Do you have any studies
that actually

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.330
show the carbon footprint?

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:56.750
Because I always find it hard
to argue when people say,

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:57.920
yeah, I only want local food.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.980
And I say, oh, well,
at what price does

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.510
that local food come?

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.420
And then it's always the exact
argument that you made.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:07.080
Yeah, it's shipped from the
other side of the world.

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.160
Like without the study behind
it, it's kind of hard to say

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.950
how little of an effect
it actually has

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:12.696
on the carbon footprint.

00:54:12.696 --> 00:54:15.240
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: I mean,
there are plenty of studies

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.440
available in the scientific
literature on it.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.870
Apples from New Zealand
was one case study.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:27.020
Models have been done of
the food chain and

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:30.120
where the carbon is.

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:36.520
Basically speaking, local food
is fine for restaurateurs.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.710
At that talk in Cork yesterday,
this lady was

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:41.130
saying that she lives out in the
country, and she gets all

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:42.830
her herbs from the side of
the road, and all that.

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.230
And I thought, what a privileged
woman you are.

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:47.330
I mean, I can't see everyone
walking around [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.540
here looking for herbs.

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.355
It's a selfish thing,
lucky thing.

00:54:53.355 --> 00:54:54.630
Good for them.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.450
But don't start standing up
there like a saint and telling

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:58.960
us that you're holy
and we're sinners.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.756
You know?

00:55:01.756 --> 00:55:04.370
I have great faith in
the food chain.

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.430
It goes wrong from
time to time.

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.870
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.120
I have great faith in it.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.450
Eating local is a nice
concept, but it's

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:18.060
not going to work.

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.130
Our exports would collapse
in this country.

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:24.020
9% of our GDP, 9% of our exports
come from agri-food.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.966
So if we couldn't export, we'd
be dead in the water.

00:55:26.966 --> 00:55:28.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:31.735
Kenyan farmers couldn't sell
their flowers in Holland,

00:55:31.735 --> 00:55:33.710
they'd [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.830
Trade is what made the world go
round since the [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:39.594
spice routes.

00:55:39.594 --> 00:55:40.720
I probably haven't
answered your

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:44.005
question, but buy the book.

00:55:44.005 --> 00:55:46.130
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:49.680
Just interesting to hear your
thoughts around nutrition

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.800
during pregnancy and how
that primes people

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.910
for later in life.

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:55.630
I was lucky enough to get your
free copy of your book.

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:57.310
I'm just reading the back,
and I couldn't wait

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:58.960
to hear that bit.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.850
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY: Well,
it is interesting.

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:04.220
Basically speaking, you inherit
your genes from your

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.800
mother and your father.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:13.900
And they sit into the embryo,
and they nurse along.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.260
And the genes are--

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.000
well, let me go back
a little bit.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.130
In my right earlobe, I have
my entire genome.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.350
And in my liver, I have
my entire genome.

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:30.380
But my liver doesn't hear
anything, and my earlobe

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.172
doesn't make anything.

00:56:32.172 --> 00:56:35.660
The reason why they differ is
the things that the liver does

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.490
are switched off
in the earlobe.

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:39.310
And the things that the earlobe
does are switched off

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.270
in the liver.

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:41.790
So genes are switched
up, or switched

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:43.432
down, or switched off.

00:56:43.432 --> 00:56:51.360
Now in pregnancy, the mother's
environment has a big say in

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.920
how the dimmer switch
is operated, whether

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.240
it goes up or down.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.870
When the child is born then,
if they're born into an

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.870
environment that matches the
plan that the mother had for

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:04.365
them, they're fine.

00:57:04.365 --> 00:57:08.550
If they don't, by the time they
get to 50 or 60, they

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:12.220
will begin to develop chronic
disease at a great rate.

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.940
So there's fabulous stuff which
goes back to, say the

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.040
Dutch famine during the Second
World War, where people

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:23.180
entered that famine pregnant,
got pregnant during it, or had

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.145
a baby during it, so [INAUDIBLE]
different

00:57:25.145 --> 00:57:26.690
trimesters of pregnancy.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:30.060
And looking at those people,
those survivors, 40, 50 years

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:34.220
later, you can see the point in
pregnancy where the damage

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:39.210
is done, where their genes were
altered in such a way to

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:41.350
expect a very, very low
level of food in

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:42.760
Holland at the time.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.630
And they grow up into this
obesogenic environment, and

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:46.620
it's a mismatch.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:54.220
A very hot topic, and I'll go
further than that to say that

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:57.320
in the period immediately
after birth--

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:01.810
the example I was always take
is, let's say, my grandson.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:03.200
He's going to learn English.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.410
He's going to learn to eat
with a knife and fork.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:08.045
He's going to learn all the
cultural things we do.

00:58:08.045 --> 00:58:10.790
A child born yesterday in
Taiwan is going to do

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:12.350
something completely
different.

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:16.520
So the humans are born with
a non-hardwired brain.

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.496
Our brain is plastic.

00:58:18.496 --> 00:58:21.170
A colt is born with
a hardwired brain.

00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:22.900
It gets up on its four
legs, and it trots

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.420
off with its mummy.

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.770
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:26.630
has nothing to learn.

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:28.570
You can teach it a few tricks.

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:31.910
But humans have to have that
plastic brain in order to

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:33.780
absorb all the culture
they are born into.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.400
What's referred to now,
particularly in the developing

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.390
world, is the first
1,000 days.

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:44.190
That covers conception right
through to two years of age.

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:48.240
If you get nutrition wrong
there, you have trouble in

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.620
later life.

00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:50.660
And it's irreversible.

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.790
So for example, if you don't get
proper brain development

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.630
in that two-year period, because
the brain is still

00:58:56.630 --> 00:59:01.200
growing, it will be
irreversible.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.960
You'll have a low IQ
all your life.

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.090
If you don't get enough food to
build the body in those two

00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.880
years, it will set your
height much lower than

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:10.760
your genetic potential.

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.810
So you'll be physically stunted,
and you won't have

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:15.380
the physical capacity
to do work.

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:20.050
So there's a recognition now,
a huge recognition that is

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:22.130
important, and the United
Nations have this protocol

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.810
scaling up nutrition.

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.730
And they focus on this
first 1,000 days.

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:29.140
Hillary Clinton is one of the
big champions of this, and our

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.630
own minister [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:33.370
It's a really absorbing area.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:35.245
It's fascinating.

00:59:35.245 --> 00:59:35.800
SINEAD GIBNEY: OK.

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.110
I'm afraid that's all
we have time for.

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:40.190
For those of you who were lucky
enough to get books,

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:42.320
Mike will happy to sign
them for you after.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.650
For those of you who didn't,
you can buy them on Amazon,

00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:46.260
New City Press.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:46.750
Where else?

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:47.500
I don't know.

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.130
The Book Depository,
I think, as well.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.560
Thank you.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.400
It's great to see such a
wonderful turnout for one of

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.110
the authors.

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:52.910
And thank you, Dad,
for a great talk.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:53.210
PROFESSOR MIKE GIBNEY:
Thank you.

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.810
SINEAD GIBNEY: That's great.

00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:57.978
[APPLAUSE]
