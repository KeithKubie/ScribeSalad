00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.710
Hi, I want you to
meet my friend Shoshanna.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.819
She's a Zebra Finch and
she is very good at it.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.729
She's here to help me
talk about comparative anatomy,

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.450
which is the study of
similarities and differences

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.900
between the anatomies of animals.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.120
We study comparative anatomy
because it helps us learn more

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.460
about our evolution and
our shared ancestry.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.189
Organisms have their evolutionary
history written all over them,

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.589
if you know what to look for.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.839
For instance, which of these two
living organisms would you say

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.179
I'm more closely related to?

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.199
Shoshanna the finch?
Or Gordon the plant?

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.599
This isn't a quiz, but....

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:30.970
Sure, it is a quiz.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.970
It is the easiest quiz that you
will ever take in your life.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.570
Gordon is green and can make his
own food with just sunlight,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.809
water and carbon dioxide.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.780
While Shoshanna can't
make her own food,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.190
she has to move around
to find stuff to eat,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.739
escape predators, find mates
and poop on park benches.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.190
Just like me...except,
not the pooping on park benches,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.030
I mean the moving around.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.660
So yeah, shocker, I am more closely
related to a bird than to a plant.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.600
You get a gold star.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.759
So that one's obvious, but as the
relationships between organisms

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.189
get closer, the questions
get a lot more interesting.

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.060
So what IS an animal?

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.790
I mean, I know you know what an
animal is, but when you're looking

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.880
at Shoshanna and me here, what
clues you in to the fact that we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.890
are members of the
kingdom Animalia?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.790
Two things:

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.540
For starters, we're both moving.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.710
Locomotion is a really good sign
that an organism is an animal,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.970
unless you're a sponge.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.780
Now, I know what
you're thinking though:

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.270
Protists, bacteria and
archaea move around using

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.759
flagella and cilia.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.140
But they also only have one cell.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.270
It's the multi-cellular locomotion
that's so peculiar and specific

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.079
to animals.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.850
So animals move because
of the second trait that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.130
we have in common:
We're heterotrophs.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.070
We get our energy from
eating other life forms.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.659
Locomotion also helps
us avoid predation and

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.329
seek out mates for reproduction.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.780
Plants can mate by dispersing
their seed to the wind or

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.469
having an insect come
by and fertilize them.

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:58.979
But if land animals did that?

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.799
Things would get like,
really messy and gross.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.909
Some aquatic animals actually do
just release their sex cells into

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.060
their surroundings
and cross their fingers

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.920
and presumably close their mouths,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.590
and hope that
somebody gets pregnant.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.000
So, since animals have
to eat and move around,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.950
they've evolved anatomical forms
that help them do those things.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.010
But obviously those forms
aren't the same on all animals.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.730
For instance, in order to move,
Shoshanna and I both have to be

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.760
able to apply force to the ground
or the air to propel ourselves.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.959
Here's me pushing off
the ground with my feet.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.590
And now, here's Shoshanna applying
force to the air with her wings,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.000
which keeps her afloat and moving.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.599
And if I had a shark in the studio
with me, which thankfully I do not,

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.129
so I'll just pretend to be a shark,

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.260
my fins would apply
force to the water,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.480
which would propel me forward.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.150
Now, you have to be
careful with this stuff,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.099
because even though
similar body structures,

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.860
like fins or wings or feet,
can mean animals have

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.590
a close common ancestor,
it can also mean the animals

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.330
just evolved similar forms
just because that's the best

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.510
structure for the job.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.800
When this happens, it's
called convergent evolution.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.720
For example, a tuna, a penguin
and a seal are all animals that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.909
spend all or a lot of
their time in the water.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.739
One's a fish, one's a
bird and one's a mammal,

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.370
but all three of them have
a suite of similar features,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.340
the most notable
being a really sleek,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.620
fusiform body that can move through
the water like nobody's business

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.970
and fins for propelling
those bodies.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.959
But of course those three
animals have very different

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.709
evolutionary origins.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.510
Each of these three marine animals
have independently "converged"

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.819
on similar body shapes because
they live in the same environment

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.739
and need to do the
same sorts of things.

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.930
So instances of convergent
evolution can make

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.409
linking physical structure of an
animal to its evolutionary history

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.739
a little bit tricky.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.549
Which is why, for a long time,
nobody really put much stock in

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.120
comparative anatomy as
proof as evolution.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.720
That is, until
Thomas Henry Huxley came along.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.530
[BIOLO-GRAPHY]

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.209
Thomas Henry Huxley was the Father
of Comparative Anatomy and the

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.900
Father of Modern Paleontology.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.900
And he invented the word "agnostic"
to describe his spiritual views.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.310
And he was the first person to
conclude that birds evolved from

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.840
small carnivorous dinosaurs!

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.939
Phew! I'm glad I'm
sitting down for this.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.989
Plus, we have much respect

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.180
for his facial hair.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.909
Huxley was born in England in 1825,
and though he started out

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.909
as a doctor, after serving as
a ship surgeon on a voyage

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.950
to Australia in his 20s, he took
to studying marine invertebrates.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.250
During his voyage, he sent all his
papers back to England, and when

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.300
he got home he found that he had
become a kinda famous marine

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.480
invertebrate expert and he was
admitted into the Royal Society.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.210
Huxley made friends with
other hot-shot natural scientists,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.800
including Charles Darwin,
and a few years later,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.110
when Darwin outlined
his theory of evolution

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.910
in On the Origin of Species,
Huxley is reported to have said,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.340
"How extremely stupid not
to have thought of that!"

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.420
In fact, he became such
a huge Darwin supporter,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.470
that everybody started
calling him "Darwin's Bulldog"

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.420
because he threatened to cut
the fool who badmouthed evolution.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.640
This is a good one:
Huxley said, when talking about

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.850
On the Origin of Species,
"Old ladies, of both sexes,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.530
consider it a decidedly
dangerous book."

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.400
You just got Huxslapped.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.610
With this new tool of
the theory of evolution,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.650
and in part to help promote
the theory of evolution,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.070
Huxley connected paleontology
and biology together by looking

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.290
for similarities in anatomy
in the fossil record,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.030
where he found all kinds
of interesting stuff.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.120
Like some really obvious
similarities between prehistoric

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.870
horse fossils and
modern day horses,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.170
as well as between
dinosaurs and birds,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.850
though nobody really bought his
insights into the resemblance

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.930
between birds and dinosaurs
for another hundred years.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.370
And just in case you were still
on the fence as to whether

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.410
intelligence is heritable,
Thomas Henry Huxley is the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.400
grandfather of Brave New World
writer Aldous Huxley and of

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.600
Sir Andrew Huxley, who won the
Nobel Prize for Physiology

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.820
or Medicine in 1963.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.210
Because all animals come from
the same evolutionary origin,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.550
in addition to sharing
some anatomical structures

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.850
like Huxley studied, we're
also built from the same

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.210
rudimentary blueprint.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.050
Our cells work pretty much
the same no matter what sort

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.970
of animal we are.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.340
So while animals have different
strategies for moving around

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.380
and acquiring food,
once the food is gotten,

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.360
all animals break it down,
turn it into useful energy,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.320
distribute nutrients,
and eliminate waste

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.290
in pretty similar ways,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.130
unless you're a sponge.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.780
Each of those functions is
performed by collections of cells

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.540
that group together in
the body to form tissues.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.340
There are 4 primary tissue
types in the human body:

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.930
epithelial tissue,
connective tissue,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.080
muscle tissue
and nerve tissue.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.550
Epithelial tissue is
formed by cells that

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.370
bind very closely together.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.660
A layer of it covers every organ
and lines the digestive tract to

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.930
prevent crazy acids and poop and
stuff from going where it's not

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.560
supposed to go.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.230
Epithelial tissue can also produce
the slippery fluid to let your

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.210
organs slide over each other
like the membrane that lines the

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.410
inside of your ribs so that
your inflating lungs don't build

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.140
up friction as they expand.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.920
Most types of connective tissue
are made up of fibrous strands of

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.000
collagen protein, and it adds
support and structure to your

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.930
body and holds your parts together.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.440
Some examples of connective
tissue include the inner layers

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.990
of your skin, your tendons,
ligaments, cartilage, and bone.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.070
But oddly enough, connective tissue
isn't defined by it's ability

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.690
to connect, but instead by the
presence of an extra-cellular

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.510
matrix, meaning that part of the
tissue extends outside of cell.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.760
And so, somewhat confusingly,
blood and fat are also considered

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.710
connective tissues.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.800
Muscle tissue is made up mostly
of two specialized proteins:

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.080
actin and myosin, which can
slide past one another and

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.250
allow for movement.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.290
It also includes a
bunch of other proteins,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.290
including that longest
word-in-the-world one, titin.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.340
And finally, there's nerve tissue,
which generates and conducts

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.220
electrical signals in the body.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.070
These electrical messages are
managed by the nerve tissue in the

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.610
brain and transmitted down
the spinal cord to the rest

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.160
of the body.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.980
Nerve tissue is made up of two
types of cells the neurons,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.740
which do the electrical work,
and the glial cells,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.690
which insulate and
support the neurons.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.120
These tissues are then
organized into organs,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.290
which perform different
functions in the body,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.930
and these organs work
together in organ systems.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.310
For instance, most animals have a
digestive system made up of a

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.320
mouth and an esophagus and
a stomach and intestines

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.150
and an anus.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.410
And a lot of animals have a
skeletal system made up of bones,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.940
tendons, ligaments and cartilage.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.510
We're going to be talking about
each of these systems in a lot

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.230
more detail in a few weeks.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.900
These organ systems, like many
different kinds of anatomical

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.060
structures, are shared by lots
of different kinds of organisms,

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.410
unless you're a sponge.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.800
Because about 1.6 billion
years ago, an organism developed

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.650
that had a digestive system and a
muscular system, and suddenly that

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.630
organism was in it to win it.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.550
That organism was the common
ancestor for all animals today,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.980
and it's the reason me and
Shoshanna here are gonna hang out

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.760
at the animal family reunion.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.030
Thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Biology.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.020
If you want to check out any
of the stuff we talked about,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.030
