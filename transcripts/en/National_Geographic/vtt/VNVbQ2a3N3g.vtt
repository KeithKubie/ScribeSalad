00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:10.110
( applause )

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:15.014 line:0%
Tonight,
I want to share with you

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.917 line:0%
something that
scientists and academics

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:22.155 line:0%
fear even more
than loss of life or limb.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.092
And that is
loss of reputation.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.063
So, how do you fail
without really trying?

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:34.467
I want to share with you
my collaboration

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:38.570
with this incredible team
out of Southampton University

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.907
on an absolutely
amazing archaeological site

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.843
that challenged me

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:47.113
in ways I never expected
to be challenged

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.049
and really showed me
the possibilities

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.953
and potential
for using new technologies

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:57.089
when you think
you're at the end of your rope.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:00.526
Many of you have actually
flown over this site, Portus,

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.361
without even realizing it.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.163
If you've ever been to Rome

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.599
and flown into the
Fiumicino airport,

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.369
you have flown
over the site of Portus.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.438
Portus was the port of Rome

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.907
during the height
of the Roman Empire.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:18.778
The site of Portus is a very
complicated landscape today.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.214
You have Rome Fiumicino airport
to the north,

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.982
you have lots of houses,
you have lots of fields

00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:25.318
as you can see in this image.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:28.187
It's a mixed urban-rural
landscape

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.990
and the archaeological team
at Portus has been working there

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.391
for over 30 years

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.128
led by Professor Simon Keay,
one of the great

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:38.230
Roman landscape archaeologists
in the world.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.133
So we decided to work together.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.967
Do you see the hexagonal basin?

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:43.469
That was actually one of the

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.071
central parts of the site
of Portus.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.640
You can see a beautiful
3D reconstruction here.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.309
This is the main basin
into which ships would sail.

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:53.179
They would dock, leave their
goods at the warehouses,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.782
they would be organized
and then sent further on

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.686
to the northeast, to Rome
and elsewhere within Italy.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.088
So, I got ahold of some

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:04.256
great high-resolution
satellite imagery,

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:06.325
I looked at a lot of
previous publications

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.960
from Professor Keay and his team

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.895
and got down to work
with processing.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:11.130
That's what I do.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.467
And we started finding
some really amazing things,

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:17.003
which I want to share with you.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.739
We started finding buildings.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.542
We started looking at things

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.444
that may not be otherwise
visible.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.412
By using the infrared part
of the light spectrum,

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.781
we are able to tease out
old roads.

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.884
We were able to
tease out buildings,

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.986
different areas of shading that,

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:36.456
potentially, could be
other warehouses

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.923 line:0%
or other structures

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:39.458 line:0%
and things
really started appearing.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:42.161 line:0%
I started getting so excited.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.831
So, these were sent on
to Professor Keay and his team.

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:48.835
Except there was a problem.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:52.305
They knew about all of them.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.373
( audience laughter )

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:58.477
Now, my ego shrunk down
to atom-size,

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:01.013
and I talked to
Professor Keay on the phone.

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:04.284
And I said, "I don't understand.
What have I missed?"

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.619
He goes, "We just haven't
published any of those yet.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.621
We saw them all
with aerial photography."

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.357
And I thought,
"Well, there goes technology.

00:03:12.357 --> 00:03:13.926
They already knew about them.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.862
What was I to do?"

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.198
Well, around that time
I started looking through

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.467
this high-resolution
satellite imagery company

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.535
called Digital Globe.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.505
I started looking through
their satellite database.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.940
And I noticed this
brand new satellite image

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.410
that hadn't been
in the database before.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.647
And, so, we got a hold of this
brand new satellite imagery.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.684
Now, Portus is
this amazing site,

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:40.419
so not only do you have

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.456
all of these warehouses
and buildings and roads

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.325
that they'd so carefully
mapped out for so long,

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:48.595
but there is this big mystery.

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:53.399
Simon Keay and his team
had spent over 30 years

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.935
looking for an amphitheater.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.273
A site of this size
filled with so many people,

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:03.509
who were living and
processing all the goods from,

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.078
uh, from all over
the Roman Empire.

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:08.881
There had been incredible wealth
at a site like Portus.

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.884
And for the wealthy inhabitants
of Portus,

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:14.186
many of whom
likely lived in Ostia,

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.722
they would have needed
a place to go be entertained.

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:19.759
Think of it like a combination
of an ancient movie theater

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.594
and sports complex,

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.629
much like what you saw
in<i> Gladiator</i> ,

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.965
although on a slightly
smaller scale.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:29.635
Where was the
missing amphitheater of Portus?

00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:31.904
Now, Simon and his team
had told me,

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:32.972
"Well, it's probably somewhere

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.140
in the southern part
of the site.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.741
I really don't know
where it is,

00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.376
it may not even exist."

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.079
So, we got hold of this
brand new satellite data

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.347
and started processing it.

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:43.816
Some interesting things
started appearing.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.418
To the east of the Tiber,

00:04:46.418 --> 00:04:48.020
this is a before
and this is an after image,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.825 line:0%
you can see in that arrow,
it's pointing to a small band

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.961 line:0%
about seven to eight meters
wide.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:59.264 line:0%
And we sent out a team
to do subsurface survey

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:01.301 line:0%
and what they found was a canal.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.003
One of the long-standing
questions

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.172
that they had
at the site of Portus was

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:09.542
"How in the heck do you
transport all these goods?"

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:12.678
Just along the Tiber itself,
you would have had logjams.

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:15.414
And what we are able
to suggest,

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:18.383
now that we've found this
new feature which is the canal,

00:05:18.383 --> 00:05:20.519
or a smaller river

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:22.388
that would have
probably led up to Rome,

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.657
is that they would have
had these smaller channels

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:26.892
to divert traffic.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.961
So, it would have been
a way for them

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.564
to have better organization
of transportation.

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:35.200
So, as I was processing
the data,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.535
something came up.

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:38.203
So this is a before image.

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:39.638
This is an after.

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:42.608
You see an interesting
oval feature

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:46.812
with linear features running
from east to west.

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:50.415
Now I admit when I first
got a hold of the data,

00:05:50.415 --> 00:05:52.351
and when I first started
processing it,

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:53.785
and when I first saw
this feature

00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:56.188
I thought that has
got to be modern,

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:58.057
or at least
100 or 200 years old.

00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:02.028
It's probably some old ditch
or drainage feature.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.930
Something to do with
local agriculture.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.334
The idea that it could be
this missing amphitheater

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:12.004
was the absolute last thing
on my mind.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.939
I had been so humbled

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.876
by the utter lack
of discovery

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.844
from our previous work,

00:06:18.844 --> 00:06:21.814
I thought best to
just not even say anything.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:22.949
I'll send...

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.517
I'll send the Portus team
an image

00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:28.053
and just let them tell me that,
once again,

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.190
I absolutely do not know
what I am talking about.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.260
Well, when Professor Keay
saw this image

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.928
I was told, and quote,

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.630
"He fell out of his chair".

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:40.732
When I talked to him
on the phone,

00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:44.904
he said, "I can't believe
what you might have found.

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.572
This is extraordinary.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:49.408
This could help us
to rewrite the history

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:52.912
of how we understand
the landscape around Portus."

00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:54.980
Previously in this area,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.016
they had found a number of
mortuary features.

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.117
So, again,
a before and an after.

00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:03.689
This feature, this ovoid feature
is 40 by 40 meters in size,

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.691
with an eastern and
a western gate.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.894
With a clear east-west road

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:09.562
and you can see,
just to the north,

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:10.996
there is a series of
outbuildings.

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:13.933
Typically around an amphitheater
you're going to have rooms

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.702
or places where people dress
or practice or prepare

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.037
for whatever activities
are going to take place

00:07:19.037 --> 00:07:21.640
in the amphitheater.
Whether they are fighting,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.744
whether they're staging a play,
whatever is going on there.

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:28.113
They knew about none of this.

00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:30.049
And what's even more
extraordinary

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:34.720
is that the Portus team had done
sub-surface survey already

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.689
and found nothing.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.326
One of our favorite
sayings in archaeology is,

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:44.464
"Absence of evidence
is not evidence of absence".

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.167
They hadn't used
the right tools.

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:50.302
Now flipping that around,

00:07:50.302 --> 00:07:52.204
the satellites
didn't find a lot of things

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:54.539
that they had found
on the ground using other tools.

00:07:54.973 --> 00:07:58.210
So what this taught me
was this amazing lesson.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.279
We have to be strategic

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.449
about when and where
we use certain technologies

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:07.819
and we have to understand
the landscapes in which we work.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.123
Just because nothing has ever
been found in a particular place

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.925
doesn't mean
that the right angle,

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:14.794
or the right picture,

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.763
or the right new
sensing technology

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:20.466
won't be able to find it.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:23.468
And this particular discovery
is allowing us...

00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:24.770
It's not just finding something,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.605
which, of course,
is cool and why I am--

00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:28.107
One of the reasons
I am an archaeologist.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:31.911
But it actually allows us
to ask better questions

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:32.945
about the site.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.079
Why was this there?

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:36.114
Why was this particular feature

00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:38.517
placed so prominently
in a landscape

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.119
that had so many
mortuary features?

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.187
What does that say
about the relationships

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:46.091
between the living and the dead
and honoring their memories?

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.493
Were there festivals held there?

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:49.929
Were there activities done
at this particular place

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:52.330
that honored the memory of
the deceased and so on.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.966
We also found road extensions,

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:57.803
we found old river courses
along the Tiber.

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.338
We found numerous
other features

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.306
that we simply hadn't found

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:04.410
because we looked differently.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.382
You've got to, sometimes,
when you're absolutely unsure

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.582
of what to do,

00:09:10.582 --> 00:09:12.251
it was only through that...

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:15.855
that just... out of just being
completely down

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:19.358
and being in a gutter
that I was able to look up

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:22.461
and think
a little bit more clearly.

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:25.163
And that is what I would
challenge all of you to do

00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:29.235
the next time that you think
you are at the end of your rope.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.936
Sometimes you don't need to
look down,

00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:32.871
sometimes look up.

00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:34.673
And I just want to thank
National Geographic

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:35.808
for having me here.

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.843
The National Science
Foundation for--

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.911
for generously
funding my research.

00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:41.881
You can follow me
at indyfromspace.

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.148
Thank you very much.

00:09:43.148 --> 00:09:46.052
( applause )

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.788
( outro music )
