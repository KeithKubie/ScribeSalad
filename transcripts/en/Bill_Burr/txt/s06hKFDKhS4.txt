Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, November 21st, 2060 what's going on? How, why? Yeah. How's it going? Oh, I'm doing good man. I hope you guys are do, Oh, it's a holiday weekend. Doobie Doobie. Do in school to lead Bop. You only have to work three days unless your boss is a fuck and cont there's always other ones too. Oh, if you're fucking self employed or if you're not happy with your home life, you'll come up with a reason. Right. To go back into work just to fucking avoid it. Um, yeah. You know what, this year, cause uh, you know, we've been getting the fucking kitchen done. We don't have time to cook and anything. So we're actually going to a friend's house for a Thanksgiving, which is, which is great because they live in the same city as us, so we don't have to go to the fucking airport right now.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       All these fucking people waddling around, you know, those people just oblivious of other peanuts. A great fucking human being, just totally being all about yourself. Oblivious moment is when fucking people, you know, there's a whole herd of people just riding down an escalator and people like the second they step off it, they don't keep walking and get the fuck out of the way. They just, they're just all fucking oblivious. It's like, Ugh, you would just on the escalator, this 50 people in front of you, a hundred people behind your touchdown. Fuck, sorry, I got the game on. What a fucking throw. What the fuck is going on with the packers this year, man, I don't fucking get it. Um, anyway, sorry about the screaming there. You know, you've got 50 people in front of, you got 100 fucking people behind you. You know, and people are getting off their kind of meandering and you're on the escalator thinking go, go get out of the way before we all fall down on each other.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       Right. For any sort of a thinking human being going like, oh, assessing the problem. Well, when in fucking eight seconds when I become that person, I'm going to get the fuck out of the way. So whoever the fuck is 20 people behind me will not be having this panic moment because of me going to become part of part of the solution, not the fucking problem. Right. I don't even know what I'm talking about at this point. I can't remember the point I was trying to make, but what, I know what I'm saying. Yeah. The kind of fucking people like you know was that hard? I'm sorry thanksgiving. That's right. Right. So we're going to fucking pee. I have no idea what my point is. You know what I mean? I just said a bunch of shit. I hope it was funny cause God knows there was no point and I think that actually is the point of the Monday morning podcast for all you people out there who you know who tend to take it unbelievably seriously. Those of you out there who think that I influence the fucking election isn't that hilarious. $7 billion was spent to get Trump and all these fucking people a to get elected.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       But you know that all goes out the window. The second, some fuckhead who can't even read out loud, does a podcast all out the window. I'll tell you if that's true. I'm going to start, I'm going to start charging more for my fucking advertising. You know what I mean? Maybe I'll use that as a selling point in 2017 I evidently I was, I was the reason Trump got into fucking office. Oh, Jesus. Hey, hey, Trump's support. Is he liking what you're seeing so far? Uh, you like in these fucking, you know, you thought Trump was all looking at fucking people. He surrounded himself with Jesus Christ. If they're not an a Nazi fucking movie, they're like 450 fucking years old. Rudy Giuliani. This is like when some old hair metal band gets back together again thinking they're going to put out a fucking relevant album. You're not, it's over.

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       You had your time. It's fucking done. You know what I mean? These guys are going to get the fucking band back together and start singing it. What, uh, girls in a strip club and the devil, maybe the PMRC or whatever the fuck people used to sing about back in the day. I don't pretend enough. Um, you know, we were fucked either way. All these fucking people, by the way, I got to give a shout out to somebody. Um, what's her name from Cosmopolitan magazine, Laura Beck calling out SNL for the horse. Shit that, that was, that was that opening completely agreed when they were saying that the woman who plays, uh, Clinton, Hillary Clinton played La Luhya and it was kinda confusing. Like is was this a tr a tribute to fucking, uh, Leonard Cohen Dying? Or was this a political fucking statement? And uh, she kind of called them out going, didn't you guys have Trump as a fucking house two while he was running for president and now all of a sudden, you know, you help promote the Guy Denya I mean, shit, if I did by trashing both fucking people, right?

Speaker 2:          00:04:56       She actually said it was bullshit. It was fucking hilarious. It's a great read. I'll give you guys a, uh, a link to it, but I mean it's a TV show. That's what they do. They did that to a buddy mandated that the fucking Dane Cook, they had them fucking, uh, host it twice. He made him a bunch of fucking monies with high ratings and then all of a sudden there's a little blip on the fucking Internet, you know, tide turns a little bit and then they use them as a fucking cheap joke when he wasn't even a, he wasn't even on the shelf. That's what they do over there. That's what they do in this business then at you fucking friends. See, that's why, you know what you do, you stay where I stay, right? My little cave. You do a podcast by yourself and then no one can hurt you.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       Um, anyways, um, so I, uh, every time I do a stand up special, you know, and ends up being a little bit too long, at least the last couple ones. So you start thinking, what if we take this out here when, if we do a little fucking thing here and we have to do, and you end up fucking the whole thing up, but you really have to do is you just gotta, you gotta cut off a limb, you know, you've gotta remove a kidney. Basically. You just got to take out a chunk. And I figured out what junk it was going to be, or I had an, an idea that that's what I wanted. And then the director Jay had the same idea. We took it out and it flows and it went from a too long of a special. Now it's like fucking perfect.

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       And now we're going to, uh, and, and all I've seen at this point is just the raw feed of it. So it's not even like an HD and it looks way over lit. And am I fucking pasty? God Damn Whitehead, I look like an asshole and it still looks like a good special. So I'm very excited. I got that done. F is for family. Second season, we're starting to fucking, you know, tighten these things down for the final fucking edit. And, um, and then next month I'm going to start, uh, the process of which should be a quick edit is editing the audio from when I did Madison Square Garden a year ago for the New York comedy festival, sorry, hiccups in New York comedy festival. I didn't almost get emotional there, New York comedy festival. Um, and then if once I get, I get all that shit done right then I'm just like done, I'm done.

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       I can just enjoy the rest of the fucking year. I've got nothing to do really. Right. And then, uh, then it starts all over again in January. You know, it'd be nice if I did cardio for the rest of the week and just, you know, then I can fucking throw down. That's another good thing about going to somebody's place for the holidays. They got clean up, you know, you know, leave with a bunch of fucking food. It's going to be good. Um, I'm excited about that and he wants me to make this fucking stuff and I knew she wouldn't let me just go over there. It's like, why can't I just be the 12 pack guy? You know, that's the best guy you put on a sweater, right? You go over there, you make people fucking laugh to show up with like a 12 or fucking whatever, whatever the fuck you want.

Speaker 2:          00:07:51       You know, I tried this IPA lately and I'm not really not an IPA guy. I go in and out of that shit. I usually drink, just drink shit that's considered a white trash beer and I'm, because I dislike it and fucked up, you know, I'm not into the taste. I just won't get fucked up. Right. And I want you guys to say, well those IPA A's have a fucking high alcohol content. I don't give a shit that. Fuck, they're heavy. Fucking heavy as hell. But I tried this one, it was called the Green Line and I got it. I don't even, because they only had a couple beers at this place. It was this goofy fucking place and I just wanted a beer and they were, that's one of the only ones they had. I actually really liked it. Remind me, living in Boston, fucking going out to fucking chestnut hill and the gray light doe Kenmore Square.

Speaker 2:          00:08:35       Go to the fucking socks. Rich gang man, Joe Fisk. Um, Gary Allen said, oh Jesus, there's a couple of red sox names from way back in the day. Anyways, um, I tried that shit. I actually really liked it and uh, I don't even want it you guys. I'm just fucking talking in circles cause I haven't been home, haven't been to my house in like fucking two months and uh, I've had it, me and dia had been living on top of each other and uh, you know, I, uh, I don't know about her, but I'm, I'm pretty sick of us being this close to one another. So hopefully Tuesday we get back in the fucking place. Oh, nice. Fucking throw out, right Rogers over the top DB complaint and Sadie fucking pushed off course. You're going to say that it's what you say when a guy fucking on a tight end beach, you that deep as a fucking corner.

Speaker 2:          00:09:28       How the hell does that happen? How do you let that happen? I ask you guys, he pushed him within five yards. I think that was all right. Um, anyways, how about those Bruins? Huh? Handling Winnipeg? I was all nervous day. The top two score is in the league. What did we do? We put fucking three of them. Three goals in the second period, right? Who scored fuck in Mash, Yan fucking Bergie Belski whatever the fuck his name is. And then, I don't know fluctuates. We actually went up for enough of one, four to one. That's another thing. When I get back, I got my Bruins and Celtics package. I can start watching that shit so I can really start boring you guys with the sports talk. You know, I didn't see the Patriots game today cause I've been running around. I haven't been spending time with my wife, so I took her out someplace today.

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       She'll come on later, I'll tell you all about it. And, um, but all I know is it's the usual shit. All my fucking friends who are pats fans like, dude, why'd we trade Chandler Joe, AJ, why we get rid of Jamie Collins? I fucking defense stank stowed. Um, so I think it was, you know what, should've been an easy gay. My kiss evidently wasn't, but a, I didn't see any of that. I watched the boxing though. Who the fuck that Russian guy that ego Larry or enough was that his fucking name? Whether it was a real hacky Russian name was surrogate Culver lev, which is like every Russian guy in the NHL Se. This first name is Sergei or his last name is cold. That's really like the John Smith of Russian names. So he's fighting this American dude. So I got to go for the fucking American and uh, I got to tell you something.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       The fucking first, first fucking round. All right, Eagle rer off comes out and he fucking punches Andre Reed. Is that the guy's name or is that the guy in the bills? I can't fucking remember. I'm not a big box and fan. I love the sport. I love it, but a, it's been ruined. It's been ruined. Cause every three pounds is a new weight class that as yet another fucking champion. And then there's like 15 different fucking boxing federations. It's a shit show. Like there's more boxing divisions than there are podcasts. And I'll tell you that's ain't some, cause there's a lot out there, um, that, you know what I mean? When I was a kid, it was like, it was like fly weight. It was like flyweight featherweight, middleweight, welterweight, heavyweight, something like that. I can't even remember. I can't remember the fucking divisions now. Everything's things like, there's like 15 offshoots of each one of them.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       It's, you know what, it's like those superhero movies, like back in the day, like Superman was in a superman movie. Batman was in a bat. They didn't fucking know each other. They weren't all hanging out at the same place. Maybe on the, the super friends, they were super friends. They did at the hall of Justice. But they only did that. They did that when they drew it, but they never had that in movies. You know what I mean? Superman was Christopher Reeves. That was his fucking shit. And a see Batman, right? Oh they have. They had Michael Keaton remember that and he was all sweaty in the locker room with just a towel around him wearing the bat mask. And he got in the face of val Kilmer and he was like, that's right ice man, I am dangerous. And then Val said, clicked his fucking teeth together and then they all played volleyball, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       And then they were playing volleyball. Aquaman did come out of the ocean. Dedi you know what I mean? Look at it. Batman being like, take my breath away, dude. Who Do you know Kelly McGillis gets in her invisible jet? I can't remember the, I can't believe the fucking names I remember for that movie. I saw that movie a bunch of times. I was the one that I owned on VHS when and cut tank. Tank of buckle [inaudible] right. I was in high school and everybody wasn't wanting to get a fucking Ninja motorcycle and fucking fly f sixteenths, you know, inverted. We all thought we were going to do that. You know this every once in a while like a movie comes out and you're like, you know what, I'm going to fucking do that. Right? And then what happens? You know what happens? Geometry, Algebra two and trig. All of that happens and then you're like, oh, I'll wait a minute. Wait, I thought, I think I was going to fly jets. Is that what I thought was going to happen? I'm sorry, I'm going to be a salesman.

Speaker 2:          00:13:53       You know I make people laugh. You know I, you know, I come into a room, I make people feel good. What you got a product? I'll do it. Huh? I you set the cotton potatoes like this. What if you had that? I like the guy with the John Riggins fucking Jersey and the crowd at the Redskins. Gay Man, 44 was always a bad ass fucking number of, there was always a fullback number when I was growing up. John Riggins, Robert Newhouse, you know chuck foreman, he, I think he was a running back. Was he 44 that was a bad ass fucking number. Reggie Jackson, you know, now you, this guy starts, he's got to live. That's it. That's a fucking legendary number. I wouldn't have any fucking hall of famers. We're 44.

Speaker 2:          00:14:40       I've fucked dead. How many fucking, just like skirts were 44. Not a lot. Everybody ever wore 44 was a tough mother fucker. Right. I like to think John Riggins broke my heart man. Cause I was a big time cowboys fan back then. Um, before, how bout damn cowboys and they kicked out Tom Landry and Tex Schramm. Uh, that was just the worst. You know, I thought Tom Landry was going to be this forever. You know, I was young. I didn't know. I didn't know people get old and their pastors and by fucked up right. And uh, I hated the fucking Redskins for beating the cowboys so much that when they were in that Superbowl actually rooted for the dolphins and I hated the fucking dolphins cause we can never beat them. And, uh, when Riggins broke through the line and whoever the fuck that was on the dolphins that came by and just grabbed him by the waist and slid down, I'm like a greased fucking pole.

Speaker 2:          00:15:30       And he just kept running that it killed me. Was it a j Dewey? I don't fucking remember. Anyways. Um, how much time have I done here is a time for the fucking region. I don't think so. Um, hey, Neha, you want to come in here and tell people about your day? I gotta tell you this shit, right? So I haven't been, you know, I've been fucking busting my ass. You know, I was getting ready to do this special and then editing all that bullshit I talked about earlier. So, you know, if you don't spend time with your wife, all of a sudden your wife gets all upset with you. Like, oh, you don't spend time with me and Boohoo who I have fucking needs. Hey Nia, I'm just, I'm doing a character. What the fuck did I do with the market? There's the microphone. There's the microphone.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       All right. Hello. Talk to me. Talk to me goose. Hello. Um, so anyways, yeah, I haven't been spending time with you. So I figured today, you know what, I gotta go, I gotta do something, I gotta do something. So I, uh, took my wife to go see Cassa blanket today while the Patriots were on. I got to get credit for that. Okay. So, um, I thought it was at this old theater I was telling you about these guys on, on, I think Thursday I was telling them about it. Like there was, there's all these old theaters out here that I'm obsessed with where they had the Oscars throughout the years. Yeah. I just think of all the great, you know, Comedians and actors and directors and everything, they'd been on him. I love that sense of history. Right. So you've got the Pantageous, you've got the fucking who's mill, what's out in Santa Monica, the Kodak Theater, all these fucking places.

Speaker 2:          00:17:06       So, um, I just remember that one from the 80s that I always saw, I guess it was in downtown La. Maybe that's the one down the other way. I don't fucking know. But I just looked him up and I was like, you know what, I'd love to do maybe a show there or I might want to do, um, you know, just go to something. And I, I looked up that one downtown and it said a, there was just a bunch of orchestras there and then it said it was Casablanca. I'm like a fucking love Humphrey Bogart. I'll take, need to go see that shit. So we go down and of course we show up in the theater. I want to go into, there's nobody there. They're like, oh yeah, yeah, it's not here. It's at the theater next door. There's a little old couple. So you go up and, um, we're walking around the theater completely

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       deserted. Amari starting to curse up a fucking storm. Yeah. Bill's already getting hot. I'll go fuck down. I was on the fucking website. I looked it up. I looked it up twice. I did, I looked it up a couple who are walking with their little bonnets on, cause it was raining outside. Yeah. Bill asked like, oh, is this where they're having the movie? I was a little more frantic than that. Yeah, but you got, you guys come from the movie. You were old and that was my energy. It's across the street at the concert hall and you had your, one of your classic, you, you, you made the mistake until you started having a little meltdown. I didn't make a mistake because if you look at the fucking theater up and you look at calendar, okay, and it says it was at the Dorothy Chandler pavilion.

Speaker 3:          00:18:41       No, you click on calendar events and then it just, it lists and it lists that, but I think the same person owns the theater. It's very fucking, you know, it's like buying a car. Yeah, we got it this lot. And all of a sudden you're down the street. It's like you're in good fellas now. A little further down. I don't know Jimmy. I think I'll pick it up tomorrow. That's what they did to me. Well, anyway, it was across the street at the Walt Disney Concert symphony looking thing that looks like a fucking exploded golf ball designed by Frank Gehry. It's like one of the most like impressive. It's like the drummer from extreme, isn't it? No, it's a very famous architect, like what you see here? Get the fuck out, get the fuck out, get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. What are you singing? We won't try to, it's one of the widest.

Speaker 3:          00:19:28       Trying to be funky songs ever. Get the fun gout. That one. And then there's the, uh, okay. Some Big Joan is my name anyway, and building my game. It's one of the worst. This building was one of the most like impressive pieces of architecture in Los Angeles. It's a beautifully designed space and bill is just like, I couldn't help but laugh at you because you were just muttering and cursing and stomping around in the rain and you're like, oh, I to go into the gray ones too. I hate that. Super Modern Shit. I've done shows in those stupid symphony fucking things. You feel like you're in front of the, like the council and one of those superman movies where you're like down. They're all fucking up above you and they're behind you. I fucking hate those things. So I was like, I don't want to fucking go into this thing.

Speaker 3:          00:20:18       So I end up show, but it's like I got to take her to this thing. It's fucking raining out. So Nice. All like whoa. Could go to the theater another time when it's a dance event to like calm you down because it's now we're going to another building. No big deal. You know, we're going to go seek it. And then what happened? Don't worry, we show up, we show up and I go, hey, can I get, and I literally said to you, go, now we're going to fucking go to this stupid ass fucking theater, right? It's probably in some small room. It's gonna be you, me and four other old people and the movies, the movies almost ready to start, right? So we fucking show up and I go up to the booth and I go, yeah, I need two tickets to Casablanca. And the person's like, oh, I don't know if there's any tickets left.

Speaker 3:          00:21:03       And I'm like, what are you talking about? It's raining. It's Sunday. Football's on his fucking movies like 80 years old. And who was going to come see dad check, right? And then she finally goes, well, you can't, I should be found too. And I'm like, thank Christ, trying to do something romantic here. It's not the right fucking theater. Now they're going to be sold out. She goes, you gotta go down to Windows. So I say, fine. I kept my cool, they're there, right? The rain and rain enough on my steaming head that I walked over at, cools you off a little bit, pulled me off a little bit and I walk home, I go, let me get too. And I, they go, okay. And then they go and the guy goes, okay, that's going to be $161 right? I go $161 he goes, each and we both were like, wait, what are you talking?

Speaker 3:          00:21:48       So it turned out no way. So this is what it turns. It turns out, I think this is way too loud here. I gotta turn this down here. It turns out that, um, what was happening was the La Philharmonic was going to be playing the film score while you watch the movie. It turns out this is a major la cultural event that basically that was just going to be a movie for a few old people in us. It turns out it's this major event. Every he's got on like sport coats and fucking dresses and shit. I'm sitting there, my wet Hoodie, Humphrey Bogart in there. What the fuck's going on? Right? We're going to view the view the body, Aaron Eckhart like introduces the fucking movie. So you know, you know when you just don't give a shit, I just said fuck it. So I light up the card and I go, let's go in there and then I start getting this feeling of like, this might be my, this might be fucking amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:22:49       And then there's all these ushers walking around hitting these things that have gone boom, boom. Like letting people know that, you know, that whole, like you don't want to disturb rich white people, that, that things are about ready to start, whatever that fucking instrument is called. Um, and they fucking go in there. Uh, we go in there and, and like, it's like Holy Shit. Like we're going to listen to what the La Philharmonic while we watched Casablanca and how fucking great was. It was amazing. It was such an awesome experience. So bill kind of fumbled, fumbled his way into her really amazing stuff, romantic date. And I get no credits. I get no credit because I picked the wrong fucking theater. I just totally stumped. So Kenny and be like, oh, you see that with the orchestra? I picked that out on purpose.

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       I feel like you definitely get points for you seeing that you saw something cultural going on and you're, oh, that sounds cool. Like Nini would like that. And we went in it, it turned out to be amazing. So it was, it was great. Yeah. Aaron, it was bio merit. It wasn't even a hail Mary, the actor, the actor came out and introduced the movie oil man. Is there another famous Aaron Eckhart? I don't know. Are you being sarcastic? I'm being a Dick Right now. Was he in? No. Was he in? No. No country. All Man. He was in there. Get out of here a bitch in the company of men. Uh, was that him and he was in Salie Sali. Y'All. You had the mustache? Yes, he was in that movie. He was in that movie. Which woof, that was a movie. That was a movie they made up.

Speaker 3:          00:24:26       They made it. Evidently they made up all of this other shit. It was just so fucking boring. Can I just say that? You don't have to say it. I'll say, come on. It's Connie's word. It was Rappaport. Senate. Jerry's in it. There's a bunch of buttons. Yes. We have friends that are in that movie, but that are we a Hollywood couple of our friends are in it. That movie was so boring because you know why? Because nobody, this is sound so terrible, but nobody died. Nobody got no, he nailed heard like it was just nailed it. He put it right where he was supposed to put it. Yeah. There was no hype. Both my engines went out at 1500 feet. Should I try to land it in the water or fly back over the most densely populated area in the United States. So he put it in the water.

Speaker 3:          00:25:13       Everyone survived. The whole thing took in real life, 24 minutes for everyone to get rescued. It's like, what is the movie about it? Well, they had to have them have, you got to have the evil corporate guys go on. Your couldn't save that jet. Yeah, but you push some people out on the way over. It just wasn't exciting. Tom Hangs is a wonderful actor. All the acting was great in it. I want to see what it was like a serial killer. I'm so sick of him always being doing the right thing. That's not his brand. That's not Tom Hanks, his brand. He's not a serial killer. Did he die and saving Private Ryan? Spoiler alert whenever he was just sitting there firing at the tank. You never saw that. Now it's not my, I'm not into those kind of, I'm not, it's a warm movies, but son, a war movie saving private Ryan is not about a war.

Speaker 3:          00:25:59       No. 10 soldiers that Diana. Well, I mean, that's literally what is, but it's more of a metaphor. It is saving private Ryan is a medical metaphor. What is it a metaphor for? Please explain. You don't even know what you're talking about. Do you even know what a metaphor is? It's an incredible fucking movie. All right. I believe you. All right. Okay. We kind of just killed your credibility to say, sell these boring and then you're like, yeah, I'm not into war. Movies of Saving Private Ryan is almost unbelievable. Fucker boobs ever saw. Why does that kill my credibility? Just because I didn't like sales. I said so. Oh, I see. That's how it works. One thing has to do with the other. I don't know. You've been bugging me lately. Why? Yeah, I dunno. I just, I don't want to be a dick, but you putting on weight. Excuse me. You're like putting on weight every fucking month. You getting bigger and I keep telling you to fucking do something about it. I have a condition. You have a condition. What is a condition bigger and bigger? Every month I would just have enough

Speaker 4:          00:27:01       [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:27:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:03       Yeah. The laugh factory fucking tweeted that out, so I guess we gotta announce it. Yeah, I'm going to be a fucking

Speaker 3:          00:27:09       father. That would kind of be parents. Everybody though excited for us. Do you know what it is? They don't give a shit. I'm actually, I think people have been people who have, you know who you are. We already tweeted day offline, stay offline. You don't become that person. I feel like people care. Listen. Why? Because it's going to bring out all the people who have nasty things to say about it. No, because people have lives, but people have been actually been very sweet. What? What?

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       No. You know, you're watching those fucking, those ladies screaming at each other too much and the ones where they sit around, you know, it was one of the funny things I saw lately was when you, you had the fucking Kardashians on with the sound down. Yeah. So much of the footage as them just looking at each other with their fucking mouth kind of open like slack-jawed because someone else is talking over the top. Just going. I just feel like when Mandy said to sandy that she, you know, she couldn't go during the nose job trip. I felt that she was upset and we, as the person's talking, they just cut to their faces. They like doing it. I can't, it's a visual. They look like those little pouty cats.

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       Okay. I mean, okay. I don't know what that has to do. I don't know. I just want you to turn this into a Kelley rip a moment guys. And this is what, but where it just makes me feel like, you know, I'm starting to understand why Michael Strahan left that show.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       Um, so anyways, yeah, it's official. It is confirmed. All right. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:28:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       No it is. And I'm, and I'm just going, I'm not going to one of these fucking assholes.

Speaker 3:          00:28:44       You're very, you know, you're like, you're begrudgingly talking about it and I understand why. I know, cause I fucking hate parents. You hate. I hate, I like why

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       one's on [inaudible] he's just the hardest fucking job. Yeah. The most rewarding job, like blah, blah, blah. And you know, and then they all say it, they all fuck. Even like chuck Yeager would say some shit like that. It's like really dude flying a fucking jet up into space. Like trying to get a kid's fucking backpack on for first grade is more difficult than what the fuck you just went through up there. You know what I mean? I think that they play Kate to fucking, is that the right word to Joe six pack where they gotta be up?

Speaker 3:          00:29:20       The real heroes pander, pander. The real people are the real heroes out there. The people out there, they're there. They're there making the tuna fish sandwiches, cutting it into four fucking pieces. You had sex and you didn't use protection. That's what you did now. All right. You're not Tom Hanks pretending to land a fucking plane into the Hudson River. Okay. You did. It's not exactly the miracle on the Hudson. So all Billy Booz bag's going to get a couple more rights and left in before the little, the little one comes. And then I'm going to be, I gotta be, I gotta be so I got to pick my spots. That is that is that the idea is that's what's been happening that you've just got to go on. I'd like a little bit of a bender [inaudible] on a bender the whole fucking year. And then when the baby comes, you're going to just like cut yourself off.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       Yeah. I mean, what am I doing? Maybe fucking hung over and we'll be that guy. No, I hope not. Yeah. No, I'm not going to do that. No, it's over. It's done. But then I got, I got all this great hooch back at the house, so I gotta kill it. I gotta kill it before it comes. You have to like drink all the alcohol before the baby. It's not like you're never going to have a dog. You gotta make space for like fucking sippy cups and shit. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. It'll suck in my bottles down there. Not gonna go on the bar pretty about making, you know what? I'll save some of my, uh, pappy van winkles he had wanted the most spoiled kid ever. When the baby's teething, I'll rub CPAP even when it goes on. It's what? It's fucking gums.

Speaker 3:          00:30:52       Isn't that what you're supposed to do? I Dunno. I Dunno. That's an old school thing, but I'm already going to do this shit. Like every time the kid cries, I'm not fucking going in. I'm going to, there's this great book that I read on Norwegian parenting that says that, you know, when the kid starts crying, you just, you just kind of, you know, you creep up to the bed and then you kind of look and you just go and then that's it. You scare the shit out of it and it understands what's going on. You're making fun of what I told you was in the book that I'm reading. By the way, it's 29, 24 fucking Washington Green Bay. Just score. This is a great cam. This reminds me, one of those old San Diego Charger Games. Are you watching the football game while you're doing the pockets? Well, I don't know. I just thought that stuff that's not a push in the back. Get the fuck out of here. Anyways, what were we talking about? Oh, you having a kid.

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       Um, the biggest moment in our relationship ever. You know nobody. Well, let's see what happens. Yes. We've been gone to like fucking lamaze classes and shit. Yes and Christ though the classes had been great. The classes have been great, but this, this is how far the fucking progressive left has gone. There's a fucking line for when she comes in, it says, mom, will you sign up at me? I'm thinking finally name of mother, name of mother. And then I'm like, yeah. And then my column, like I'm finally going to be called a dad after almost living on this planet for half a fucking century. And it just says partner fucking ridiculous. And what kills me is everybody in there, heterosexual, all in a fucking relationship. Everybody there was was, there was all straight couples, straight couples and all the dads were there. Yeah, yeah, that's true. And let's just keeps going. Coaches, coaches, calling them coach. I swear to God, Dude, I'm going to show up with a fucking whistle next week.

Speaker 3:          00:32:43       No fucking Bill Belichick Hoodie and shit. The fuck are you talking about? She said, I guess she probably probably gonna get in trouble. She said Dad's twice last class. I didn't hear it. Yeah. Got Too busy muttering under your breath about every time she says coaches, I say fathers, fathers, I'm not trying to cut out gay people or people got bagged behind a fucking Carl's Jr. You know what I mean? But what about us? That's just solution. I thought it's inclusive. You're supposed to include people. I'll take second and third billing behind a alternative people. What did you think of that? I'm birthing video that we watched the last one. Oh, Paulie's. Put a placenta. You know? That was tremendous. I don't know. I don't even know why I'm there in here. It's all going to go out the fucking window. The doctors and nurses are going to tell you what to do.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       I'm just there for you. Fucking yell at me. It's so fucking stupid. If I was going through gallbladder surgery or whatever, you would not be in there holding my fucking hand. It's so dumb. This is just classic you guys, you know you got, you got the shit end of the stick on this thing and somehow you figured out a way to drag us in there. I'll tell you right now, I'm staying north of that fucking sheet. Yeah. When that guy comes in and goes, hey, hey, you want to hook up your own cable? No, I don't. That's what the fuck I'm paying you for. I don't want you to be below the, the blanket below deck. You don't need to be below the performance problems for the next three months. Cause I keep picturing my kid's head coming out of your Twat. No, I'm not doing that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:14       I shouldn't be in there. My fucking didn't mash that ass, you know? But you said after you watched the movie, you leaned over to me and you said, I understand now why the guy isn't there. You did. Yeah. To get yelled at. No, that's not what it was. It was to provide comfort. You're killing my fucking image here. Okay. So stop showing your image, dad. Now get over it. Fuck your image. Um, no. So I'm going to, I want to be, yeah, I'm gonna be a sober debt, but on the road home, I'll tell him rip it enough. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, just like every other comic out there. You're fucking heck.

Speaker 3:          00:35:00       I told you my last podcast, I was going for a Boston accent word and I realized that I was gonna get in trouble if I said it so that I had to switch to console. I was like, oh, I'll talk to you lady. Oh fuck. Yeah. Cool. Fucking Ben Bailey looks at me. He's like, Quan subs like that. It's a new day. I'm gonna get in trouble if I say to him and I don't mean anything by it. So, um, yeah, anyone's don't end up like Kanye and never everybody be mad at you. Oh, he's going to be fine. He knows what the fuck he's doing. He was yelling. I mean, to be honest with you, I don't understand those shows. Anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       there's no band. Everybody's standing with their cell phones on and this somebody a rapping and then they just stick in them. I, it's, it's, it's for young kids. They love it. And I'm not going to go there like, hey, you think this is music? I'm not going to be that guy. I, I stay away from them. I'm going to go see Casablanca in the rain with a bunch of old people. By the way, Nia. Yes. Did you see during the break, those old people trying to walk? Holy fucking shit.

Speaker 2:          00:45:30       I actually listened to my podcast is I uploaded my just listening to him. You know, I don't know why I do. He loves the sound of his own voice. Um, that's not true. I've learned to love it. When you first hear your own voice, you don't like it. Now I can't live without it. Um, I walk around with headphones in my house just listening to my own podcast. When Andrew cuts together the clips, he uses the same date from eight years ago. Last Thursday was from November 17th, 2008. Oh, he told me he does that. That's cool. He said in that episode you made a reference to cash cab, which was hosting, which was hosted by your guests this week, Ben Bailey also a couple of weeks ago when you first mentioned watching Westworld, the throw back clip had you mentioned the original Westworld once again, eight years ago to the, to the day. Yeah, that back then.

Speaker 2:          00:46:18       That's what I wanted to buy the rights to it until I realized it was zillions of dollars and I was like, oh, forget it. Bye Bye everybody. And Oh, I had it. My whole representation, all excited. Like, is he going to do something like this? We can get a piece of this. And I was like, oh, that's too much money. Um, he said, I'll be on the lookout for more of these and hopes to exploit your magic. Love. You Love Nia. Well that's all. Love you too, boo. That's all due to, um, what's his face? Uh, Andrew. Andrew like I think he tries to find like the parallel, so that's his homework, not mine. All right. Thanksgiving recipe a. They are Billy White meat and I'm like that Billy White Meat Burger. The other white meat, the other white meat. A, the Billy White meat. Uh, what are you going to teach us to cook this year if I don't get another cooking video?

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       Like the pie crust masterpiece. I'm boycotting the season. I'm the single one of my siblings. And last year I showed up with the pie and waited till everyone was done to let them know I made it. Then I showed them your Wii video and we had some full fully belly, less full, I think full belly labs is what you want to say. Don't let me make a, don't let me make, let my family down. Don't let me let my family down by letting me down. Okay. God, thanks for all the free labs. I'm hearing you get through that set. I know my eyes are always 10 words ahead of what I can fucking remember. I think that's what happens. So maybe I'm just dumb. Um, it's going to be sad when a kid's a better reader than me. Fucking six months in her baby's going to teach you how to read.

Speaker 2:          00:47:58       I'm gonna read you a book at my house whenever I bought read to like my nieces and nephews, like there's a point when they stopped looking at the book and they just turn around and look at me and then it's like more pressure on him and I'm literally reading like the rabbit goes, hop, hop, hop, hop. It doesn't go hop it, it hops. A cow goes moo. And maybe that helps you out there. Fucking old and bald. Um, well I feel like last year like making a pie crust, it was like a real fucking skill that I had. Like, I dunno what else to show you guys how to make, um, you know, if Nia lets me get this fucking griddle that I want to get, Oh my God, this is great. Oh my God, that's fucking griddle. It's like you love when I Cook, but you don't want, you don't wanna. You know what I mean? It's like you like your freedom, but you don't want to see how it happens. You're the same way with food. You know touchdown fucking Redskins. God dammit,

Speaker 5:          00:48:51       because I don't what? What are you trying to do here? You're trying to get like every fucking invention that has to do with cooking or grilling or smoking or frying. You want to buy it and it's just like, where are we gonna put all this shit? Okay, let's list all the shit that I've bought. I'm not saying that you bought it all. I'm saying that you want to buy it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:10       Why? I do want to buy it all and why haven't I bought it all? Because there's no room for it. Oh, and who determined that?

Speaker 5:          00:49:18       I mean, oh, another missed extra point. Who determined that? Nia. I, you decided that? I thought it was a mutual. Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:49:29       It wasn't all right. A buddy of mine was going to hook me up with this. Woke up pellet smoker, you said? No.

Speaker 5:          00:49:36       Well because he tried to act like he told me it was the size of a, of a typewriter. Then would be a solid, and when he actually showed it to me, he was like, come here, let me show you. Let me show you what it looks like. And then I looked at it and I'm like, and what Universe is this? The size of a typewriter, the size of a roof? I said, it's like a sewing machine. He goes, oh yeah, yeah. It's more like a sewing machine. I'm like, a sewing machine is on a typewriter. Can I

Speaker 2:          00:49:59       tell you something there? That's why guys are great. That's why I love that dude forever because you know we do that for each other. I don't know if women do. I want to speak for you guys, but guys do that.

Speaker 5:          00:50:10       It was a sight. It's the size of a wallet. You need a kitchen the size of his kitchen in order to do all the things that you want to do.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       It's a kitchen. It's a portable thing. It's on fucking wheels. It's in the back, but we've got like three fucking tables in the backyard and I can't get rid of any of those tables for the fucking potato salad.

Speaker 3:          00:50:29       You know every piece of furniture I put in the back yard has a function and we have used it

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       in that

Speaker 3:          00:50:36       function. That doesn't make any sense. But she doesn't mean no. You're what you're doing and she, you've become the dictator or the fucking backyard. Mm. You're the woman. I own the backyard. I own the fucking garage. If we had a basement, that's my shit. You can have the rest of the fucking house.

Speaker 2:          00:50:51       All right, so what are you saying? I'm saying I'm getting that griddle. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:00       All right. [inaudible] oh Jesus Christ. Yeah, you're going to hear me say that until I fucking make you a nice fucking steak and cheese or make some hash browns or make you a grand slam breakfast. I've got my fuckings, I've got my fucken. You've been making all of those things without the grill cause I may need to guide. Right. So why exactly. So what do you need all this other stuff for if you're so talented? Because just imagine how good it would taste if I actually had a fucking griddle. Even those fucking stoves that have a griddle, if the thing sucks because it's one heat source, so you can't, you can't have deficiency. Can't move it around. You can't play with you heat. It sucks. It's like this is the temperature. It's a pain in the fucking ass. It's one thing if you've got a pot or a pan, you can take it on the heat. Take it off. When you're on your fucking griddle, you know you want one on one off and maybe one a little bit on. Why don't you just get one of those little electric griddles at the little, the one my freshman in college. Once you can put on your counter, well, when you divorce me. Oh, that's too sad to say if you ever do that. Do you ever do that and I'll [inaudible]. It's a grown fucking man to buy divorcee kitchen products.

Speaker 3:          00:52:09       Fuck. Are you talking about divorce? Yeah. I'll go to McDonald's and grab some extra packets of ketchup for the future when I need more ketchup. I've done all that. Nia. I've used shares for tables, eight pasta all fucking day and pancakes. I've done all that. Yes, I'm done this, we know. Yeah. Yeah, you'll use sick and my self made man, shit, it annoys you, doesn't it? I would eat spaghetti with prego and, and the bread because it will fill me up and it will last me all nights. I do all my spots and I would eat pancakes because it kept me the most full when I me up like cement. And you don't want him doing that for the fucking people out there. Women included. Go on and be one to fucking make something happen and food's a big thing cause you got to fucking have it every day. So you gotta have that shit that fills you up, right? Listen, don't let this little ray of Sunshine fucking rain on your parade. Okay, I'm here for all you guys. I'm the positive guy. I'm the motivational speaker. Hey, speaking of motivational, what the fuck's going on with the PNID ex guy? Did he become a Vegan or something? Well first of all, he's not to P90x anymore. He's got a different thing late night. Yeah. Yeah. But now Tony Horny, he's looking a little like he's not doing his pull ups anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       He's getting older. He's looking like, um, I dunno. He's looking all veggie. Hmm. Anyways, so I don't what I'm going to make this year.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       I told you. Oh, you mean for the people? For this guy. Yeah. Yeah. You want me to, I'm not showing my fam secret family fucking recipe of the best stuffing you're ever gonna have. Admit it. Most people stuffing fucking sucks stuffing that bill makes. Oh my God. It's so delicious. I've never had good stuff. The only stuffing I've ever had that even like me too. I don't ever like stuffing. I don't roast. It's always wet and it already has a bad aftertaste. Yeah. This is nice and crispy and like buttery. Oh, it's so good. Yeah. When you got, you got that fucking barbecue the other night. You didn't like the corn bread. They put that weird ingredient in there. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:54:02       Ah, fumble

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       you so and so. Read another question. Dammit.

Speaker 6:          00:54:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       When the fuck did I become such a package fan? This just certain old NFL teams. I like actually like the giants. Can you fucking believe that if the what they did to my patriots twice, um, one flew over the cuckoo's nest. Alright. Hey, they're all Billy bibbet. Um, it's funny who's Bibbet is a character in one flew over the cuckoo's nest. Oh Shit.

Speaker 6:          00:54:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:33       What's his face downstairs here and old friend of mine has gone so far down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories that he really can't even function in society anymore. Oh, that's relatable. Tell him to start telling jokes. He's, he is unable to hold a conversation for two minutes without going off on some rambling horse shit about chem trails, Freemasons, aliens and all of that crap. Completely oblivious to the fact that none of us are interested in hearing about all that nonsense he reads on the Internet. It used to be funny, we were driving out west a few years back and he pointed out at some lights moving up in the sky and said, those are the aliens that follow me around. Oh, this sounds like a mental issue, dude. I said, what does that sign on the right set? He said, airport neck size cause it. And I said, yeah, those are airplanes you check.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       Yes. And he said, well maybe some of them. Wow. He goes, okay, it's been over a decade of that kind of Shit. And it's gotten way, way worse because of this obsession and the resulting paranoia. He can't even hold down a menial job. And all of his friends have abandoned ship. He has become addicted to painkillers. I think he already had a mental issue, man. Yeah, of course. Has Been in and out of rehab centers in hospitals because of bizarre health problems and is now bordering on full blown schizophrenia. Well you don't get that from reading conspiracy theory, sir.

Speaker 5:          00:55:59       He kinda did a fucking bait and switch with that question, that whole thing in the beginning, which is like a red herring. It turns out he's got like serious mental problems.

Speaker 1:          00:56:08       What's a red herring? It's just, it's just a distraction. Exactly. It's something that you think is

Speaker 5:          00:56:13       the cause of, you know, I'm not gonna explain it right, cause I'm tired, but

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       oh, I got to use that excuse sometimes when I use an expression that, oh, where's my

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       brain? My brain is mush. Oh Christ. How many points does fucking Aaron Rogers gotta put up? You know, it's like Tom Brady, same thing. How many fucking points did you get a score? You just gotta you know, defense. Um, I want to respect his right to believe what he wants to believe. But in the end it has only caused him to lead an increasingly miserable and lonely life that will end in a tragedy and a sparsely attended funeral unless something changes soon. So how the fuck do you bring someone back from so far over the edge? Okay, well he might be exaggerated a little bit with the, maybe he's using schizophrenia as like a fucking filler word there. Like, you know, this guy isn't narcissists. This guy's a sociopath. This sounds like paranoid schizophrenia. This is exactly, oh, Dr. Hill. Are you going to diagnose that on this fucking one?

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       If she written fucking email? Unfortunately, a member of my family who went through this exact thing. I do feel that I recognize it a little bit. Yes. As a matter of fact, I do. Okay, but do you feel like that you can make that diagnosis as someone who is not a doctor? No, of course not. A comedian is not even a podcaster that you can on a podcast done by a comedian as not a doctor. Diagnose this person that you've never met based on this four paragraph email to come in here. So I'm giving my opinion. Either you're going to start a song, you ask me to come here. Are you annoyed that that lady singing about all the ingredients, you get annoyed when black shit goes fucking mainstream and then white people ruin it? Well, I got peas, greens, tomatoes, potatoes. That she,

Speaker 7:          00:57:59       yeah, that thing.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       I swear to God, if that's what my nice little week long run before everyone else. If that was my, if that's what my, which was like I would, I would go every week. If it was only a half hour long, I still can't. I just can't get into the fucking, I like to sing and part of black churches. But even when the priest, regardless of race, when they get up there and they start saying that this invisible guy gives a shit about me, that's, I just, I tap out. I just can't listen to it anyway. He wants he cheeses tcis bond chair that that's the second flat screen downstairs friend needs per fellows help. You're not going to be able to, I let Joel State, he's a, he's a very positive guy. Um, well you know something, he's been out there long enough that you'd think if there was a scandal it would come up by now.

Speaker 2:          00:58:49       Right. Um, this, your friend needs professional help. This is beyond your, um, this is beyond your pay grade. Jesus don't Shit on the guy. He might've just been being funny just because I'm not shitting on him. I'm saying that you're, his friend needs help and this is not anything that he is qualified to do. So because he's not much nicer way of saying the same as beyond your pay grade a buddy you don't, you get, don't pick up your brome and keep sweeping up. This is the job of people with lab coats. Um, hold on a second. But what

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       does he say? He said like I respect his right to believe what he wants to believe, but in the end that Dah Dah, Dah, Dah. Yeah, I don't, I don't even think he necessarily maybe even believes, believes it. He's just got, yeah, he's, yeah, he's become a data paying. Claire's had been in and out of rehab centers in hospitals because of bizarre health problems. Yeah. He is now bordering on full blown schizophrenia. Yeah. I think you just got to be there for him, but maybe just check in on them and say, Hey, are you taking your meds? Are you going to see her

Speaker 3:          00:59:50       doctor? That type of thing. But you're, I don't think you're going to be able to like help him with this hail on you. Is that what I just sounded? Yeah. You know, it's fucking coolest shit. The Redskins still have a band and they actually have a team song. I think that's fucking cool. It's a professional level. For some reason that all went away. I hope our baby doesn't get your add. Why it's worked great for me. Has It? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah. I played drums for helicopters. Still Chokes you and Amos.

Speaker 8:          01:00:30       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:00:32       Add is is a fucking great thing to have. It sucks with some shit, but it's, it's, it sucks when you're in school and you're going to do poorly in school and everyone's going to say you're fucking dumb. But when you get out in the world, man, it's fucking tremendous.

Speaker 8:          01:00:45       It's tremendous.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       I know I run around all day long, have a various, so you don't have it like severely though. You weren't able to just fucking, you just get, you know, even get the lab glasses on tonight, just fucking diagnosed at everything. How do you know what I have at us? Remember when we tried to do that ADT questionnaire and you couldn't even pay attention long enough to answer the question. You have a part of that was because I was annoyed with it. You want to revisit that real quick? No. Do an Oldie but goodie. All right. Built my kid is 14 years old, 14 years old, and he wants a drone for Christmas. The drone market is huge with kids these days. When I was a kid, we wanted to fly something for the sake of flying it. Now they all have cameras attached to them and they hover in a real creepy way.

Speaker 3:          01:01:33       He's not a punk, so he won't flip out if he doesn't get one. His friends have them. So it's not like he'll eat, never use one. If I did get him one, he's not the type of kid to fly it up to someone's window. So that's not the concern. I'm coming from a place like if I didn't want him to get an earring, uh, more of, don't be that kid. I might be overreacting, but that's just something. But there's just something about drones. What do you think? Uh, congrats on the condition. Uh, thank you. Um, I would say, uh, I agree with you. No drowns, no drones with the cameras. That's too much. Th the Shit I would have fucking done, I would have the hottest chicken in the neighborhood. I would've had it out there hovering, hovering near a bathroom. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       of course you would. If he's not, then his friends are going to, his friends are going to be like, let's just take it over here and just see, and this is a thing, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:02:27       person watching is jerking off if it immediately crashes. So,

Speaker 5:          01:02:36       so kids are really using drones like they're, are they, is that the hot gift? This Christmas is a drone

Speaker 2:          01:02:42       for a teenager. I mean it's, it's an amazing fucking thing. It really is. I mean, I can't imagine like just flying over a neighborhood to see what your neighborhood looks like from the air or your house. All of that would be cool. But the, the, the possibilities, the shit that you could do with those things, uh, in a, with a juvenile brain, I don't know. I would be nervous. One of the best things my parents did was they never let us play video games. They never let us play it. They just, you're not getting that. It's going to fuck with your schoolwork. You know, it was funny as I still fucked up in school, but the great thing is is I'm not a fucking 48 year old gamer. You know, like I just think that's, that's really like a, I, I, you know, I kinda judged that shit like after a while.

Speaker 2:          01:03:28       Like, like what are you, what are you doing? You know what I mean? What you want to go outside, like the amount of time that people spent. You could learn a language, you could learn how to play an instrument. This, I'm literally doing whatever you get delta is. You could go out and do the things that I find interesting. The fuck if you're into video games, go ahead and play it. But I'm glad that I didn't cause I wasted enough time watching fucking sports. I can't imagine, cause I told you, I've always said I tapped out after grand theft auto three. It literally took over my life. I'm so sick of this fucking commercial where they show the Ford F-150 with the aluminum bed and it has, it doesn't have any bedliner and they dropped the fucking toolbox into it and then they showed the Chevy with the steel one.

Speaker 2:          01:04:07       This is such bullshit advertising. What it's really is, is I bet the Ford gets better gas mileage because it has a lighter bed and then all you do is just put that to the same rubber guard that comes in all pickup trucks. What kind of a fucking asshole buys a pickup truck and you don't have the bedliner the fuck outta here. Fuck Chevy. Even though I like this Silverado. All right. Thanksgiving debacle. Old Billy Turkey legs. Don't get your kid a drone if you don't want them to have the drone. You're the, you're the parent. Alright. What's that? Another add moment that I'd leave it there. I'm going a little debacle with

Speaker 5:          01:04:39       lady

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       about Thanksgiving. I want my girl to come to my thanksgiving, but it starts like only an hour before hers.

Speaker 9:          01:04:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:51       Right. I'm in a little bit of a Dabbagh for my lady about Thanksgiving. I want my girl to come to my thanksgiving, but it starts only an hour before hers, but they are in the same time town. Mind you, mine's at my aunt's house and hers is at our parents. Mine starts at 12 hers starts at one 30 I wanted her to come to mind for a little bit before hers, but she's not having it because she's got to help her mom cook. Well, this is easy, so you just say you'll be over there and fucking one 30 and you're just going to make an appearance, which you can make it not

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       see your family on thanksgiving. He said, on one hand, I'm super salty and want to be a huge and want to make a huge deal about this because I really want her there and I think she's being selfish, but on the other hand, I understand she's got to help her mom cook and stuff. At least that's her excuse. I know she loves her family, but it really pisses me off because she's never been to my family shit. But I've got gone. I've gone to plenty of hers. Hers offense is that she's never made me miss any of my family gatherings to go to hers. But my family is a bunch of nut jobs and you get the point. A old Billy burnt Dick. I could use some words of wisdom. I'm a huge fan. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Happy holidays. Huge Fan. Well, I mean this is all your doing so you can undo all of this. All right.

Speaker 10:         01:06:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       You know, you just got to put your foot down and just say, listen, I respect, I understand you got to help you mother cook. But I, you know, I want to see my aunt, my family on Thanksgiving. So I will go over there. I'll be there over the for an hour. All right. And then I'll be over here at one 30 in time to eat. And if she has a problem with that, um, just ask her why do you have a problem with that? This is perfect. I'll, I'll, you don't have, you don't have to come, you don't have to come to, to, uh, my family of nutjobs as you say. And, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:06:42       yeah, she tried to get out of going to your families is what I'm wondering because most people, I feel like in the situation, you just split it up. So she's got to go help her family cook.

Speaker 10:         01:06:53       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:06:55       You could go over there with her while they're doing that. Talk to the dad of the brothers, whatever. I don't know if they're going to be cooking or whatever. Spend that time, have the meal and then the two of you then go to your, your family's house for dessert and like coffee and a movie or game night or whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       There's his starts early. It starts at 12 there starts at one 30. So I'm saying, I just, I tell, listen, you go over to your mom's house, you cook. I'm going to all my aunts from 12 to one I'll be back at one 30 show up like, and then you show up at like one 40. You don't even have to spend like an hour though. That's nothing.

Speaker 10:         01:07:32       Hm.

Speaker 5:          01:07:32       He goes, you'd like the food isn't going on the table right at swell. Everyone's going to like saunter in around 1230, 1245 sit down then eat. I would take, it's going to be there.

Speaker 1:          01:07:42       This, this is what I would do. I would say this is the deal. I'm going in there for an hour, then I'm gonna go over to one 30, right? One 30 I'll be at your place, but next year we're going to my families. This isn't like, I'm not going to like never see my family on Thanksgiving again. Right. I would never do that to you. I, you saying I can't see my family anymore on thanksgiving.

Speaker 5:          01:08:01       Let's just go, yeah, go to his family's and just say, Hey, text me when you guys are about to like sit down because she's going to cook and do all this other stuff. So it was like texting me when you guys are about to sit down, I'll let you know where I'm at with my dinner and then I'll just

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       come over there and that's, what do you need to do is say it totally calmly do not trasher do not, do not insult. Say anything insulting about her family. Do not let her, uh, when and when you stay calm, if she does that thing where she then tries to bait you into a fight, do not take the bait. Just ask her why she's reacting that way. Or just just stay calm. Stay on target star wars. Right. You just, you just make your points and that's it. Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Well there you go. So you like how great a move you is Casablanca. And it was really nice. I finally understood the fucking movie. I always got confused. I understood the love story, but I didn't quite understand, you know, unoccupied France and the talking and like Nazi Germany and shit. It's just like they're taking over your country and it's just like, I guess they hadn't, their power hadn't gotten to that point cause it was like Italians soldiers there. There was German soldiers and there was fucking these, these German Nazi guys. I don't know. I'll have to watch it again and maybe read a little bit of fucking history, but I actually understood the love story this time. It was fucking great. How beautiful was that woman too, Huh? Yeah, she's beautiful. Yeah, she was like modern day. Beautiful too. A lot of them back then or back then. Beautiful. You know what I mean? Like, Hey, what he say they're fucking Ellis island.

Speaker 1:          01:09:36       She's a classic. Uh, ah, there she goes. There you go. Sleeping like a damn dog lately because of your condition. Because of my condition. I think you're being a jerk about it. Personally. I think you're being a jerk about it. I'm not. How, why is my fucking leg hurt? Oh my God. I'm an analyst. Those fucking people in the orchestra pit just will fucking Lisa. That one guy was like 55 just sitting there. He looked like he just fell off a motorcycle. Um, anyways. Well I'm glad you had a good time. I hope you enjoy it because uh, I'm watching all the rest of the football Sundays from here on out is I empty the liquor cabinet. So it that our last Sunday out. Is that what you're saying? Until now I would like to do that. I'm going to actually, and I've been looking up museums and shit on the download trying to understand arteries.

Speaker 1:          01:10:28       I never understood it and I find that I, I like, uh, uh, I forget what period it is. It's the van Gogh in the period out to van Gogh. I liked that shit. That's cool. I liked that abstract. I'm starting to understand that. What? You don't need lines, you have colors to suggest moods. It's like, all right, let's get shit. I know it looks like a five-year-old. It's always going to look like a five-year-old. Didn't see like modern art do you think or do you like them more old classic stuff. Uh, like the van Gogh versus the Jeff Koons. I don't know who. Jeff criminals. Andy Warhol. Andy Warhol was the original hipster is brutally, brutally fucking overrated. Oh, hot take and was not a nice person. And what [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       did you like? Basket? I like basket. What's that to do? Looks like saving and Glover. But he painted safe young Glover. Wow. Oh my God. I haven't heard that name in awhile. Uh, yeah. Seed. Sorta like the weekend before he cut his hair, he was doing like an homage to basket. Yeah. Yes. That's John Michelle a basket yet. That's the most modern person I listened to. Yeah, to the point I preordered his next album. I know I love, I got the first two songs either I want to hear it. Oh, you should listen to it after this. Absolutely. As I fall asleep because of my condition. How far are we talking about my condition? Not that much. Right. What do you mean? Like we're not going to get into all like all the specifics. No, we're not. I'm just something the sex and all that pictures. No, none of that shit.

Speaker 3:          01:12:06       It's just like the kitchen. You just got to know what got read down. Just know that I share enough. There's too many fucking Weirdos on the fucking Internet. I don't, I do not understand people that post pictures of their children, you know, because you get excited because there's fucking hallway address right above your fucking head for the, for the family photo because they're so cute and you just want to like show off, you know. But I definitely understand why we will not be doing that. All right. This is probably a conversation that should have happened off of the podcast. All right. You're fucking cool. And um, what the fuck did I do to my leg? I just laid down and I feel like I hyper extended my knee.

Speaker 3:          01:12:53       Who is it that comedian? What's his name? You always bring him up, Richard. Can't I know. Uh Oh. Robert Klein. Robert Gla, Robert Klein. I can't stop my look. Very good. Look at you. [inaudible] saving Glover and you hit me back. White style little Robert Klein. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving and I will be checking in on you on Thanksgiving. No, you will not so well. No, you will not. Listen, we're going to eat at one 30. I'm going to do a podcast at 12 at my parents' house. You can't, you can take things giving off. People understand. Yeah. I believe you or people said money never sleeps in 24, seven. What are some of that stupid shit? They sleep. We grind. Yeah. I'll let dumb shit like, like Bill Gates isn't doing that. You're going to do a podcast on Thanksgiving, what is wrong with you? Or maybe you'll do it the day before thanksgiving. That's a big pet peeve of mine when performers over talk about how fucking hard they work, you know, and they take those pictures of them where they look, they've got their head down like they're fucking exhausted, you know, and then you just, at least to these fucking and pose compliments,

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       you know, lot of people would stop. I feel like I'm just beginning. But that's essentially what you're doing. If you're going to be working on thanksgiving. No, no, no. That was a really weak way to try to manipulate it back. And now I'm going to do it. So if you just want to have the argument now, cause I'm going to do it. No, I'm too tired. Yeah.
