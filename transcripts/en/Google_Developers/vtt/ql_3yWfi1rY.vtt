00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:01.968
One of the things
I really like about GWT

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:04.934
is the introduction
of generics in GWT 1.5.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:06.968
This allows for better
static type checking

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:08.601
in the client part
of the application,

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:11.567
and as a result,
a more solid product.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.734
One of the things I'd like
to see in GWT moving forward

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:15.534
is the ability
to edit CSS

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:17.467
while in hosted mode.

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:19.033
That would save
a lot of time

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:20.634
from having to go
to "compile browse"

00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:23.534
and open a tool
such as Firefox with Firebug

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:25.701
to edit CSS styles.
