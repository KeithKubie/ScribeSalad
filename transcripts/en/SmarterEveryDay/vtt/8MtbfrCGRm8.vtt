00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.850
Hey, it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. I've been wanting to do this video forever.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.820
Chameleons tongues are very unique, and this is a very hungry chameleon right now, and I'm going to see if I can feed him

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780
by holding a cricket in my mouth and

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.960
There's a lot of her gone hmm

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700
That was amazing. You got it! Okay, so

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.540
The unique- that was- okay, the cool thing about chamele-- I'm feeding him again. We're doing it again.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.220
Alright cricket.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.240
I think you've had a good life

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.160
It's time to meet Mojo

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.660
(watchmojo is cancer)

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.580
(laughs) I think Mojo likes crickets

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240
Okay, that's amazing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.860
Okay, so it's a really unique

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.440
biomechanical device that's a catapult and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.160
We're going to analyze it in slow motion, and then I'm going to show you a little model

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.079
I built to explain this, but the chameleons tongue is a wonder of nature

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.960
it is beautiful, so I'm gonna feed Mojo a little bit more and, uh,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.840
Let's look at some slow motion, then we'll talk about it

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.840
watchmojo is cancer

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.019
Okay, this is not a good model, but we're gonna try this anyway

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.809
This is a chameleon, right? Right. In the back of a chameleon's throat, there is this long

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.420
Longitudinal bone that is fired by something called the hyoid bone.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.740
You have a hyoid- it's in the back of your throat just under your jaw- anyway, the chameleon will use that to launch that bone

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.680
straight out

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.569
Forward, right? On the outside of that, there is this musculature

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.889
That's the tongue muscle, and a sphincter is like a muscle around a hole, right? Well this tongue of the chameleon has a series of

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:41.809
sphincter muscles lined up, and it will fire them in rapid succession so that it'll squeeze that tongue muscle off of that bone

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.349
That's protruding forward, so you've got several steps that happen in order to accelerate that tongue forward. It's really neat

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.849
How it works, but it's really hard to visualize with pipes that you created in your eyes

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.720
But what does help you is when you have a really smart friend named Emily Graslie

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.440
And you can just randomly text her: "I was wondering if you guys have a chameleon skeleton?" To which she replies:

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.620
"I'm certain

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.348
we do."

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:05.180
Hey guys

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.060
It's Emily Graslie from The Brain Scoop here at the Field Museum in Chicago

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.319
and I wanted to show you a

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.969
Chameleon that's been prepared in a really special way that allows you to see all of the bones in the specimen that are still intact

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.959
And it's a process that we call diaphonization or clearing and staining

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.820
This is what this process looks like. It looks as though the specimen is just a skeleton

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.329
But actually there's still tissue that is on all the bones. It's just been

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.099
processed with an enzyme that makes it clear and then the specimen sits in glycerin, which has the same refractive index as

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.660
The tissue in the animal so you don't get any sort of reflection

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.569
and then here you can see the hyoid bone and

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.210
here's some of the cartilage of the

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.568
Trachea of the windpipe, and then the hyoid bone

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.999
Which is three bones put together. You can even see some of that other blue cartilage down there, and then wrapped around it

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.069
That's actually the tongue. That's still in place

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.405
resting on the hyoid bone.

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:03.478
As soon as Emily sent me this footage

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.410
Everything became clear. You've got a two-bar mechanical linkage-

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.469
just like I learned about in engineering school- in the throat of the chameleon. You can see that U-shape bone in the back fold

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.009
Up and back as he sticks that bone in and out. It's amazing!

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.949
You've got those muscles on the outside of that linear bone

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.440
You can see the sphincters fire  to squirt that tongue off the end of it. It's amazing! Anyway-

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:32.579
Let's watch the high-speed together and see if you can identify each individual step in the process in order to attack this cricket

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.579
On this shot the shadows are perfect

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.030
So they reveal exactly what's going on with a hyoid bone. It's operating exactly like a mechanical bar linkage.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.019
All right, I hope you enjoyed this episode of "Smarter Every Day"

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.200
You know how the internet works-sometimes a sponsor will sponsor a video

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.950
Well this one was sponsored by KiwiCo. If you watched "Smarter Every Day" for any length of time,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.840
You know I love their products.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.600
I reached out to them. They sponsored when they were called Kiwi Crate,

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.529
But that's the name of one of their products, so now they changed their name to KiwiCo

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:26.940
Different boxes are focused on different ages in different stages of development. For example, they have a new box called a "cricket crate"

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.720
That's focused on 2+,  so my daughter's excited-  she gets to have one for herself now.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.300
"I got these" 
"What do you got?"
"I got all of these!"

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.800
 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.960
"Oh my goodness!

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.647
Are you- are you serious? You're going to make rockets?

00:07:41.647 --> 00:07:42.850
Man! It's a rocket!

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.500
I might steal this from you."

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.719
If you want to do this go to KiwiCo.com/smarter

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.100
Get the first box for free, you just pay shipping. This is completely worth it

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:56.619
and it is great for a kid's mind. As a dad, I love this because it gives my kids hands-on developmental time

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.179
It's better than screen time. We enjoy it. My son, for example. He likes tinker crates

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.430
He learns about engineering. My daughter loves art

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.520
So we do the doodle crate for her. She even keeps the old boxes and goes back through them sometimes. This is a blast

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.140
You will love it. I highly recommend it. Go to KiwiCo.com/smarter

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.320
These make great gifts

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.500
It's like giving the kid a gift every single month, and the gift is "learning."

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:25.630
Thanks to KiwiCo for sponsoring "Smarter Every Day" and give my family some quality time together. We really appreciate it.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.380
A big thanks to Emily Graslie from The Brain Scoop. She's got a great YouTube channel, you should check it out.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.700
She basically takes some part animals all the time. You should go look at that. It's called The Brain Scoop.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.160
You'll love it.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.589
Also a big thanks to Drew who is Mojo's human. Drew takes care of Mojo and

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:39.820
he does a really good job at it

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.500
"How many crickets will Mojo eat?"
"He'll eat about 10 to 15 a day."

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.669
"So what other- what other things

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.170
do you feed him? Just crickets?"

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.670
"Just crickets. He'll eat

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.829
hornworms, cicadas, butterflies, moths."

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.820
"You're feeding butterflies??"

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.080
I hope this video earned your subscription.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.429
I'm gonna put a link right here beside Mojo. If you feel like this video has earned it

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.720
Please click the subscribe link

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.250
I'm not gonna know if you click it or not

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.559
But Mojo is gonna be sitting there with a look of disapproval until you actually subscribe to "Smarter Every Day."

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.980
So I don't know, whatever you want to do, but Mojo's watching. Here we go.
