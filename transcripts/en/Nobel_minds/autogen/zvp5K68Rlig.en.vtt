we there's a way to eat a diet a dietary
 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.180
we there's a way to eat a diet a dietary
pattern that fulfills our nutrient needs

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190
pattern that fulfills our nutrient needs
 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.160
pattern that fulfills our nutrient needs
and and promotes health but I think we

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170
and and promotes health but I think we
 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.350
and and promotes health but I think we
have to realize we are not alone on the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360
have to realize we are not alone on the
 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.970
have to realize we are not alone on the
planet we have to have multiple goals

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980
planet we have to have multiple goals
 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.580
planet we have to have multiple goals
about the way we eat the planet being

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590
about the way we eat the planet being
 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.090
about the way we eat the planet being
the one issue when we think about

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100
the one issue when we think about
 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.860
the one issue when we think about
healthy diets we want to also be

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870
healthy diets we want to also be
 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.640
healthy diets we want to also be
thinking about planetary health now when

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650
thinking about planetary health now when
 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.860
thinking about planetary health now when
you start to think about how important

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870
you start to think about how important
 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.030
you start to think about how important
food is in our culture how food is so

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040
food is in our culture how food is so
 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.330
food is in our culture how food is so
globalized we start thinking about

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340
globalized we start thinking about
 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.220
globalized we start thinking about
health of societies and that means

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230
health of societies and that means
 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.980
health of societies and that means
equitable access to foods so to me when

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990
equitable access to foods so to me when
 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.720
equitable access to foods so to me when
I think about diet I don't only think

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730
I think about diet I don't only think
 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:20.080
I think about diet I don't only think
about human health or promoting the and

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090
about human health or promoting the and
 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.090
about human health or promoting the and
ensuring that we meet our nutrient

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100
ensuring that we meet our nutrient
 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.500
ensuring that we meet our nutrient
requirements but we're thinking about

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510
requirements but we're thinking about
 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.840
requirements but we're thinking about
planetary health we're thinking about

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850
planetary health we're thinking about
 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.930
planetary health we're thinking about
economic health we're thinking about

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940
economic health we're thinking about
 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.090
economic health we're thinking about
socio-cultural health so I think about

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100
socio-cultural health so I think about
 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.040
socio-cultural health so I think about
it as a multi-dimensional issue I know

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050
it as a multi-dimensional issue I know
 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.200
it as a multi-dimensional issue I know
Marian does as well thank you gave that

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210
Marian does as well thank you gave that
 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.660
Marian does as well thank you gave that
she gave you the answer that that you

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670
she gave you the answer that that you
 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.610
she gave you the answer that that you
asked for but I think we need to start

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620
asked for but I think we need to start
 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.520
asked for but I think we need to start
thinking about the way we eat and how it

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530
thinking about the way we eat and how it
 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.880
thinking about the way we eat and how it
affects multiple issues of our society

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890
affects multiple issues of our society
 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.060
affects multiple issues of our society
not just our own health but but so how

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070
not just our own health but but so how
 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.010
not just our own health but but so how
different these roses and what we eat

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020
different these roses and what we eat
 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.150
different these roses and what we eat
also becomes important yeah and and for

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160
also becomes important yeah and and for
 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.700
also becomes important yeah and and for
some of we can put costs on human health

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710
some of we can put costs on human health
 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.520
some of we can put costs on human health
we can put costs on some issues around

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530
we can put costs on some issues around
 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.530
we can put costs on some issues around
climate change but there's a lot of

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540
climate change but there's a lot of
 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.470
climate change but there's a lot of
other things we don't have true kaustubh

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480
other things we don't have true kaustubh
 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.140
other things we don't have true kaustubh
we don't know the cost of biodiversity

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150
we don't know the cost of biodiversity
 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.010
we don't know the cost of biodiversity
loss for example which then allows for

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020
loss for example which then allows for
 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.990
loss for example which then allows for
us to eat a variety of foods it's very

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000
us to eat a variety of foods it's very
 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.180
us to eat a variety of foods it's very
hard to cost some of these things so it

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190
hard to cost some of these things so it
 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.270
hard to cost some of these things so it
makes it less important if we can't put

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280
makes it less important if we can't put
 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.270
makes it less important if we can't put
an economic piece or a price tag to it

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280
an economic piece or a price tag to it
 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.820
an economic piece or a price tag to it
particularly for politicians they don't

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830
particularly for politicians they don't
 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.130
particularly for politicians they don't
see an economic cost to these things

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.140
see an economic cost to these things
 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.010
see an economic cost to these things
it's very hard to them

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020
it's very hard to them
 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.140
it's very hard to them
push them to to change so we know some

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150
push them to to change so we know some
 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.520
push them to to change so we know some
of the costs of human health but even

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530
of the costs of human health but even
 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.580
of the costs of human health but even
that it's a guessing game on the obesity

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.590
that it's a guessing game on the obesity
 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.379
that it's a guessing game on the obesity
we have certain price tags of what it

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:41.389
we have certain price tags of what it
 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:42.850
we have certain price tags of what it
could potentially cost the healthcare

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:42.860
could potentially cost the healthcare
 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.760
could potentially cost the healthcare

tags to the way we eat that we don't
 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.330

even healthy diets we know that the

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:54.860
even healthy diets we know that the
 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.460
even healthy diets we know that the
Mediterranean diet while healthy that

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:54.470
demand so consumers have more power than
 

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.620

worked that way so if you created a big

00:16:59.740 --> 00:16:59.750
worked that way so if you created a big

demand for healthy foods industry will

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:03.740
demand for healthy foods industry will
 

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.010
demand for healthy foods industry will
answer to that and I think it's it's

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:06.020
answer to that and I think it's it's
 

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.299
answer to that and I think it's it's
it's something that we need to think

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:07.309
it's something that we need to think
 

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:10.150
it's something that we need to think
about so and and we've seen these shifts

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160
about so and and we've seen these shifts
 

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.160
about so and and we've seen these shifts
in diet patterns we've seen these

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.170
in diet patterns we've seen these
 

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.350

changes happen where demand has really
 

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.230
changes happen where demand has really
shifted the supply so I you know we

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240
shifted the supply so I you know we
 

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.910
shifted the supply so I you know we

I agree that there's the nudges and
 

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.470
I agree that there's the nudges and
there's the individual changes of the

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480
there's the individual changes of the
 

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.210
there's the individual changes of the
consumer engaging with a food

environment where there then they have

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.050
environment where there then they have
 

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.410
environment where there then they have
preferences they have choices sometimes

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:32.420
preferences they have choices sometimes
 

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.500
preferences they have choices sometimes
very few sometimes a lot but then we do

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:35.510
very few sometimes a lot but then we do
 

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.690
very few sometimes a lot but then we do
have these macro things that need to

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:37.700
have these macro things that need to
 

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.640
have these macro things that need to
change of what marion was talking about

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:39.650
change of what marion was talking about
 

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.200
change of what marion was talking about
we need to think about government

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:41.210
we need to think about government
 

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.750
we need to think about government
policies we need to think about the role

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760
policies we need to think about the role
 

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.460

of industry how do we hold them

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:45.470
of industry how do we hold them
 

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:47.350

accountable to ensuring that the food

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:47.360
accountable to ensuring that the food
 

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.610
accountable to ensuring that the food
system is healthier trade big issues on

dictate the kind of foods it's moving
 

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.910
dictate the kind of foods it's moving
around the world so we have these macro

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920
around the world so we have these macro
 

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.950
around the world so we have these macro
issues that we need to deal with along

00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960
issues that we need to deal with along
 

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.040
issues that we need to deal with along
with these more individual type issues

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.050
with these more individual type issues
 

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.020
with these more individual type issues
and as Marion said it's kind of the top

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:05.030
and as Marion said it's kind of the top
 

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.300
and as Marion said it's kind of the top
and bottom we need all of it and that's

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:07.310
and bottom we need all of it and that's
 

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.620
and bottom we need all of it and that's
what makes working in food systems

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:10.630
what makes working in food systems
 

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.810
what makes working in food systems
research so complicated but I think we

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:13.820
research so complicated but I think we
 

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.110
research so complicated but I think we
need to start addressing the complex and

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:17.120
need to start addressing the complex and
 

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.430
need to start addressing the complex and
being okay with having lots of solutions

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440
being okay with having lots of solutions
 

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.730
being okay with having lots of solutions
and not just one solution there needs to

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:24.740
and not just one solution there needs to
 

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.900
and not just one solution there needs to
be a lot of things that we're doing

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:26.910
be a lot of things that we're doing
 

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.670
be a lot of things that we're doing
and people are never comfortable with

a bio fortified crop or of course you

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760
a bio fortified crop or of course you
 

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.160
a bio fortified crop or of course you
know it's easier to do kind of these

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:37.170
know it's easier to do kind of these
 

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.380
know it's easier to do kind of these
silver bullet approaches but we know

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:39.390
silver bullet approaches but we know
 

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.740
silver bullet approaches but we know
after 4050 years of working in food and

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:42.750
after 4050 years of working in food and
 

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.990

that's not working we need to embrace
 

00:38:47.609 --> 00:38:51.140
that's not working we need to embrace

addressed it the way we hoped for
 

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.470
addressed it the way we hoped for
because we all hope forcing a single

and go to the shop and or talk to our

00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619
and go to the shop and or talk to our
 

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:07.250
and go to the shop and or talk to our
politicians as on what we've learned is

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260
politicians as on what we've learned is
 

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.670
politicians as on what we've learned is
that the food system the food politics

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680
that the food system the food politics
 

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.440
that the food system the food politics
the health problems on earth and the the

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:15.450
the health problems on earth and the the
 

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.950
the health problems on earth and the the
problem regarding the the planet itself

problem regarding the the planet itself
 

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.299
problem regarding the the planet itself
is so interconnected and complicated so

00:40:23.299 --> 00:40:23.309
is so interconnected and complicated so
 

00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:26.170
is so interconnected and complicated so
we need a broad approach to this problem

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:26.180
we need a broad approach to this problem
 

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.839
we need a broad approach to this problem
but as as we are understanding that I

00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:29.849
but as as we are understanding that I
 

00:40:29.849 --> 00:40:31.400
but as as we are understanding that I
think we have taken the first step

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:31.410
think we have taken the first step
 

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.750
think we have taken the first step
haven't we yeah so in in five years when

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760
haven't we yeah so in in five years when
 

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.630
haven't we yeah so in in five years when
you come back to stop on please when you

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640
you come back to stop on please when you
 

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.220
you come back to stop on please when you
come back in five years and ten

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:40.230
come back in five years and ten
 

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.960
come back in five years and ten
years oh now here comes the Nobel

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:41.970
years oh now here comes the Nobel
 

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.910
years oh now here comes the Nobel
laureate again what will be the

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920
laureate again what will be the
 

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.890
laureate again what will be the
difference do you think do you think we

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:48.900
difference do you think do you think we
 

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.380
difference do you think do you think we
will be by certain that case what will

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:51.390
will be by certain that case what will
 

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.060
will be by certain that case what will
have risen and this is the biggest

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.070
have risen and this is the biggest
 

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.890
have risen and this is the biggest
problem I think you have to play

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900
problem I think you have to play
 

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.170
problem I think you have to play
something about the population increase

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180
something about the population increase
 

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.480
something about the population increase
yeah and we cannot I mean the planet is

00:40:59.480 --> 00:40:59.490
yeah and we cannot I mean the planet is
 

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.090
yeah and we cannot I mean the planet is
full yeah and the country is taken and

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:02.100
full yeah and the country is taken and
 

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.120
full yeah and the country is taken and
this is I would like to I think it's

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.130
this is I would like to I think it's
 

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:06.710
this is I would like to I think it's
really important also to think about

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720
really important also to think about
 

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.960
really important also to think about
agricultural development because the

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:08.970
agricultural development because the
 

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.540
agricultural development because the
land is limited we cannot break we

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:11.550
land is limited we cannot break we
 

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.870
land is limited we cannot break we
cannot increase the deformable country

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880
cannot increase the deformable country
 

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.020
cannot increase the deformable country
inside so we have to learn how to I mean

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:18.030
inside so we have to learn how to I mean
 

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.540
inside so we have to learn how to I mean
