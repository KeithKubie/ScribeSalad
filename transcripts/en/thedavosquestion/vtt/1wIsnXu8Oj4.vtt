00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670
&gt;&gt; China can help in the worldwide economic
recovery by importing more

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.019
goods from other countries.
Traditionally, the Chinese economy has been

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.699
driven by exports but we
see now an internal boom, and to the extent

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.349
that that internal boom can
help bring in more exports -- um, more imports

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.359
from other countries
then that clearly would help.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.740
I wouldn't say that the Chinese market by
itself can be as powerful a

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.110
locomotive for global growth as the US consumer,
but unfortunately, the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.560
US consumer is very lethargic now.
We need a different impetus and China is the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.050
probably the best
alternative out there.
