00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.590
So for this quiz, your goal is to

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.870
predict the value of each expression. Try to figure

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.650
out the answer yourself. You can definitely try

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.700
evaluating in the Python interpreter to check that it's

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.980
correct. So, the first expression is 12 modulo

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.255
3, the second expression is ord, the character a,

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.510
modulo ord the character a. And you should

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.450
see if you can solve this, without actually figuring

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.690
out what the value of ord a is. And the third

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.460
question is ord of z plus 3 modulo ord of z.
