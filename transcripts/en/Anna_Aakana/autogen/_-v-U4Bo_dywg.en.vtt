00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.220
It's a new year! And that means your resolutions are...

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.240
OH MY GOD MY RESOLUTIONS

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.940
(mutters) shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.480
(GASPS)

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.260
Oh yeah, they're dead.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.640
Totally forgot about them and now they're dead...

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.300
(awkwardly closes door)

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.480
But don't worry, even if your resolutions are freaking dead, it's never too late to re-evaluate

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.500
Everything you've ever known and see if there's a better way!

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.780
I do it all the time.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.840
In fact, when I was 13, I came up with both a life philosophy,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.580
And a method for evaluating my life and seeing if I was actually

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.040
aligned with the person that I wanted to be in the life that I wanted to create.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.600
and it is actually surprisingly easy.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.500
I've stuck with it for the last 15 years and I don't know why I have never talked about it

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.320
BUT HERE IT IS!

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.640
When I really started to look at my long life of 13 whole years,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.980
I realized I could approach it categorically.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.260
I saw life broken down into the following areas:

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.800
emotional, intellectual, spiritual, mental, physical, artistic and financial.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
Now in each of these categories, figure out what the ideal 'you' looks like.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.000
Try to be very specific about what the best 'you' does.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.660
For intellectual, that means I learned two new skills and read 70 books a year.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.420
For my mental health, I meditate twice a day for 20 minutes and see a therapist at least once a month.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.140
For emotional, I see friends at least twice a week

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.480
and engage in a hobby that has nothing to do with my work life that I get to do just for fun.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
For physical, I workout three to four times a week and gain my left split.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.560
For spiritual, I read more philosophy in Buddhist books and constantly contemplate my mortality and what it means to me.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.780
For artistic, I write a short story per month,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.620
experiment in new mediums throughout the year, and I aim to complete two longer short films a year.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.760
And for financial health, I save 10% of my paycheck,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.560
donate 10% of my money to charities and make consistent contributions to my IRA.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.120
Sometimes, these will overlap and those are the ones that you should definitely pay special attention to.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.000
For example, therapy will help both mental and emotional health.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.520
Yoga benefits someone mentally and physically.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.540
Exercise helps emotional and physical areas and so on, and so on (woohoo!)

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.760
Now, take a look at the big picture.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.380
How in line are you with this vision that you've created?

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.140
And if not, how can you be more balanced in your life and work on the areas that are weak?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.720
I've done this every year for like, forever,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.080
And I supplement this little bubble map with a vision board so that I can always check in visually,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.880
and see if I'm on track with what I value to be important.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.240
I know I was a very introspective thirteen-year-old,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.340
But I found that this has really helped me in my life, like keep balance or ...

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.280
Strengthen areas of my life that are weak, that I really want to improve.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.080
I'm Anna Akana,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.240

Thank you so much to Credit Karma for sponsoring today's episode.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.880
You know during the new year,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.680
I was talking to a friend and I asked him what is his resolutions were

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.660
and he said to build his credit.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.480
He's 30 years old, and he's never had a credit card.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.420
So whenever he's moved apartments or tried to buy a new car

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.460
He's noticed that he's having the hardest time because his credit is virtually non-existent.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.500
And I know that out of all of these categories being physically fit and knowledgeable could be the most daunting.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.620
So I'm really excited to tell you that Credit Karma is here to help.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.840

I'm a home owner,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.640
which means I have like this 30 year loan from the bank with very confusing terms, like

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.680
principal, interest, escrow, fixed-rate mortgage

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.620
(unable to type out this part lol)

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.800
So my favorite feature is the amortization calculator, which helps me understand the payment breakdowns,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.320
and how I can affect the life of my loan over time to suit me as I go.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.880
