00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.220
- [Instructor] The mayor
of a town saw an article

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.250
that claimed the national
unemployment rate is 8%.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.030
They wondered if this held
true in their own town,

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.370
so they took a sample of 200 residents

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.203
to test the null hypothesis
is that the unemployment rate

00:00:13.203 --> 00:00:15.500
is the same as the national one

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.740
versus the alternative hypothesis which is

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.460
that the unemployment rate is
not the same as the national,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.940
where p is the proportion
of residents in the town

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.250
that are unemployed.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.910
The sample included 22
residents who were unemployed.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.630
Assuming that the conditions
for inference have been met,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.100
and so that's the random, normal,
and independent conditions

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.480
that we've talked about
in previous videos,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.140
identify the correct test statistic

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.580
for this significance test.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.010
So let me just, I like
to rewrite everything

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.900
just to make sure I've
understood what's going on.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.910
We have a null hypothesis
that the true proportion

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.780
of unemployed people in our town,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.430
that's what this p represents,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.860
is the same as the national unemployment.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.610
And remember, our null
hypothesis tends to be

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.780
the no news here, nothing
to report so to speak,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.710
and we have our alternative hypothesis

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.460
that no, the true unemployment
in this town is different,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.810
is different than 8%.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750
And so what we would do is we would set

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.470
some type of a significance level,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.820
we would assume that the
mayor of the town sets it,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.330
let's say, he sets or she sets
a significance level of 0.5.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.030
And then, what we wanna do
is conduct the experiment.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.970
So this is the entire
population of the town.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.970
They take a sample of 200
people, so this is our sample,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.650
n is equal to 200, since it
met the independence condition,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.930
we'll assume that this is less
than 10% of the population,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.818
and we calculate a sample statistic here,

00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:48.080
and it would be, since we care about

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.950
the true population proportion,
the sample statistic

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.490
we would care about is
the sample proportion

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.440
and we figure out that it
is 22 out of the 200 people

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.480
in the sample are unemployed.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.190
So this is 0.11.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.670
Now the next step is
assuming the null hypothesis

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.610
is true, what is the
probability of getting a result

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.330
this far away or further

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.110
from the assumed population proportion?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.760
And if that probability
is lower than alpha,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.000
then we would reject the null hypothesis

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
which would suggest the alternative.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.140
But how do you figure
out this probability?

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.560
Well, one way to think about it is

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.419
we could say how many
standard deviations away

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:38.350
from the true proportion,
the assumed proportion is it?

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.860
And then we could say
what's the probability

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.610
of getting that many standard
deviations or further

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.860
from the true proportion?

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.710
We could use a z-table to do that.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.010
And so what we wanna do is figure out

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.720
the number of standard deviations,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.140
and so that would be a z-statistic.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.860
And so how do we figure it out?

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.430
Well, we can figure out the difference

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.490
between the sample proportion here

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.950
and the assumed population proportion,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.950
so that would be 0.11 minus 0.08

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.450
divided by the standard deviation

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.480
of the sampling distribution
of the sample proportions.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.310
And we can figure that out.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.120
Remember, all that is is,
and sometimes we don't know

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.900
what the population proportion is

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.470
but here we're assuming
a population proportion.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.860
So we're assuming it is 0.08

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.770
and then we'll multiply
that times one minus 0.08

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.460
so we'll multiply that times 0.92

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.990
and this come straight from we've seen it

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.560
in previous videos, the standard deviation

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.890
of the sampling distribution
of sample proportions

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.410
and then you divide that by n
which is 200 right over here.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.410
And we can get a calculator
out to figure this out

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.300
but this would give us
some value which it says

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.300
how many standard deviations
away from 0.08 is 0.11?

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.400
And then we could use
a z-table to figure out

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.820
what's the probability of
getting that far or further

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.090
from the true proportion
and then that would give us

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.120
our p-value which we can
compare the significance level.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.670
Sometimes, you will see a formula

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.570
that looks something
like this that you say,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.726
hey look, you have your sample proportion,

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:10.300
you find the difference between that

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.920
and the assumed proportion
in the null hypothesis,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.040
that's what this little zero says,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.130
that this is the assumed
population proportion

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.310
from the null hypothesis
and you divide that

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.590
by the standard deviation,
the assumed standard deviation

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.030
of the sampling distribution
of the sample proportions.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.100
So that would be our assumed
population proportion

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.410
times one minus our assumed
population proportion

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.600
divided by our sample size.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.690
And in future videos,
we're gonna go all the away

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.150
and calculate this, and
then look it up in a z-table

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.860
and see what's the probability of getting

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.530
that extreme or more extreme of a result

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.990
and compare it to alpha.
