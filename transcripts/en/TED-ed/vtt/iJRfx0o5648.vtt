00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.995
Many modern musical instruments
are cumbersome or have a lot of parts.

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:14.512
Some need a stand or a stool.

00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:21.382
But the cajon is a drum, a stand
and a seat all in one convenient box.

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:25.853
And this simplicity may be key to
its journey across continents and cultures

00:00:25.853 --> 00:00:30.892
to become one of the most popular 
percussion instruments in the world today.

00:00:30.892 --> 00:00:34.103
The cajon's story begins in West Africa,

00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:37.226
whose indigenousness people 
had rich musical traditions

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.819
centered on drumming and dancing.

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.748
When many of them were captured
and brought to the Americas as slaves,

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:45.576
they brought this culture with them,

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:50.041
but without their native instruments,
they had to improvise.

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.059
African slaves in coastal Peru
didn't have the materials

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.374
or the opportunity to craft 
one of their traditional drums

00:00:56.374 --> 00:00:59.618
such as a djembe or a djun djun.

00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:02.712
But what they did have 
were plenty of shipping crates.

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:05.209
Not only were these readily accessible,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.130
but their inconspicuous appearance

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.529
may have helped get around laws 
prohibiting slaves from playing music.

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:15.995
Early Peruvian cajons 
consisted of a simple box

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:18.119
with five thick wooden sides.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.627
The sixth side, made of 
a thinner sheet of wood,

00:01:20.627 --> 00:01:23.060
would be used as the striking surface,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.570
or more commonly known as the tapa.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.424
A sound hole was also cut into the back
to allow the sound to escape.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.411
As an Afro-Peruvian culture developed,

00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:36.749
and new forms of music and dance,
such as Zamacueca,

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:39.354
Festejo and Landó were born,

00:01:39.354 --> 00:01:44.624
the cajon became a dedicated musical
instrument in its own right.

00:01:44.624 --> 00:01:48.512
Early modifications involved simply
bending the planks of the box

00:01:48.512 --> 00:01:50.119
to tweak the sound,

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.324
and when abolition of slavery introduced
the cajon to a broader population,

00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:59.661
more improvisation 
and experimentation soon followed.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.903
Perhaps the person most responsible 
for introducing the cajon

00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:08.874
to European audiences was Spanish 
Flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía.

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:11.934
When touring in Peru in 1977,

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:14.410
he and his percussionist Rubem Dantas

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.259
discovered the cajon 
and brought it back to Spain,

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.892
recognizing its potential 
for use in Flamenco music.

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:25.303
By stretching guitar strings 
along the inside of the tapa,

00:02:25.303 --> 00:02:29.447
the flamenco musicians were able to create
a buzz-like snare sound.

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:31.986
Combined with the regular base tone,

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:36.642
this gave the cajon a sound 
close to a basic drum set.

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:38.544
The cajon quickly caught on,

00:02:38.544 --> 00:02:40.819
not only becoming standard in Flamenco,

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.410
but being used in genres like folk,
jazz, blues and rock.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.660
Today, many specialized cajons 
are manufactured,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.710
some with adjustable strings,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.860
some with multiple playing surfaces,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.917
and some with a snare mechansim.

00:02:56.917 --> 00:02:59.616
But the basic concept remains the same,

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:01.703
and the story of the cajon shows

00:03:01.703 --> 00:03:05.399
that the simplest things 
can have the most amazing potential

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:10.215
when you think outside and inside the box.
