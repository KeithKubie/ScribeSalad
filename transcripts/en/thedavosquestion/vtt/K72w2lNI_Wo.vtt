00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.179
&gt;&gt; My name is Nabil Elshourbagy, and I am
from [INAUDIBLE] Biomedical, a biotechnology

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.680
company based in Philadelphia, and basically
it's

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.032
involved in drug discoveries using the biotechnology
as [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:38.790
I think role model is an important aspect
in the Middle East, and one

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:50.350
of the countries that I studied and have admiration
for is Qatar. And

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.531
they have invested quite a bit of money in
the recent years in bringing

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:58.720
the gap between the Middle East and also -- and
the United States and

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.770
Europe by bringing collaboration over from
 -- from -- by bringing

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.930
collaboration from Europe and United States
back to the Middle East.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.520
This kind of cooperation should be expanded
greatly and I would

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.810
recommend strongly that we have more and more
investment in this type

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.810
of collaboration.
So that we can lift the big gap between the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.810
Middle East and this
country.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.810
And this could be done because we have two
things bringing and the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.810
manpower which will bring both of those to
the Middle East.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.810
And apparently, I am from the Middle East,
I'm from Egypt, and we have

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:37.759
a lot of scientists in the Middle East and
in the United States and

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:52.000
Europe that other chief a great deal so we
have that capability.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.299
Thank you.
