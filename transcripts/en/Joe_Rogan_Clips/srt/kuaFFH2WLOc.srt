1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,640
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,760
I was so impressed with
the your performance from
that past UFC that I had to

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,610
had to talk to you. I was like,
that was what I've seen guys make.

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,990
Like you are always a very
dangerous striker from
obviously from the [inaudible]

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,950
hockey fight.
Every got everybody got to see that.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,250
But to see how fluid you were
against a beast like Eric Andrews,

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,340
I mean Eric Andrews a scary cat. Yeah,
he's, he's coming from blood. Right.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,240
And you were so fast, man. It was crazy
to watch. It was really interesting.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:30,840
Thank you.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
What if you had to give
yourself a percentage leap
that you've gone up over the

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,180
last year,

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,330
what do you think it would be compared
to like who you were before that?

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,890
Not The hive leap. I mean, not that I
like, that performance for me was like,

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,630
I feel good about it, but that
was only four months. So I'm like,

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,660
I know that there's so much more for
me to gain. That's what I'm like, yeah,

16
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:58,060
I gotta go back. So the leap, not,

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,770
not too much because I know there's still
a lot more to go a lot more. Yeah. Wow.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,830
So you've decided, so for people who
don't understand what we're talking about,

19
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:10,070
you went to Thailand, he spent four
months down in Thailand and um,

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,470
you were fighting like a Thai boxer.
It was crazy. Like Martell, grotty,

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,650
who works in the production truck and
he's the guy who picks out the instant

22
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:18,280
replays.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,950
He and I talked back and forth sometimes
while the fights going on and mark mark

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,520
market with his heavy Boston accent,
like dude classic,

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,440
he's classic Chi stance and he would
just sell a light on that front leg

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,720
inside leg kick was so ferocious.
It was fun to watch men.

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,590
So it's just usually wherever I go.
Um,

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,630
I've always been good at just like kind
of absorbing the culture. I'm a guy,

29
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:48,860
like I can go into a room full of people
and I can just kind of pick up what the

30
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:52,040
energy is like. And that's another
reason why I wanted to go to Thailand.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,760
So just the way that they
train and the discipline,

32
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,600
the power. But the relaxation,
like everything I was learning,

33
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:05,480
just like then there's so much
more to Moitai. So I would just,

34
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,650
even the days that I didn't train,

35
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:11,390
I just sit around and just watch these
guys because moy ties with more than just

36
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:14,420
punching, kicking elbows, minters
balance. You know what I mean? There's,

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,560
there's repetition. Like how many
kicks are you throwing? You know,

38
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:21,270
the guys at the stadiums, they're
like their Kik, Kik, Kik, Kik.

39
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,150
So I was able to learn a lot, man.
And they're still a lot to go.

40
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,080
It's beautiful to see someone on
that pursuit. And I think it's, um,

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,010
it's much like Roger
Mayweather said about boxing.

42
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,710
Like most people don't know shit about
boxing. The lady said that, it's like,

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,740
if anybody say that he's going to say
that because there are levels and layers

44
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,320
and there's,
there's paths to go down.

45
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:49,321
And it's interesting when you see
someone like committed with a very,

46
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,710
like a very specific style,
like your,

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,840
like your adoption of
that Moyie Thai style.

48
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,510
So if it's so effective
as a striking style,

49
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,360
it's really interesting when you think
of all the different ways to attack with

50
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,350
striking that one way became
very particularly successful.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,753
You know what,

52
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,410
before I even started
training MMA as a whole,

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,330
um, my first mixed martial, my first
martial arts class with Moitai class,

54
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,710
I knew that I wanted to train
Moitai or to learn when we tie. Um,

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,390
and so since I've started,
I always thought like, yeah,
I wanna go there. You know,

56
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:30,190
just, maybe it's cool, but, um,
[inaudible] has always been my thing,

57
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,570
but I had never really learned it like
the actual way, you know, like from,

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,540
from the root of, uh,
of where it comes from.

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,560
I always just kind of like passed down or
like Brazilian style, Moy, Tai, you know,

60
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,290
like shoot the box type stuff. So, um,

61
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,790
that's completely different from stadium
we tie and most people don't know shit

62
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,780
about stadium Moitai. Like unless
you go to, unless you go to Bangkok,

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,320
let's characterize it for people.
You do say that that core was style,

64
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,570
just way more aggressive,
different,

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,250
a different way they utilize techniques.
Yeah, it's light on the front leg.

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,330
So sometimes they are like more shogun
would be light on his front leg a little

67
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,050
bit. One thing that they were doing
a lot that it's pretty similar.

68
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,520
It's just like they go at it,
shoot the box, they'll go at it,

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,800
you just go until the other
guy stops. Pretty much. Um,

70
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,130
but from the shoot the box,
I was like very combo based,

71
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,620
like punches and kicks are like one,

72
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,880
two like you have to memorize these
crazy combos. Codero is he like,

73
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,330
I think he's one of the guys that just
like passed it down a lot in San Diego,

74
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,350
Lima that guys like that.

75
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:36,730
But they have this system and
it's very like combination based,

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,010
um, memory slipping Punchkick all this
stuff. But the ties are just like,

77
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,280
it's just straight kick,
you know, like punch view.

78
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,510
You fall down on that front
foot, elbow, knee. It's just,

79
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,890
it's broken down completely
differently. Um, it's just a whole,

80
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:56,310
whole different style.
Yeah, it is like, so the,

81
00:04:56,311 --> 00:05:00,010
the shoot the box stuff has punches,
kicks, knees, elbows, combination,

82
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:03,230
same tools that you're gonna use
him Moitai button. [inaudible]

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,340
has got a whole different game
plan, you know, clinching,

84
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,490
like I've never trained as much clinching
in America as I have in Thailand in

85
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:15,550
just four months and I've been fighting
our training now for like nine years.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,170
So just in four months I've gotten more
clinch time in Thailand that I have,

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,950
you know, in my whole career. And that's
because it's a whole different game.

88
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,900
You got to master the clinch and t in
Noida you have to for effective like real

89
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:32,590
true. Moitai are you getting a
lot of wrestling over there? Yeah,

90
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,940
so that's one thing too. I heard, um,
I heard shop talking about it. Um,

91
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,780
tiger has amazing,
like it's an amazing gym,

92
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,690
40 to 60 guys on the mat from
everywhere. Chechnya. Wow. You know,

93
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,130
in everywhere, in everywhere. Man. Those
guys, they come there maybe for a week,

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,020
maybe two weeks, um, maybe for a
month. But you're getting constant,

95
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,100
um, good training, grappling,
everything, MMA, boxing, crossfit,

96
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,480
everything you need is in one place. It's
a, blew my mind being there, honestly.

97
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,610
That's fascinating.
And your,

98
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,520
are you the coaches that you
were working with before?

99
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you still working
with them and Thailand?

100
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:17,080
Are you just gonna I know you had talked
about actually moving to Thailand. Yeah.

101
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:20,480
Yeah. The plan is to move there like
as soon as possible. Really? Yeah.

102
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,060
So I was like hitting you up like
y'all want to get on your show.

103
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:26,630
I want to talk a little bit.
Um, but yeah, I want to, um,

104
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,930
the plan is to move to Thailand like with
the next couple of weeks for at least

105
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,960
a year.
And I want to go there just because

106
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,360
I can just train. The lifestyle
is completely different.
I can walk to the gym,

107
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,720
hop on a motorbike. It's
just, it's so simple. Um,

108
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,360
but to answer the question
about my coaches, um,

109
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,150
I always have my brother in my corner.
He's just kind of like moral support.

110
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:49,040
We started this together.
Um,

111
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,190
I had a conditioning coach slash friends
slash mental type of like support,

112
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,560
um,
Lorenzo Paprika.

113
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,630
And then my head coaches have switched
probably two or three times in the last

114
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,930
couple of fights I had Kenny
Johnson from black house, um,

115
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,700
John Wood from syndicate. And now I have
George Hickman from Tiger Moy. Tai. Yeah.

116
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,420
And so this change that
you decided to make a,

117
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,940
did it come after the Johnnie Walker
fight? Yeah. So the Johnnie Walker fly,

118
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,430
like that camp was tough man.

119
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:27,431
Like I was doing so much to try to improve
in my wrestling and grappling because

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,970
that was always like a
big hole that my game. Um,

121
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,120
so I spent so much time wrestling over
at Black House with Kevin Casey and this

122
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,390
guy that I fought Blake troop.

123
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,310
They're huge and these guys are great
grapplers so in cases of powerhouse, yeah,

124
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,490
he'll put you into the ground and he
feels like cement block on top of you.

125
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:50,270
So it's old school Hixon Jujitsu.
Exactly. How pressure man. So, um,

126
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,140
yeah, I would, I was just grinding myself
into the mat every day for that camp,

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,650
expecting like, okay, I'm comfortable
in the feed. If it goes to the ground,

128
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,370
I'm ready. And um, I,

129
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,610
I think I just completely lost sight of
like my striking my Moitai in that fight,

130
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,270
his size, everything. I just kind of
froze up, man. I was just like, ah,

131
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,410
I didn't know what to do, how to get
there. So let's all part of the education,

132
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:16,180
right. I mean this is what this,
this career of fighting that you're,

133
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:18,350
you're on this path is
what it's all about. Yeah.

134
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,410
And fighting for me is like big
self-awareness too. You know?

135
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,970
I think it's always important though,

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,140
when a guy has a setback to see how he
responds. Some people get discouraged,

137
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,280
some people get encouraged,

138
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,950
some people just decide like they're
going to be much more committed.

139
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:31,784
And that's what you did.

140
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,510
You just mean making that move to do
your camp in Thailand and seeing how it

141
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:36,380
paid off.
I mean,

142
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:41,120
Eric Anders is a very tough customer
and you essentially shut him out. Yeah.

143
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,110
It was very, very impressive man. That
was the, that was the plan though,

144
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,630
because I knew he was telling
me he's talking to them before.

145
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,330
I sparred with him before
that everything in like he's,

146
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,920
I've watched all of his fights.

147
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,530
The guy's hard to put away and making a
case for the fight being stopped. Yeah.

148
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,520
We were making a case. I mean, DC was
saying like the, we can stop this fight.

149
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,120
I was saying it, I was like,
you are fucking his legs up.

150
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,450
I feel like this is about it.
During the fight, I wasn't lying.

151
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:10,150
I'm sure you weren't, but
that guy is so damn tough. He
kept coming, man. I mean, he,

152
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,280
he never stopped trying to win that fight.
Yeah. There's no quit in him. No. I mean,

153
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:18,450
even in the, in the Santos
fight, remember? Yeah. It was
just they were due or die.

154
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,400
Yeah. And then he tweets, he is like,

155
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,680
I haven't been that tired since like my
wedding night or something like that.

156
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:26,100
He's always got good good tweets after
the fight. Shout out to air handlers.

157
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:26,950
Okay.
