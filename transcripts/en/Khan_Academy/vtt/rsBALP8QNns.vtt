00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:01.774
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:03.933
is get some more practice
identifying when to use

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.509
u-substitution and
picking an appropriate u.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.343
So let's say we have

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.014
the indefinite integral of

00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:13.181
natural log of

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:15.494
x to the,

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:19.342
to the 10th power,

00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:22.967
all of that over x dx.

00:00:24.088 --> 00:00:25.481
Does u-substitution apply,

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:28.639
and if so how would we
make that substitution?

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:30.775
Well the key for u-substitution is to see,

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:34.583
do I have some function
and its derivative?

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:36.302
And you might immediately recognize

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.020
that the derivative of natural log of x

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.460
is equal to one over x.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.501
To make it a little bit clearer,

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:43.845
I could write this as the integral of

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:47.375
natural log of x to the 10th power

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.292
times one over x dx.

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:52.012
Now it becomes clear.

00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:54.404
We have some function, natural log of x,

00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:56.355
being raised to the 10th power,

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.212
but we also have its
derivative right over here,

00:00:58.212 --> 00:00:59.512
one over x.

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:01.718
So we could make the substitution.

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:03.301
We could say that u

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:06.455
is equal to the natural log of x.

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:07.872
And the reason why I
picked natural log of x

00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:09.126
is because I see something,

00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:10.588
I see its exact derivative here,

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:12.353
something close to its
derivative, in this case

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:13.700
its exact derivative.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.720
And so then I could say,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.553
du dx,

00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:19.925
du dx is equal to one over x,

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:23.015
which means that du

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.334
is equal to one over x dx.

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:29.071
And so here you have it.

00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:31.858
This right over here is du,

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:35.712
and then this right over here is our u.

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:38.290
And so this nicely simplifies to

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.540
the integral of

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:42.163
u to the 10th power,

00:01:44.606 --> 00:01:46.523
u to the 10th power du.

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:49.946
And so you would evaluate what this is,

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:51.525
find the antiderivative here,

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:54.358
and then you would back-substitute
the natural log of x

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:59.211
for u, to actually evaluate
this indefinite integral.

00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:00.720
Let's do another one.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.926
Let's say that we have

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:04.259
the integral of,

00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:07.292
let's do something,

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:10.287
let's do something interesting here.

00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:13.787
Let's say the integral of tangent x dx.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.739
Does u-substitution apply here?

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.480
And at first you say well
I just have a tangent of x,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.570
where is its derivative?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.312
But one interesting thing to do is well

00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:27.354
we can rewrite tangent in
terms of sine and cosine.

00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:29.745
So we can write this as the integral of

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:30.578
sine of x

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.706
over cosine of x dx.

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:37.361
And now you might say

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:39.358
well where does u-substitution apply here?

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.843
Well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:45.279
You could say the derivative
of sine of x is cosine of x,

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.835
but you're now dividing by the derivative

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.343
as opposed to multiplying by it.

00:02:49.343 --> 00:02:50.759
But more interesting you could say

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:54.521
the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:56.166
We don't have a negative sine of x,

00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:57.978
but we can do a little bit of engineering.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.741
We can multiply by negative one twice.

00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:03.411
So we could say the negative
of the negative sine of x,

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:05.640
and I stuck one of the you
could say negative ones

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.801
outside of the integral,

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:09.100
which comes straight from
our integration properties.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.331
This is equivalent.

00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:11.677
I can put a negative on the outside,

00:03:11.677 --> 00:03:12.908
a negative on the inside,

00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:15.950
so that this is the
derivative of cosine of x.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.831
And so now this is interesting.

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.131
In fact let me rewrite this.

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.058
This is going to be equal to negative,

00:03:21.058 --> 00:03:23.311
the negative integral,

00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.228
of one over cosine of x

00:03:27.676 --> 00:03:30.259
times negative sine of x dx.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.941
Now does it jump out at
you what our u might be?

00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.448
Well I have a cosine of
x in the denominator,

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:41.770
and I have its derivative,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.462
so what if I made u equal to cosine of x?

00:03:45.462 --> 00:03:47.629
u is equal to cosine of x,

00:03:48.504 --> 00:03:49.671
and then du dx

00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:54.797
would be equal to negative sine of x.

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:56.399
Or I could say

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.149
that du is equal to negative sine of x dx.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.823
And just like that I have my du here,

00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:07.937
and this of course is my u.

00:04:09.843 --> 00:04:12.189
And so my whole thing
has now simplified to,

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.162
it's equal to,

00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:15.162
the negative

00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:19.294
indefinite integral of one over u,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.667
one over u du.

00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:27.885
Which is a much easier
integral to evaluate,

00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:29.186
and then once you evaluate this,

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:32.603
you back-substitute cosine of x for u.
