00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.320
&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.690
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington: I'm
so honored to be here today

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.680 position:56%
to introduce Luis Alberto Urrea, a
member of the Latino Literature Hall

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.130
of Fame and author of 16 books
include fiction, non-fiction,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.740
short stories, and poetry.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.890
Luis is a master storyteller who
moves effortlessly between genres.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.630
He is perhaps best
known for his writing

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.150
about the U.S.-Mexican border born
in Tijuana to a Mexican father

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.740
and an American mother, Luis
understands the complexity

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.570
of border life and
the inherent tension

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.460
in living between two worlds.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.160
His memoir, "Nobody's Son,
Notes from an American Life,"

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.600
won the 1999 American Book Award

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.170
and chronicles his early
childhood growing up in Tijuana

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.600
and his family's immigration
to the United States.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.800
Published in 2004, "The
Devil's Highway," a harrowing,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.120
non-fiction account of
Mexican immigrants lost

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560
in the Arizona desert was a
finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.600
His 2005 historical novel,
"The Hummingbird's Daughter,"

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.470
tells the story of his
great aunt Teresa Urrea,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.630
and involved 20 years
of research and writing.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.220 position:56%
Along with "The Devil's Highway," it
was named the best book of the year

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.900
by many publications and won the
[inaudible] Prize in Fiction.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.810
His most recent title, "The
Water Museum," is a finalist

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.560
for the Pen Faulkner Award and was
named the best book of the year

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.540
by The Washington Post and
Kirkus Reviews among many others.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.410
Like much of Lisa's work,
these short stories,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.680
these 13 short stories reflect
a sensitivity and allegiance

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.970
to both sides of his
family's heritage.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640
The collection exhibits
an impressive range

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.670
of style and subject matter.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.680
From "Welcome to the Water
Museum," a dystopian tale of life

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.630
in the future where children
consider water an anomaly.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.030
To "Carnations and the White Girl,"
"Vignettes of Grief of Loneliness,"

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.970
to the Edgar Award winning
"Amapola," which tells the story

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.390
of a teen romance with a very
dark twist to the comedic,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.180 position:56%
"Tape to the Sky," a look at an East
coast's academic's haphazard efforts

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.110
to reconcile with his
wife's infidelity.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.250
The stories in "The Water
Museum" largely depict outsiders.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.330
Individual displaced by
geography and poverty but also

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.450
by their grief and their longing.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.110
While not every story is linked
in the collection, each one builds

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.400
on the previous, creating
a community of character

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.100
that is exquisitely drawn.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.590
Their collective voice is haunting.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.420
It reflects a desire for
connection despite societal

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.070
and cultural divides.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.170
It is these moments of connection
between characters however brief

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.370
or imperfect that shine brightest

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.460
and convey Luis's self-proclaimed
interest in bridges not borders.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.420
For the past three years,
we've had the pleasure

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.210
of working directly with Luis.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.640
His book "Into the Beautiful
North" is part of the NEA Big Read,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.390
the National Endowment for the
Arts Community Reading Initiative.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.110
Communities across this country
from Los Angeles to Wichita,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.920
Kansas to Trenton, New Jersey
have read his book as a part

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.730
of the NEA Big Read and six other
communities will do so this year.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.690
We hear again and again
from these communities

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.330
about how much they love having
Luis at their Big Read events.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.810
Big Read participants,
especially youth participants,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.000
enjoy meeting and connecting
with him.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.650
And this is no surprise to us.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.490
He is not only a really
talented writer

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.290
but he is a gracious individual
and a very phenomenal speaker.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.840
It is a huge privilege to
have him here with us today.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.510
Please join me in welcoming
Luis to the stage.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.470
[ Applause ]

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.990
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Thank you.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.290
That's awesome.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.170
Buenos tardes, Washington DC.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.290
Tijuana in the house.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.200
I got to say that everywhere I go.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.360
So, I thought I would
talk to you a little bit

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.670
about the writer's journey and what
led to my obsession with writing

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.530
and talking and leave some
time at the end because I love

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.280
to know what you'd like to know.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.260
Sometimes people surprise me
with things they'd like to know.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.160
So, I'll stop at about 4:35
or so and give the last 10,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.800
15 minutes to questions
if you have them.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.850 position:56%
If not, we'll just leave [laughter].

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.140
But so I was born in
Tijuana, whoops,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.750 position:56%
and I was raised my first four years

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.630
in a neighborhood called
Colonia Independencia,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.840
which means the Colony
of Independence.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.580
Our street was Rampa Independencia.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.210
The Ramp of Independence.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.810
We have a theme.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.260
And the Rampa was an
interesting place for me.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.760
It was, if you could
sort of meld John Irving

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.800
and Garcia Marcus, it
was kind of that way.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.780
It was a rough, rough dirt
street on the side of a hill

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.950
in Tijuana overlooking downtown.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.340
From our grandmother's house,

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.860
we could see the movie theater
downtown called Cine de Forma

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.940
where we would go to
watch [inaudible] movies.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.370
And the dirt street was so rough
that it could tear the oil pan

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.020
out of your car if you didn't
go very, very slowly on it.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.700
And I want you to imagine
this place.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.480
We had a little yellow house that
my grandfather built by hand.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.490
And it was on a slope.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.530
So, the second story was the ground
floor and you would go downhill

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.920
into the subsequent layers of the
house, which turned out to be one

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.450
of the controlling
metaphors for me as a writer.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.850
I'm really fascinated by what one
of my students called under story.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.080
You know, the use of the shadow
that is implied by what you write

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.070
and helps put the trance
on your reader.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.210
And I think it's from that
house because you would go in,

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.010
the front of the house was
a wall with broken pieces

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.320
of Pepsi bottles stuck
in the cement, you know,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.860
to cut up anybody who
tried to sneak in.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.650
And then you would go down
these wooden steps into places

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.050
that were deep and shadowy where
the old family papers were,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.530
old books were.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.240
And there was a room that
was notoriously haunted

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.190
by an evil presence.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.040
And sometimes the dogs
were down there.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.240
So, it was an amazing kind of
a life long portrait for me

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.230
of the stuff that's hidden
down below the story.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.930
This dirt street, later on when
I moved to the United States,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.230
I went to Catholic school.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.550
I wanted to be a Jesuit priest
when I was a little kid.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.020 position:56%
And back in those days,
Catholicism was not exactly the Pope

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.320
Francis style.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.620
It was a little harsher.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.800
So, the nuns would terrorize
us with terrible stories

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.750
about the Communists all
the time that, you know,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.810
"The Communists don't
want you to love Jesus."

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.190
And they'd say, "Who
here loves Jesus?"

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.660
It was me and all the little
[inaudible], you know,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.960
the little [inaudible] kids.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.710
They were like, "Yo,
we totally love Jesus.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.770
I'm down with Jesus, man."

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.010
They're like, "Really?

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.510
How much do you love Jesus?"

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.220
"Like totally.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.680
I'm down with Jesus.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.980
[inaudible].

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.160
Jesus is the Lord and
Savior [inaudible]."

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.220
And they'd say, "Really because the
Communists will rip your skin off

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.260
inch by inch."

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.540
And we'd say, "What?"

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.840
They'd say, "Oh, yes.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.200
Yes. The Communists will put
little fish hooks in your flesh

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.520
and begin to rip your skin off.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.400
Will you still love Jesus?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.470
Because all you have to do
to stop the torment is say,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.700
'I renounce Jesus Christ.'

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.520
How many of you now love the Lord?"

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.090
We'd be like, "I totally love him.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.330
Like Jesus is wonderful."

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.880
That was the little world I was in.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.300
And I was the dreamer
form the beginning.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.400
I was the guy always in
trouble with the nuns.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.760
I remember that they gave
us a little plastic statue

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.600
of the Virgin Mary.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.070
She was in a little weird
modernistic shrine standing

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.660
there piously.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.800
And I was a sci-fi freak.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.990
And the shrine looked
like Rocket ship XM

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.120
from the science fiction movie.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.300
And I kept launching the Virgin.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.500
And I remember I got her about
this high and my eyes rose

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.360
and locked eyes with
Sister Bernita [laughter].

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:17.570
And back then they would flog you.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.170
So, Sister Bernita came
after me with her yard stick.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.360
And she latched onto my arm
and she began what I used

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.790
to call the [inaudible] two-step
where she'd whack you and you'd try

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.230
to run but you couldn't escape.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:35.420
So, you'd go in a circle like
dancing a square dance of pain.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:44.220
Anyway, in that atmosphere of
loving Jesus I was given a pamphlet

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.840
one day.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.780
And the pamphlet, I still remember
quite vividly, was a cartoon.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:58.550
And it said, "The highway to
hell and the path to redemption."

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:04.440
So, you opened the little booklet
and there is a beautiful drawing

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.780
of a late model maybe
1959 convertible.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.080
And there's a dude driving
it looking like Don Draper.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.780
He's got a little suit, a little
pork pie hat and he's waving.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.060 position:56%
And next to him there's a woman
with blonde bouffant in a red dress.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.020 position:56%
And they're going with the top down.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.410
And it says, "The highway to hell."

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:36.090
And you turn the page and there's
this horrible rock strewn path

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.830
up a dark mountain covered in
cacti and threats everywhere.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.270
Wolves, coyotes, skunks, snakes.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.970
And that was the hard
path to heaven.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.490
Which one are you going
to take [laughter]?

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.270
And for me it looked just
like Rampa Independencia.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.990
So, I was like, cool,
I'm already there, man.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.520
I'm on the path to heaven.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.600
I'm in. Jesus loves me.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.290
Now, just so the John Irving part.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.550 position:56%
You're probably wondering, where the
hell does John Irving fit into this?

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:20.970
Halfway down the Rampa, there
was a house down the slope.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.330
And they had a bear.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.510
How could you not be
a writer, right?

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.250
They had a bear that they
kept chained to a dead tree.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.100
Poor bear.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:39.870 position:56%
Now I had this cousin who if anybody
has read "Into the Beautiful North,"

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.380
there's a character named
Atomico [phonetic] who is

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.320
like the world's toughest cholo.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.530
It was based on my
cousin Ugo [phonetic].

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.580
Ugo Milan [phonetic].

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:56.340
Ugo Milan always talked like this.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.810
When he was seven,
he talked like this.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:07.840
Ugo Milan grew the first
[inaudible] mustache in the family

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.490
when he was 11 [laughter].

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.690
Oh, yeah. He had two whiskers.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.390
He would stick them
down to hang down.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.000
That was Ugo.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.320
Ugo used to say to me, he used
to call me Louche [phonetic].

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.240
I hate to say this
because, you know,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.750
dudes in Tijuana had
really cool nicknames.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.870 position:56%
There was a guy in our
neighborhood called El Frankenstein.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:40.010
Just like El Lovo [phonetic],
El Tigre, and here I was Louche.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.210
I was kind of lacking
in my machismo.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:50.350 position:56%
But anyway, he'd say to me, "Louche,
you want to go feed the bear?"

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.180
And I'd be like, "Yeah, Ugo,
let's go feed the bear."

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.550
So, we'd go out with this
little sister Margarita.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.510
And there was a ritual.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.750
You couldn't just go feed the bear.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.210
First, you had to get
stale tortillas.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.090
Then you had to go outside
and turn on the radio

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.060
until James Brown came on.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.930
And then you had to try to get on
the good foot in the rocks and dirt

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.830
without falling down to
dance to James Brown.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.520
And then we would go
in line down the hill.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.070
And we would get to this poor bear.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.240
And Ugo would summon him.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.850
You know, "Hey, bear."

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.980
And it would look up at him.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.040
And he would fly that stale
tortillas like Frisbees.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.800
And the bear would catch them.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.100
And it would eat them.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.740
And sometimes it would wave.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.040
Seriously.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.950
It would speak some bear.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:43.370
You know? Farther down the
hill, believe it or not,

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:49.300
somebody had built on top of
a dirt cliff, little castle.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:54.060
Castle complete with turrets
and like archer slots in Tijuana

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.690
and they painted it bright yellow,
which I thought was really cool.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.670 position:56%
At the bottom of that, there was a
vertical shaft that led to the sewer

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.950
and flood control tunnels.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.720
And Ugo would always fake
me out and say, "Hey Louche.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.290
Look up at the castle."

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.010
I'd look at the castle and he'd
grab me and throw me down the hole

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.500
and then he'd come down after
me and then we'd catch her.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.370
And we would walk underground
through Tijuana.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.590
So, you can see the deeper story
was really interesting to me.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.050
What's down in the shadows?

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.110
You know? And one time, I've
written about this elsewhere,

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.970
but we were down there
and we started

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.610
to smell something really bad.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.480
And then we heard something
making these sounds,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.780
you know [strange sounds].

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.150
Like that.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.740 position:56%
We thought, oh my god, what is that?

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.120
I watch those monster movies.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.860
I thought it was the blob.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.050
And so she was holding
onto his shirt.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.190
I was holding on to her sweater.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.310
We're walking in and it's getting
louder and louder and stinkier

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.060
and stinkier, and he pulled

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.040
out a cigarette lighter he
had stolen from his mom.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.340
And he lit it.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.330
And it was a dead pig
full of maggots.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.880
And we were just like ahh
looking at this thing.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.180
And I still remember him.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.790
He looked at us and he
goes, "Ain't nothing.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.310
It's death.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.790
Death don't got nothing
to do with us."

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.840
And we walked out to
the light [laughter].

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.850
You know? You got to write.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.100
And I want to just
put this as an aside.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.750
And since we are in DC and
this is an election year,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:46.630
I just want to say Ugo
Milan, if you ever watch TV,

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.130
you know the The Dog
Whisperer, right?

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.490
Cesar Milan.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.790
Get out of here.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.270
That's not Cesar Milan.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.370
His name is Cesar Milan.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.290
He is a cousin of my cousins.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.310
He is from [inaudible].

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:14.220 position:56%
And I just want to say, the man came
to the United States undocumented.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.750
He did. No papers.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.790
His only skill was
talking to dogs [laughter].

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:27.710
And now he is a millionaire
media star.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.010
All right?

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.120
So, America, I don't
care what you hear

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.250
about America not working,
still works.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.050
Still works.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:42.060
[ Applause ]

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.600
So, just briefly I just, you know,
want to give you a little more

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.100
about this writing thing.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.490
Two things.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.370
One was his mother.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:57.010
Ugo Milan's mother was
named Tia Flaca [phonetic],

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.850
which means Aunt Skinny.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.820
Tia Flaca was in fact skinny.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.400
Lifelong diabetic.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.260
Everybody in my family.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.600
I think everybody in
Mexico, diabetic.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.570
And I grew up watching her
getting her shots every day.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.490
They gave them to her in her leg.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.850
In her thigh.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.040
And picture this woman.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.700
She was stylish in her own way.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.570
She wore cat eye glasses.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:26.870
Remember those?

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.160
With glitter in them.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.380
And being diabetic she had
gone blind in her left eye.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.430
And so it was always a
little squinchy [phonetic].

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:43.830
And she always smoked menthol
cigarettes around the clock

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.140
but always clamped
them on the left side.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.440
So, there was always smoke.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.400
It looked like it was
coming out of her bad eye.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.030
There was smoke coming out.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.850
And she controlled us with stories.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.950
She lied in other words to
make us do what she wanted.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.810
For example, she hated
a mess in the house.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.290
She did not, she figured, you
know, I'm a working woman.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.500
I don't have time to clean the
house, so don't make a mess.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.430
She used to go every morning
to a tuna cannery to work

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.910
in San Diego and come
back exhausted.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.510
She was not going to clean house.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.360
Now, my grandmother,
her mom, and by the way,

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.810
if you're asking yourself why
does this dude look Irish,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.020
I will tell you because
my grandmother

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.610
from [inaudible] was named
Guadalupe Murray [phonetic].

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.870
So, red haired, blue-eyed
Irish Mexican lass.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.810
So, we called her Mama Lupita.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.450
Mama Lupita was a lapsed Catholic.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.950 position:56%
She didn't want to deal with church.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.250
Mass. Get out of here.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.720
You know, she had better
things to do.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.060
So, she would every Friday fry
a fish for the young priest.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.640
And he'd walk down from
the church and eat his fish

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.390
and get out of our house.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.300
And she got these ideas that
you could do symbolic things

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.130
that God liked like burn incense.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.430
She thought, "Yeah.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.880
Yeah. God likes incense.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.870
So, I'll burn some
incense and he will see,

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.440
you know, house is full of smoke."

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.150
And then she realized he could
count the cones of incense.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.550
So, she would do like
20 cones a day.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:21.260
Right? But it never occurred to her
to actually put them in saucers.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.590
So, she put the cones on
window ledges and on the piano.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.450
So there were burns
everywhere and stains

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.350
of the resin all over the house.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:35.070
But she also did not like to
get rid of the cone of ash.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.530
I think she was figuring God
is going to keep a tally.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.070
You know God has a little
check that says, "Ah ha.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.470
Lupita did 27.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.770
That's good.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.070
It erases a couple of sins."

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.900
Right? "Oh, she was
down to 15 today."

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.840
Well, you know?

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.480
So, the house was full of
cones of ash from the incense.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.880
And I didn't know what they were.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.600
I saw them and I was thinking,
"That is really weird.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.110
What is that stuff?"

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.200
And remember, Tia Flaca
didn't want a mess.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.230
She didn't want to be
sweeping up ashes, right?

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.530
So, I stupidly went to her.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.990
I said, "Tia, [foreign
language spoken] Tia.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:18.680
All those cones every place?"

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.130
And she said, "Oh."

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.430
She got very serious.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.730
"[inaudible].

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:33.200
Those are the souls of
dead men [laughter]."

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.740 position:56%
She said, "If you break them, the
house is going to fill with spirits.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.130
Don't touch."

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.430
So, there was no mess [laughter].

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.550
And the other little
thing, which is truly one

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:49.450
of the I think deepest inspirations
for writing in my life was this.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:54.030
She didn't like me
going out on the street.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.890
It was rough.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.320
People shooting each other.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.580
Cars. Who knows what.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.460
Dogs [inaudible].

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.180
So, my dad and my mom would leave.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.580 position:56%
My mom worked in a department store.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.540
He also worked in the tuna cannery.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:15.220 position:56%
And Tia Flaca would leave later in
her '56 Chevy driving across, right?

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.800
And there was I.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.500
And she would tell me,
"Meijo, I don't want you

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.580
to go in the street today.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.880
Stay inside."

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.180
They had a phrase [foreign
language spoken].

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.400 position:56%
It was like, you know, you're a
street dog, which I thought was kind

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.990
of bad ass frankly, but,
and I would be all repentant

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.290
like I had been with the nuns.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.620
"No, Tia. I won't go.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.920
I promise."

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.220
She says, "You promise me."

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.520
"No, I promise.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.330
I swear. I'm going to stay and
watch like Jeopardy with grandma.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.630
OK? It's OK."

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.930
And so she'd go to work.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.940
And as soon as she was
gone, out in the street

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.810
because my little pals
were out there.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.650
We would play marbles.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.950
[inaudible] we'd call them.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.390
Right? And you could get, you
could get a kite for a penny.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.770
So, we're flying kites.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:03.590
And you could buy candies, like
five, six candies for a penny.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.890
We were in heaven.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.210
There were dogs out there.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.320
And we could try to spin tops but
you couldn't do it in the the dirt

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.270
but we'd keep trying all day long.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.120
Just stupid stuff.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.340
And I was out there with my
homies, shooting marbles, right?

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.770
Not paying any attention.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.990
And all of the sudden they
all jumped up and ran away.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.560
And I was like, "What the heck?"

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.860
You know? Where'd they go?

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:31.410
And I look up and here comes Flaca
driving home in her '56 Chevy.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.090
Smoke pouring out of her eye.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.730
I thought, "Oh, no."

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.990
Oh my god.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.780
You know, and you start
confessing your sins.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.250
"Jesus, I did lie to my
Tia, but, you know, come on.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.550
Give me a break.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.310
You died for me."

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.540
And she pulls up and I
stand up and I'm ready.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.330
The worst punishment, those of
you with Mexican or Latina moms

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.930 position:56%
or aunts know what I'm going to say.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.550
The worst punishment than the yard
stick is what we call the chankla

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.320
[phonetic], which is the old
lady gets out her slipper

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.880
and wails on you with it.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.920
And the funny thing
about them when they do

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.710
that is they get very formal.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.960
So, you become thou.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.760
And as they hit you,
they explain every point

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.560
of their agenda [laughter].

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:34.060
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.310
They get more and more obscene
while they're calling you thou.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.930
And you're like raining slippers.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:46.870
And then the most diabolical
thing is they all have this eye.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.100
They could pass for the NFL.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.470
Because they let you
go and you start to run

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.680
and slosh [phonetic], bam.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.320
They always get you at the last
second on the back of the head.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.620
You know it's true.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.470 position:56%
So, I was waiting for my punishment.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.550
And I thought, "I'm going
to take it like a man."

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.190
My dad's big thing was "Be a man."

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.660
So, I thought, OK, I'm
going to show him I'm a man.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.960
And she got out of the car.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.260
And she took her cigarette.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.520
And she said, "Aye Luis.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.790
Didn't I tell you to
stay out of the street?"

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.270
I said, "Yes, Tia."

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.350
"Didn't I tell you to stay inside?"

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.680
"Yes." "And what did you tell me?"

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.980
"That I would."

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.280
"And what did you do?"

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.760
"I went outside."

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.400
"And why did you go outside?"

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.150
"I don't know."

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:40.040
And she said, "I don't care.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.340
I give up.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.640
I don't care.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.860
I can't control you anymore.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.570
Do what you got to do, meijo.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.380
You want to be out on the street?

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.680
Stay out on the street.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.060
I've given up.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.360
I'm going inside."

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.770 position:56%
So, off she went with her cigarette.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.130
And I thought, "Oh, yes.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.380
Thank you God.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.750
You love me."

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.640
And she got right to the door.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.870
And she said, "Except there's
one thing I want to say to you."

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.000
And I said, "Yeah?"

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.100
And she came back.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.880
And she said, "Look around."

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.430
So, I looked around.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.580
"Look behind us."

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.250
I looked behind us.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:23.910
She said, "You see that Tijuana
has hills all around it?"

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.210
I said, "Yeah.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:29.300
Yeah." "There's mountains
even all around Tijuana."

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.600
"Yeah, Tia."

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.390
"Have you ever gone
up there, meijo?"

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.940
Duh. "No."

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.970
"Do you know what's up there?"

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.300
"No, Tia."

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.010
"Marijuana farms."

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.310
I was like, "Really?"

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.610
"Oh, yeah."

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:49.560
I thought, OK, you know, grown
ups are always saying weird stuff

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.860
to you.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.160
I thought OK.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.820
She said, "Do you know
how they grow marijuana?"

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.960
I said, "No, how do
they grow marijuana?"

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:09.640
"Oh, well, every afternoon around
now, the narcos send out trucks

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.440
with men with rifles in
the trucks and they drive

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.950
around Tijuana hunting for
little blonde boys playing

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.250
in the street [laughter].

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.740
And they use their guns.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:27.480
And they take those
little boys prisoner.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.150
And they take them to
the top of the mountain.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.410
And they force them to grow
marijuana at gunpoint."

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.920
And then she says, "But it's OK.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.850
Stay out here if you
want to [laughter]."

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.020
So, come on.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.920
I went inside.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.640
So, you know, I was deeply infected
with storytelling from the get go.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.820
And I truly loved it.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.880
And a little bit more of a
spiritual aspect that I just can't,

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.660
because it's not all fun and
games but there's a lot of beauty

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.930
in our roots and we
don't always know.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.730
Sometimes, you know, we
think our roots are shameful.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.970
I'm not going to get political,

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.490
but look at the Presidential
campaign this year.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:19.270
You know? And people tell
you that you're no good

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.810
or your ancestors are no good
or you come from a neighborhood

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.600
with no hope and nothing but
terrible crime and murder.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.900
You know, sometimes it's all
about the beauty of those places

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.300
that someone tells
you aren't beautiful.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.440
And for me Colonia
Independencia was beautiful, man.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.950
And the best part for me,

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:42.530
I've talked about this
before, was the tortilla place.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.270
One of the times they
would let me go

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.180
out is they would give me some
money, and they'd say, "Luis,

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.800
go buy a kilo of tortillas."

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.500
Then I was cool, man,
because I'd walk

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.000
up the hill toward
the tortilla place.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.960
And anybody who knows a
Mexican village or has old time

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.810
because now they make
tortillas with machines.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.110
You don't get this anymore.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.740
But from a certain distance
you hear the ladies doing this

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.040
[patting hands].

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.630
Right? It's like they're
applauding you.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.770
Yes. Yes [laughter].

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.090
And it gets louder and
louder the closer you get.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.200
You start smelling the maize.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.670
And then you hear the radio.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.530
And then you hear them
laughing and talking.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.280
And it's like entering to me,

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.790
it was like entering this
weird state of grace.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:28.510
Like it's so magical it still
chokes me up to this day to think

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.180
about being this little guy walking
up to the tortilla [inaudible]

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.420
and stepping in this
rough, super hot room.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.070
Four or six Mexican women,

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:43.710
many of them indigenous [patting
hands], making tortillas.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.940 position:56%
And the radio is blaring and there's
a [inaudible] and it's burning hot.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.530
And you're watching them.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.890
And they're sweating.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.190
And even as a little kid,

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:57.640
you realize that their flavor
is going into the food.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.140
Right? They're making this thing.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.450
Their sweat is falling into it.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:08.920
And I even at seven, eight, was
having a super erotic moment

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:16.050
because I was looking up
at them thinking, "Oh, oh,

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.770
you dusky princesses [laughter]."

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:27.210
Right? I was like, "I
shall marry all six of you.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:31.240
Just wait for me though.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.050
I got to catch up, but I'm coming."

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:39.520
And they were so sweet because,
you know, the older women

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.310
in our cultures have so
many codes of generosity

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.930
and kindness and strength.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.530
Not just [foreign language spoken].

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.510
And they would look at me
and they would go nuts.

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.230
The little blonde boy
[foreign language spoken].

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.110
I was like, "Yeah.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.290
I am hot. Yes."

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.590
And they'd be like,
"[foreign language spoken]."

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:09.500
And I'd be like, "Dang
right I want a tortilla."

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.070
And I'd say, "Si.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.370
Por favor."

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.030
And they would take a hot tortilla.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.730
And they'd put a little salt in
it, roll it up, and give it to me.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.830
Come on. And then on a really
good day they had butter.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.040
And they'd put butter on it
and roll it up and give it,

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.870
I was just like, mm-hmm, yeah.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.320
And then they would
give me that hot kilo.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.050
And I would carry it back
warming my body to feed my family.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.270
Holy cow. How powerful is that?

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.010
And I carry them with me.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.510
I carry them with me.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.940
And the women that I
saw when I was a kid.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.620
My upbringing was absent
men pretty much.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.830
My dad was out and
about being a man.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.690
And he'd come home and
check on me and make sure,

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.210
want to see if I was being
a man or not [laughter].

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:00.670
And he was never happy with
how much of a man I was.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:07.830
But to watch the miracle
I think of the daily life.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:11.400
I became kind of obsessed
with capturing the daily life.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.330
Watching my godmother garden.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:20.140
Watching her daughters
sort the pinto beans.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.980
This act that was so graceful
and so invisible, nobody thought

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.320
about it or saw it except me.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.760
I would sit all morning and watch
and how they would put the beans

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.210
on the table and start sifting them
around and raking the good beans

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.550
into a pot they held between their
knees and without even looking,

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:46.220
flick away little pebbles and
sticks without seeing them.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.750
But they knew they were
there until they had the pot.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.010
And then they could
make food to feed us.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:55.030
And how I would try to
tell them my newest poems.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.470
And they would say,
"[foreign language spoken].

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:59.710
You talk so pretty."

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.860
Wow, man. Writing, right?

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.870
Later on we moved up to a little
white, working class suburb.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.890
I was telling people earlier today,

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.750
I had never seen lawns
until the fifth grade.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.580
I saw grass.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.530 position:56%
And I remember thinking, "Wow, these
white dudes are billionaires, man.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:27.670
They pour water on their
yards and they have grass."

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.840
And I also ate sliced bread.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:36.440
I grew up eating peanut butter
sandwiches on corn tortillas.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.860
We called it "la peanut butter."

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.620
There I was in this new
world and I have to tell you

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.160
that this big transformation
happened in the fifth grade.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.250
I did all this new stuff.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:55.280
I had a very strong Tijuana accent
until I moved to that neighborhood.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.930
I have relatives still
talk like this.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.940
OK? If I go to Mexico very
long, I come back like,

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.620
my friends think I'm kidding.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.830
They're like, "What is this man?"

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.240
"What? [inaudible]."

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:13.450
But we got up there and it
started changing immediately.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.910
And I know exactly when it changed.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.090
They didn't know what my name was.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:23.440
Right? So, I was, of course,
urine, diarrhea, urethra.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.770
They didn't know what
the heck it was.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:29.880
They started calling me unreal,
which I thought was awesome.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.090
For a guy that wanted
to be a famous author

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:35.010
or be in Led Zeppelin,
it didn't matter.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.590
Unreal. Cool name.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:42.270
So, I joined the Boy Scouts.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.830
And the Boy Scouts were
heaven for a kid like me.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.340
Going camping and stuff.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.040
And my old man did not approve.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.340
He didn't like it.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.920
He'd be like, "Meijo,
[inaudible] Boy Scouts.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.560
You wore green shorts, meijo."

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.930
I was like, "Yeah, Dad."

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.150
"You wear green shorts
and long socks

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.660
and you wear a handkerchief
on your neck."

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.000
I said, "Yeah, it's my
neckerchief [phonetic].

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.030
It's got a slide and everything."

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:14.850
And my dad said, "If you want to be
a man, join the Army [inaudible]."

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.810
And I was like, "Dad,
I'm in fifth grade."

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.850
It was always about
being a man, you know?

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.600
But here is where the change came.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.790
And I think about this a lot.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:30.190
Almost every time I turn
on the TV right now.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:35.360
I was with my boys, my new
homies, and we had been camping

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.660
and doing all this stuff.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.960
The Bat Patrol.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.260
Troop 260.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.560
Bat Patrol.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.090
And we were in the bathroom.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.580
Fifth grade.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.130
About to head into sixth grade.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.170
And everybody is in there
doing their business.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.740
And there was this one kid,
bright red hair, freckles.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.500
I mean the classic suburban
white boy, you know?

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.800
And they're all my buds.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.690
And he turns to me and
he says, "Hey, Unreal."

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:02.990
And I said, "Yeah."

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.230
And he said, "You know
what you are, man?"

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.840
I said, "No, what am I?"

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.230
He said, "You're a greaser."

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.840
And they all turned to
me and started laughing.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.140
And I said, "I'm a what?"

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.480
He said, "You're a
greaser, wet back."

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.520
And all my homies started
in, "Greaser wet back.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.820
Greaser wet back."

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.330
And they all walked out together.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.630
And I was standing there.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.210
And, you know, you're a kid.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.020
You internalize it, right?

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.700
And you think, "Greaser wet back."

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:37.860
I thought, nobody told us
that we're wet with grease

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:44.300
that only these folks in the
north part of the city can see it.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.540
And I remember taking
off my shirt and trying

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.100 position:56%
to find the grease on my undershirt.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.030
That was a shock.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:35:00.240
And my cousins would come up from
Mexico and they couldn't figure

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.670
out the whole dynamic
of race and so forth

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.110
because they weren't
poor kids like me.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.950
They were actually kind
of royalty down there.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.160
And in Southern California they
had all kinds of names for us

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.970
but the one that was
kind of creative,

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.560
they could call us taco benders

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.630
because there is a nice little
u-shape in the taco, right?

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.350
It's pretty creative.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.120
And I was walking down the
street with my cousin Jamie

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.210
who didn't speak English.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.670
He was a Beatles fiend.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:32.670
He knew English from
phonetic recounting

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.320
of Beatles songs [inaudible].

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:42.020
And he would sing,
you know [inaudible].

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.490
You know? Old [inaudible].

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:49.810
So, we're walking down the street
and a guy in a truck pulled up

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.870
and yelled, "Hey, taco bender."

00:35:52.870 --> 00:36:01.550
And he said, "What you want
cheeseburger [laughter]?"

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.750
His one English lesson.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.980
So, words meant so much to me.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.770
They always meant so much to me.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:12.280
And the thing I want to leave
with you before I go to questions

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.400
or comments if you have
any, is that at that moment

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.550
when I suddenly internalized
shame, I was so shocked.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.960
All of the sudden people
didn't like Mexicans.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.090
I thought everybody loved us.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.910
I thought Tia Flaca was awesome.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.500
I thought my grandma was cool.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.360
I thought Rampa Independencia
was cool.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:41.160
I thought Ugo Milan was super cool
and all of the sudden we weren't.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:46.330
And that was a great
and tremendous shock.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:50.880
So, everything I held
sacred was suddenly trash

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.790
in the culture in which I was in.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:56.530
And it took me a long time to
figure out how to deal with that.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.140
Thank god for words.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.090
When I got to college,
Southern California

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.570
in those days was not a
place to expect to learn

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:09.560
that there were Latino writers or
women writers or black writers.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.160
I get to college and
they're like, "OK.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:20.590
We're going to be reading
[inaudible], Carlos Fuentes."

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.750
I said, "Who?

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.700
What?" What a miracle.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:30.990
So, I felt like I got kind of
atomized and then reintegrated.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.700
And something, it was good.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.460
It was like a transporter beam
in Star Trek or something.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.730
I felt like my cells
were purified in a way.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:43.360
And so I decided what I had
to do was do a literature

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.600
of witness for the rest of my life.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.380
I was a poor boy like I told you.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.310
I wanted to be Stephen King.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:52.750
I wanted to be Robert
Plant or Steve McQueen.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.850
I just wanted a bunch
of cars and a plane.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:58.630
And for a long time I
thought if I wrote love poems

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.970
to my girlfriend Collette,
that would happen.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:05.220
Wrong. But I realized
that I wanted to witness.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.780
And that meant witness everybody.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:11.020
And sometimes it means having
to put your prejudice aside,

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.610
because I'm loaded with it,
class rage and prejudice,

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:17.420
and try to see everybody
that you're writing about

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.360
and give them a fair reading.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.660
And that can be really hard,

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.100
but that has been my
obsession ever since.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.650
So, that's a little bit
of where I came from.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:32.270
That and about 300 notebooks
full of really bad writing.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.870
And here we are now.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.520
So, thanks for listening.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.510
And if you have any
questions [inaudible].

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:46.340
[ Applause ]

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.690
There are mics.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:50.990
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 1: Hi.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.290
A fellow Chicagoan.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:56.560
And Chicago has a great tradition
of Mexican American writers, Luis.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.860
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Yeah.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.120
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 1: And I want
to know, what are you students,

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.290
what kind of stories are your
students bringing to you?

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:06.590
Is it anywhere near the same
or has too much changed?

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.190
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
That's a great question.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:14.020
I, oddly enough our school has kind

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.440
of a difficult time I think
getting Latino students to come

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.660
to our English Department.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:26.360
So, every spring they ask me to
do an Introduction to Latino Lit

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.920
and it's amazing because
those kids are like me.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.110
They have no idea.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.700
So, I hit them with
Gloria [inaudible].

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.390
You know, and then we
just make the circuit

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:38.750
through as many authors
as I can get to them.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:43.530
And in the creative writing
aspects, I do graduate workshops

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:47.670
like in the fall, well,
I'm here with you instead

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.090
of doing my day job, right?

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:53.620
So, I just teach one class,
which is a graduate workshop,

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.180
which every year, it keeps
getting bigger and bigger.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.550
And I had to stop it this year

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:02.250
because I said there are too
many people to fit in the room,

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.770
and we can't possibly
do a workshop now.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.780
But the subject matter is
fascinating and multi-faceted.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.520
And, in fact, there's
a young Chicana

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:18.250
who just wrote this amazing super
powerful piece and didn't know

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.060
if the workshop could
handle it or not.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.210
And she sent it to me, which
really moved me almost to tears

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.980
that she would have me look at her
secret story first and trust me

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.210
to tell her if it was safe or not
and should I put a trigger warning

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.880
on it or not show it at all.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.860
And it's very powerful
what she talks about

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.550
but I told her, I think
you can do this.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:40.800
I think if you feel good about
it, I'll back you up on this,

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.250
and I think it's really good.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:48.430
So, you know, the subject
matter is all over the place.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:52.130
And I am trying to just help people
find the story they want to tell.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.810
I think it's difficult when you're
just starting to know what you want

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.560
to write, you know, and
how you want to write it.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.980 position:56%
I was talking with Kelly earlier
about a writer named Nnedi Okorafor.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.210
If you know Nnedi, she
just won the Hugo Award.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:09.240
She's Nigerian.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.370
And she came to our
school to write a memoir.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.420
And over the couple of
years she started to realize

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.690 position:56%
that there's very little science
fiction and speculative fiction come

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:23.280
out of African [inaudible].

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.460
And she decided to
write science fiction

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.200
with Nigerian folklore in it.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.330
And, you know, created
her own genre by accident.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.400
So, sometimes it takes a step

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.940
and then you might surprise
yourself where you end up going.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:45.220
So, I'm trying to stay as flexible
as I can and sort of help move them

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.530
in the direction that moves them.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:52.620
And it's not always what a
wise career move would dictate.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.300
But, you know, your soul
knows what it wants.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:00.420
And I tell them, you know, you may
be in for 40 years of suffering

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.330
and obscurity but it's worth it if
that's what you really need to say.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:08.630
So, I don't know if that
answers your question, but, hi.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:09.930
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 2: Me?

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.230
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Yeah.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.530
Oh, is there somebody,
oh, I'm sorry.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.830
Let me go over there
and I'll come back.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:15.130
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 2: OK.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.430
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Hi.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.730
Sorry.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.030
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 3:
Do you have a favorite,

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.330
do you have a favorite
story you made as a child?

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.630
And what is it about?

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.580
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Oh my goodness.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.610
Probably not as a child.

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.910
I think later on I
have a lot of stories.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:33.530
Like this book "Hummingbird's
Daughter" that I did and "Queen

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:37.360
of America, The Sequel"
took 26 years to write.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.640
And they began as stories
that Tia Flaca told.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.940
So, I would say probably

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.240
that because I've carried
them with me my whole life.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.540
Yeah.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.840
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 2: Hi.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.140
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Hi.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.440
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker 2: I wanted to
ask you, who are you writing for?

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.740
You know who is your
intended audience?

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.810
Or who is it that you are
writing for [inaudible]?

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.490
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Who am I writing for?

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.230
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: For himself.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:00.900
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
That's a great question.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:06.920
My wife. She's always
my first reader.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.030
And I can tell you
when I had been working

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:14.710 position:56%
on "Hummingbird's Daughter" a
decade plus, and I gave her a draft,

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:18.300
she's a reporter, and I
said, "Here, check it out.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.600
What do you think?"

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.460
And she gave it back and
said, "I don't like it?"

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.970
What? And all my friends
took her aside and said, "No.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.390
No. No. You're supposed to
tell him it's brilliant.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:30.420
He doesn't actually
want your opinion."

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:34.630
But it was great because I
realized I could always trust her

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.270
to tell me the truth.

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:38.840
So, I think, you know,
beginning with Cindy.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.710
But also I feel responsible
to the ancestors

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.700
and to people who are gone.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:49.710
And I have honestly a lot, I've
written about this else where,

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:56.460
but in my mind I'm thinking of
a hard working woman like my mom

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:01.250
or my Tia Flaca who has had a
hellish day and is tired of putting

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.950 position:56%
on the brave face every morning and
just looking forward to getting home

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:08.380
and getting that soak in the
tub and she opens my book.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.110
And I want to give her the
best I can possibly give her.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.760
So, you know, I think those things.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.060
Hi.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.360
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: Hello.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.660
I really enjoyed listening to you.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.960
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Thank you.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.260
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: You know,

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.620
you mentioned you're part
Irish and part Mexican.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.920
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Yes.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.760
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: So, my
question is, this [inaudible]

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:32.260
or this combination, how far
do you think is the cause

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:36.780
of your boisterous way of
putting things [laughter]?

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.300
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea: Oh, I
thought I was rather somber.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:45.050
You know, I don't know.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:50.600
My mother was from English
and Hungarian stock.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.610
And she was, the family
came from the South.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.770
They were Virginians that lost
everything in the Civil War

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:58.750
and headed north to New York.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:03.190
And my father actually, my
grandmother is Irish/Mexican.

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:07.620
My Grandfather Urrea was Basque.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:13.530
And Urrea in Basque
means the golden man.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.030
Yeah. Yeah.

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:19.610
So, I just think it was, my
mother used to say to me,

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:22.420
"It's no wonder you're
so moody, dear boy."

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.260
So, I think that the
general [inaudible]

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:30.420
of my character may just
be that plus just relief

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.440
that I survived, you know?

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:38.150
And it doesn't stink to have
your dreams coming true.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:41.880
And to be able to know
that I can be here with you

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.030
because I typed is unbelievable.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.650 position:56%
And, you know, you meet your heroes.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:53.180
I'm a fan more than, I never get
up in the morning and think, "Yes,

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.660
I'm a professional author."

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.420
I get up because I'm
insane for books.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.410
And I confessed to
somebody in the green room

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:04.070
that I've been doing the Tucson
Festival of Books every year.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.370
I'm one of the founding authors.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:10.220 position:56%
Right? And one of the other
founding authors was Elmore Leonard.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.730
Oh, you know?

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:17.180
And for six years I would look at
Elmore Leonard in the green room.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.690
And Cindy would say, "Go say hi."

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:19.990
"No. No [laughter]."

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.290
"Come on."

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.590
"No. It's Elmore Leonard.

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:26.400 position:56%
I can't." And the last year before
he passed away, he started noticing,

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.290
"There's that idiot staring at me."

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:33.010
And so the last year, he
got up to go to his reading,

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.380
and he was walking out, and
he stopped at our table.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.600 position:56%
And he looked at me and went, "Hey."

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.900
And he kept going [laughter].

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:47.050
So, there's a certain element
of joy I think in all of this

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.400 position:56%
for me though, you know, she'll tell
you I complain all the time, but.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.700
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: Thank you.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.000
&gt;&gt; Luis Alberto Urrea:
Thank you, sir.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.300
I guess that's it.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.600
And we're right on the button.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.150
So, thank you.

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.290
[ Applause ]

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.590
Thank you.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:02.000
