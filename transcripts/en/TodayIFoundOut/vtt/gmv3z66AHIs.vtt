00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.879
Throughout the history of modern warfare,
the record for longest confirmed sniper kill

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.270
is one that has steadily gotten more and more
extreme as technology has progressed.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.630
At the time of writing this, the holder of
that record is British sniper Craig Harrison,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.990
who notably broke the previous record twice
on the same day by hitting two enemy targets

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.790
on two consecutive shots an astounding 2,474
metres away.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.350
For our friends across the pond, that’s
8,116.8 feet or 1.54 miles or about 22.5 NFL

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.579
football fields (including end zones) away.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.900
The shot was from such an extreme range that
it took the bullet about three seconds to

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.219
reach the target.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.100
Corporal of Horse Craig Harrison made his
record breaking shot in November of 2009 while

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.030
stationed in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.250
Harrison personally didn’t find out about
its record breaking nature until after he

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.390
returned home in 2010.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.479
The distance from which he took the shot,
which was measured and confirmed via GPS,

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.900
amazed his superiors in the Ministry of Defence
so much that they published the details of

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.140
his shot almost as soon as he got back to
the UK, and even granted him permission to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.380
give interviews about it to the world’s
media.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.640
If you’re wondering about the circumstances
surrounding the shot, Harrison was providing

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.000
cover fire for his commanding officer and
members of the Afghan National Army, who’d

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.130
been ambushed by two insurgents.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.740
According to Harrison, the insurgents were
armed with a PKM machine-gun and had pinned

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.909
down the soldiers, giving him only a short
time to assess the situation and subsequently

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.870
line up a shot to ruin the attackers’ day.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.229
With a help from a spotter, Cliff O’Farrell,
and 9 test shots to nail down the exact distance,

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.100
Harrison lined up his shot and squeezed the
trigger for a 10th time, firing a .338 Lapua

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.870
Magnum round and striking the machine-gunner
in the gut, killing him.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.650
The remaining insurgent, who wouldn’t have
even heard the shot coming, reached out to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.290
take command of the now free machine-gun only
to be hit by a second round launched by Harrison.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.550
With both insurgents down, Harrison pulled
the trigger one more time to disable the machine-gun

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.550
itself.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.870
Thus, Harrison not only broke the previous
record (7,972 feet set in 2002 in Afghanistan)

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.500
held by Canadian Rob Furlong using a McMillan-Tac
50, but he made the shot essentially three

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.310
times in a row without missing- hitting the
two insurgents and their machine-gun.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.200
This means he technically broke the record
twice within a few seconds of one another.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.930
As if all that wasn’t impressive enough,
the actual shots were noted as being about

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.060
3,000 feet beyond the L115A3 rifle’s effective
range.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.349
Needless to say, as Harrison said, “Conditions
were perfect, no wind, mild weather, clear

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.349
visibility”.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.120
Interestingly, despite the interviews he gave
over the matter, we shouldn’t really know

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.640
Harrison’s real name.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.580
Official Ministry of Defence rules state that
the identities of snipers, regardless of interviews

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.349
of this nature, should never be disclosed
publicly, as they would quickly become prime

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.349
targets.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.810
Harrison was well aware of this rule and reportedly
only agreed to speak with the media about

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.849
his record shot on the understanding that
his identity wouldn’t be disclosed or that

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:15.940
they’d give him a pseudonym.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.030
However, for reasons that aren’t clear,
the MoD never passed this restriction onto

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.170
any of the media outlets Harrison spoke with
and they all released stories crediting Harrison

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.470
under his real name, with some sources even
noting where he lived.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.260
The police quickly warned Harrison and his
family that they were in danger after the

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.580
story was printed.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.500
To protect his wife, daughter, and himself,
Harrison was left with no choice but to uproot

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.070
his family, which in turn resulted in his
wife losing her job and his daughter being

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.189
pulled from school mid-year.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.260
We’re also guessing that for the following
few months, Harrison ensured that his wife

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.480
and daughter were always within 8000 feet
of his location, just in case.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.230
Understandably, Harrison got pretty upset
about his identity being printed in the news

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.650
when he was explicitly told it wouldn’t
be.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.240
Thus, he asked the MoD for compensation for
drawing a bullseye on his family’s backs

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.330
and to cover moving expenses.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:19.750
He was later awarded £100,000 (about $156,000)
for 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.469
his trouble.
