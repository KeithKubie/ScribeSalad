&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.520
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening everybody.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.440
It's a great pleasure to
see you all here tonight.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.740
My name is David Plylar.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710
I'm in the music division.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.570
I'm a music specialist there.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.520
And we have a real treat for you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.440
for our preconcert
conversation this evening.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.930
We have composer and
pianist Frederic Rzewski,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.540
who will be performing tonight as
-- his own music, which will be --

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.320
we'll have a chance to hear
two piano pieces as well

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.240
as the world premiere of a new
piece for violin and piano.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.000
So, we'll talk a bit about that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.420
And I also have Charlton
Lee, who's the violist

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.890
with the Del Sol String
Quartet, and they've been

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.770
with us all week doing
really excellent work,

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.430
using our instruments, and last
night they performed the String

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.400
Quartet from 1955, and we'll
speak a bit about that as well.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.510
So, if you could just join
me in welcoming our guests.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.110
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.990
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I'd like to start
with something that's a bit unusual

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.800
for me, which is not a
question, but rather a statement,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.460
and this is that I had
the opportunity in 2012

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.970
to put together a chamber
concert in South Africa

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.430
at the Grahamstown Festival,
which is kind of an obscure part

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.260 position:56%
of South Africa, and we programmed
Coming Together at that performance.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.970
And what was an interesting
thing that happened was

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.640 position:56%
that when we gave the performance we
had this huge up swell of gratitude

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.460
and thanks from the audience
for that particular piece

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.650 position:56%
and people had come in from all over
the place just to hear that piece.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.160
I thought it was the Dallapiccola

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.460
that we had also programmed,
but it wasn't that.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.180
[laughter] Although that
was also a nice piece.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.740
But there -- it spoke to me at
a time that there's this element

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.950 position:56%
to your music and it's -- of course
you write lots of different music --

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.150
that tends to reach many
different types of people.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.090
And I just thought that I'd
share that as a starting point,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.970
that I had a very positive
experience in that light.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.810
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
I'm glad to hear that.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.110
I didn't know that.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.830
Do you know why people
-- ?[laughter]

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.780
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: This I do
not know, but they just said

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.550
that they were fans of
your music and so just --

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.720
it wasn't often performed there.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.020
So --

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.320
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Probably not.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.670
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, so it
was a chance to hear it I think.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.570
Hearing music live is just
also one of those things

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.670
that they greatly valued.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.970
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.600
it's funny because I had a
similar experience in Athens.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.690
I went to Athens a little more than
a year ago and a lot of people came

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:27.280 position:56%
to my concert and it turned out most
of them were anarchists [laughter]

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.610
and that this piece had been
played a number of times in Athens,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.330
and of course the guy who wrote
the text was himself an anarchist.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.410
So, there was some
connection there and there --

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.530
in Athens there are
lots of anarchists.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.660
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: [laughs] Sure.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.850
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: But
more than that I don't know.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.630
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I'm not sure
they're a particular [inaudible],

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.400 position:56%
but they certainly enjoyed the music

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.720
and the performance
[laughs] to be sure.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.020
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, good.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.320
Yeah.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.160
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, I
thought we'd start with --

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.570
I don't know how many people in
this audience were able to come

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.910
to the concert last night,
but we had a very -- Oh, good.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.720
I'm glad to see that
some of you were able to.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.310
It was a very unique experience,
and not just for us, the audience,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.900
but also for you, I would
imagine, in that there was a piece

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.700
that you had written
when you were 16 or 17.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.100
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: That's right.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.900
Both actually.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.200
[inaudible]

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: [laughs] Straddled.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.560
And I guess I'm just wondering what
that experience would be like to --

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.410
you hadn't ever had
a chance to hear --

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.270 position:56%
you had your experience with it
composing it, clearly invested a lot

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.910
of energy, and invested
time, and thought into it.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.210
At least it seemed to --

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.930
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: I was a
student and I didn't know anything

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.110
about anything and I
still don't, right?

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.380
Truly. [laughter] But I mean,
string quartet, I only knew --

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.320
I listened to a lot of
records, but I never played a --

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.650
I mean I tried to play the cello
once and I even tried the viola,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.770
but you know there's a
kind of fundamental gap

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.150
between keyboard players
and, you know,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.720
it's two completely different
universes and of course the thing

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.220
about a piano or a keyboard
instrument is that it's a machine,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.960
a labor saving device
for playing lute music.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.150
[laughter] Well, historically
that is in fact the case

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.390
because the lute is a
notoriously difficult instrument,

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:50.020
as I guess you know, and the
keyboard was developed as a way

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.970
of making it more available.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.010
I mean and you can see that
in renaissance paintings.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.570
It's the lute -- only
angels play lutes.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.730
[laughter] So -- but everybody
can play a keyboard instrument.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.530
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I can't.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.930
[laughter]

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.610
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Well, that's what it is.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.350
And I mean, you know, I
don't know how I got into it,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.770
but anyhow what I really
wanted to say is

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.610
that your performance
was spectacular.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.910
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Thank you.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.370
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
I mean, it really was.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.520
[ Applause ]

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.970
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: I had
never heard your quartet before,

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.600
but it's really fantastic.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.610
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Thank
you very much.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.910
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Aside from the fact

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.150
that you obviously worked very
hard on this particular thing,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.540 position:56%
I can see that you're, you know, a
real quartet and those things aren't

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.360 position:56%
so common these days, but -- So, I'm
going to definitely check you out.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.580
[laughter] But thanks anyway.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.920
I mean it was fantastic because
my piece is, you know, basically,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.990
you know, just a student exercise.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.750
It's not so bad, but it isn't
really that [laughter] exciting.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.050
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: [laughing]
Not at all.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: What I wouldn't say
is your standard student exercise.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.550
I don't remember too many
16-17 year olds who really --

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.850
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well I --

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.150
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Mendelssohn
comes to mind.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.920
[laughter]

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.030
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, I was
trying to be avant-garde also

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.670
and so forth and, you know, I was
trying to do all kinds of things,

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.610
but without really know howing
-- [laughs] how to do them.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.410
And it's just as well it
waited 60 years to be performed

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.200
because if it had been informed
then -- been performed then --

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.400
then probably some
professor would have said,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.520
"Look dear take this
stuff out [laughter]

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.360
because you can't have
these glissandi,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.150
you know, that's ridiculous."

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.880
And in fact [laughs]
they are ridiculous.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.260
[laughter] But the extraordinary
thing about your performance was

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.620 position:56%
that you did exactly what's written.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.590
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Well, we thought
about it and we said, "Well,

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.840
he was 17 and he probably said,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.330
'I don't care!'" [laughter]
So, we did it.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.630
[laughter]

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.930
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yes, you
know, I mean I didn't expect that.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:20.070
I expected that you were
going to like, you know,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.710 position:56%
smooth out the [laughs] funny parts.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.560
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I think
because we work so much

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.900
with living composers we're
used to starting from the point

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.160 position:56%
of doing exactly what's on the page
and then if they think it doesn't --

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.030
if they don't like it they can
change it and then we'll change it.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, that brings
up an interesting question Charlton,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.960
with the process of preparing
this particular piece you know

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.040
that you're going to have
the opportunity to speak

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.320
with the composer, but it's at
such a remove that it's really

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.460
like everybody's coming to this
piece as if it were a new piece.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.250
Did that affect the way -- or
did you still just go at it just

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.630
as if it were a new piece
that's put in front of you?

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.210
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: We still --
we treat every piece that way.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.550
So, even the two pieces on
these programs by the composers

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.350
who are deceased, Crawford
[assumed spelling] and Ontile,

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.100 position:56%
[phonetic spelling] we still
approached them as if they're living

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.550
and then -- with like for example
the other day when you brought

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.270
out those manuscripts, that was a
treat, and then we can look and,

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.570
you know, they have notes written.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.990
It's like, mistake
here, tempo change here,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.880
it's like all this
great information.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.750
Then we of course copy them over.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.050
[laughter]

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And actually I
think you did some adaptations based

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.120
on little minor notes.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.420
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yeah, we did.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.740
Yeah, there was some
-- in the Ontile --

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.430
let's see, when we recorded
the Ontile we had --

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.190
there was one notation where he
crossed out one section and --

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.010
but this time around we felt like,
actually it makes sense with it.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.210
Well, you can tell us tonight
if it works or not, but --

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.840
[laughter] So, we kept
the whole thing this time.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.850 position:56%
Yeah, it's all the way -- it's all
what he wrote the first time around.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.450
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: The
Crawford is extraordinary.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.940
I didn't know this piece.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.240
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: It's incredible.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.810
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Especially the second movement.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.110
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yeah.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.410
[laughs] That's --

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.710
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
No, that really is --

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.400
I mean that was an eye --
an ear -- opener for me.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.820
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yeah.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.630
No, she -- we were talking
as we were working in depth

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:16.220
on this piece we were saying that
because she knew this young fellow

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:23.520
at the time named -- uh oh,
now I'm blanking on a very --

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.750
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
You mean knew him in --

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.240
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Mister
Elliot Carter.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.540 position:56%
So, he was her kind of a -- you know
he was a younger composer who's kind

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.910
of hanging out with
them a little bit.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.210
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Them who?

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.810
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: The
Seegers and other people.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.110
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: both of them?

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.410
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I think so, yes.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.830
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: This
was before she was married.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.220
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I'm
not sure exactly when --

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.520
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: It
says so in the program.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Okay, there you go.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.720
And -- oh no, this piece for sure.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.020
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: This piece.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.850
This was written a year
before she was married.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.150
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: That's right.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.450
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Which is a --

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.350
you know normally it's
not so significant,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.840
but I mean the only thing I
really know about this woman is

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.030
that she basically
stopped composing.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.330
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: It's a pity.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.630
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.550
I'm not sure what that's all
about, but it's not unusual.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.300
Of course the same thing
was true of Moller's wife.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.600
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Right.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.900
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Same thing.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.200
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: That's right.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.820
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: And,
you know I mean it's a --

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.210
I presume probably very
common in, you know --

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.510
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Right.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.810
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It's
definitely a complicated issue

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.240
that has been written
about quite a bit recently.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.960
Judith Tick definitely approaches
it in her biography and some essays

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.610
about it, but yes,
but Carter wasn't --

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.180 position:56%
I believe those first string quartet
was actually influenced by --

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.480
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I think a lot

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.450
of his ideas [laughs] were
influenced by this piece.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.750
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: By this piece.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.170
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.020
A lot of the polyrhythms
and the voicing --

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.000
voices crossing and all this stuff.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.440
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: But he didn't
start doing that kind of thing --

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.080
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Until
about 15 years later.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.380
[laughs]

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.680
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Yeah, well more than that.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.980
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yeah, or more.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.280
Right.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Because up
until 1950 or so he was writing sort

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:08.700
of your standard neoclassic
Americana kind of thing.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.130
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yeah.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.430
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well,
was this when you --

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.040
going back to when you
wrote the string quartet,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.310
was that the first writing
for strings that you had done,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.170
or had you done some
practice pieces before

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.850
that for other versions
of the ensemble?

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.680
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Wait.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.980
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Or for you to say.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.780
[laughter] When you first
wrote that string quartet was

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.500
that your first attempt at writing
for strings or was that -- ?

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.800
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Oh no.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.100
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: No.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.400
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
[laughs] No, no, no.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.700
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It
didn't sound like that.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.000
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: There are some
other unperformed -- [laughter]

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.820
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: We can
make a business out of this.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.120
[laughter]

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:51.480
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: In fact, I
mean, you know, I stopped writing

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.950
for strings because no string
players were interested

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.000
and that's still true today.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.290
Nobody is interested in
-- nobody is interested.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:07.500
I mean look, you probably wouldn't
have done this unless you had been

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.500
hired to do it.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.800
[laughter] Let's face it.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.800
I mean string players are just not
interested as a rule in new music.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.310
I mean your group may be
exceptional, but the rule is,

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.820
you know -- even at
conservatories I know well

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.120
that many teachers tell the
students, "Don't play new music

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.170
because it will ruin
your technique."

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.810
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Actually for
our case it would have been

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.660
if we were disinterested
in the piece

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:42.780
without being hired it
would be because it was old.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.090
[laughter] If you had a new
quartet we'd be all over it.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.390
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, I do.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.690
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Oh, you do.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:48.990
[laughter] Ooh.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.290
Let's talk.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.720
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: This has all
been an elaborate set up for you.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.420
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: [laughs] Yes.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.070
Well, yes it's true.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.250
I mean, you know, but -- look
you have to admit that I'm right.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.550
[laughs]

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.920
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: No, you're right.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.170
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Some string
quartets maybe will play let's say

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.620
Philip Glass or something
like that, okay?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.070
Why? Because they know
there will be an audience

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.120 position:56%
and this is a perfectly good reason.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.200
But I suppose one good reason
for not playing new music is

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.950
because there's really not
very much that's any good.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.370
Well, that happens to be also true.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.120
But how many string quartets for
instance, since we were speaking

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.780
about Elliot, how many string
quartets play his work?

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.240
How many? Can -- just
off the top of your head.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.440
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: For
sure the Pacificas.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.740
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yeah,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.400
but how many string quartets
will actually play this stuff?

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.700
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I'm not sure.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.000
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Not too many.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.300
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yeah,
probably not too many.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.600
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Of
course it's difficult.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.900
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yes.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.200
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: But, you know,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.350
any string quartet music
that's any good is --

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.960
has, you know Beethoven too.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:13.970
So, you know it's not -- these two
things don't really sit comfortably

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.270
with each other.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.890
I mean, your group
may be an exception.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.190
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I
would say that they are

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.330
because they have a great track
record of really promoting --

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.440
especially living composers -- and
doing great work with their music.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.010 position:56%
Also with some of the music that's a
bit more obscure that we don't hear

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.530 position:56%
as often, like the Antile, [phonetic
spelling] they have a collection

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.870
of all of his string quartet music.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.620
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Oh really?

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.130
You've recorded --

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.460
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Right.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.990
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Well, of course he is --

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.050
deserves to be much
better known than he is.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:50.550
And he has and -- undeservedly
-- not very good reputation.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:16:00.180
And even I didn't really know the
work very well and I still don't --

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.610
until fairly recently, until
I realized that, you know,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.070
this guy actually wrote
interesting music.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.800
It's hard to say why.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.450
Anyway, let's not stare.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:18.130
This subject is getting
too pessimistic.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.340
[laughter]

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.500
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, maybe we can
look at some of your piano music.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.500
So, moving away from
strings, you're also going

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.760
to be playing some solo
piano works tonight.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.560
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yes.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.890
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Maybe
you can share a few things

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.560
about these particular pieces,
or the types of piano [inaudible]

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.860
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Alright,

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.160
now we're coming to
the part that I like.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.470
You know, I suggested today that --

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.900
what are we going to
do on this talk?

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.790
And I said, "Well, an easy
way of dealing with it is

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.980
to let the audience talk."

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.360
So, maybe somebody has
[laughs] something to say.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.810
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Sure.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.110
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yes.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.660
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: If you
don't mind we'll take a --

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.240
&gt;&gt; -- Frederic Rzewski: Why
don't you take this mic down?

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.660
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: If Jay
[assumed spelling] is [inaudible]

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.410
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well
here's what -- right here.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:08.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm -- you said that conservatory
teachers tell the string players not

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.750
to play the new string quartets

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.620
because it will ruin
their technique.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.240
What did you mean by that?

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:21.240
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: I just know
what I heard and I used to teach

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.770
in the Liaz Conservatory
[phonetic spelling] myself.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:29.970
And actually the Liaz Conservatory
in Belgium has a long history of,

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.430
you know, association with violin.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.320
People like, you know,
all the famous, you know,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.580
Izie [phonetic spelling] and
all these people, you know,

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.420
they were all connected with that.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:50.190 position:56%
So, they have a long history of,
you know, string teachers and so on.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.570
And people told me that, that,
you know the teachers told them --

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.610
told the students, you know,
"Stay away from modern music

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.400
because it will ruin
your technique."

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.620
And it may be true for all I know.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:09.890
You know maybe, you know, you
guys play Azul Ponticello very

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.910
convincingly, but what is it
like when you play Mozart?

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.300
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: We
don't use a Ponticello.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.350
[laughs]

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.650
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Exactly.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.690
So, you know, I mean the
Kronos Quartet is well known

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:28.010
for playing new music,
for better or for worse,

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:32.250
but I also heard them play classics
and they don't do it very well,

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.450 position:56%
or at least they didn't when I
heard them, which was some time ago.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.490
And maybe it's true, you know?

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.680 position:56%
Maybe it's true that if you're going

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.500
to play the classics
correctly you should stay away

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.560
from this other stuff.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.860
[laughter]

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.160
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I happen to think

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.810
that it would actually
just expand your pallet,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.120
but it is a common trend that a lot

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.890
of conservatory teachers have their
students focusing so primarily

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:08.260 position:56%
on the classics that they don't have
time really to explore beyond that.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.910
And so a lot of them -- we
were just at -- Where was it?

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.270
Oh, we were just at Peabody
last week, giving a class,

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.100
and I think people were a little
scared by some of the pieces

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.120
that we played because they
had never heard anything

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.630
like that before.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.840
And some of it was
not even that far out.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.830
So, it's really -- and
that's not unusual.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.570
I think it's quite common now
that a lot of the students,

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:38.320 position:56%
if they want to explore contemporary
music, they have to go outside

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.900
of the school to access it.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.200
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I think there's --

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.500
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yeah?

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.750
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I think there's
also different populations of --

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.640
different teachers
offer different things

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.550 position:56%
to their students at conservatories.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.620
I mean the root of
that is conservative.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.470
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: No.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.770
[laughter] I beg to differ.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.070
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Okay.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.540
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: In fact
maybe somebody in the audience --

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.570
I heard already some
-- just heard protest.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.040
Can somebody tell us what
this word actually means?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.550
No hu? Well, I often, you know,
talk to my students about this.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.710
Well, I lived in Italy
for a long time.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.010
So, the word is conservatorio.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.560
Now, what is a conservatorio?

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:29.540
It is an orphanage because in the
middle ages the church received --

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:34.330
you can still see them in certain
places, in Padua for example,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:39.940
in front of the Cathedral of Saint
Anthony there is a curious rotund

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.410
structure, which has a little
door on it and there's a kind

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.420
of lazy Susan inside the door.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.360 position:56%
Now the whole point of that is that
behind the door on the other side --

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:57.410
behind it on the other side there's
a similar door with a nun waiting

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:04.260
and what you do is if you have a
child which you really can't afford

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.340
to bring up, instead of throwing
it in the river you take it

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.900
to the church, put it in there,

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.550
and on the other side the nun
takes the baby and that's it.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.260
You never make eye
contact or anything.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:26.040
And so many children were saved
or conservati in this way.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.120
So, the place where --

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.210
which receives these children
there is a conservatori,

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.420
or place where they are saved.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:41.840 position:56%
And of course the church brings them
up and teaches them to do things

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.050
like decorating the church,
singing in the choir.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:51.510
So, many of the famous
painters of the renaissance

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:57.870
and musicians were
[laughs] saved in this way.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.080 position:56%
And only in the eighteenth century
did Caro Bini [phonetic spelling] go

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.550
to Paris and start the
first conservatoire,

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:11.560
which then was -- became
a music school.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.650
But that's not what the word means.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.570
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I wasn't really
trying to say that's what it means,

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.520
but it certainly is
one of those things

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.080
that one finds in a conservatory.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:26.050
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: [sighs] Well
that happens to be an accident

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.350
of language [laughter]

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.810
that conservatories
tend to be conservative.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:36.120
But it's [laughs] nothing
really structurally --

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.880
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
to point out, yes.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.180
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yeah.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.020
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Can we go back
to your piano playing in terms

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.040
of what -- I just want to know a
bit more about the types of music

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.410
that you've been writing
lately for solo piano.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.450
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,
what would you like to know?

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.750
[laughter]

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.050
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Anything
you'd like to tell us.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.350
I --

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.190
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,
you can hear a lot of it.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:08.950
Just go on IMSLP and most of my
music is there, up for grabs.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:14.480
You can download the scores
and the recordings, free.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.890 position:56%
[laughter] So, if you're interested,
you know, you can do that.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.190
Yeah.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.090
&gt;&gt; Then how do you make a living?

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.390
[laughter]

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.350
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: The question
was; how do I make a living?

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.480
Or should I --

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.160
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: We've got it down.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.960
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
This way and that way.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.510
[laughter] You know I don't
make much of a living,

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:43.170
but I manage to survive and one
of the ways I make a living is

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.190
like thanks to this place.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:50.880
I got a nice commission to write
these pieces that we're going

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.340
to hear tonight and tomorrow.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:59.770
So, I used to make a living
mostly by playing the piano

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:05.830
and occasionally some kind
of something, you know,

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.830
coming in from composing, but
now it's more the opposite.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:16.830
But let's face it, [laughs] I
just told David, I said that,

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:22.150
"There are lots of good
musician jokes, as we know,

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:29.350
mostly about viola players
[laughter] and trombones

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.400
and so forth, and very
few jokes about composers

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.050
because it just isn't funny."

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.630
[laughter] But there is one I like.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:45.310
It's -- the composition teacher is
trying to discourage the student

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:50.240
so he says, "Well, what do
you want to get into this for?

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.990
It's just one frustration
after another

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.170
and they never play your music.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.650
You never get any recognition.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:05.560
You know, nothing ever happens and
of course there's no money in it

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.600
and it just goes on year
after year until you're 50."

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.940
And the student perks up and
says, "And then what happens?"

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.510
[laughter] And the teacher says,
"Well, then you get used to it."

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:26.040
[ Laughter ]

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.200
That's -- I won't tell anymore
because they get more depressing.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.550
[laughter] But, you know, I mean
one doesn't do this for a living.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.410
That's the answer.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:41.090
If you read music for a living
you're doing the wrong thing.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:45.290
First of all, if you write
music for money it's probably --

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:53.060
it might be, you know -- you might
do a good job doing commercial

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.430
music, but if you're
trying to do something

00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:03.210 position:56%
that is not commercial then it won't
be very good if you're doing it

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.660 position:56%
for money, if I make my point clear.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.950
You know it's very simple,
but that's the truth.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.660
So, like, you know, there are
certain things that you cannot do

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:18.390 position:56%
for money, first of all because it's
not a very good way of making money,

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.480
and secondly because if you do it

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.030
for money it's not
going to be any good.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.760
That's all.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.670
And I guess there are
many examples of that.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:35.750
I mean priests for example,
or for that matter doctors.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:40.170
I met in Stanford -- I was in
Stanford University a few years ago

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.960
and there was a Chinese
student -- pianist --

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.200
you know, there are no
music majors in Stanford.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.690
You can major in different
things, but not music.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:55.790
So -- but many students
study music nonetheless.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:00.110
So, there was -- I was doing a
piano master class or something

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:05.270
and there was somebody -- a Chinese
woman -- who played quite well.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.150
And so I talked to her afterwards
because I was interested,

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:14.920
you know -- this was in
the nineties so it wasn't

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.900
so -- it was a while ago.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.830
Before it was clear
whether China was --

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.780
you know, which way China was going

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.560
and it was still very much a
communist country, if you like.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.430
And so I asked her, "Well,
what are you really studying?"

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.380
She said, "I'm studying medicine."

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.040
So, I thought, "Well,
this is interesting."

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.570
And, you know -- so I
asked her, "Are you --

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:46.140
you want to become a doctor
because you want to help people

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.470
or because you want to get rich?"

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:56.660
And she went, [growls] "Get rich!"

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.450
[laughter] So, you know, okay.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:03.270
This is certainly --
that's possible.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.500
But it's not really a good idea.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.270
I mean there are certain --

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:16.840
there's a fundamental contradiction
there somewhere, it seems to me.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:22.300
And it certainly is true
in the case of composition.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.940
You just don't do it for money.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.680
So, you make a living
one way or another.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.990
Most people in this
country do it by teaching.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.840
Well, I would have done that
too, gladly, if I had been able

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.040
to get a job, but I wasn't.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.040
So, I went to Europe and
did it some other way.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.850
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, you also
had going for you the ability

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.700
to perform your own
music, which was,

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.830
I think, a helpful exponent of --

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.130
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, yes.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:59.690
It's good if you can -- if you're
a performing musician it's good

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.790
to bring these two things
together as much as possible.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.690
I mean it's good to
get paid when you play,

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.960
and that's actually becoming
more and more difficult

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.810
as you -- I'm sure you will agree.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.110
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yes.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:18.080
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: There's less
and less money around for culture.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.480
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: That's right.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.780
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
But that's a long story.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.300
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: That's
a very big story.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.600
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: We
could talk about that

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.900
for the rest of the night.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.200
[laughs]

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.500
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: All night.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.800
[laughs]

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.100
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, one
other thing that we're going

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.700
to be hearing tonight that I would
love to hear you say a few words

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.000
about if you like,
would be the new piece,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.430
the new commission work
for violin and piano.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.470
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, I did
write about it in the program notes

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:45.780
and there's not really
much more to say about it.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, how much have
you composed for that medium before?

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.450
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
For violin and piano?

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.750
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.050
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Well, around the time

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.270
of this piece you played last night
I also wrote a sonata for violin

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.980
and piano and I think
maybe it got lost.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.280
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Oh.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.280
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: At least
I don't know where it is.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.850
It's kind of in -- I remember
it's kind of in the style

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.700
of Bartok or something like that.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:14.290
So -- and I tried writing for
violin and piano in the meantime,

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.740
occasionally a few fiddle players
expressed some interest in it,

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.190
but I didn't get very far.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.770
And as I say, I think it was
mainly because, you know,

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.980
string players are
basically just not interested.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:36.090
And, in fact, it is kind of an
antiquated, or archaic, form.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:40.510
I mean, not string quartet
maybe, but say violin and piano,

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.600
or if you think about it
there isn't really that much.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.350 position:56%
And for that matter, you know,
beside from the Shostakovich Sonata,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.580
what is there for viola
and piano for example.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:51.890
[laughter] I mean really?

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.190
Do you ever -- ?

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.490
You must know.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.420
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Actually
I'm focusing so much

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.460
on string quartets [laughs] I'm
not really paying attention.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.740
But there's actually
a lot being written.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.740
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: There
may be a lot written [laughs]

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.100
but it doesn't get played and
that's probably a good thing.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:12.700
[laughter] Is there
any significant -- ?

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I'm so biased just
towards the string quartet it really

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.760
isn't fair.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.060
[laughs]

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.360
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: That's fine,
but what I'm saying is that yeah,

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.370
I don't think it's -- you know
there may be string quartets,

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.250
although there aren't
that many of those either.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.770
That, you know --

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.070
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: There's a lot.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:35.040
Actually you should see the
piles of submissions we have.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.590
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: That may
well be that there is a lot.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.890
Somebody said something.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.190
--

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:43.770
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: They
were just laughing.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.070
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Oh, just laughing.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.370
Okay.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.380
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, I think
that in any case there's --

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.010
whether a medium is played out or
not there's always something to say

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.060
in it I think and it seems like --

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.940
what's an interesting thing is
that you've done this for us,

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.550
and we'll get to hear this tonight.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.850
And kind of as a counterpart we
have the collaborative effort

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.800
with the Philips Collection and
you'll be playing another violin

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.430
and piano piece tomorrow there.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.410
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,
this is a great idea.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.040
I mean, it's my own
point of view, but --

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.340
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah,
we think so too.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.640
[laughs]

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.940
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: But I think --
you know I think composers would --

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.890
most composers would agree
because there isn't a whole lot

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.910
of demand for violin and piano.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:28.600
It just seems like
it's an archaic forum

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:34.740 position:56%
and therefore there isn't that much.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.240
So, I mean I don't know.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.570
We'll see what it's like.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.730
I have a pretty good idea of
what it's going to sound like

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.310
and I think it's not so bad.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:48.570
But of course I'm the last
person [laughs] to judge.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.870
We'll see.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:57.940
But I -- but it's a good idea,
you know, to get people to do --

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:03.930
get them back into this form
again because it seems to be --

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.850
I don't know I can't get --

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.850
I mean you probably know
more than I do about this.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.150
I mean --

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:11.520
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well,
the library has a --

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.390
this is funded through the McKim
Fund in the Library of Congress,

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.680
which as many of you concert
goers who have been to lots

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.450
of our concerts, it's a fund
that we've had in place for many,

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.800
many years, I think since the
late sixties or early seventies,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.880
and it's commissioned -- I'm trying
to think of the number offhand --

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.380
but a number of very large
-- of pieces of, you know,

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.880
different styles, different
composers, all those types

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.420 position:56%
of things, but including things
like the Carter duo and other things

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.220
like that and some works
by Babbitt and it's a --

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.460
it has a wide variety
of opportunities given

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.870
for that particular ensemble,

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.630
but funding requires it
to be violin and piano.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.930
So, that's one reason why we
stick with that when we do that.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:00.560
But it certainly has, I
think, enlarged the body

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.980
of music available for that.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: I think I asked
you, when this first arose, I said,

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.550
"Well, does it really
have to be violin?

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:12.570 position:56%
For instance, couldn't it be viola?"

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.450
[laughter] Well, my
daughter plays viola

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:17.850
and of course I was
thinking about that.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.550
And David said, "Nope it
has to be violin and piano."

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.850
[laughter]

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.150
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So,
we just need a new fund

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.950
that covers viola and piano.

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:29.100
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, my
daughter has this particular point

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.140
of view, she thinks that the
real instrument is the viola,

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:36.830
after all violino is just
a little viola, that's all.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.680
[laughter] and the real instrument
is the viola and she thinks what --

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.480 position:56%
you should just have a five stringed
viola, a viola with an E string

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.760
and then get rid of the violin.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.060
[laughter]

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.360
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: How do you
feel about that Charles?

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.660
[laughter]

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.120
&gt;&gt; That's how electronic
violins are made these days.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.420
[laughter]

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.720
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Yes, I know they --

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.160
&gt;&gt; Electronic ones are made with
five -- exactly that, five strings.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: I know it does.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.760
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I've even
seen some six stringed ones.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.260
[laughter]

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.190
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,
her point was that, you know,

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:08.600
the thing about the violin --

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.340
I think the dramatic part

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.550
of the violin is the G
string, the low string.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:20.790
And she says the G string is
really much better on the viola.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.780
And, you know, actually it's
hard to argue with that.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.080
It's just --

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.380
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Then
you have the C string.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.680
[laughter]

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.980
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
And then you have on top

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.450
of that you have that
fantastic C string.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:36.150 position:56%
By the way, I did notice your --
you have a particular way of playing

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.740
that -- you know the
viola doesn't often stick

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:45.540 position:56%
out in a string quartet, and you do.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.320
[laughter] Was it because
of the instrument or --

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.750
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Are any
of my colleagues here?

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.880
[laughter]

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.210
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: No, my
question is -- I mean it --

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:57.950
was the instrument unusually
strong or is it just your -- ?

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.480
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: No, they
have the big instruments.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.890
The -- I mean, last night Ben
[assumed spelling] was playing the

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:05.590 position:56%
Chrysler Coronary [assumed spelling]

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.590
and Rick [assumed spelling]
was playing the Besk Strata

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.890
[phonetic spelling].

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.820
They should -- no,
it's probably just me.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.490
I like to play loud.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Just a power house.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.150
So, yeah.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.450
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yes.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:18.960
Well, yeah, I mean I
was impressed by that.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I mean I -- there's
a wonderful quote from Michael Tree,

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.060
[assumed spelling] the former
violist of the Guarneri Quartet,

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.450
and he said that the violas
should always play louder

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.460 position:56%
than his colleagues think he should.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.100
[laughter]

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.680
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yeah, well
of course we're starting to get

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.510
into the area of viola jokes.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.810
[laughter]

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:46.310
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, why don't
we take some more questions.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.070
There's a microphone
that will come to you.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.890
&gt;&gt; Hi, thanks.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:53.380
You said earlier that
-- or suggested that --

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.120
much new music wasn't very good,

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.450
but are there any contemporary
composers you particularly

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.440
like or respect?

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.130
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Oh,
yeah quite a few of them.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.430
Yeah. Sure.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:08.640
I mean, actually there are a lot of
them and the interesting thing is

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.630
that -- well it goes up and down,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:18.020
but there for a while there
it looked as though, you know,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.310 position:56%
composition might be on the way out.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:25.870
After all there's no reason why
it should stick around forever

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:30.080
and we can see the art
of painting, for example,

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:36.980
seems to be disappearing,
if not already gone.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.940
The art of painting with
oil colors, which has been

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.550
around for say 600 years
or something like that,

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.260
since Ja Do [phonetic
spelling], say.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:53.240
It's, you know, arguably finished

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:58.370
because now we have
something called visual arts.

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.780
Well, I've never seen a visual art.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.080
I don't know what it is.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.380
I know what painting is.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.870
I know what sculpture
is, but visual arts

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:12.290
to me is a euphemism
synonymous with nothing.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:18.980
And the same thing may
be happening with music.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:24.790
It's clear to everybody I think
that the level of creative --

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.980
the creative level of music
has been going down steadily

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:34.330 position:56%
for the last 100 years, if not more.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:38.670
And I'm afraid since
Stockhausen was a good composer,

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.850
but he wasn't as good
as Richard Strauss,

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:47.800
who in turn was not
quite as good as Brahms.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.120
So, there is clearly
a steady decline

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.250
in quality throughout the
twentieth century, which is --

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:57.570
I mean you may argue with it.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.470
You may say, "Well,
actually, you know,

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.140
Schoenberg was the greatest
composer who ever lived,

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.660
but it won't convince most people.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:13.720
Of course he was a good composer,
but again so on and so forth --

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.890
but whereas -- interestingly the
level of performance has gone

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.950
in the opposite direction.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:27.760
The young performers of today
are better than Horowitz

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.710
and you can hear that on -- one of
the advantages of the internet is

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:37.570
that you can just push a button
and compare; [laughs] five seconds.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:42.970
And it's quite extraordinary
that this is true.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.170
So, it's not at all simple.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:50.020
It's a complex process and
of course that can be due

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.660
to many different factors.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:56.780
One of them, for example, is the
radio and technology in general

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.210 position:56%
and the media and the monopolization

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:02.040
of the music industry
and etcetera, etcetera.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.830
I mean, basically capitalism
is not good for culture.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:12.710
Capitalism does not lead to
better art, on the contrary,

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:18.990
it's destructive in many, many
ways including the [laughs] are

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:24.690
of art and culture.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.560
It -- capitalism is --
it's time to get rid of it.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.380
[laughs] We need something else.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.180
I mean, this was not
always true of course.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.650
There -- even in the
nineteenth century much art

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:47.680 position:56%
and culture owes its existence to
the fact that there were rich people

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.910
around who could spend money on it.

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.160
But today it is no longer true.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.450
It -- well, okay, this is again
a completely different thing.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.790
[laughs] The point is though
that yes, there are --

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.980
yeah, and it's a complex
process and it --

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:05.790
I think history goes in
both directions at once.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.720
It goes forward and it also
goes backward at the same time.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:16.700
So, for a while it looked as though
there were not very interesting

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.290 position:56%
composers around, and of course
that varies from country to country.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:25.500
Unfortunately in this
country it's especially true.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:31.700
A lot of young composers
want to be pop stars.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.360
It's unfortunate, but it's true.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.020
And of course most of them
won't become pop stars,

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.040
but some of them do, and some
of them even get commissions

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.720
from the Metropolitan
Opera or wherever

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.590
and of course you could say,
"Well, this has always been true."

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:55.440
Maybe, but -- So, it's hard --

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:02.490
I can't point to really
any really significant,

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.920
interesting young composers
in this country.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:10.590
I can point to a few in
some European countries.

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.950
Now of course I don't know
everything and I don't --

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.850
and most of the time I don't live
here so I -- there probably --

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.060
and maybe there are
some young people

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.690
around who are very interesting
and who I just don't know.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:28.790
And I would hope that
would be the case.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:33.120
Probably if Ursula Oppens were
here she would probably be already

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.560
protesting, loudly, and saying,
you know, there's this one,

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.040
and this one, and this one, and
this one, and of course I know

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.650
from long friendship that it's
better not to argue with Ursula.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:51.740
[laughter] And [laughs] I would be
very happy if that were the case,

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:57.810
but there are some -- a few
interesting younger composers

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.600
around in certain places.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:07.050
So, I wouldn't be surprised if
there's a new kind of generation

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:14.090
that appears that -- One thing that
I think was not good was serialism.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:19.340
I think serialism did not help
to advance the art of music.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:26.760
It had a definitely a depressing
quality on the level of music.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:32.940
A lot of music was produced that
has this academic quality about it,

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:37.690
which did not guarantee its
future; on the contrary.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:44.090
But even worse, I would say,
was what is known as minimalism.

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.310
It's even worse.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:50.320
And -- but fortunately now you
have some younger composers

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.910
who not only don't give a
damn about serial music,

00:43:54.910 --> 00:44:01.670
which is already being forgotten,
but even they don't give a damn

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:06.740
about minimalism either
and this kind of green mold

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.470
or fungus is growing
on this kind of music,

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:14.200
which before the people
are even dead.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.720
[laughter] At least,
you know, Stockhausen

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.510
and Boulez are now gone, but --

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:25.390
[ Laughter ]

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:29.160
But to see this happening already,
you know, this mold growing

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.740
on people who are still there,
it's kind of frightening.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:38.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Well, it's kind of
curious that tonight the other piece

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.930
that we're playing tonight is
by Ben Johnston and so that --

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:43.750
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,
he was a very good composer.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.050
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: And still is.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.350
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: And still is!

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.350
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: He's still alive.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.910
[laughter] He is 90, to be fair.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:54.520
But he would -- in many ways --
would probably be the antithesis

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.880
of a serialist composer because his
whole paradigm was just intonation.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.160
So, he wanted pure ratios
between the pitches.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.840
And so everything was blending in
a beautiful wave, not strange wave.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.850
But so the whole idea about
serialism and, you know,

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.960
each half step being a
square root of two --

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.800
oh no, twelfth root of
two, or some crazy --

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.360
you know, it's like was
completely against his ideas.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.490
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, you
know, the reality is that these --

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:26.730
what you're talking
about is just theory.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.030
That's mathematics.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:29.330
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Yes.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:30.630
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: I mean,
you look at a real piano

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.550
after the piano tuner is done with
it, it has absolutely nothing to do

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:37.010
with the twelfth root
[laughing] of two.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:40.880
It's whatever the piano
tuner thinks sounded good.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.790
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: He has
to make magic with it.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: And in fact all
pianos are completely out of tune.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.980
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Right.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.670
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: And if they
weren't they wouldn't sound good.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.090
[laughter]

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.720
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Actually I've
heard some that have been --

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.990
but then you can only play
specific pieces on them.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:59.960
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: No.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:05.400
The piano I'm going to play on
tonight is a good instrument.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.200
I don't know if anybody
tuned it [laughter] recently.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.500
They probably did, right?

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.820
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: They were
tuning just as I came in.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.340
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,
I worked on it this morning.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.120
It sounded very good
even before it was tuned.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.040
[laughter] It's probably going
to sound even better now.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.980
But you know piano tuners have
this thing that they talk about,

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:29.200
which I have never understood,
it's called harmonisity.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.580
You know what it is?

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:35.730
It's something about how the spaces
between the intervals gets bigger

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:41.250
as you go from the middle of the
instrument to the outer extremes.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.070
But I have never understood
[laughs] what that actually means.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:49.600
I think it just means that piano
tuners have found this particular

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.030
way of making the instrument
sound good and it probably varies

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:55.820
from instrument to instrument.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:58.990
So, this twelfth root of
two business is, you know,

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.520
it's like E equals MC squared.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.650
You know, maybe it's
true [laughs] but --

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:07.280
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I think it's
-- for us as string players,

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.950
of course we're particularly
sensitive to those,

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:11.950
and so to us the piano
basically sounds

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:13.410
out of tune, I'm sorry to say.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.710
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Well, it is out of tune.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:16.920
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Exactly,
but we hear it.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:21.510
[laughs] So -- and I think --
So, what we are able to do,

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.440
and if you're tuning --
because our tendency is

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.470
to tune more pure,
as much as we can.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.510
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Pure?

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.380
Oh, don't give me that.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.680
[laughter]

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.980
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Tuning more

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.440
with smaller ratios,
let's put it that way.

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.740
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Ratios?

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.040
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Ratios.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.340
Like --

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.640
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So,
like smaller numbers?

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.940
[inaudible]

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.240
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Right.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.940
So, a fifth being a
three to two match.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.620
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Okay,
I'll take your word for it.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.680
I've never understood these things.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:56.700
So, I don't know, maybe.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:01.350
Okay, but any rate, Ben Johnston,
whether he believes this stuff

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:02.970
or not, it doesn't really matter.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.220
The fact was that he wrote --
has written some good music.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.520
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Exactly.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.820
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yeah.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.120
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: The
music is really fun.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.240
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: How
he did it, who cares.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.540
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I
think we have time

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.170
for just about one more question.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:20.550
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I hope,
no [inaudible].

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.850
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Let's say two.

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:23.210
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Okay,
two more questions.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:24.700
&gt;&gt; Okay, is this good?

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.330
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Why
do we have to stop anyway?

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.270
&gt;&gt; Anyway -- [laughter]

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:30.860
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well,
it's only 20 after seven.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.160
When is the concert?

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.460
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Eight,
but we have to open

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.380
up the house at seven thirty.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.680
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
Alright, well -- [laughter]

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.570
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is a simple one.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:44.790 position:56%
You mentioned that if music is
composed for money it won't be good,

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:48.350
but when I read the writings
of composers of the past,

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:52.680
like Dvorak comes to mind, he
was very much writing for money.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.630
He would write about how much he
was going to get for what piece

00:48:55.630 --> 00:49:00.200
and how well he was able to deliver
it on time and it was great music.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.610
So -- and other people -- I'm
sure you can think of others.

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.910
Has something changed?

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.830
And if so, why?

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:11.030
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, I
don't know that much about Bartok,

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.340
but some composers aren't --

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.640
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: Dvorak.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.940
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Dvorak.

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.310
Oh, Dvorak -- you were
talking -- not Bartok.

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:22.510
Oh, yeah. Well, I don't know
that much about him either.

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:27.040
[ Laughter ]

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.980
So, I don't know.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:32.550
But some composers
are good businessmen

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.540 position:56%
and there's nothing wrong with that.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:40.770
I mean, Philip Glass is both a
good composer, I think, you know --

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:44.990
although he's certainly not --
everything he wrote is that good,

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:50.090
but he has done some good stuff and
he's also a very good businessman.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.960 position:56%
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.890
In fact I once read an
interview with him --

00:49:55.890 --> 00:50:00.920
or I actually saw it on YouTube
or on the internet or something --

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.000
and somebody asked him something
about like, "Well, you know,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.350
a lot of your colleagues are
critical of you because you're

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:13.800
so successful commercially."

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:18.330
And he said, "Well, actually I
don't see anything wrong with it.

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:21.930
What's -- [laughs] I'm
not hurting anybody."

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.970
And he went on to explain.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:30.290
He said, "You know when I was 15 I
worked in my father's record store

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:35.860
and what I -- we sold
records to people --

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:40.970
people would come into the store
wanting music and gave us money

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.590
and I don't see anything
[laughs] wrong with it at all."

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:46.960
You know he just happened
to, you know,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.390
learned how to put the
two things together,

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:54.340
which of course most
composers don't know.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:59.210
And he does it well.

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:01.290
So, it's true.

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.420
I mean there's nothing
wrong with it.

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.360
In fact probably it
would be a good thing

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:11.330
if people learned how
to sell your music.

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:14.410
You know, something I've never
really learned, but there --

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.040
I guess you can't really teach it.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.740
It has to be learned by experience.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.600
I just know -- all I'm saying is

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.030
that I don't think that
should be the goal.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:30.730
I mean you -- it's good if somebody
pays you, of course it's good,

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:36.410
but if you're doing
something for that purpose --

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:42.570
[sighs] Well, it's
theoretically possible.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:47.350
I mean, Bach wrote his B Minor
Mass certainly for money.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:50.050
After all, he was Protestant.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:52.980
[laughter] But this was a
-- he wrote a Catholic mass.

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:58.380
Now the only explanation for that
is that somebody paid him very well

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.980
because he wouldn't normally
do that [laughs] would he?

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.090
[laughter] The fact was
that he was able to do it

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:08.230
and people were willing
to pay him for it.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.360
So, I don't know what
the details were,

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.170
but there's nothing wrong with it.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I mean I would
certainly agree that it's a bad idea

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.640
to go into music to make money.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.940
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Exactly.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.240
Precisely.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.910
&gt;&gt; Charlton Lee: I mean, if you
do wind up making money, great!

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:25.440
But if you go into
music for the purpose

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.800
of making money that's a dumb idea.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.170
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Yes, I think
that's all I was trying to say.

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:30.590
Yeah, exactly.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:34.250
He's got -- he hit
the nail on the head.

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:35.630
Does that answer the question?

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.330
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well,
let's take one more.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:40.970

Yeah, I think you had a --

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.700

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.860
&gt;&gt; There's a story about when
he was a taxi driver and --

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.950
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, I
happen to know something about that

00:52:54.950 --> 00:53:01.690
because I've known Philip since
the late 60s and he was working

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:05.960
as a plumber down in
SoHo a lot of --

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.370
He had a lot of artist friends
who were moving into SoHo

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:12.500
and he would come in
and put in the toilets.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.580
And then he was driving
taxis for a while.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:20.860
I was living up on Riverside Drive
at a hundred and fifty fifth street

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.510
and when he was in the
neighborhood he would come by

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.260
and we would have a drink together.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.680
So, I know that.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.140
I mean I've known him
for a long time.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.740
&gt;&gt; Well, the story I heard
was somebody was in his taxi

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:36.510 position:56%
and they said, "You know you have
the same name as a famous composer."

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:40.050
[ Laughter ]

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:42.060
But that's not my question.

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.820
My question is that you
have spoken at times

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:52.720
about a social consciousness or
philosophy that informs your music

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.450
and maybe the 32 variations

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:59.940
on "The People United Will Never
Be Defeated" is an example of that,

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.800
but I just wondered
where you're at with --

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.670
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Speaking
too close to the microphone.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.510
So, you're -- and you're not
speaking loud enough so --

[ Inaudible Answer ]

What? [inaudible answer]

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:22.120
&gt;&gt; My question was about having
a social message in your music.

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.600
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski:
What is the question?

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.900
[laughter]

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.180
&gt;&gt; Whether that's an
important thing to you now.

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:30.480
I mean I think that --

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.790
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: To
have a social message?

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:35.260
&gt;&gt; Frederic Rzewski: Well, if
you have one it's important

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:40.030
to speak it out, but you
don't have to have one.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:46.370
It's not necessary to make music
-- to have a social message.

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:51.740
You can write music about
love, death, a lot of things,

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:57.390
but if you have a social message
and you can use music as a way

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:03.760
of expressing it, it's -- well
it's like what Jesus Christ says,

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.060
you know; if you have the
light you should not hide it

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.530
under a bushel, whatever
a bushel is.

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:15.040
[laughter] It's the same
thing in art or music.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:21.410
I mean you -- Oscar Wilde
says, "Expression is all."

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:28.560
So, many people have -- and Pablo
Neruda in his autobiography talks

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.070
about how he meets a worker
who recognizes him and says

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:37.470
that he too would like to be a
poet and Neruda tells him, "Well,

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:42.250
you are a poet, everybody is a
poet because everybody dreams.

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:45.890
The only difference between
a poet and other people is

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:48.490 position:56%
that poets write their dreams down."

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.770
So, that's all it is really.

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:56.140
So, yeah if you have
something to say about society

00:55:56.140 --> 00:56:03.830
and you can use music to say
it, why this is a good thing,

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:09.810
but of course not everybody
does that

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:13.800
and there's no reason
why they should.

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.000
Some people do.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.670
Verdi wrote Nabucco, one of his
early operas and there's a chorus

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:26.570
in it of the Jews who are
lamenting, who are crying about how

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:31.780
on the shores of Babylon --
they're on the shores of Babylon

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.390
and so forth, and thinking
about their homeland

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:40.750
and that became the Risorgimento.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:44.710
It's -- began the Italian
Revolutionary Movement.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:50.590
And so you know it happens.

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:55.650
Pierre De Geyter was asked
by the International --

00:56:55.650 --> 00:57:00.290
Socialist International to write a
worker's hymn for the International

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:06.170
and he brought in a kind of folk
song like melody and they said,

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:09.340
[derisive noise] "This
is too low class.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:15.250
You should write something that's
similar to La Marseillaise."

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:17.200
[laughter] So, he went
back to the drawing board

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:25.820
and he wrote the International,
which had a notable career.

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:28.790
It's now sort of forgotten, but --

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:32.420
and he never received
a penny from it.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:38.110
A German businessman realized
that sometime in the 60s,

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:42.640
realized that this song had
never been copywrited [laughter]

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:48.330
and there was still a feel
years left in international law.

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:53.260
So, he went and copywrited it
and for the next few years he,

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.220
every time the song was played

00:57:55.220 --> 00:58:01.120
in a Romanian movie
theater, he got money.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.890
[laughter] Why not?

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:11.600
Well, look I mean Warner
Communications has just recently --

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.950
a federal judge just a
month ago or so decided

that Warner Communications had
no right to collect royalties
