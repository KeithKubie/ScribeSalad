00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.699
It was meant to be and I think is the symbolic center
of the university.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.020
we probably see more people passing through here

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.420
in the course of a year

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.139
than almost any other space that I can think of at Harvard

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:28.369
We're not just a museum to the war dead of WWI who
were brought through

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.769
but we're a large and lively

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.520
congregation and it's the natural place that people
turn to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.500
when there is trouble

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.000
or sorrow

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.220
or celebration

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.620
I think people are, especially

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.589
in large institutions like this

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.330
need a place of centering

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.920
they need a place where they can bring both their
sorrows and their joys

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.920
so this is one of those few places, I can't think 
of many people celebrate in the library

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.450
and you may not be particularly thoughtful 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.040
on soldiers field but

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.410
this church

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.990
with the emphasis upon

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.970
a commemoration of sacrifice, young lives

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.570
all sorts of promise. So this is a place where

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.460
freshmen are welcome, these are the steps on which 
commencement is held

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.210
there are very few buildings

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.010
and programs at Harvard that are hospitable in this way

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.670
and I think that's why people turn to us, 
they recognize

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.670
that they need it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.909
and we certainly encourage it, we want it to happen.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.990
The original connection was that the dead 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.820
should always be present among the living, that the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.119
two should be together

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.780
and that happens most perfectly at reunions

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.840
when at the center of every reunion is a memorial service

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.500
and then somebody said to me

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.819
it's really nice to know that when I'm dead, 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.640
somewhere somebody will call out my name, 
and this is that place.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.020
And I want it always to be the case here. And as Harvard becomes

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.430
ever more diverse and complex

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.500
I hope that this place will continue to be

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.189
the heart of its operations, and I believe it can be.
