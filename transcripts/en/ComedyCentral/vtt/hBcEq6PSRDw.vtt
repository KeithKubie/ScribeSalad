00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.202
We're in the midst
of a great upheaval.

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:04.604
Our culture is moving so fast

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.205
in such strange
and unexpected directions

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:07.640
that the world
of the near future

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.842
will be a mysterious place
beyond our comprehension.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:12.845
So remember where you were
when you first heard this,

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:16.049
my friends, for it is
the heralding of a new age.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.852
Psychologists are now saying
it's totally cool

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.989
to masturbate at work.
All right?

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.625
(cheers and applause)

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.227
According...

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.263
According to a new report,

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.198
the occasional work jerk

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.434
or breakroom bean poke

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.837
can lead to higher productivity,
decreased aggression,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.639
and if you don't
wash your hands,

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.873
there's no better power move

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:42.842
than a slightly sticky
handshake.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.378
(applause)

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.679
How about...

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.716
That's what that was.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.886
(gruff voice): "I've been doing
a little work in my cubicle."

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.154
But that's her voice.

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:56.689
(laughter)

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.292
So, comedians,
if this trend becomes a trend,

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.294
what's a professional way
to tell your boss

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.296
you're going
for some workday self-love?

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.964
-(bell dings)
-Al Madrigal.

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:08.935
I'm gonna take a long lunch
in the handicap stall.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.503
-All right.
-(laughter and applause)

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.872
All right. Points.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.273
Uh, Clark Duke.

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:17.243
Well, actually, as an actor,
you know, we already have a way

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.811
to tell our bosses
that we're doing that.

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:20.446
We just say,
"I'm going to my trailer."

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.215
-Yeah, okay. Points.
-(laughter and applause)

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.350
Points. Every time,
that's what that means.

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:25.618
Ari.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.653
Uh, on my break,
I'm gonna go out

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:31.090
and flick my coffee bean,
if anyone wants to come.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.793
-All right, points. Points.
-(cheers and applause)
