00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.690
A rooster...cat?
And Ronald orders a number three.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.730
It's episode 41 of IMG!

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.880
City life.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.160
Oh hi.
And here's a necktie that's formal

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.380
and manly, though, of course,
I prefer one piece

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.830
cat faces. Too much coverage?
Well, try on one of these

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.119
or just wear a slice of bread on your face. It's

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.410
almost as good as squishing it up against bars.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.789
Hayashi Natsumi takes photos of herself relaxing

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.780
mid-jump.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.380
Tug on a blowhole

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.180
with this whale tissue holder and the
movie poster for The Dark Knight Rises

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.420
contains an awesome

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.239
hidden bat shape,
but some people see a jumping unicorn.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.170
Here kid, have a sparkler.
I mean, say cheese.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.290
Doh. The baby's okay,
so take your dog for a walk

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.720
skate and then put a price sticker on Moby
Dick just right

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.950
and you get... 
Wow, okay, look, let's just get some knowledge.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.060
In Canada, postal codes are alphanumeric.
And in British Columbia

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.000
you can visit V4G1N4.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.330
Alright, let's be more mature.
Every year during the wet season, Lake Titicaca

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.660
overflows into lake PoopÃ³, which in
turn overflows into Salar de Uyuni,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.550
the world's largest salt bed.
It is so big

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.050
it contains 70 percent of our world's lithium reserves

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.270
and it's so flat that orbiting
satellites use it

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.940
to determine the steadiness of their altitudes.
When it rains,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.390
Salar de Uyuni becomes the world's
largest mirror.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.459
But if that's too much water for you,
you don't have to travel very far to get to

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.130
Antofagasta Region of the Atacama
Desert, the driest

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.110
place on Earth. On average,
the entire desert only receives one

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.220
millimeter of rain each year. And some
weather stations out there have yet

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.230
in human history to have recorded
rainfall. In fact, between 1570

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.900
and 1971 it is estimated that no significant water

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.270
fell there at all.
It's so near sterile

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.650
NASA uses the region to test Mars rovers
and in some areas of the desert

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.000
those rovers found not a single trace

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.370
of life.
On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.459
Panagiotis showed that with the right
clouds the Sun

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.849
could become a smiley face.
He also showed off an inquisitive

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.069
beard and Tim Ryan helped out.
Okay.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.569
I'll go left and then I'll go... wait.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.689
I'm just gonna lay around with some chicks.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.029
And as always,

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.549
thanks for watching.
