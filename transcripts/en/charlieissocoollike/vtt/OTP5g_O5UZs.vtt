00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.370
I consider myself to be a very rational
and scientifically-minded human being,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.570
and as a result, I find myself
believing in some scientific theories 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.000
that when I say them out loud
kind of make me sound like I'm insane. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.890
Oh this is gonna...
Alright, I'm going to try to convince you 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.270
that in our own universe,
there is a person identical to you

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.970
watching a YouTube video
identical to this one on a planet 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.330
and in a solar system that is exactly
the same as the one that we are in 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.870
and that there is not only one
of these carbon copies, 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.120
but there are an infinite number
of them throughout our universe. 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.340
Do I have your attention?

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.320
Okay, let's do this. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.230
Firstly, an example. 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.690
Imagine a man who has a hundred
different shirts, 250 different ties, 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.970
and just two pairs of trousers, 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.830
leaving him with a possible 50,000
different unique outfit combinations. 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.430
Most people don't have
that many clothes. 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.070
He is unique.
He's exceptional. 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.980
He is our example.
He's Example Man. 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.060
He wears all the clothes. 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.200
However, if we were to imagine
that Example Man were immortal 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.950
and that he never bought any other
clothes in his life, we can accept, I think, 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.350
that eventually he would have to start
repeating his outfit combinations. 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.880
Bearing that example in mind, here is where
things start to go completely bonkers.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.900
Me and you and everything in
our entire universe is made up 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.370
of a combination of different
types of particles,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.440
and the particular combinations of
all of these different particles 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.230
can make up anything from
the simplest hydrogen gases 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.590
floating around the universe to the incredibly
complicated neurological systems 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.360
that make up our brains and our memories
and, in turn, us as individuals. 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.520
That is what
science tells us. 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.730
The sheer number of possible combinations
that these particles can make 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.160
is so big that I am not going to bother
trying to figure out what that number is.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.650
However, because there are only a certain
number of different types of particles, 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.410
that means that the number
of different combinations 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.160
those particles can
make is finite, 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.470
meaning that, just
like Example Man, 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.090
if you give the universe enough space,
it will have to start repeating itself. 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.720
And it just so happens that the prevailing
scientific theory at the moment 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.850
is that the universe
is infinitely big. 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.480
So, if that's true, then that means that
the universe has to have repeated itself, 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.250
which means that there has to be an
infinite number of different copies

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.110
of me and of you and of our planets
scattered throughout the cosmos. 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.710
Please believe me when I say I know
how absurd this idea sounds,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.190
but I also know that it comes
from a place of observing

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.680
our universe and making a
logical conclusion about it. 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.430
It is not fanciful thinking.
It is rational thinking. 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.520
It just doesn't feel like
it should be true. 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.210
Now, obviously when
it come to science, 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.510
how we feel about an idea has absolutely
zero impact on how true it is or isn't, 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.640
but, for me personally, I kind of
like the idea of infinite Charlies, 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.730
and I will explain why. 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.110
What the theory dictates is that
not only are there an infinite number 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.610
of identical versions of us
scattered around the universe, 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.050
but also that there are an infinite number
of ever so slightly different versions 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.480
of us scattered
throughout the universe. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.420
And so, for me personally, when I'm
going about my day to day life 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.620
and I make a decision that I regret or
I find myself missing an opportunity, 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.250
I fail to tell a girl that I like
her or something,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.470
then what I like to think about is that
somewhere out there in the universe, 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.930
there is a Charlie who did tell
that girl that he liked her,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.740
and not only is there one of them
but there are an infinite number 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.840
of Charlies that made the decision
that I was hoping make 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.120
and, for some reason,
that just makes me feel better. 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.920
So, there you go.
That's how my brain works. 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.120
Hopefully, you found that as
interesting as I think it is 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.790
and that you don't
think I'm too crazy. 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.870
Quick update: my second
short film is now in the can, 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.990
and I'm hoping to have a version
of it or at least a scene of it 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.930
or something to show
at VidCon this year, 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.760
so if you're going to VidCon,
look out for that. 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.040
Annnnd yeah.
Goodbye. 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.430
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.447
which makes you, like, cool.
