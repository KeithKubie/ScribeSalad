Hey Rick, what's your answer?

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.600
&gt;&gt; So we can see pretty easily that
Y aligns with 1 E, in the horizontal

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.880
direction, and approximately 9
N in the vertical direction.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.680
So, it's 1 E and 9 N.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.210
&gt;&gt; Precisely.
