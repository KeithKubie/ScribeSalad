00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Hey, it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.440
When you think about gemstones, people typically have their favorites.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.900
I happen to think that opal is one of the most fascinating stones there is.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.700
Think about it. If you think about a diamond or a sapphire, or even a ruby,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.810
it's just a colored rock.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.320
Opals are different.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.320
Opals are created by specifically stacked hydrated silica spheres

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.100
that will diffract light as it enters the rock and it'll exit as blue green or even red.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.920
This is fascinating! In order to create something so specific

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.020
it requires a very precise geologic condition in order for that to form.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.740
So today on Smarter Every Day, the question is simple:

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
How do we find an opal, if it has to be created under very specific conditions?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.700
The answer, quite literally, is we're gonna have to travel to the other side of the world

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.340
to one of these specific places that opals are created,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.961
and find an opal prospecting expert.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.820
To find the guy, I flew to Coober Pedy, Australia

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.660
which is the opal capital of the world.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.340
It looks like Mars, like straight out of Mad Max.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.700
In fact, it's where they filmed Mad Max.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.560
It's such a harsh environment that people live underground,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.880
and this sounds like a joke,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.780
but you're not supposed to walk backwards at all in the town.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.920
Seriously, someone died by falling in a mineshaft the week before I got there.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.420
I had no plan when I arrived, so I walked straight into the visitor center,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.880
and asked for an opal mining expert.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.180
I am with George. George–
"Gardashi, Gardashi."

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.000
Gardashi?
"Gardashi, brother."

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.080
Gardashi, I'm sorry.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.800
So–so he came to Coober Pedy in 1969–

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.300
"Yes."

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.860
and he's been mining his entire life.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.840
So today, he has agreed to take us out. We're gonna go to a working mine?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.900
"Eh, we'll go to the–to a drill for opal. With a drill."

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.300
"A coal oil drill, the America drill."

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.640
Okay, we're gonna go use an American drill to drill a hole–

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.660
"That's a boy."

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.080
A shaft down into an opal mine.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.720
*George says something*

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.760
*laughing* Right.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.160
This should be awesome, let's go give it a shot.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.460
What does that sign say?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.780
Hold on–back up, let me look at that sign.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.100
"That sign says shaft, it's danger."

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.920
Danger...
"Don't walk backwards."

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.100
Don't walk backwards?

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.700
So everywhere there is a–

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.940
Everywhere there's a pile of dirt there's a shaft into the ground.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.780
How deep will the shaft be?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.760
"Uh. This–this area will be 20 meters".

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.700
So everywhere I see a pile of dirt, there's a 20 meter shaft?

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.400
"Yes, definitely."
Oh my goodness.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.920
But there's also horizontal shafts at the bottom of the vertical shafts, right?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.360
"Sorry?"
Aren't there also shafts that go side to side–

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.440
"No, that's tunnels, not shafts."

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.020
Ok. Tunnels?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.320
"Yes, of course."

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.560
"Where do you live? Alabama?"

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.260
Alabama.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.520
"Ah, that's why you don't know." *Destin laughs*

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.660
So, if somebody hears that you've struck opal, they will come at midnight and try to steal your opal.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.900
"No, no, no, no that's a another thing."

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.440
"But they try to peg the claim, see, the night time they–"

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.600
Wait, what's that word you're using? Peck?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.940
"To peg, to peg, to peg."

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.620
"To put the peg–put the pegs down."

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.440
*Destin realising* Peg.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.140
"Peg."

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.060
So they're pegging the claims.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.960
"I am from Greece, my accent's a bit funny".

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960
*Destin laughs*

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.920
I'm from Alabama, my accent's a bit funny too, I get it.
"Yeah that makes two of us."

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.360
*Excitedly* Yes. *Destin laughs*
"Tough guy."

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.540
Two tough guys in Coober Pedy.
"There's the drill."

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.880
"We're approaching the drill now".

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.220
Oh, this is the drill.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.240
"Uh-huh"

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.600
Oh wow.
"It's an old one, American."

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.860
"It's a bit old, but nice. Does the job".

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.600
Georgie is 77 years old and he's nimble as a cat.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.820
This is crazy.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.180
"Ok!"

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.640
"Good luck."
Good luck!

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.500
"Maybe you'll like it."

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.200
"Look."
Oh. Wow.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.260
I think I get it!

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.820
So, he only– The butterfly only moves down the length of one bucket every time?
"Yes."

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.760
Oh! It's hydraulically driven! I get it!

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.920
So, this wheel is called the what? This drive wheel.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.640
"This one is the ring gear."

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.560
So the ring gear drives the butterfly,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.360
and these pistons on the side support the weight of the butterfly

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.320
which holds the bucket.
"Yeah. And it goes lifts up the mound,"

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.760
"That gives you the length."

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.450
That's genius!

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.470
"American."

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.480
Americans came up with that? That's awesome!

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.280
*voice over* The neat thing about how this drill works is that it's very hands-on.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.720
As the bucket comes up to the top, George taught me how to connect one cable so a winch pull the shaft to the side,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.440
and a second rope so you can release a trip mechanism at the bottom of the bucket to dump the material out.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.180
You've gotta love people like George, he's mastered this art for himself and even though there's money in it,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.860
he still not stingy with the knowledge that he's gained.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.840
For example. In this field, he said that there's two known depths that contain opal

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.400
and the locals know exactly how far down it can be found.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.920
They remove the material one bucket at a time

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.920
and constantly measure the hole to see how far from the opal they are.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.540
Once the dirt pile changes from brown to white,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.800
the depth is confirmed and then they swarm the pile looking for evidence of opal.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.740
Then, you actually go down in the hole and you start looking for opal.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.820
That's the interesting part. Let's go do that.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.820
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.860
Must admit I'm a little bit scared that we'll fall in a hole.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.980
"Nah, nah, nah."

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.580
"If you talk too much, I'll get upset."

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.800
*Destin laughs* You'll get upset?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.500
*George laughs*

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.820
I don't believe that.
"Not you, my friend."

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.140
*Destin laughs again*

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.540
"I don't get upset with my friends."

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.020
No way.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.180
"Opa!" (Greek exclamation)

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.060
"Alright."

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.540
"That'll do. Alright!"

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.260
*Destin in the background* That good?
"Yeah, very good."

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.580
Okay, I understand the purpose of the safety rope.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.220
It's if your uh– if your winch doesn't work.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.140
"I'll grab it and then I'll come up."

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.860
Yeah, you climb up.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.080
Wow.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.960
Have you ever had to do that?

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.340
"Oh, many times man."

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.510
You can still do it?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.320
"Yeah. Why I put the rope for?"

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.880
*Destin laughs*

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.940
"You're joking."

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.680
*Destin laughs harder*

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.960
Oh man.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.280
"I mean, if you're not here I'll be by myself."

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.820
No, no, no! Let's go, let's go.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.740
"If I don't come up, that means I stay here all night!"

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.440
I get it buddy, let's roll.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.830
Let's roll man, I get this.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.600
"Pull it with you, please."

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.600
"That's a boy."

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.460
"Thank you."

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.520
"Fold your body."

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.520
"Control your body with your toes."

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.400
Okay. Got it.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200
*Destin giggles*

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.600
Wow.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.040
Holy cow.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.460
*voice over* Okay, to review. I met a guy yesterday, who took me to a secret hole in the middle of the desert

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.019
and now he's lowering me into it, on the premise of finding buried treasure.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.820
This was approximately the time I realized I should have told any one of these details to my wife.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.520
Holy cow, look at this.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.599
It's opening up.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.460
Oh my gosh.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.819
And of course, there's a beer bottle down here.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.840
Ok, so he said unhook this, and wave the light.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.740
That's what he said. So I'm gonna wave the light.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.660
"You out?"

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.580
I'm out!

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.620
"Ok, I go!"

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.040
Okay!

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.200
*voice over* Once George got to the bottom of the shaft with me,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.600
he explained that the drillers ream out the bottom to increase the surface area of the shaft.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.460
He then started to, legit, pick his way through material in different spots

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.340
based on the color of the dirt.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.100
After about 20 minutes of me being really eager to help but very confused, this happened:

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.220
Do you want me to uh– Do you want me to pick for awhile?

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.440
"Yes, you want to?'

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.600
I don't know what i'm doing, but–
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, HA, HA!"

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.320
"HA!"
What?

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.120
"HA!"

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.780
"Come have a look. If you see the color there."

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.580
Where?
"Tell me."

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.560
"If you see some color."

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.380
Right here?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.720
No, I don't see what you're talking about.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.920
"Ok. Alright."
Right here?

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.060
"Yes! Spot on!"

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.120
Are you serious?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.800
Right there?
"Yes."

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.110
So that's green?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.960
"Yes."

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.440
I–

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.660
I'm just gonna be straight up with you right now, this is pretty dang crazy.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.000
We are–

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.200
We are in the middle of Australia,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.640
How far underground are we?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.840
"Uh, not much."
50 feet underground?

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.110
"Yes."
We went down this hole,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.380
and we're excited about this little bitty trace in the ground.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.320
Man, people are weird! People are weird!

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.280
We do this, so that– I see green right there by the way.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.400
"Where?"
Right here.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.360
There's green right there. You see it?

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.980
"Yep!"

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.100
People are so weird!

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.500
We're doing this because women like pretty things on their ears.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.580
What do you think?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.880
"Yeah, they're pretty."

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.440
This–this doesn't make any sense at all.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.580
"Looks a bit of color there. Can you see color or not?"

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.660
Ohhh, my gosh!
"Yeah?"

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.720
I do see it!

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.140
"You know what I'm gonna do?"

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:30.900
What?

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.960
"I'm gonna get a jack pick. You busy?"

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.920
You're gonna go get a jack pick?
"Yeah."

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.040
Lets do it! Bring it!

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.380
Okay, don't leave me here! *Destin chuckles nervously*

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.700
"You're digging, you're digging."

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.340
I'm digging. Ok, I will dig.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.260
And...

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.000
Yeah...

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.720
There are moments in your life where you stop and think about

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.520
how you got to got to this point that you are, at that moment.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.880
This is one of those moments.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.700
There's 700 holes that I've passed on way in here.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.980
I'm in one of those.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.500
The only person that knows which hole I'm in is George,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.380
and he just went up that shaft, on a rope.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.540
This is not–

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.220
This is dumb! *Destin laughs*

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.800
There's a big one right here.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.900
"Mhm. Color."
Color.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.800
"Another one. Color."
Color.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.480
"The other one. Color."
Color.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.520
"You see the color there?"
Yeah.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.460
"There's that one."

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.000
Oh my goodness!

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.020
"And this one, look!"

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.400
"Look!"

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.760
Man...

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.960
Look at that!

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.960
It's an actual–

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.720
It's an opal. We found an opal.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.940
George, you're crazy man.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.940
There are some things in life you can only do if a master in the topic shows you how to do it.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.200
Finding a little bitty opal underground is one of those things.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.040
That leads us to this week's sponsor.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.340
You're smart. You know how advertisements work on the internet.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.940
Let me just give you the run down, and let's decide if this is something you want to do or not.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.000
This week's sponsor is The Great Courses Plus.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
On Smarter Every Day, I like to partner with sponsors long-term, and so I'm trying out this sponsor,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.400
and I would like your help to check them out.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.880
The Great Courses Plus lets you take complete courses on awesome topics.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.520
So before I show you more opal that George found,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.080
it be awesome if you'd do me a solid and check out the topics they have to offer.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.320
Many of my friends have recommended that I try it because they say its top notch.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.220
So I got them to agree to sponsor Smarter Every Day

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.940
based on how many people sign up for a one month free trial.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.280
It's pretty simple. The more people that try it with me, the more support Smarter Every Day gets.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.080
You can do as many courses as you want for free, for an entire month.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.060
The thing I'm really excited about is you can link it up to your Apple TV and watch it on the big screen.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.500
There's an app, and you can check out all these courses.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.600
You'll wanna learn about paleontology, you can do that.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.360
I'm excited about Greek and Roman technology.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.720
My wife saw this. Pediatric medicine.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.160
This is not like a surface-level youtube knowledge.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.400
These are in-depth courses, with each one of these lectures being taught by an expert in the field.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.200
Go to TheGreatCoursesPlus.com/Smarter if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.960
If not, no big deal. But I think this is going to be really cool and I'd appreciate you trying it.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.780
Give me some feedback.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.760
Let me know if you think this is a really good match for Smarter Every Day or not with a free trial.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.460
I'd appreciate that. Link below, thank you very much.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.220
Let's go get out of the hole and go say goodbye to Georgie.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.260
"Hold this rope here."

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.040
"Alright, don't worry. I'm here."

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.980
That was awesome!

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.060
Alright, so that is it today here on Smarter Every Day.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.780
That is how you go find opals in the middle of this.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.960
When you see a woman that has opal earrings, or an opal pendant, or anything,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.980
just think of Georgie. Right Georgie? 
"Thank you!"

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.420
"'Especially when the woman is good looking."

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.480
If it's a good looking woman, especially think of Georgie. *Destin laughs*

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.220
Okay, this is what raw opal looks like so,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.200
George has brought us here to Yanni, who is showing us this stuff.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.680
"A stone that was next to that, here, I cut it and this came out."

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.660
Wow.
"Expensive one, by the way."

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.700
This is very expensive?

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.360
"This is– What I can say, for example. Okay, correct me Yanni."

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.940
"For this one here maybe, $10,000?"

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.200
50 years, mining opal.
"40."

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.740
40 years?
"Uh, 60, uh 40..."

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.680
'Lotta years.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.100
Georgie!
"Yes?"

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.140
Thank you so much!

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.640
"Thank you my boy!"

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.440
I appreciate it, I feel like you're my friend now.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.740
"Yeah. I am your friend, man!"
Very good.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.300
"I am your friend!"
Very good.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.080
"I could be your grandpa, but doesn't matter. I'm your friend." *Destin laughs*

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.700
Anyway, I'm Destin. You're getting smarter everyday. Have a good one.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.640
Have you ever had your generator die when you're down there?

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.580
"Many times!"

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.860
You just climb up the rope?
