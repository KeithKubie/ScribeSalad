Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. That's what, that's what I'm saying, I have shit going on. I can't worry overtly all day long about like, is this meal going to, it's like, how am I going to get fucked that shit? But that's one of the things that people like about it. Like, okay, I'm on this diet now I've got to concentrate. Is it like meal prep? Really? Um, yeah. Or meal prepping and Sunday prepping all up. Where I look at my shows at [inaudible] prep, I am in control of my world asteroid hurdling towards us. Complete control of controlling rocket space. I have a finite lifespan. I have to constantly feet and shit. Everything's fine. Everything else is okay. Yeah, everything's fine. My buddy texted me today by the way, I want, he goes, uh, he had a concern I talked about on another podcast about how he couldn't, he didn't shit for like five days.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Oh. I have a buddy who went through that and he went to the doctor and he has this thing and he had to get help for it. He texted me, he goes, I just want to let you know I'm back from vacation. I feel really good. Also, I'm shitting like normal again. And I was like, I feel like a, like a really proud friend. Like he, he was really struggling. He was nervous about it. He was like, dude, I haven't shit in like four days. I was like four fucking days. Who was a guy that I worked with on fear factor. I don't want to shame him, so I won't say his name. He wants it out there. Great Guy. Um, he had a real problem, a real problem. It was packed in there for days and days. It wasn't coming out and he could feel it.

Speaker 1:          01:18          Like you could touch his butt hole and feel it inside. It was hard. Fuck as hard girls. Yeah. So fiber dog had to go to a doctor and they literally had to chip it out of his asshole. Shut the fuck up. Allocated impacted on his butt hole. They had to get in there and break it up and then they had to make him take this like really intense laxative. So he takes this really intense laxative, like, like weapons grade lacks and they're in, they're chipping away at the stone wall, which is essentially just like a dam to keep all this shit juice is piling up. Damn it. Because he's got the impacted dried out shit that should have been out of his body days ago. And then he's got the fresh shit on top of that. And on top of that he's got this chemical laxative that just selling off explosions inside of them.

Speaker 1:          02:09          And the doctor says it was a fucking hammer hammer and a screwdriver just whacking at the ship rock that's at the bottom of his ass hole and then it breaks loose and just explodes everywhere. Fuck. Like he gave birth to a dead seal, just blah flying out of the bag. All right, we got it. We got it. How much did you, how much weight you lose? I don't know. But he said it was awful. It was awful. Like they had a PR pry the shit out of his ass. I'm going to break it up. Those are the kinds of pains those downstairs today from you're not shitting. Yes, it's a, what's it called?

If you're, if you don't shit for a certain amount of time, you, you poison yourself. Hmm. Yeah. It starts to leak into your organs and should something, it's something absurdly just, there was a show a one of those like, um, oh, a 600 pound life or whatever those shows are, this woman wouldn't shit. And she, she, which she can polling in holding out and they're like, purpose. Yes. Why? Because she didn't want, she couldn't move to shit. She was so fucking big, she couldn't move to shit. So the ship packed up and sat around and they were like, you're gonna fucking die. It's gonna get in your bloods. It's going to get your, your other organs in your bloodstream and kill you. Isn't it? Like, doesn't that freak you out when you watch a show like that where someone's like, like uh, uh, what are those called?
