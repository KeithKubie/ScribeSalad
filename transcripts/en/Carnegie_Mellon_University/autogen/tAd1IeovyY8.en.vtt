00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.119
so the interesting thing is that the eye

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129
so the interesting thing is that the eye
 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.960
so the interesting thing is that the eye
bows are you know robots that allow you

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970
bows are you know robots that allow you
 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.350
bows are you know robots that allow you
to do perception cognition and action so

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360
to do perception cognition and action so
 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.390
to do perception cognition and action so
they can sense the world make decisions

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400
they can sense the world make decisions
 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.339
they can sense the world make decisions
and actually move in addition they can

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349
and actually move in addition they can
 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.380
and actually move in addition they can
talk with each other and therefore we

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390
talk with each other and therefore we
 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.839
talk with each other and therefore we
can create systems of multiple robots

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849
can create systems of multiple robots
 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.960
can create systems of multiple robots
that create teamwork in very complex

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970
that create teamwork in very complex
 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.580
that create teamwork in very complex
situations so if you look at this there

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590
situations so if you look at this there
 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.530
situations so if you look at this there
is one attacker that goes to the ball

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540
is one attacker that goes to the ball
 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.900
is one attacker that goes to the ball
and he's going to kick the ball towards

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910
and he's going to kick the ball towards
 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.240
and he's going to kick the ball towards
the goal down the field but the

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250
the goal down the field but the
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.760
the goal down the field but the
interesting robot to look at is its

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770
interesting robot to look at is its
 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.720
interesting robot to look at is its
teammate who is active as an offensive

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730
teammate who is active as an offensive
 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.780
teammate who is active as an offensive
supporter moves down the field always

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790
supporter moves down the field always
 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.450
supporter moves down the field always
seeing the ball but not going to the

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460
seeing the ball but not going to the
 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.910
seeing the ball but not going to the
ball because its role is just to support

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920
ball because its role is just to support
 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.150
ball because its role is just to support
the attack until the moment that after

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160
the attack until the moment that after
 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.009
the attack until the moment that after
the attacker kicks into the goal the

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019
the attacker kicks into the goal the
 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.990
the attacker kicks into the goal the
ball rolls into a position where it was

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000
ball rolls into a position where it was
 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.569
ball rolls into a position where it was
ready to receive it and scores as a

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579
ready to receive it and scores as a
 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.249
ready to receive it and scores as a
beautiful offensive supporter so this is

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259
beautiful offensive supporter so this is
 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.230
beautiful offensive supporter so this is
the model that we have been using more

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240
the model that we have been using more
 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.809
the model that we have been using more
recently but we have experienced all the

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819
recently but we have experienced all the
 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.090
recently but we have experienced all the
sequence of the models and making use of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100
sequence of the models and making use of
 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.069
sequence of the models and making use of
the villians features throughout the

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079
the villians features throughout the
 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.770
the villians features throughout the
years

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840
