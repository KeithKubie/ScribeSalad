00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:12.780
Over here in Blighty (the UK), Margaret Thatcher
is an incredibly polarizing figure in British

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.710
politics, which is why today instead of talking
about any of that, I’m going to tell you

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.960
about a somewhat lesser known facet of the
“Iron Lady”.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.269
As you may or may not know, the Prime Minister
of England resides at number 10 Downing Street

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.500
in Westminster.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.070
While the building isn’t as immediately
impressive as say, the White House, it’s

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.190
deceptively large boasting over 100 rooms
(leading to it being nicknamed “The Tardis”

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.770
by some officials), a museum’s worth of
art and state of the art security features

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.620
including a solid steel, blast-proof door
so heavy it takes 8 burly men to lift it.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.800
When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister
in 1979, one of the first things she did was

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.390
request a breakdown of the amount that was
to be spent getting her new official residence

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.750
cleaned up and ready for her to move in; and
she wasn’t happy with the answer she got

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.750
back.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.650
According to official sealed government documents
released in 2011, the Iron Lady was shocked

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.580
when she received a quote explaining that
the estimate came to £1,836 (about £9000

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.000
or around $14,000 today).

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.760
In particular, Thatcher couldn’t understand
why replacing all of the linen and bedding

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.970
in the residence was supposed to cost £464
(£2300 or about $3500), especially when she

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.500
already had “sufficient linen” and noting
that, “We use only one bedroom”.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.000
thatcherBut the Iron Lady didn’t let the
issue drop there because official documents

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.360
show that Thatcher not only queried these
costs personally, but demanded that the spending

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.220
on Number 10 be as “economical as possible”.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.970
It’s noted that Thatcher went as far as
buying her own ironing board when she saw

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.510
that the quote listed it as costing £19 (nearly
£100 or $150 today).

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.290
The important thing to keep in mind here is
that these expenses weren’t actually going

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.150
to personally cost Thatcher anything, since
one of the perks of being leader of an entire

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.920
country is that the tax payer in many countries
foots the bill of maintaining your state home;

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.360
she just really didn’t like the idea of
taxpayer money being unnecessarily wasted.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.230
During her time as Prime Minister, Thatcher
also refused to draw her full salary and was

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.090
known for recommending that other ministers
do the same.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.080
Thatcher’s extreme, rather endearing frugality
is regarded as being a holdover from her childhood

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.560
which one biographer described as modest and
somewhat “grim” due to her father’s

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.110
miserly personality.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.560
Despite being a successful grocer who owned
two separate stores, Thatcher’s father was

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.170
frugal to the extreme in his spending, choosing
to live with his family above the larger of

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.060
his two stores in a flat without an indoor
toilet or hot water.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.280
(Something Thatcher has in common with Arnold
Schwarzenegger.)

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.860
Her father’s mentality of “never wasting
a minute” (a favourite saying of his) and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.490
not spending money unnecessarily, evidently
stuck with Thatcher throughout her adult life,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.050
which led to her clashing with her more affluent
peers in politics on a number of occasions.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.590
For example, Thatcher did most of her work
in a single chair in her office; over the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.130
years, her heels wore noticeable holes in
the carpet, which she refused to have replaced.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.900
It was only after her peers implored her to
consider how bad the leader of the UK having

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.989
such a shabby carpet may have looked to other
heads of state and officials that she relented

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.090
and patched the hole with another piece of
carpet.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.010
An another occasion, the Secretary of State
for Wales wrote to Thatcher requesting funds

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.590
to make a number of “small improvements”
to his office that he’d had estimated at

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.590
costing £26,000.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.459
Thatcher sent a back the terse reply, “Get
some other estimates.”

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.060
Thatcher then requested a breakdown of how
exactly they arrived at this figure and for

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.410
some reason, the estimate suddenly went down
to £11,000.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.239
Perhaps the ultimate example of Thatcher’s
frugality came after she stopped being Prime

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.160
Minister and became worried about what her
husband was going to eat when she was away

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.709
on her many speaking engagements.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.660
According to the book, Not for Turning: The
Life of Margaret Thatcher, rather than hiring

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.500
a cook, which she would have been well able
to afford, Thatcher genuinely inquired about

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.769
Meals on Wheels, an organization that offers
meal delivery to those who are unable to purchase

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.200
or make their own meals.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.620
She ultimately abandoned the idea when a colleague
pointed out that it probably wasn’t appropriate.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.900
When she was at home, Thatcher reportedly
mostly subsisted on a diet of pre-made frozen

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.900
food.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.459
As Prime Minister, her diet was better, but
still remarkably spartan and simple for a

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.159
head of state, mostly limited to tinned food
or re-heated frozen meals made by her cook.

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.180
Interestingly, one of the few times Thatcher
was known to have dropped the cast-iron façade

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.620
for which she would become synonymous was
when a political opponent accused her of being

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.099
a “food hoarder” (an insult dating back
to the time of rationing) when she was just

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.099
an MP.

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.110
An angry Thatcher hit back and invited journalists
to see her larder for themselves, before releasing

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.900
a statement listing its contents as well as
the savings she’d made buying certain items

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.900
in bulk.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.130
Thatcher was even frugal in death and when
she passed away in 2013 she left explicit

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.669
instructions in her will to forgo some of
the usual traditions for the passing of a

00:04:50.669 --> 00:06:08.360
former Prime Minister such as a military flyover,
saving the country an estimated £800,000.
