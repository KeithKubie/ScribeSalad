parameters for example you can create an
 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.300
parameters for example you can create an
invisible marker which you can later

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
invisible marker which you can later
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280

markers however since there are a number

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
markers however since there are a number
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770
markers however since there are a number
of ways that you can change markers

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
of ways that you can change markers
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.850
of ways that you can change markers
appearance after a marker has been

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
appearance after a marker has been
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.710
appearance after a marker has been
created most of its properties like its

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
created most of its properties like its
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.780
created most of its properties like its
position visibility and icon can be

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
position visibility and icon can be
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.550
position visibility and icon can be
changed by calling corresponding mutator

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
changed by calling corresponding mutator
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.249
changed by calling corresponding mutator
methods on the marker class for example

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
methods on the marker class for example
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.929
methods on the marker class for example
if you want to toggle the visibility of

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
if you want to toggle the visibility of
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670
if you want to toggle the visibility of
a marker you can call a set visible

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
a marker you can call a set visible
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.840
a marker you can call a set visible
method of a marker instance toggling

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
method of a marker instance toggling
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.310
method of a marker instance toggling
marker visibility is a great way to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
marker visibility is a great way to
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770
marker visibility is a great way to
implement place filtering since making

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
implement place filtering since making
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.319
implement place filtering since making
an initially invisible marker visible is

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
an initially invisible marker visible is
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.789
an initially invisible marker visible is
faster than creating a new marker

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
faster than creating a new marker
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.990
faster than creating a new marker
altogether for example if you want to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
altogether for example if you want to
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.059
altogether for example if you want to
allow the user to hide or show hotels

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
allow the user to hide or show hotels
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.179
allow the user to hide or show hotels
with specific price or cost levels

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.189
with specific price or cost levels
 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.440
with specific price or cost levels
you'll likely want to use marker

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
you'll likely want to use marker
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970
you'll likely want to use marker
visibility instead of creating new

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
visibility instead of creating new
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.409
visibility instead of creating new
markers altogether to get the best

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:18.419
markers altogether to get the best
 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.630
