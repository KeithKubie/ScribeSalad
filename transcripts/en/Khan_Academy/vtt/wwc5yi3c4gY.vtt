00:00:00.383 --> 00:00:03.146
- [Voiceover] Let K equal six,
so that F of X is equal to

00:00:03.146 --> 00:00:05.165
one over X-squared minus six X.

00:00:05.165 --> 00:00:09.321
Find the partial fraction
decomposition for the function F.

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:12.503
Find the integral of F of X D-X.

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:14.222
And so let's first thinl about

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.983
the partial fraction
decomposition for the function F.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:21.883
So, F of X, I could rewrite it

00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:23.997
where I factor the denominator.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:27.503
If I factor out an X, I
get X times X minus six.

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:29.837
So, I can rewrite this as...

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:31.462
And this is where I'm going

00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:33.099
to decompose it into partial fractions.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:36.153
A over X plus B over X minus six.

00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:46.136
If I actually had to add these two,

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:48.110
I would try to find a common denominator.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.910
The best common denominator is

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.488
just to take the product
of these two expressions.

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:53.554
So I could multiply the
numerator and denomenator

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.607
of this first time by X minus six.

00:00:56.607 --> 00:00:58.327
X minus six.

00:00:58.327 --> 00:01:00.416
And the numerator and
denominator of the second term,

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:03.172
I can multiply it by the
denominator of the other one.

00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:07.166
So times X and times X.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.187
So that would give us,

00:01:09.187 --> 00:01:10.777
let's see if I distribute the A,

00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:14.266
it would give us A X minus six A plus B X

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:23.845
over X times X minus six.

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:28.375
If this looks completely foreign to you,

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:30.697
I encourage you to watch
the videos on Kahn Academy

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:34.855
on partial fraction decomposition.

00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:36.492
So let's see if we can,

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:40.149
so what we wanna do is solve
for the A's and the B's.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.508
And so let's see,

00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:48.966
if we see that these have to add up to

00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:52.477
one over X times X minus six.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.161
So these have to add up.

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:55.381
I'm just going back to
this, these have to add up.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.797
The numerator.

00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:58.143
So it has to add up to

00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:01.221
one over X times X minus six.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.181
So this numerator has to add up to one.

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:05.842
So what we can see is

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:07.978
is that the X terms right over here

00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:11.146
must cancel out since
we have no X terms here.

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:16.146
We have A X plus B X
must be equal to zero.

00:02:16.244 --> 00:02:17.939
Or you could say,

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.479
well that means A plus B is equal to zero.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.278
So we took care of that
term and that term.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.338
And then we know, that this
must be the constant term

00:02:27.338 --> 00:02:28.817
that adds up to one or
that is equal to one.

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:30.617
And so we also know that
negative six A is equal to one.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:34.745
Or A is equal to, divide
both sides by negative six,

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.508
negative one sixth.

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:42.667
And if A is negative one sixth,

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:45.012
well B is going to be
the negative of that.

00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:47.815
And negative one sixth plus B.

00:02:47.815 --> 00:02:51.101
I'm just substituting A
back into that equation.

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:54.043
Need to be equal to zero.

00:02:54.043 --> 00:02:55.872
And so add one sixth to both sides,

00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:58.397
you get B is equal to one sixth.

00:02:58.397 --> 00:03:00.307
So I can decompose F of X.

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:04.546
I can decompose F of X as
being equal to A over X

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:10.982
So that's negative one sixth over X.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.231
I just write it that way.

00:03:12.231 --> 00:03:14.332
I could write it as
negative one over six X

00:03:14.332 --> 00:03:15.598
or something like that.

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:17.165
But I'll just write it
like this, just be clear

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:18.709
that this was our A.

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.493
Plus B, which is one
sixth over X minus six.

00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:28.996
So that right over there,

00:03:28.996 --> 00:03:31.182
that's the partial fraction decomposition

00:03:31.182 --> 00:03:33.334
for our function F.

00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:35.401
And if I want to evaluate the integral.

00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:38.438
So the integral of F of X,
the indefinite integral.

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:41.636
Well, that's where this
partial fractions decomposition

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:43.046
is going to be valuable.

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.719
That's going to be the indefinite integral

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.086
of negative one sixth over
X plus positive one sixth

00:03:50.473 --> 00:03:54.246
over X minus six, and then we have D X.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.658
Well what's the anti-derivative
of this right over here?

00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:01.557
Well the anti-derivative of one over X

00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:03.954
is the natural log of
the absolute value of X.

00:04:03.954 --> 00:04:05.837
And so we can just this is going to be

00:04:05.837 --> 00:04:09.412
negative one sixth times
the natural log of the

00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:10.757
absolute value of X.

00:04:10.757 --> 00:04:12.860
Anti-derivative of this part.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.931
Then plus one sixth.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.543
You could do u-substitution
but you could just say

00:04:18.543 --> 00:04:21.050
"Hey, look the derivative of
this bottom part, X minus six."

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.643
That's just one.

00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:25.169
So you could say that I have
that derivative laying around.

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.185
So I can just take the
anti-derivative with respect to that.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.123
So that's going to be one
sixth times the natural log

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:35.261
of the absolute value of X minus six,

00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:37.972
and then I have plus C.

00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:42.192
Don't forget this is an
indefinite integral over here.

00:04:42.192 --> 00:04:43.852
And then you're done.

00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:46.203
And you see that partial
fraction decomposition

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.690
was actually quite useful.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.820
So they were helping us

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.528
how to figure out this.

00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:52.362
You didn't just have to have that insight

00:04:52.362 --> 00:04:54.928
that, okay how do I evaluate
this anti-derivative.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:57.204
Well, the they're telling us to use

00:04:57.204 --> 00:04:59.277
partial fraction decomposition.
