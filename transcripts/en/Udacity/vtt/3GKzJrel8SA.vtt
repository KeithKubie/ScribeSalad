00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.260
The answer is this first expression
here, unless ui is positive, we can make

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.740
gamma as big as we want without
running into the constraint here.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.890
And of these constraints, we hit the one
where this ratio is lowest first.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.700
Setting gamma to this value makes
one of these constraints tight and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.060
sends the corresponding
entry of xB to zero.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.540
Remember that this equation came from
the constraint that xB be non-negative.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.400
We can then bring dq into our basis, and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.570
kick out the column corresponding to
the constraint that became tight.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.950
We then want to repeat this process
over and over, getting better and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.490
better basic feasible solutions.
