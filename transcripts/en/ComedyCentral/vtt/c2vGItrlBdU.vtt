00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:24.791
HE KILLED HIMSELF, SO--

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.894
- HONEY!
- UM...

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.996
[clattering]
I THINK YOUR FENCE IS BROKEN.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.931
- YEAH, IT'S NOT.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.633
OR IT WASN'T.
BE CAREFUL.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.401
I REALLY--
I DON'T WANT A LAWSUIT.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.336
HONEY! UM, THAT'S--

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.437
- ALL RIGHT, KIDS!
ALL RIGHT, KIDS!

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.673
[children scream]
- [laughs wildly]

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.409
NOT WE'RE HAVING FUN ALREADY.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.311
SO IT'S BELLA'S BIRTHDAY,
SO SHE'S RUNNING THE SHOW.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.915
IT'S ME...
AND THEN IT'S BELLA.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.717
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
THE MOST EXCITING PART. KIDS!

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:51.985
LOOK AT THIS.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.453
- ALL RIGHT!
- COME TO LIFE.

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:55.122
YOU LOOK AT THIS HOUSE
GET FILLED WITH AIR

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:59.092
JUST LIKE I WATCHED THE AIR
LEAVE MY BROTHER'S BODY

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.761
WHEN HE KILLED HIMSELF
IN FRONT OF ME.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.930
- YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?
- WHAT'S THAT, MOM?

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:05.899
- WE'RE GONNA MAYBE
NOT VISIT THAT TOPIC ANYMORE.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.869
- WHAT'S THE SNACK SITUATION?

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.605
- MAKING REAL HEAVY
EYE CONTACT THERE, MAN.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:12.973
- OH, YEAH.
- ARE YOU GAY?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.341
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? NO.
- IS THIS A--

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.543
- I'M NOT A--
NO, NO.

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:18.946
TRUST ME, I HAD PLENTY
OF OPPORTUNITIES IN PRISON

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.214
TO DO THAT,
BUT I DIDN'T.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.748
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:22.916
HEY, BELLA!

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.651
GIVE UNCLE JEFF
A PUSH IN THE TUSH.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.186
IT'S UNCLE JEFF.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.189
YOU GUYS ARE SITTING ON
WHERE MY BROTHER PASSED.

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:30.290
THIS IS A VIDEO.

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:32.726
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST--
KIDS LOVED HIM.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.528
THEY WOULD JUST SWARM HIM.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:38.131
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE THAT,
UH, RELATIONSHIP WITH KIDS,

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:39.700
BUT YOU GUYS SEEM COOL.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.401
WE SHOULD
LOCK DOWN PLANS.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.703
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.505
- OH, JUST HANGING OUT
WITH THE KIDS.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.473
TELLING THEM STORIES.
- OKAY.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:47.774
KIDS, YOU WANNA, UM--

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:49.676
WHO HAS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM?
- I DO.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.112
- EVERYBODY, COME ON.
HERE COMES THE CAKE.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.915
IT'S BELLA'S BIRTHDAY.
LET'S MAKE A WISH.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.117
- WISH MY BROTHER
HADN'T KILLED HIMSELF.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.619
- HUH?
- BUT, UH...

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.387
YOU KNOW, WHAT I ALSO
WISH FOR IS A NEW FAMILY.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.822
AND I FEEL LIKE I--
[clears throat]

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.056
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE THAT
WITH YOU GUYS.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:07.294
SO LET'S WISH FOR THAT.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:08.862
- [under breath]
OH, MY GOD.
