00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.560
I've got a tattoo on my left leg; It means
left leg in Chinese.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.049
Yes, I did it on purpose.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.500
I don't have to worry about it interfering
with an Apple Watch, but it might screw up

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.420
an MRI.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.270
Sup people, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.560
Thanks for coming by.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.650
News broke recently that just like your grandmother,
the Apple Watch has a problem with your tattoos.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.250
Apple fessed up and admitted tattoos can interfere
with the measurements of their newest device;

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.239
they believe the infrared lights in its pulse
monitor are bumfuzzled by differing light

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.699
absorption rates for skin and tattoo ink.

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.190
After all, pulse oximetry, or the measuring
of blood flow using light, has only been around

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.370
since the 70s.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.489
If anything, this "problem" will make medical
and consumer tech even better in the long

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.489
run!

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.940
But the trend of body modification is a growing
challenge in the medical field mainly because

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.819
ink manufacture is largely unregulated.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.719
Different artists will use different inks,
some make their own, using either inorganic

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.229
or synthetic compounds; but there's no standard
practice.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.269
According to the Food and Drug Administration's
own files, "Color additives must be approved

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.100
by FDA for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics,
[but] no color additives have been listed

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.730
for injected use."

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.380
This is government-speak for no one checks
to see what's in that ink the tattoo artists

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.640
inject into your dermis, and that HAS caused
issues.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.150
Magnetic Resonance Imaging uses giant magnets
and radio waves to image human tissues without

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.110
the use of radiating x-rays.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.549
Before MRI scans patients have to remove any
metal, and cannot be scanned if they have

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.570
pins or plates in their body.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.979
Without tattoo ink regulation, however, some
have unknowingly scanned themselves into a

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.520
world of pain.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.909
Some black, red and blue tattoo ink contains
iron as part of the inorganic ingredients;

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.549
and though you're probably imagining a tugging
pain, it's more physics-y than that…

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.729
A 2009 study in the International Journal
of Environmental Research and Public Health

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.399
found when you run a strong magnetic field
back and forth across an iron loop (like a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.299
tattoo) it agitates the iron elements sort
of like a rudimentary generator; but since

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.730
it's not able to spin and produce electricity,
the iron in the ink heats up to dissipate

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.800
the energy.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.110
It's possible that it gets so hot it causes
swelling, pain and even blistering second-degree

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.110
burns!

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.550
On top of that, the MRI scan is distorted,
so the whole point is lost.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.060
Of course, this was just one paper, and it's
pretty rare, but it can happen.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.480
CT scans or CAT scans are simply x-ray scans
which compile a 3-D image.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.780
Tattoos haven't been known to interrupt X-Rays,
but piercings can!

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.250
CAT scans require removal of piercings in
the region being scanned, nose, lip, ear and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.950
tongue piercings all need to be taken out
to scan the head, for example.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.210
When x-rays hit metal piercings, the beam
reflects off the thick metal ruining the image

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.400
and throwing dangerous x-rays around at random,
like water splashes.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.900
But aside from messing up CAT scans, the Journal
of Periodontology found fifty percent of people

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.320
with barbell-style tongue piercings had chipped
their teeth on the jewelry, and the longer

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.450
they wore it correlated with receding gumlines.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.450
Yikes.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.360
Researchers in these studies recommend avoiding
tattoos just in case you ever need an MRI,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.090
and talking to your dentist before getting
an oral piercing, but honestly, you do you.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.090
You're going to anyway, right?

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.870
But if doctors don't assuage you, what about
how you're viewed?

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:42.440
Anthony dug deep into how tattoos affect the
opinions of those who carry them…

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.150
I'm looking to get a new tattoo, and don't
know what to get make some suggestions in

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.150
the comments!!!

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.010
OR or show me yours, i'm on instagram @trace501!

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.430
Thanks for watching DNews everyone!
