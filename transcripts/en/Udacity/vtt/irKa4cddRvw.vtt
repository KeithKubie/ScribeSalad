00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:06.585
The LCD is 2 times u minus 3 times u plus 3. Fantastic work if you figured that

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:10.760
one out. Again, I don't expect you to get that right on your first try, or even

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.571
maybe at all. Let's see how we do it. We know u squared minus 9 is a difference

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:20.534
of two perfect squares. So we can factor this as u plus 3 times u minus 3. So we

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:25.270
can rewrite this first fraction like this. For the second denominator we have a

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.278
common factor of 2. So we can factor that out. Now that we have factored

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:33.214
denominators, we can use our factor tree method. These two denominators share a

00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:37.876
common factor of u minus 3, and the other factor for this one is u plus 3, while

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:42.686
the other factor for this one is positive 2. And there it is. We multiply all

00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:47.803
these together to get 2 times u plus 3 times u minus 3, our LCD.
