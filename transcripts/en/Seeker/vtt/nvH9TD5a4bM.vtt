00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.320
We have a pretty good idea of how climate
change will affect the world, but what about

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.440
the people in it?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.480
How will it affect us?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.580
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we’ve
been talking a lot lately about climate change,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.760
and how it’ll affect the world around us.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.390
Like everything, though, there are unexpected
consequences - and according to a new study,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.410
one of the consequences of climate change,
is fewer males being born.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.430
It sounds crazy, but this has actually been
happening over in Japan.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.470
Researchers from the M&amp;K Health Institute
have been examining how extreme weather events

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.430
have affected sex ratios of infants in Japan.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.840
Specifically, they looked at temperature fluctuations
brought on by global warming, and compared

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.579
them to national data on births and fetal
deaths between 1968 and 2012.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.289
Fetal deaths being any miscarriage that occurs
after 12 weeks of gestation.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.059
And what they found, is that male fetuses
are considerably more vulnerable to extreme

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.899
weather, which has led to a decrease in the
amount of male births.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.450
In 2010, Japan experienced their hottest summer
since 1898, when records began.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.930
During that summer, researchers noted an increase
in the number of miscarriages, and nine months

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.310
later, they noticed a decrease in the ratio
of male to female babies born in the country.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.770
Meaning the majority of those miscarriages
were male.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.130
But it’s not just the heat that causes this.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.189
The following year, in 2011, Japan also experienced
a particularly brutal winter.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.869
And sure enough, that winter saw an increase
in miscarriages, and a subsequent decrease

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.539
in male births, 9 months later.

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.829
Researchers say this doesn’t necessarily
mean that climate change is completely to

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.939
blame - but it does highlight the fact that
male fetuses in particular, are extremely

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.290
sensitive to external stress factors.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.319
Earthquakes, pollution, and even famine - have
all been linked to increased miscarriages,

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.429
and a decline in the number of male births.

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.139
What’s especially damning about this study,
though, is the exact timing of events.

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:01.270
It pretty clearly indicates that temperature
is at least partially responsible - and unfortunately,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.810
no one’s been able to explain why this is
such a male-specific problem.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.709
What do you guys think?

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.739
Any plausible theories you wanna throw out
there?

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.000
If so, just leave em in the comments below
- otherwise, thank you guys for watching!
