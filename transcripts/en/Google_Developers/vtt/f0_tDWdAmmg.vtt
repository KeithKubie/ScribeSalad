00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.704
MALE SPEAKER: Be even
better if it moved.

00:00:01.704 --> 00:00:03.000
MALE SPEAKER: It would be.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.432
MALE SPEAKER: You ready?

00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:06.170
THIJS DAMSMA: OK, I'm
ready, I guess.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.823
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:07.823 --> 00:00:09.630
Take it away.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.040
THIJS DAMSMA: OK.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.710
Hi, everyone.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350
Thanks for tuning in.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.370
This is my presentation
about visualization of

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.490
coastal data with KML.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.590
My name is Thijs Damsa, and
I've done this work for

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.010
EcoShape last summer.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.580
And all the work I've done is
available on openearth.eu.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.340
First little bit, this is going
to be about data from

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.610
the Netherlands.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.870
That's where I'm from.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.440
Netherlands is a low-lying
country.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.310
And we basically owe our
existence to coastal zone

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.950
management.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.685
If we wouldn't manage our
coastal zone, the sea would

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:43.960
have taken out at least
half of the country.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.950
So that's why in the Netherlands
coastal protection

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.550
is very important.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.090
Now, within the Netherlands we
have this new thing, EcoShape,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.380
Building with Nature, that's a
collaborative research program

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.020
for integrated coastal
zone management.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.040
So just a bunch of companies
and institutes who work

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.955
together, put up some money, and
basically do more research

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:04.360
about the coast.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.900
And of course, Building with
Nature indicates that it's all

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.460
sustainable nowadays, just like
everything has to be.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.100
Now, within EcoShape we have a
thing called OpenEarth Tools.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
And that's the geeky part of
it, the technicalities to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.880
facilitate the research.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.300
When many people do a lot of
research, you need some

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.330
technical infrastructure
to help you out.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.680
So OpenEarth Tools is all
about managing data.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.910
Because basically research, or
the research we do, is mostly

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.770
about managing data.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.430
So it's collecting data, getting
it from whatever

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.845
institute owns it.

00:01:37.845 --> 00:01:39.620
Then we collect it.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.440
We store the data.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.410
We put it in manageable
format.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.860
We put everything in that CDF.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.030
Process the data, so do whatever
you want with it, and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.440
then present the data to
whoever's your audience.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.440
So that's the research cycle.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.320
And one of the basic things we
want to do, we want to collect

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.410
all the data available.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.860
Because nowadays in research
it's usually you spend a lot

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.685
of time collecting your data,
finding out who owns it, where

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:10.009
is it, how is it stored, which
format is it in, and how do I

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.280
get that into whatever computer
program you use to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.530
process it.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.720
Also another thing we do next to
collecting and storing data

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.230
is sharing tools.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.690
So we don't want to reinvent
the wheel every time, so

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.080
everybody is encouraged to
share as much of their

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.930
programming with other people as
possible, so everybody can

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.580
use and work on each
other's tools.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.550
We have a subversion repository
with scripts.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.900
A lot of it is in Matlab,
because that's where a lot of

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.220
coastal researchers are familiar
with, but also

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.615
Python, Fortran, whatever
you can put in there.

00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:46.370
And the participation is,
of course, important.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.590
More is better.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.070
So you have to have an
attractive thing that

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.210
everybody feels encouraged to
sign up on and to work with.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.770
Now that's where it gets
a bit complicated.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.110
Because not everyone
is a programmer.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.800
And if you explain these kind
of sheets with how we manage

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.780
data, how we process it, how we
have different servers to

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.030
do everything, for a lot of
people, especially the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.170
non-technical, the
non-programmers, it's just

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.980
basically a bunch of [INAUDIBLE]
mumbo jumbo.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.600
And they don't really know what
you're talking about or

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.640
what the advantages are of
joining your program.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.970
So the important thing
is a visualization.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.700
And this is a scan of
a book which is--

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.740
every year they bring out the
new book which shows some

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.820
coastal data from
the Netherlands.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.650
They have a map.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.810
You have some green bars, which
are good, and you have

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.220
red bars, which are bad.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.090
But it's a book, so you have to
print a new one every year.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.860
And it's not interactive.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.170
So it's a really kind
of static thing.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.030
And this is how it's
done nowadays.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.240
And of course we want
more things.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.420
So another way to present your
data is, of course, in

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.280
computer programs.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.180
But you usually get plots
like this or like

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.980
this, or like this.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.600
And usually you kind of
miss the context of

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.560
what the data means.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.320
And it's not always that
appealing, so I'd say it's

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.720
kind of ugly.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.500
And it's good for some purposes,
but as an attractive

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.005
way of presenting your
results, it's

00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:10.980
maybe not that good.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.250
Because it's all very static.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.340
And still you don't get
user interaction.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.940
Or if you do want it, you have
to develop a user interface.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.550
And those are expensive
to develop.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.770
And it's difficult to do that
in a proper and nice way.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.610
So we have another thing, and
that's called Google Earth.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.850
We use Google Earth to present
our data and as sort of a

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.860
visual front-end for the
databases we've created.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.190
We're experiencing now how we
can use Google Earth to its

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.870
maximum to interact with the
data and to present it.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.410
So this is--

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.715
I want to give you a live
demonstration of the Google

00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:45.635
Earth stuff I've done.

00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:48.850
So switch to Google Earth.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.530
And I'll just pull up a chair.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.530
OK, so first let's go
to the Netherlands.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.780
So fly here.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.160
Netherlands, it's a country
right down here.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.820
Amsterdam, the capital.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.890
First I'll show you a data
set which we only

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.070
recently got hold of.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.800
It's a Dutch heights, so it's
like a datum of the country.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.730
And this is a tiled image I've
generated using the tools we

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.770
have, which show the height
of the country.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.580
Now here's the coloring, which
more or less indicates the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.770
natural beach color.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.390
So blue is underwater,
submerged, and green is above.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.850
And sandy is sort
of beach level.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.620
So if I just switch it off,
you'll see that a lot of the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.390
country is actually colored
blue, which indicates that

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.040
it's pretty much below
sea level.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.680
And you'd reduce the size of
the country by about 50% if

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.610
there were no sea protections.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.710
So just to give you a bit of an
idea why we think coastal

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.320
protection so important
in the Netherlands.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.980
The good thing is you can use
Google Earth to present data

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.800
which you would otherwise
also present.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.170
But if you look at the
resolution of this map, it's

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.640
actually pretty high.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.840
And if you print this out,
you'll have a huge map.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.264
And if you're only interested
in a little bit, well, then

00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:09.630
you need a lot of small maps.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.280
But that's really
inconvenient.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.540
So this is a big advantage of
Google Earth, just being able

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.320
to zoom interactively.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.280
It dynamically loads data
when it needs to.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.410
So quickly you can get a good
overview of your data.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.700
There's much more
possibilities.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.215
And I'll show you a little thing
we've made of Katrina

00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:31.370
the hurricane.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.930
This is a little animation
of the hurricane.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.430
The water levels are indicated
by the coloring.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.480
So the Gulf of Mexico and the
arrows indicate the wind.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.310
So I'll just play this.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.770
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.200
THIJS DAMSMA: Needs to load
a little bit more.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.550
So it's needs a bit time to load
the background images.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.020
But as I scroll through,
get a bit smoother.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.680
And you see here all the arrows
indicating how the

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.240
hurricane has developed and how
the wind pushed the water.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.195
And here you can really see
clearly how the wind pushed

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:09.510
the water all through
New Orleans.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.580
So you can understand why New
Orleans was so badly hit.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.200
Because just before the
hurricane reached the shore,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.355
the water levels said
it wasn't that bad.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:22.500
And really, as it progressed
closely to the shore--

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.820
here you see it--

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.510
it really pushed the water
all the way up to

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.820
the back of the city.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.420
And that's why we got so
much damage there.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:37.670
So you can use Google Earth to
make simple animations and

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.110
just look through
them as you go.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.250
And if you have a map any other
way, of course it's

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.282
really hard to get this level of
user interaction where you

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:50.350
can just scroll through your
data just like that.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.180
So this is one of the things
I'd like to show you.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.705
In the Netherlands we
have an estuary.

00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:57.730
It's called the Westerschelde.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.990
It's down here in the bottom.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.910
And this is a harbor
of Antwerp.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.110
So there's a lot of shipping
from down this corner all up

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.800
to the sea.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.460
But as it's an estuary you
need to do a lot of

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.070
maintenance to make sure
it's deep enough.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.240
So there's a lot
of maps of it.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.380
So first I'll show a

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.575
bathymetric map of this estuary.

00:08:15.575 --> 00:08:18.230
I'll just change the angle.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.920
And a good thing of Google Earth
is that you can easily

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.410
compare different data sets
if you at least treat

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.250
them in the same way.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.400
So the one I'll first show you,
the height data set of

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.815
the Netherlands, this is
a different source.

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:35.280
And you see immediately if I
just pop it on and off that in

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.179
the estuary you get basically
the same data, but it's

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.450
slightly different.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.230
So if you're really interested
in it, you could check it out,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.630
why is the data different.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.540
But at least visually you can
get a quick impression that

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.420
there's different data,
different sources, that

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.160
they're not always identical,
of course.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.580
Now, you can use traditional
quiver plots to plot the flow.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.190
Because a simulation was done
here, so using advanced

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.680
modeling, a simulation was done
of the tidal flows and

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.220
the speeds of the water
which you get.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.900
So at a certain time, these
arrows represent the flow you

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.620
have in your estuary.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.180
And of course, static arrows,
that's something

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:17.880
maybe of the past.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.060
So you want to have the flow,
and have the flow dynamically.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.860
So let me just load that.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.416
It takes a sec.

00:09:28.416 --> 00:09:32.640
And now if I look through it,
you get a much better

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.460
indication of where
you have the flow.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.500
And you see at the deep parts
you have redder, bigger arrows

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.440
moving faster, so that indicates
a strong flow.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.860
And with a downgoing tide,
all the water flows back.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.580
And you can see it really
follows the gullies and gives

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.560
you a good indication of where
the flow is and what the

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.160
important areas are, and gives
you a nice way to disseminate

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.730
the results of a computational
model within the public in a

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.100
way that they can actually
play with it.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.720
Because I just press the play
button here, but of course you

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.760
can also drag different time
steps or maybe if you enhance

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.080
the slide, you can get
more of a history--

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.060
let's say a particle
tracking way of how

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.030
the flow has developed.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.120
Now, all these computations
were done on a certain

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.760
computational grid.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.920
It's also a good thing to note
that in Google Earth, you see

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.190
here all the black indicates
the grid, and all the--

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.030
these are all grid cells.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.070
So it also gives you a good
indication of which resolution

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.110
you can achieve and how this
lines up with, for instance, a

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.820
satellite image.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.775
So lines up pretty good,
but not perfectly.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.720
So this is the computational
grid which we have used.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.020
It gives you an idea of the
scale and the size of what you

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.400
could achieve.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.260
Now, another way of presenting
the depth would be using a

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.730
contour plot.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.450
So I'll also use
contours here.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.460
But as Google Earth 3D,
why not make the

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.610
contour plot in 3D?

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.260
So this is what I've done.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.870
Gives you nice 3D
contour plot.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.480
But unfortunately, the digital
terrain model's not user

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.880
adjustable, which means that I
have to plot something which

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.490
is underwater.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.040
I have to lift it up above the
ground and then exaggerate the

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.480
height of it to get an
indication of how deep the

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:25.840
gullies are.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.910
So you can really see the
really steep edges here.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.850
Let's go down here.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.370
Now I could add some
labels here.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.320
A good thing about Google Earth
is I don't have to worry

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.030
about all my labels
clogging up.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.370
Because as I zoom out, it
will draw less labels.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.810
Always make each individual
label visual.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.070
Now also, I could combine
this with the grid

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:51.760
I just showed you.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.540
And then you really get a nice
indication of the 3D grid,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.840
which is created to do
these model runs.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.050
So this is basically a powerful
visualization which

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.940
you could never achieve
in any other way.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.390
The other data set which I've
put in here is called the

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.830
Dutch Beach Lines.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.620
Gives an indication of dune foot
and shoreline positions

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.180
throughout the years.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.650
And I'll just zoom in to one
of these islands here.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.940
And the data goes back--
this is 1842.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.230
And as soon as these lines pop
up, that's where I have

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.210
measurement data available.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.290
So the blue line indicates
the shoreline,

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.530
the edge of the beach.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.940
And the green line, the dune
foots are where the beach goes

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.890
over in the dunes.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.010
As I scroll through that, you
really get an indication of

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.100
how this island has changed
throughout the years, where it

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.270
grows, where it erodes.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.870
And this can help the general
public understand what's

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:56.260
natural variations or what are
artificial ones, and where you

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.640
should be worried about
or what not.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.590
It just really gives a quick
view of what you can expect.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.420
And also, if you make it broader
this side where you

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.730
get an idea of the variation.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.420
So it's normal that you
have a few meters of

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.350
variations at points.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.470
And if you want to measure, you
can just use a ruler tool

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.450
here and see how many meters or
feet of variations you have

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.450
throughout a certain
time span.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.110
So this is really something
which can help out a lot.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.160
And I've also plotted out the
grid over which these lines

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.470
are measured, just to
give an indication.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.400
Now, other data sets have
also been created.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.860
This is called a [INAUDIBLE]
data set.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.650
It's only available from
1960 something.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.990
Here it is.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.070
And these are coastal profile
measurements of the dunes.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.470
Now, normally these are
profiles-- you would

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.640
draw them in a plot.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.210
But here I thought, why not plot
them in 3D just over the

00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:00.270
map, which, over the satellite
picture, gives you a good idea

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:06.610
of these different data sets,
what context they are made in.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.430
Now, a powerful interpretation
of this is all these lines

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.140
which you see here,
they all seem to

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.850
represent dune profile.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.000
You can't see by a line that
actually this line is nonsense

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.900
and that line is nonsense
and that one is good.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.430
But you can see from the context
that you see on this

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.610
satellite picture.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.380
Let me just illustrate
this to you.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.060
So here you see dune profiles
from year to year.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.680
See also how the profiles
influence where the beaches

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.150
and where not.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.340
I see the blue and green lines
moving back and forth.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.420
But also you see the lines here
on the right side jagging

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.680
very much from year to year.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.070
And I'll just expand the time
span which I'm viewing.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.110
And you see here that there are
really big variations of

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.150
the dune profile in here
also from year to year.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.350
And if you just look at the
satellite picture, you

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.890
immediately understand
why-- because this

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.470
is not a dune profile.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.780
This is actually a coal stack
of some kind of big

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.380
factory over here.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.920
But they are included
in the data.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.880
And if you don't have the
context, there's no way to

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.260
know, except if you very closely
study the data, you

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:14.960
ask some questions.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.310
But here you can just easily
have a glance at your data,

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.160
just fly over it.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.610
And those things, they become
clear pretty quickly

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.860
what's going on.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.910
So the next data set, the last
one I want to show you, is

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.650
called [INAUDIBLE],
a Dutch word.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.450
But it means basically height
maps which are measured from

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.080
year to year at different
locations.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.080
They're all stored in
different charts.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:49.060
And if I go to this location,
I've taken some metadata from

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.720
the database, which
is behind this.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.500
And it just gives a really--

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.550
it's a quick way to look at
metadata, even though I didn't

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.980
put very much in here.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.560
But you can see the
coordinates of the

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.680
measurements and whatever
information you

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.470
want to show here.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.520
You can see the years on
which it's measured.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.350
And on a few years I've
pre-rendered some charts.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.830
And I'd like to show you one.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.370
You could click on the links,
but I've already

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.450
loaded them in here.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:22.830
So this is a 3D map of,
actually, what's the data.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.390
This is from 2005.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.020
So I also used KMLs.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.180
I directly plot a
three-dimensional image of the

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.270
measurement.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.870
I colored it and triangulated
it.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.970
So this gives an idea of the
area which is measured.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.310
And of course, you could
load data from

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.890
several different points.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.350
Just click on it, and then
you can really make your

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.840
own map as you go.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.780
Another one which is important,
I've created this

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.640
time animation.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.270
So all the different
data which is

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.480
stored at this point--

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.460
let me just load everything.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.540
Might take a sec.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.880
OK, there, it's coming.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.240
And now you see how the profiles
have changed in time.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.030
They seem getting nothing much
changed, because it hasn't

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.410
been measured that frequently.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.500
In the later years you can see
how the coast has changed.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.380
So I'll just do it myself.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.490
You get a good idea
of how the coastal

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.050
evolution is of this area.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:26.210
Also, you notice in the
back in, say, 1980,

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.329
there's hardly any bumps.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:32.650
It's a very smooth
bathymetric map.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.510
But in later years there's
a lot more detail.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.090
Of course, the topography
probably hasn't changed.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.590
But it's more that the
measurements have changed.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.300
So it's probably multi-beam
EcoSound instead of

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.270
single-beam, which gives
you more detail.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.560
But you can quickly compare
all these maps, and really

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.370
easily you get an idea
of the changes which

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.620
have occurred in time.

00:17:55.702 --> 00:17:56.952
So small wrap-up--

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.780
if you use Google Earth
as a visual

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.390
front-end for your database--

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.290
oh, I see I'm out
of the screen.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.000
MALE SPEAKER: Just
stay seated.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.460
THIJS DAMSMA: So if you use
Google Earth as a visual

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:16.500
front-end of a database, first
thing is it looks good and

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.320
everyone can use it.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.440
I just showed you in a live
demonstration, which went

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.910
almost flawless-- no but--

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.610
everyone can use it.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.070
Google Earth is a user-friendly
program.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.970
I think Google put a lot of
effort in making it easy for

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.840
everyone to use, no complicated
menus and no

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.750
complicated installation
procedures, and-- good thing--

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.200
no license fees.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.350
It works on a lot of
operating systems.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.880
You have lots of
possibilities.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.030
You can make it interactive.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.120
You can use four dimensions,
three dimensional plus time.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.140
This is a huge advantage over
most other data viewers.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.910
So to wrap it up, Google Earth
can be used as a visual

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.230
front-end for the data in
OpenEarth and, I think, for

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.260
many other data sets.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:03.070
One big wish I have for KML is
that I could use an adjustable

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:07.370
DTM so that I could adjust the
terrain model without having

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.580
to make complicated 3D overlays
and be able to dig a

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.230
hole in the earth to show my own
data instead of have the

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.920
data as it is now, that
I have to raise

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.220
everything up from the earth.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.840
Now, OpenEarth tools, everything
I've shown here is

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.460
created with Matlab.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.060
Its source code, the
documentation, and tutorials

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.280
to use this is freely
available.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.800
So you just go to openearth.eu
and you'll

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.780
find everything there.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.340
So thank you for
your attention.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:41.214
