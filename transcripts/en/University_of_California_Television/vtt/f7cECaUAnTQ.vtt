00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:36.560
- Daniel Kahneman is an
internationally-renowned

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.316
psychologist whose work
spans cognitive psychology,

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:42.540
behavioral economics, and
the science of well-being.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.280
In recognition of his groundbreaking work

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.060
on human judgment and decision-making,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.860
Kahneman received the 2002
Nobel Prize in economics.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.840
And as many of you know,
economics is a field

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.417
that increasingly bases economic models

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:59.890
on psychological models
of information processing.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.092
With his longtime
collaborator Amos Tversky,

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:06.060
Kahneman laid the foundations

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.180
for the new field of behavioral economics.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.137
And I wanna note that, incredibly
poignantly and graciously,

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:15.713
in accepting the Nobel,
Kahneman acknowledged

00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:17.900
that this award really should have been

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.130
for both himself and Tversky,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.817
but as you know, the Nobel
is not awarded posthumously,

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.441
and it saddens me and
many others here today

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.760
that Tversky can't be here to join

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.630
in hearing Kahneman's talk.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.360
Kahneman received his BA in '54

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.402
from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem,

00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:39.310
majoring in psychology
and minoring in math.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.180
He earned his PhD in psychology

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.470
from the University of
California, Berkeley in 1961,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.732
just missing the opening of Tolman Hall,

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:50.500
which opened the next year.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.170
So he spent his graduate career

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.040
in the old life sciences building.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.194
He returned to Hebrew
University as a professor.

00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:00.240
He has also been a professor

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.607
at the University of British Columbia,

00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:06.607
back here in our own psychology
department from '86 to '94,

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:11.770
and since '93, he has been
at Princeton where he is

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.715
currently the Eugene Higgins
professor of psychology.

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:17.838
Also professor of psychology
and public affairs

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:19.620
at the Woodrow Wilson School

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.540
of Public and International Affairs.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.630
Kahneman has received many awards,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.630
you can read about them on
the first page on the program.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.618
He's a member of the
National Academy of Sciences,

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.001
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:40.001
the Econometric Society, many
other elective societies.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.900
He has received

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.930
the Distinguished Scientific
Contribution Award

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.240
from the American
Psychological Association,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.528
with Amos Tversky back in 1982,

00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:50.583
the Warren Medal of the Society

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:53.497
of Experimental Psychologists,
also with Tversky,

00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:55.660
the Hilgard Award for Lifetime

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.839
Contributions to General Psychology,

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.980
and many others, too
numerous to mention here.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.526
He holds honorary degrees
from many universities,

00:03:04.526 --> 00:03:06.790
including Harvard, the
University of Pennsylvania,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.710
and the Sorbonne.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.040
All of us in the psychology department

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.660
are pleased today to share
Professor Kahneman with you

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.160
as our former colleague

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.327
and brought forth by our nomination of him

00:03:20.327 --> 00:03:22.840
and this selection by
the Hitchcock Committee

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.620
so he could present to
us and visit with us

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.330
and hold office hours on
campus for the last few days.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.821
The title of today's talk was

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:34.660
Happiness: Living and Thinking About It,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.900
has been changed recently to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.741
Well-Being: Living and Thinking About It.

00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.360
I don't think is a bait and switch.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.750
We'll take well-being
as well as happiness.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.630
And now I'd like you to please welcome

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.320
our honored guest,
Professor Daniel Kahneman.

00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:58.320
- Thank you.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.610
Well, well-being and happiness

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.610
have both become rather
hot topics recently.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.140
New books are coming out all the time.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.740
Positive psychology is
very much in the news,

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.560
and the term has come into the language.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.630
And the interest is not only
limited to psychologists,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.400
but is clearly interdisciplinary,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.217
and in particular, of particular
interest to me actually,

00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:29.479
is the fact that economists
have become interested,

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.940
and some significant figures in economics

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.610
have made significant
career bets on the topic.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.326
And I'll be describing the work,

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:42.130
a collaboration with one of
these figures, Alan Krueger.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.385
Now, the interest in economics

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:49.123
may be a reflection of
questions that have been raised

00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:53.872
in behavioral economics about
the assumption of rationality.

00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:58.872
Because, once that assumption was made,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.977
that agents are rational,

00:05:00.977 --> 00:05:05.977
with that assumption, and not
only through that assumption,

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:09.870
economics generally showed
very little interest

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.170
until recent years in anything

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.100
that had to do with subjective
measures of anything,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.550
and in particular with
measures of well-being,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.780
and they had, I think,
two reasons for that.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.399
One is that, if people are rational,

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:23.791
then measuring their happiness

00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:27.280
or their enjoyment of
consequences is superfluous,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.562
because you know that,
if they're rational,

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:30.768
they're choosing what's best for them,

00:05:30.768 --> 00:05:32.916
and if they're choosing
what's best for them

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:37.280
there is very little point
in measuring anything else.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.620
That is, you can go, as is
the tradition in economics,

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.540
by measuring what people want

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.280
and assume that what they want

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.770
is what they are most likely to enjoy.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.013
The second objection of economics,

00:05:50.013 --> 00:05:54.146
and that one was formulated,
I think, about 100 years ago,

00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:58.450
is that measuring subjective
well-being is impossible,

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.250
well, because it's subjective.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.580
And the only things that are
supposed to be measurable

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.300
are behaviors, things that
anyone can observe objectively.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.211
I think both of these objections

00:06:12.211 --> 00:06:14.150
to the measurement of well-being

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.780
are ill-placed and have been
questioned by psychologists.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.290
I mean, it's pretty clear
that there is a point

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.940
in measuring and in distinguishing

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.990
what people want from
what they experience,

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.830
because, in fact, what people want

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.410
is not always what they will enjoy.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.261
And it is also not the case,

00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:35.540
or it is also the case,
that we in fact can do

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.430
a pretty good job of
measuring subjective states.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.060
And in recent years, I think,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.909
those methodological strictures

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.550
on the conduct of research
have been dropped very largely.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.653
Now, what I'd like to do first

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:52.776
is show you some of the major puzzles

00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:56.851
in the study of well-being.

00:06:56.851 --> 00:07:01.851
Okay, this is called
the Easterlin Paradox,

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:06.998
and what it shows is income

00:07:06.998 --> 00:07:09.262
and happiness in the United States.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.640
This is the percentage of Americans

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.547
who describe themselves as very happy,

00:07:13.547 --> 00:07:18.109
as a function of time between
the years 1946 and 1996,

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:20.380
and you see two curves there,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.070
one curve that seems to be rising

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.200
that simply is GDP per head,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.259
and the other curve is
the percentage of people,

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:29.139
the curve that isn't going
anywhere in particular,

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:31.401
is the percentage of people

00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:34.150
who describe themselves as very happy.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.670
Now this is really a problem, I think,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.570
because people do want to get rich.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.310
I mean, there is no question about it.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.270
They want to get richer,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.240
they want their standard
of living to increase.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.073
And yet, when everybody's
standard of living is increasing,

00:07:48.073 --> 00:07:49.780
as we see in this graph,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.707
quite steadily over the last 60 years,

00:07:51.707 --> 00:07:56.280
little if anything happens to well-being.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.520
And that is a deep puzzle, I think.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.844
And economists in general simply

00:08:00.844 --> 00:08:02.910
were paying no attention to this.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.650
In recent years, this has been
recognized as a difficulty,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.940
as something that needs
to be grappled with.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.570
Now, here is the emblematic
puzzle of well-being.

00:08:17.902 --> 00:08:19.792
This result describes,

00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:23.240
it's from the German socioeconomic panel,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.202
people are interviewed every year,

00:08:25.202 --> 00:08:27.090
one of the questions that they are asked

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.416
is how satisfied they are with their life,

00:08:29.416 --> 00:08:31.990
and this is the percentage of people,

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.014
I think, who describe
themselves as satisfied.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.394
No, that can't be it.

00:08:36.394 --> 00:08:39.460
But it's some score of life satisfaction,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.720
I don't remember the details now.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.950
And it's as a function of years

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.230
before and after marriage.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.440
And, you know, I think this
sort of speaks for itself.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.570
You can get very similar
curves with different things.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.450
You know, widowhood actually behaves

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.760
as pretty much the mirror image of that.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.820
Although recovery is a bit slower

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.220
than recovery from the
happiness of marriage is.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.800
Especially for men.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.800
But you get similar results
on many other changes of life.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.409
You get an anticipation,
a change in anticipation,

00:09:18.409 --> 00:09:22.880
and then what looks like
fairly rapid adaptation,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.850
in many cases pretty close to
baseline, although not always.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.590
Okay, we need to understand that.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.200
What is actually happening here?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.350
And I think there is another puzzle

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.970
that we want to add to this.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.452
And this is that if the curve
for marriage is like this,

00:09:43.452 --> 00:09:47.272
that is, you know, if we see
for most big changes in life

00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:49.610
that there is a transient change

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.799
and then something that
looks like adaptation,

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:55.060
why do we find this result surprising?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.290
Because the fact is, we
do find it surprising.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.120
And it is certainly the case that people,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.109
on the day of their, on their wedding day,

00:10:02.109 --> 00:10:04.210
are not anticipating this curve.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.856
There is, so here is something that is

00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:10.271
absolutely routine in our life

00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:13.278
and which is deeply counterintuitive.

00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:15.344
And why it is counterintuitive

00:10:15.344 --> 00:10:18.910
is, I think, by itself an important puzzle

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.000
in the study of well-being.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.924
We need to understand
why a basic fact of life

00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:27.110
seems surprising to us
and stays surprising.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.620
This just shows how
surprising it is, actually.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.790
This is a study that an
undergraduate student

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.321
did with me at Princeton some time ago.

00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:40.840
Survey participants who were asked

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.477
to estimate the percentage of time

00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:45.160
that various classes of persons spend

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.260
in good, neutral, or bad mood,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.420
so paraplegics, lottery winners,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.530
one month or one year after the event,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.370
and many other classes of people.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.820
And respondents were also asked

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.750
if they knew a case personally.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.140
And what I'm going to
show you as the measure

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.990
is percentage of good mood

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.900
minus percentage of time in bad mood.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.180
So people assign percentages to these,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.480
we look at the difference.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.820
And so, if you know a paraplegic,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.580
and these people, so some of them

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.086
knew a paraplegic personally
and others didn't,

00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:22.999
then they knew that one
month after the event,

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:25.506
the situation is much worse

00:11:25.506 --> 00:11:27.610
than one year after the event.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.404
People who reported not
knowing a paraplegic

00:11:31.404 --> 00:11:35.305
seemed to be unaware or at
least completely insensitive

00:11:35.305 --> 00:11:38.498
to the difference between one month

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:41.320
and one year after the event.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.180
Now this is really pretty dramatic,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.930
because, if you stop to think about it,

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.738
it out to be salient that the response,

00:11:48.738 --> 00:11:50.979
you know, the emotional response

00:11:50.979 --> 00:11:54.450
to such an event cannot
last all that long,

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.710
but people spontaneously don't do this.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.439
And I can tell you what I
believe is happening here.

00:12:01.439 --> 00:12:03.530
What is happening is that

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.500
when people are asked the question

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.500
how happy or miserable somebody is,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.510
lottery winner or a paraplegic,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.070
after x time after the event,

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.975
what they do, instead
of thinking about this,

00:12:15.975 --> 00:12:19.520
they answer a much easier question.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.820
And the question is

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.920
how miserable is a person
when they become a paraplegic

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.430
or how happy is a person
when they win the lottery.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.360
This is something that we can imagine.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.040
We probably imagine it fairly
well, fairly accurately.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.289
And if we substitute this judgment

00:12:38.289 --> 00:12:40.590
for the judgment that is required,

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.380
how happy will that
person be after a year,

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.870
you get results like this.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.194
Very similar results for lottery winners.

00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:48.870
People who know a lottery winner

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.860
know that there is a, you know,
euphoria at the beginning,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.450
one year later very little
is left of the euphoria.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.350
This is actually below average

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.953
of people, there's 25 percent.

00:12:57.953 --> 00:13:01.077
And people who don't know a paraplegic

00:13:01.077 --> 00:13:05.570
don't seem to anticipate the leveling off

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.590
or the change that will
occur after a year.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.491
So something deeply
counterintuitive is happening.

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.383
We now have other results using,

00:13:13.383 --> 00:13:16.297
I'm just going to go
over this very quickly

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:18.558
without going into the numbers.

00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:21.480
We ask about groups,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.270
for example, people whose
household income is above 100,000

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.270
and people whose household
income is below 20,000.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.360
And we know the results, because we have

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.237
samples of people who
belong to these categories.

00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:35.010
The difference in mood,

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.050
the actual difference in mood is small.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.850
It's about 12 percent in these units.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.480
The predicted difference is 32 percent.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.188
People greatly exaggerate
the weight of this event.

00:13:49.188 --> 00:13:50.929
One of my favorites is

00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:53.611
what do people believe
about what it's like

00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:56.360
to be a woman over 40 years of age?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.060
Now, you know, you would think that

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.995
most of the people who answer
this question have mothers.

00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:03.410
And, you know, they would know that it's

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.659
not all that bad to be over 40.

00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:11.119
And there is no difference, actually,

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:13.660
in terms of reported mood,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.490
between women over 40 and below 40.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.260
But people do predict
quite a large difference.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.603
And by the way, young males in particular

00:14:21.603 --> 00:14:24.784
seem to think that being a woman over 40,

00:14:24.784 --> 00:14:28.400
you know, you might as well be dead.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.144
So, now, close supervision at work

00:14:32.144 --> 00:14:36.289
has a substantial effect
on mood at work in fact,

00:14:36.289 --> 00:14:38.983
but the effect is greatly overestimated

00:14:38.983 --> 00:14:41.280
when you try to do this.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.882
The effect of fringe benefits
is almost negligible,

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:47.560
but substantially overestimated.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.230
So there is a phenomenon,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.940
and it's a phenomenon that
we'll want to explain,

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.925
of why do we have the wrong intuitions

00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:56.398
about what will make us

00:14:56.398 --> 00:14:59.950
and makes other people happy or miserable?

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.090
Now, so that's the second
puzzle of well-being.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.260
And the third puzzle of well-being

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.760
is the enormous
differences among countries

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.820
that have been reported.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.298
So this has been, there have
been hundreds of studies

00:15:14.298 --> 00:15:18.400
using similar questions across the globe,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.990
and this result is really
a fairly typical result.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.180
And you know, you can replicate
it survey after survey.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.680
There's a group of,
you have GDP per capita

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.350
on the x axis and you have, in this case,

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.980
the mean of the percentage of people

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.970
report themselves very satisfied

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.790
and very happy with their lives.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.460
Historically Protestant societies

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.760
are up there on the right.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.050
The former communist societies
are down there on the left.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.160
And this has not changed
for the last 10 or 15 years,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.320
it is really a very stable
result, enormous differences.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.050
And you know, that, we
need to understand that.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.421
What on earth is happening here?

00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:04.850
It distinguishes the Danes,

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.990
who are the world champions in happiness.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.980
Why are they so much happier than people,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.660
you know, in Lithuania or Latvia?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.700
So those are some of the puzzles.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.340
And I will try to deal with those puzzles

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.960
in the remainder of this talk.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.360
Now, my own interest in well-being

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.450
arose during my years in Berkeley.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.546
Actually, when I came to Berkeley,

00:16:34.546 --> 00:16:37.250
I was running an experiment on whether

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.680
people can predict their future tastes.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.680
And we, just to describe the
nature of that experiment,

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.500
which actually was quite popular
among students at the time,

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.130
it was an experiment about
the consumption of ice cream,

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.710
and we advertised it as such

00:16:54.608 --> 00:16:57.080
and we paid people to
come to the laboratory

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.657
for, I think, eight
consecutive working days

00:17:00.657 --> 00:17:05.190
to have an experience, which
was always the same experience.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.070
They had a helping of
their favorite ice cream

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.680
and they listened to a piece of Canadian

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.440
rock music that I had selected.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.920
They rated their experience
after the first day,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.938
and they then predicted
what was going to happen

00:17:22.938 --> 00:17:25.200
eight days later, how they would rate

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.320
the same experience eight days later.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.500
And there was a lot of
variation that we observed.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.610
That is, some people get sort
of addicted to the ice cream.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.810
You know, they had to come
on the same hour of the day

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.130
to the same place to get that experience,

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.990
and so they would get, you know,

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.320
eager towards the appointed hour.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.170
Other people got sort of
sick of the whole thing.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.213
But the interesting thing is

00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:50.210
that people did not predict

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.140
what was going to happen to them.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.920
That is, there was
essentially no correlation

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.967
between people's individual predictions

00:17:56.967 --> 00:17:58.990
and their individual outcomes.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.000
People were not better at predicting

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.050
what would happen to them than they were

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.480
at predicting what would
happen to a stranger.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.550
And that was sort of surprising,

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.950
because if people cannot really predict

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.860
their tastes in such a very, you know,

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.720
mundane kind of experience,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.410
how their tastes will
evolve with repetition,

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.698
how can we make rational decisions

00:18:20.698 --> 00:18:24.560
about outcomes that are far in the future?

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.450
If we cannot predict our tastes,

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.670
rationality is indeed very
difficult to conceive of.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.770
Subsequent to those studies of prediction,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.320
we got into another question

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.252
that at first seemed,
you know, a bit extreme.

00:18:38.252 --> 00:18:43.000
How good are people at
remembering past experiences?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.404
So people have an experience and then,

00:18:45.404 --> 00:18:48.360
that's the living, in my title,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.160
and then they remember that experience,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.590
they store that experience.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.412
They have a memory,
they store that memory.

00:18:55.412 --> 00:18:59.673
How good or how accurate, if you will,

00:18:59.673 --> 00:19:03.690
are memories of, I'll call
them hedonic experiences,

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.290
experiences of pleasure or pain.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.830
Well it turns out, not
particularly good at all.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:14.673
So here is, in this case, well,

00:19:14.673 --> 00:19:19.030
that's a study of patients
undergoing a colonoscopy.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.080
A colonoscopy, I won't go into detail,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.640
but it's a procedure that
involved a tube up the gut.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.350
It now is commonly run
under general anesthesia,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.578
but at the time this study was run,

00:19:30.578 --> 00:19:34.440
most people had it without
any anesthesia at all.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.170
And it could get quite painful.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.239
Now that procedure is highly
variable in terms of duration.

00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:43.129
In the original sample of patients

00:19:43.129 --> 00:19:45.470
on which the study was conducted,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.490
I think the shortest
was about five minutes

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.090
and the longest was about an hour.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.840
So there is a lot of variability
in how long it lasts.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.810
And what we did was very simple.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.247
We asked people every 60 seconds

00:19:57.247 --> 00:20:01.740
to tell us how much pain they
were experiencing right then.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.725
So there was somebody and they would ask.

00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:06.690
And now I'm going to
show you two patients.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.495
So this is Patient A
and this is Patient B.

00:20:09.495 --> 00:20:14.495
You can see here the profile
of the pain that they reported.

00:20:15.033 --> 00:20:17.123
And the question that I want to ask

00:20:17.123 --> 00:20:20.501
is how much did these patients suffer?

00:20:20.501 --> 00:20:23.868
Now I want you to notice that this is,

00:20:23.868 --> 00:20:26.090
as it were, an objective question.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.570
I am asking you to evaluate

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.490
how much these patients suffered,

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.785
assuming that they used the scale

00:20:32.785 --> 00:20:35.500
in roughly comparable ways.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.382
Or you know, if you want,

00:20:37.382 --> 00:20:39.050
you could have those two experiences

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.039
of the same patient and I could ask you,

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:44.520
on which of these occasions
did the patient suffer more?

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.690
So that question is asked

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.272
from the perspective of
an objective observer.

00:20:48.272 --> 00:20:51.256
And what it requires is the evaluation

00:20:51.256 --> 00:20:54.780
of the temporal profile of an experience.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.740
Utility is the term that,

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.180
well it started in philosophy

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.030
and it's been adopted in economics,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.580
to describe the value
of goods or episodes.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.700
So this is an objective utility.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.100
And what I mean by objective is

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.200
we don't ask the patient to
provide a global evaluation.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.480
The patient provides a
moment by moment evaluation.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.400
We evaluate that.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.350
And most of us, I think, will say

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.400
that Patient B suffered
more than Patient A.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.800
It's very easy to justify that.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.490
Patient B's colonoscopy
lasted two minutes,

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.150
Patient A eight minutes,

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.200
and every level of pain
that Patient A reported,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.540
Patient B had that and more.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.860
So Patient B suffered more.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.580
But we can ask a completely
different question.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.910
We can ask, how did the two
patients remember the episode?

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.910
Which of the two patients
remembered the episode as worse?

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.860
And let me show you again
what they looked like.

00:21:57.085 --> 00:21:59.110
This question is now asked

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.890
from the perspective of
the experiencing subject.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.080
And here is a finding,
it's a very robust finding.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.554
It's not only about these
two patients, it generalizes.

00:22:09.554 --> 00:22:12.430
We've done many studies along those lines.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.110
Patient A actually keeps a much worse

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.000
memory of the episode than Patient B.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.900
And the reason is straightforward.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.685
For Patient A, the episode ended

00:22:22.685 --> 00:22:25.600
at the moment of intense pain.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.340
And it turns out that if you look at

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.510
how memories of such episodes are formed,

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:35.502
well, they're not, they don't
integrate under the curve.

00:22:35.502 --> 00:22:37.350
This is not what is happening.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.310
It is not a sum, rolling sum of the pain

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.040
that a person experiences,
that's not what happens.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.590
What happens is that what gets stored

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:51.040
is an average of the pain
that was experienced.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.710
And it's a weighted average.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.290
And in that weighted average,

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.360
two moments have particular weight,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.590
the peak pain that was
experienced and the end.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.810
And if you know the peak
and you know the end,

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.401
you can predict with a
great deal of accuracy

00:23:04.401 --> 00:23:07.650
how people will evaluate
the experience as a whole.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.264
And there is one detail
you don't need to know,

00:23:10.264 --> 00:23:14.100
and this is how long
the colonoscopy lasted.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.180
Because when people provide
an overall evaluation,

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.220
it turns out that that detail goes.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.200
In the memory representation,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.393
the colonoscopy is represented

00:23:24.393 --> 00:23:28.860
by sort of an average
moment, a moment of pain.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.310
And if it ended badly, then the memory

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.080
is of relatively intense pain.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.547
Now it turns out that people

00:23:37.547 --> 00:23:38.630
not only remember things that way,

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.870
they also, so that's the correlation

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:45.410
of peak and end and those
are correlation values,

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.500
and the duration of the procedure

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.910
has essentially no effect on the ratings.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.080
It turns out that people make decisions

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.480
that are based on such odd
memories that they store.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.830
So we ran an experiment that was,

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.880
that was run, actually, at Berkeley.

00:24:06.433 --> 00:24:09.230
And in that experiment,
well let me describe it.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.400
On two trials separated by seven minutes,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.150
participants immerse a hand in cold water

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.160
until instructed to remove it.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.250
That's called the cold press task.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.740
So you put your hand to
the wrist in cold water.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.500
And you can make it as
painful as you want.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.760
I mean, you can make
it very painful indeed

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.190
if the water is very cold.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.880
This is kind of tolerable.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.230
Seven minutes after the second trial,

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.970
they are called for third trial

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.910
and are asked which of the two
trials they want to repeat.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.400
So they have one with their left hand,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.840
one with their right hand.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.350
And one of these trials is short,

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.290
I'll call it the short trial,
the other is the long trial.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.820
The short trial is you spend 60 seconds

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.828
in water at 14 degrees Celsius.

00:24:51.828 --> 00:24:55.914
And by the time you are done with that,

00:24:55.914 --> 00:24:58.040
you are reporting levels of pain

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.180
that are eight or nine
on a 14-point scale.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.590
Quite substantial pain.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.930
Not overwhelming, not intolerable,
but people are in pain.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.090
The long experience,

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.590
oh yes, and after 60
seconds, the experimenter

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.100
tells you take your hand out,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.670
and there is a warm towel waiting for you.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.415
The long experience, which
you have with the other hand,

00:25:18.415 --> 00:25:19.740
is the following,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.690
you have 60 seconds at 14 degrees
Celsius, exactly the same,

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.450
but at the end of the 60 seconds,

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.665
the experimenter doesn't say anything.

00:25:29.665 --> 00:25:31.917
The experimenter opens a valve

00:25:31.917 --> 00:25:35.750
which lets in some water
that is slightly warmer,

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.966
so that over the next 30 seconds

00:25:37.966 --> 00:25:42.360
the water heats up, if you
will, to 15 degrees Celsius.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.010
Still painfully cold,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:48.710
but a little less painful
than it was initially.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.320
So now we have a clear prediction
from what I said earlier.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.450
Because the average of
peak pain and end pain

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.710
is now lower for the longer experience.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.740
And the question is

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.480
which of the two experiences
would people choose to repeat?

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.120
And 65 to 80 percent,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.540
depending on conditions and how you count,

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.460
prefer the long experience
over the short experience.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.120
So people expose themselves to pain

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.880
that they really don't need
to expose themselves to.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.420
They don't do it to be brave,

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.830
they don't do it to impress anyone.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.034
It is simply that the memory they stored

00:26:24.034 --> 00:26:28.930
is worse when the experience
ended at a high level of pain

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.400
than when the experience
ended more gently.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.321
Although the overall amount
of pain that people suffered

00:26:34.321 --> 00:26:36.880
is higher in the second case.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.180
So that creates, you know,
this is telling us something.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.440
This is telling us that
there is a difference

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.680
between living and thinking about it

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.530
or between living and remembering it.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.039
Because if you think about the experience,

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:53.605
clearly the longer experience is worse.

00:26:53.605 --> 00:26:58.390
But if you think of the
memory that people keep,

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:02.150
then the longer experience
is actually better.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.660
It is not as bad.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.770
And notice that the
choices that people make

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:08.600
are guided by their memory.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.450
They're not guided by the
reality of the experience.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.130
They are guided, in this case,

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.880
by what I would describe
as an inaccurate memory

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.060
of what actually happened to them.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.560
So, there have been many
experiments of that kind,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.610
and that's the background, actually,

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.763
for my interest in the
study of well-being.

00:27:26.763 --> 00:27:29.370
So I want to distinguish

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.700
two notions, if you will.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.570
I think of it in terms of two selves.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.300
There is an experiencing self.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.120
That's the one that's doing
the living moment to moment.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.070
And then there is a
remembering, evaluating self.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.570
So that's the one that answers
question like how was it?

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.230
You know, how was this experience?

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.600
How was your vacation?

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.850
How's your life these days?

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:59.850
This is a very different
person that we're asking.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.400
They're not necessarily the same.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.520
So some, you know, someone is
doing the living at all times,

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.670
and then occasionally we stop
and think about our life.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.720
And memories are all we get
to keep from the living.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.780
So the experiencing self, you know,

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.410
just exists second by second

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.140
and it's a fleeting
existence and it's gone.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.229
So the only self that has permanence

00:28:24.229 --> 00:28:26.560
is the remembering self.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.370
But the remembering self need not

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.210
be right about what actually happened.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.940
The remembering self can have,

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.130
you know, can have memories
that are quite inaccurate.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.980
Now it turned out, when, you know,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.482
I was interested by
this, it turned out that

00:28:41.482 --> 00:28:46.300
research on well-being
is almost exclusively

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.430
dominated by studies of
the remembering self.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.221
So people get asked questions such as

00:28:52.221 --> 00:28:55.950
how happy are you with
your life these days?

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.590
Or, here are some examples.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.170
How satisfied are you with your
life as a whole these days?

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.783
Would you say that these days you are

00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:05.070
very happy, pretty happy, or not so happy?

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.173
Millions of people have
been asked these questions.

00:29:07.173 --> 00:29:10.920
These are questions to
the remembering self.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.396
But now, how would we go about measuring

00:29:13.396 --> 00:29:16.150
the happiness of the experiencing self?

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:19.170
Well it turns out there
are methods for doing that,

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:24.150
and in particular a method
invented by Csikszentmihalyi,

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.410
which is called experience sampling.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.440
And the way that experience sampling

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.590
would be done these days

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.106
is participants carry a palm-top,
you know, or cell phone,

00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:38.843
it beeps several times a day
at unpredictable intervals,

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:42.310
and then you're supposed to take it out

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.240
and there is a menu of questions,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.424
and the questions basically
ask you where are you,

00:29:46.424 --> 00:29:49.410
you know, offering a
menu of possibilities,

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.150
what are you doing, offering
a menu of possibilities,

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.295
and how do you feel.

00:29:53.295 --> 00:29:55.570
And there is a list of feelings

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.770
and you rate the
intensity of your feeling.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.530
That is, you know, there
is memory involved,

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.600
but clearly the memory
demands are very different

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.640
in experience sampling and
in the life study questions.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.770
Basically you're asked,
how do you feel right now?

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.920
And the assumption is that you

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.170
are likely to get quite different results.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:21.670
So I'm interested in the
difference, if you will,

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.220
between the experiencing self
and the remembering self.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.680
And this is what I've been studying

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.730
for the better part of the last 10 years.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.710
Now I haven't been studying this alone.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.700
I have a whole team.

00:30:39.866 --> 00:30:43.468
In our studies, there
is a philosophical issue

00:30:43.468 --> 00:30:46.780
that, I suppose, I have been raising,

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.600
and I'm not going to answer it.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.340
Which of the two matters more?

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.880
That is, if they diverge,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.930
if the experiencing self, you know,

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.840
has one evaluation of life, if you will,

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.980
and the remembering self has another,

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.230
which should we cater to?

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.750
So those are the extensions.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.280
We have contradictory intuitions

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.368
about what happiness and
well-being is, by the way.

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:15.291
Consider an individual that
is always in a good mood,

00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:20.291
but when you ask him, he
says that his life was wasted

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.810
because he didn't go to college.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.600
Now would we say that this person

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.000
is high or low in well-being?

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.550
If we look at the mood, the
mood is almost always good.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.356
But when the person thinks about his life,

00:31:33.356 --> 00:31:34.810
he's not happy with it.

00:31:35.713 --> 00:31:37.890
Compare that to an individual

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.780
who rarely smiles but
lives a productive life

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.110
and says he's achieving his goals.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.230
Who of those two, we would
say, has higher well-being?

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.250
And it really, I think
most people, by the way,

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.491
on this question, would
say the second individual

00:31:51.491 --> 00:31:54.120
has higher well-being than the first,

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.810
but clearly it's debatable.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.650
We have linguistic intuitions

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.300
that are not entirely consistent.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.500
A question in which I've been
personally quite interested

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.880
is are people happier in
California than elsewhere?

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.194
Now, and you know, it was highly relevant

00:32:10.194 --> 00:32:13.240
when we went from California to Princeton.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.970
There were different opinions

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.660
in my family about this question.

00:32:18.995 --> 00:32:23.093
Now, when you ask this question,

00:32:23.093 --> 00:32:25.241
what do you have in mind?

00:32:25.241 --> 00:32:28.306
Do we ask whether Californians

00:32:28.306 --> 00:32:30.820
are more satisfied with their lives

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.080
or do we ask, are Californians basically

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.010
more cheerful and in a better mood?

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.170
And in this case, I think unquestionably,

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.100
the interpretation of this
question has to do with mood.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.650
It has to do with the experiencing self

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.500
and not with the remembering self.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.020
So there is something to be explored.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.410
So about six years ago I started work

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.340
on measuring the happiness
of the experiencing self

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.460
with a group of collaborators.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.040
Alan Krueger is my colleague,
an economist at Princeton.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.860
The rest are psychologists.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.650
Clause Fischler is a sociologist in Paris

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.210
with whom we did a
study that I'll describe

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.770
comparing happiness in France
and in the United States.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.867
And the method that we used,

00:33:20.867 --> 00:33:23.420
we call that the day
reconstruction method,

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.640
and I won't go into details.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.840
But basically we bring people,

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.680
and so far we've studied only women,

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.150
we've studied thousands of them

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.500
but we haven't studied men,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:37.225
although study of men is ongoing now.

00:33:37.225 --> 00:33:39.837
Participants come to a central place.

00:33:39.837 --> 00:33:44.300
That's the way that the data
I'll describe is collected.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.780
And they're asked to remember yesterday,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.830
to think about yesterday in detail

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:53.084
and to reconstruct yesterday
as a sequence of episodes.

00:33:53.084 --> 00:33:55.673
They're asked to think of it as a film

00:33:55.673 --> 00:33:58.924
and take scenes, label those scenes.

00:33:58.924 --> 00:34:01.770
And they, in general, people create

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.030
about 15, 17 episodes for a day.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.540
And then, in a subsequent questionnaire,

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.360
they're asked to describe
each of these episodes.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.260
Now it turns out that,
and we have evidence

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.530
that I won't go over in detail,

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.990
this procedure is pretty good
to cause actual reliving.

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:23.530
That is, people who are led in this way

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.090
to relive the day do a pretty good job

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.860
of recovering their actual
emotional experience.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.710
There are other data indicating that

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.730
and we find the same.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.822
Now, the day reconstruction method

00:34:34.822 --> 00:34:37.680
has advantages because it's a lot more

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.230
practical than experience sampling.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.276
You can get data much more easily.

00:34:42.276 --> 00:34:44.090
And now there are variations

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.800
of the day reconstruction method.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.850
It's being used in telephone surveys

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.120
and it's being used
internationally in various formats.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.750
But that's the general idea

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.260
and those are the data that we collected.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.318
Now, let me tell you where I was

00:35:00.318 --> 00:35:03.116
when we started this study.

00:35:03.116 --> 00:35:07.063
I mean, it hasn't happened to me,

00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:09.745
during my career, I think,

00:35:09.745 --> 00:35:12.601
this particular topic is the one

00:35:12.601 --> 00:35:14.598
where I have changed my mind

00:35:14.598 --> 00:35:16.641
or I have been forced to change my mind

00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:18.696
or I've been wrong simply,

00:35:18.696 --> 00:35:21.310
more often thinking about well-being

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.120
than in thinking about
almost anything else.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.300
So I can tell you that when
I was young and foolish,

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.240
and by that I mean about eight years ago,

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.240
I thought that really what
matters is the experiencing self,

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.970
that, you know, who cares
about the remembering self,

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.885
it's just a story that we're telling.

00:35:39.885 --> 00:35:43.650
And I thought, we can neglect that.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.408
If we really succeed in
studying the experiencing self,

00:35:47.408 --> 00:35:50.810
then we'll have the real
answer to people's well-being.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.574
And now that I am somewhat more mature,

00:35:52.574 --> 00:35:55.340
I have accepted a different model.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.940
And the reason I have had to accept it

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.880
is because people just don't go along

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.140
with the idea that the experiencing self

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.790
is really the end all and be all.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.370
It turns out that people have
a narrative of their life,

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.700
they have a story of their life,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.680
they care a great deal about that story,

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.620
they make decisions for that story,

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.580
they make choices to keep that
story good or to improve it.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.680
In short, people care a great deal

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.860
and take actions that are based

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:28.860
on anticipated memories
and on evaluations.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:34.260
So you can't just look
at ongoing experience.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.436
But I would argue that it would also

00:36:36.436 --> 00:36:39.269
be a mistake to ignore ongoing experience.

00:36:39.269 --> 00:36:41.850
So I've sort of ended up with

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.718
a hybrid model that nobody likes,

00:36:44.718 --> 00:36:48.370
where I keep both elements.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:51.480
Experienced happiness is, you know,

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.530
what happens to the experiencing self,

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.480
and life satisfaction, which is

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.920
the reports of the
remembering, evaluating self.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.920
And those two are clearly
distinct, that we're finding.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.470
And I do not answer the
philosophical questions

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.260
of which of them matters more.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.200
I'm currently interested
in the descriptive task

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.620
of figuring out what produces
experienced happiness

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.440
and what produces reported
life satisfaction.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.440
And how it varies.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.760
Now, there are some important differences

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.500
depending on whether you focus

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.880
on experienced happiness or
on reported life satisfaction,

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.180
and perhaps the most
significant is the role of time.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.320
Because, if life is a story,
if life is a narrative,

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.900
and we're evaluating the
narrative of our life,

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.230
time is relatively
insignificant in narratives.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.830
Narratives and stories
go from event to event,

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.510
from change to change.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.070
Duration really doesn't matter very much.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.650
But if you focus on experience,

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.447
then the duration of experiences

00:37:55.447 --> 00:37:57.730
is, in fact, quite critical.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.210
So, from my point of view,

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.300
a day in which somebody, you know,

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.960
just about everyone prefers
socializing over commuting,

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.460
and I would say that a day on which

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.890
you socialized more and
commuted less is a better day,

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.010
regardless of how you think

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.020
about that day at the end of the day.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.430
That is, in terms of
the experiencing self,

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.290
just changing the duration,
changing the allocation of time

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.550
makes a great deal of difference.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:28.040
And we have gone into,

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.520
we've proposed a measure for this.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.130
And let me introduce that measure.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:37.070
We call this the U Index,
U for unpleasantness.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.240
And the U Index is simply
the proportion of time

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.870
that an individual or a group

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.600
spend in an unpleasant emotional state.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.260
The way that we do this is
actually quite straightforward.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.870
So in the DRM, the day
reconstruction method,

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.794
people describe one episode after another,

00:38:56.794 --> 00:38:59.200
they rate all sorts of feelings,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.530
some of them positive,
some of them negative,

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:04.399
and we count the amount
of time during the day

00:39:04.399 --> 00:39:08.960
in which the most intense
emotion is negative.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.120
It could be anger, it could be depression,

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.826
it could be sadness, I
think we have several.

00:39:13.826 --> 00:39:15.620
Or tension.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.040
And if it is strictly more intense

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.970
than any positive emotion,

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.590
we call that a negative moment.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.170
And we look at that index,

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.930
it's an index that has some
interesting properties,

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.730
because you can compare individuals,

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.070
you can compare groups,

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.505
so that you can ask about a population.

00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:35.990
What percentage of time
did that population

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.360
spend in a negative emotional state?

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.520
It's a meaningful question.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.590
So let me give you a few miscellaneous

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:44.710
facts about the U Index.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.040
Among the American women
that we have studied,

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.160
the average is 18 percent.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:54.124
It's 21 percent on weekdays,
it's 14 percent on weekends.

00:39:54.124 --> 00:39:56.770
People do more things they like doing

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.620
on weekends and on weekdays.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.110
And that's a very striking result.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.930
The distribution of misery, if you will,

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.080
is extraordinarily unequal.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.020
That is, when you look at
who does the suffering,

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.580
you know, in a large group of people,

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.600
it's a relatively small number of people

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.460
who do the bulk of the suffering.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.370
That is, the top 10 percent of people

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.920
account for about 40 percent or over

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.830
of the total amount, the total time

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:31.640
spent by a group in a
negative emotional state.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.980
That, by the way, is a result that has,

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.470
in my view, immediately
policy implications,

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:38.830
when we encountered that.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.140
And the policy implications are that,

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.700
probably, there should be
a focus on mental illness,

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.300
and there should be a focus on misery.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.430
That is, what are the
sources of intense misery?

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.850
This is something that you get to

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.080
because that U Index is
actually an interesting measure,

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.240
that is has some metric properties,

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.670
that it makes sense to say that we have

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.480
reduced the time that
people spend suffering

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.570
by five percent or 10 percent.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.270
If we achieved that change,

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.390
we have achieved something
for the population.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.240
That is, I think, quite meaningful.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.083
Okay.

00:41:13.083 --> 00:41:14.850
Another difference between,

00:41:17.622 --> 00:41:19.890
another thing we need to think about

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:24.730
when we think about the experiencing self

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.070
and the remembering self
and their well-being

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.370
is the role of attention.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.120
What do we focus on when
we think about our life?

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.910
That is, as I've said occasionally,

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.370
you think about your
life and you evaluate it.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.020
What are you thinking about then?

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.817
And compare that to what
controls the quality

00:41:43.817 --> 00:41:46.630
of your emotional experience ongoing,

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.840
when you're not asking
yourself general questions,

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.550
you're just living.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:55.150
So what does the remembering
self focus on or attend to?

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.810
What does the experiencing self attend to?

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.410
Do those match?

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.870
And it turns out they don't.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.920
Norbert Schwarz, one of my
colleagues in this group,

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.650
has a lovely experiment in which

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.920
he asks people a very simple question,

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.070
how much pleasure do
you get from your car?

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.337
And, you know, it's a question
that people can answer.

00:42:16.337 --> 00:42:20.070
And then he asks them a lot
of details about their car

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:21.782
so that he can look up the Blue Book value

00:42:21.782 --> 00:42:23.830
of the individual's car.

00:42:25.218 --> 00:42:26.879
And then he can correlate the amount

00:42:26.879 --> 00:42:27.780
of pleasure that people get from their car

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.400
with the Blue Book value.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.540
And there is a correlation.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.900
It's not very high, but it's like .35,

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.700
it's a very respectable correlation.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.600
Now there's something else you can do.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.290
You can ask people,

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.670
think of your commute this morning,

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:44.190
how much did you enjoy
your commute this morning?

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:45.590
And you can correlate that with

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.150
the Blue Book value of the car.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.080
And the correlation is zero.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.480
And if you stop to think about it,

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.180
when do you get pleasure from your car?

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.710
Well the answer is, when
you're thinking about your car.

00:43:01.737 --> 00:43:04.770
And by and large, we don't spend

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.420
much time thinking about our car.

00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:14.770
Now, the same question, I think,

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.810
explains what happens about California.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:20.081
It turns out that people both
in California and elsewhere

00:43:20.081 --> 00:43:22.910
think that people are
happier in California.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.784
To the best of, you know,

00:43:24.784 --> 00:43:28.850
the best evidence available
doesn't support this.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.070
But what happens is that

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:34.260
when you think about living in California,

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.590
you are going to think about

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.990
what distinguishes life in
California from elsewhere.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:41.380
For many people who are not in California,

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.950
it's the climate.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:46.692
And clearly, you know,
the climate is better here

00:43:46.692 --> 00:43:49.010
than it is, you know, in Cleveland.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.110
And people in Cleveland
really despise their climate.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:54.250
I mean, it is not that, you
know, the have adapted to it.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.839
They haven't adapted to it, they hate it.

00:43:56.839 --> 00:44:01.459
But the point is, most of the time

00:44:01.459 --> 00:44:03.760
this is not what they focus on.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.240
They're thinking about other things.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.800
So the amount of time,

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.968
being a Californian is
a part-time situation.

00:44:10.968 --> 00:44:13.650
We rarely think about the advantages

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.350
of living in California.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.280
Now we do a fair amount of commuting.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.430
We have a house here.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.560
So we do actually think about California

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.160
when we live that experience.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.897
But by and large, for
people who live here,

00:44:24.897 --> 00:44:27.530
that's not a very salient
part of their life.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.460
And the climate is not a very
salient part of their life.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.790
So asking the issue about
what people focus on,

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:35.610
what people think about

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.460
when they live and when
they think about their life

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.610
is sort of interesting.

00:44:40.675 --> 00:44:44.228
And it has implications for consumption.

00:44:44.228 --> 00:44:46.921
Because you can think of different

00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:49.731
types of consumption goods.

00:44:49.731 --> 00:44:52.924
For example, you know,
a large refrigerator,

00:44:52.924 --> 00:44:55.513
a large car, a large house, et cetera.

00:44:55.513 --> 00:44:57.900
Those are goods that people think

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.700
are going to make a very large
difference in their life.

00:45:01.736 --> 00:45:05.927
We call that a focusing illusion.

00:45:05.927 --> 00:45:08.220
People exaggerate the importance

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.000
that this is going to have in their life.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.990
Now what's happening
here is the following.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:15.656
There are different kinds
of consumption goods.

00:45:15.656 --> 00:45:18.280
There are consumption goods
such as a refrigerator

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.050
that you're completely unaware of unless,

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:25.257
you know, something happens to
it and it stops functioning.

00:45:25.257 --> 00:45:29.147
There are other goods, like
interactions with friends,

00:45:29.147 --> 00:45:34.147
like family feasts, that, when
you are consuming that good,

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.500
you are consuming it consciously.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.510
You're aware of it.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:43.402
So the amount of discrepancy between

00:45:43.402 --> 00:45:46.870
the expectation or the amount of pleasure

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:49.277
that we get from our house
when we think about our house

00:45:49.277 --> 00:45:52.310
and the amount of
pleasure we actually get,

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.620
that may not be the same for
different kinds of goods.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.990
We call that the focusing illusion,

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.390
and I have, that's the only Chinese cookie

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.860
kind of thing that I've ever
composed, so I'm proud of it.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.980
But it says that nothing in life matters

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.140
quite as much as you think it does

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.320
while you are thinking about it.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.850
You can parse this.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.076
The idea is that merely
thinking about something

00:46:18.076 --> 00:46:20.520
causes you to exaggerate its importance.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.900
And we have massive evidence
that this is the case.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.390
So notice, by the way,
that what this means

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:32.070
is that when people are
making life decisions,

00:46:33.854 --> 00:46:36.150
they are very likely
basing their decisions

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.800
on a mistake about the
relative importance,

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.730
a mistaken view of the importance

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:43.840
of what they are deciding
on to their actual welfare.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.230
Everything that we decide on

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:47.190
because of the focusing illusion

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.990
tends to be, to have
exaggerated importance.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.823
Okay.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:47:00.110
Now, I have a more provocative
statement about this,

00:47:02.066 --> 00:47:05.130
and that's to do with the
issue of meaning in life.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.190
Clearly a meaningful life is something

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.140
that people care about very much.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.370
And you know, when you ask people

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.400
whether they would rather
have a meaningful life,

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.040
you know, or pleasure from food,

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.080
they will, you know, without hesitation

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.590
tell you that a meaningful
life is more important.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.560
What is sort of interesting is that

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.810
we don't find very much meaning

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.390
in our studies of actual experience.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:30.880
Meaning is something that happens

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.220
when people think about
their life, mostly.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.890
And it, by the way, you also need

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.590
to encourage them to think
about a meaningful life.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.640
There are focusing illusions
that are quite significant

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.130
and that we need to think about.

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:49.740
And the possibility that
meaning is one of them

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.160
is an interesting one.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.790
Okay.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.460
Now let me just show you

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.940
what are the implications of this,

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.140
then I'll go very quickly
through some data.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:03.130
The distinction between experiencing self

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:08.130
and remembering self can lead
us to ask questions about

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:10.360
what is the interpretation of this

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.320
marriage graph that we saw earlier?

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.350
And the question I'm asking is,

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:19.710
if we measure the experiencing self,

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.000
would the experiencing self

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.740
adapt along the red curve
or along the blue curve?

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.814
Would the experiencing self
adapt faster or more slowly

00:48:28.814 --> 00:48:32.660
than the remembering self who
is evaluating satisfaction?

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.166
And I can tell you, I used to think

00:48:34.166 --> 00:48:37.970
that it's the red curve when
we started six years ago.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.910
It isn't, it's very likely
to be the blue curve,

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:43.640
that experience actually
adapts even faster

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.730
in many cases, and possibly,

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:50.030
I'll give you some evidence
about this if I can do it.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.863
Okay.

00:48:52.521 --> 00:48:55.260
We can also ask the same question

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.070
about national differences.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:59.700
Are they only in evaluation or are they

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.280
in the experience as well?

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.820
Okay.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.740
We did a study in two cities,

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:13.260
Columbus, Ohio and Rennes in
France, a city in Brittany.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.710
800 women in each city
described one day in their life.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:19.330
This is how they spend their time.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:23.340
Engaged leisure, I mean, those categories

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:24.740
are pretty self-explanatory.

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.280
By and large, quite similar,

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.730
the way they spend their
time, except for eating.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.000
And by the way, it is not,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.440
what we do here is we ask people

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.450
when they check multiple activities

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:38.650
to indicate what is the focal activity.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.880
And what happens is American women

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.744
spend almost as much time
eating as French women,

00:49:44.744 --> 00:49:46.930
but they don't think about it.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:49.280
That is, they check something
else as more important,

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.630
like driving or speaking on the phone.

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.210
The French women, by and large,

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.769
when they eat, that's what they're doing.

00:49:55.769 --> 00:49:59.450
Which is probably a good thing for them.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:03.380
But aside from that,
it's not very surprising.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.090
Here is, you know, the
ranking of activities.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.259
And there are some things
that are worth pointing out.

00:50:09.259 --> 00:50:11.268
Not very surprising, but you know,

00:50:11.268 --> 00:50:14.147
making love is much more
pleasant than commuting,

00:50:14.147 --> 00:50:16.144
which is down there.

00:50:16.144 --> 00:50:19.116
Play is very good.

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.660
By and large, the ranking of activities

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.690
in the two cities is very similar,

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.720
with one very interesting exception.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.620
That's child care.

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:31.630
French women enjoy their children

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.810
way more than American women do.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.450
American mothers spend more time

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.620
with their children and enjoy it less.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.380
And, you know, what the reasons are

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.350
and what the mechanics are, I don't know,

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:45.420
but it's very clear, and we
have other evidence for that,

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.910
that the costs of being
a mother are higher

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:50.380
in the United States
than they are in France.

00:50:52.241 --> 00:50:53.213
Okay.

00:50:53.213 --> 00:50:56.383
That just repeats or shows you,

00:50:56.383 --> 00:50:59.780
you know, the U Index
for different activities.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.816
And engaged leisure is very good.

00:51:01.816 --> 00:51:04.940
And work and commute are pretty bad.

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.360
So no surprises here.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:12.550
Now, we're happier on
weekends, I told you earlier.

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.630
And that's straightforward.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:18.650
We're happier on weekends
because we use time differently.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:21.950
We shift time from
activities we don't like

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.660
to activities we like better.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.880
There's just no particular mystery here.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.352
We can compare who is happier,

00:51:29.352 --> 00:51:32.520
women in France or women
in the United States,

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.250
and the answer is women in
France, slightly happier.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.247
Not by a lot, but you know,

00:51:37.247 --> 00:51:41.148
the difference between 18 percent U Index

00:51:41.148 --> 00:51:43.900
and 16 percent U Index, don't knock it,

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.230
that's a substantial difference

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:49.368
in terms of the overall
amount that people suffer.

00:51:49.368 --> 00:51:52.352
In Denmark it seems to
be about 13 percent,

00:51:52.352 --> 00:51:54.820
for 800 women in Denmark.

00:51:56.949 --> 00:52:01.949
Now I want to go back
to the marriage issue.

00:52:02.423 --> 00:52:07.423
I promised you a solution to
the question of adaptation,

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.480
or a tentative solution.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.400
So here is my attempt.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.706
We compared time use of married women

00:52:16.706 --> 00:52:19.380
and unmarried women in our sample.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.700
Now, his could be done
better statistically,

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.990
but it's good enough as we have it.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:28.500
So we look at has a mate
or don't have a mate,

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.950
so it's not actual marriage,
but lives with someone.

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:36.240
Now obviously, people who have a mate

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.348
spend much less time alone,
and that's a good thing,

00:52:39.348 --> 00:52:44.223
because, you know,
being alone is not good.

00:52:44.223 --> 00:52:49.223
They spend more time with
immediate nuclear family.

00:52:50.443 --> 00:52:51.330
That's okay.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.830
Not great, but okay.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:56.820
They spend a lot less time with friends.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.190
That goes from 16
percent to three percent.

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:03.860
They spend significantly more time

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.610
doing things they don't like doing.

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.242
And they spend significantly less time

00:53:10.242 --> 00:53:13.740
on discretionary
activities, on just leisure.

00:53:14.756 --> 00:53:17.556
Now when you look at the balance

00:53:17.556 --> 00:53:22.556
of good and bad in those
descriptions of time use,

00:53:24.209 --> 00:53:26.630
it pretty much is a wash.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.860
There is no mystery why married women

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.039
are not all that happier than
single women in steady state.

00:53:36.039 --> 00:53:38.199
They live different lives

00:53:38.199 --> 00:53:41.550
and there are costs and
benefits to being married

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:43.760
in terms of the kinds
of things that they do,

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.870
and I'm talking strictly about
the experiencing self here.

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:48.440
Being married is quite good.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.840
Having a mate is quite
good for life satisfaction.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.590
But in terms of experience,
it's much more complicated.

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.588
So I don't think it's a mystery,

00:53:57.588 --> 00:54:01.210
what happens a few years before marriage

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:02.910
and a few years after marriage,

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.960
that those levels are pretty similar.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.730
I think that what is interesting
and what is a mystery

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:12.250
is, you know, why are people
so excited about marriage?

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.350
If, you know, if this is
what's going to happen to them.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:19.844
And I think there is, of
course, a pretty good answer.

00:54:19.844 --> 00:54:23.780
Most of the time in the
way that we live normally,

00:54:25.974 --> 00:54:30.020
what determines how happy we
are in terms of experience

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.920
is primarily our personality.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.430
There is no question about it,

00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:35.760
some people are born to
be happier than others.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.250
It's largely genetic.

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:39.910
But beyond personality,

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:42.610
there is an enormous effect of context.

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:45.240
So people are happier, as we see,

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.750
socializing than working,

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.260
socializing than commuting, and so on.

00:54:50.202 --> 00:54:53.070
But there are periods in life

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.580
during which it is not the context

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.130
that determines your happiness.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.150
So in a period when, you know,

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:02.160
somebody's gloriously in love,

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.700
they can be very happy
while stuck in traffic.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.570
That's completely possible.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:08.990
And people who are depressed

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.460
are going to be miserable
in a family feast.

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:16.940
So there are periods and there are persons

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.200
whose happiness, experienced happiness,

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.930
is not determined by the context,

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:24.750
it's determined endogenously

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.645
by things that are
happening in their head.

00:55:27.645 --> 00:55:30.535
And what happens around marriage

00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:33.930
is probably in large
part an effect like that.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.590
It's an effect of attention.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.536
People are spending much more time

00:55:37.536 --> 00:55:41.182
attending to things that make them happy

00:55:41.182 --> 00:55:43.230
and relatively less time

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.380
attending to their immediate context.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.521
So they are happier while they drive

00:55:47.521 --> 00:55:49.500
and they are happier in general,

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.870
because their attention
is temporarily diverted.

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.330
So the role of attention in experience

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.691
is absolutely critical in understanding

00:55:57.691 --> 00:56:00.570
what is happening in this context

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:03.000
and in explaining this mystery.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.536
Okay, I think I have kept my promise,

00:56:07.536 --> 00:56:09.470
almost kept my promise.

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:10.860
I'll tell you just in a word

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.500
about international differences.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.440
Turns out I was wrong there again.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.860
I thought that I knew that there are

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:23.547
those large international differences

00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:28.547
in the evaluative self,
the remembered self.

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:32.360
You know, life satisfaction.

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.850
I was not expecting to find very large

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:38.210
differences in actual emotion.

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:40.080
But I'm now looking at the data set

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.720
collected by Gallup,
they have a world poll

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.620
in which they have asked, you know,

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.964
national samples in
well over 100 countries

00:56:46.964 --> 00:56:49.797
a question such as think about yesterday,

00:56:49.797 --> 00:56:53.140
did you spend a lot of time yesterday

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:56.635
feeling, say, depression,
or feeling enjoyment?

00:56:56.635 --> 00:56:59.700
Now let me tell you some of the results,

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.000
and I find them stunning

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.200
and I don't understand
where they come from.

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:11.550
The Danes, the Swiss, the Dutch

00:57:11.565 --> 00:57:15.211
report being depressed
about three or four percent,

00:57:15.211 --> 00:57:17.020
three or four percent of people

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.370
report that they were
depressed the day before.

00:57:20.552 --> 00:57:24.371
The Americans, the Greeks, the Indians

00:57:24.371 --> 00:57:26.750
report about 14 percent.

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:31.510
The Palestinians report 30 percent.

00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:34.130
The Armenians report close to 50 percent.

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.090
There are enormous differences.

00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:39.470
There are similar
differences in the number

00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:43.150
of people who report
that they smiled a lot.

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:47.120
Well they're somewhat smaller,
but in the same direction.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.010
About 80 percent of the Danes,

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:50.750
and in this case also the Americans,

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:53.070
report that they smiled a lot yesterday.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:57.280
50 percent of Palestinians say
they smiled a lot yesterday.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:01.988
So national circumstances
have a big effect

00:58:01.988 --> 00:58:04.350
not only on people's evaluation,

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:06.446
they have a big effect on emotional life.

00:58:06.446 --> 00:58:09.490
And this is a topic that
deserves to be studied

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:11.140
and it's going to be studied,

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:14.200
but I think we don't understand it yet.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.220
I've gone a bit too long, I apologize.

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:22.220
Thank you.
