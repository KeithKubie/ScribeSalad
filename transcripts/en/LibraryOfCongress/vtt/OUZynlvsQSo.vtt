.

00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:39.633
&gt;&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.  
Thank you for joining us for 

00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:41.634
inside baseball, baseball 
collections as data.

00:10:44.752 --> 00:10:47.196
This morning we're going to 
marry a hear a lot about rapid 

00:10:47.197 --> 00:10:50.701
prototyping, designing, 
collaboration, a little bit of 

00:10:50.702 --> 00:10:53.171
scrambling, maybe a dash of 
magic as well.  First I'd like 

00:10:53.172 --> 00:10:55.424
to introduce you to our director
of digital strategy at the 

00:10:57.702 --> 00:10:59.120
library of congress, Kate.  
Kate's going to share a little 

00:10:59.121 --> 00:11:02.383
more about the work that's 
happening here at the library 

00:11:02.384 --> 00:11:04.384
and are delighted to have her 
here with us.  Thank you.

00:11:08.917 --> 00:11:12.570
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Meghan.  
I'm thrilled to be here to open 

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.390
today's events.

00:11:17.897 --> 00:11:19.897
I'm the library of congress's 
director of digital strategy.

00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:23.874
And on behalf of the National 
Museum of African-American and 

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:25.875
culture and 

00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:28.980
JSTOR, I'd like to welcome 
everybody.  We're excited to be 

00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:32.065
able to share with you a week's 
worth of very focused work.  As 

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.066
you all know, Dr.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.528
Hayden has brought a new vision 
to the 

00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:41.111
library that will be or user 
centered and focused on how we 

00:11:41.112 --> 00:11:43.161
can reach more people and 
interact with them on a deeper 

00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:46.455
level.  And technology, I think,
is a great enabler of that kind 

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:50.731
of work.  This event highlights 
how we can effectively partner 

00:11:50.732 --> 00:11:52.548
with our users and create 
prototypes that will make us 

00:11:52.549 --> 00:11:56.538
more effective and efficient.  
           We'll be publishing a

00:11:56.539 --> 00:12:01.001
digital strategy for the Library
of Congress in September.  Which

00:12:01.002 --> 00:12:03.002
will describe our plans for 

00:12:04.313 --> 00:12:07.015
reaching more users with 
technology and enabling further 

00:12:07.016 --> 00:12:08.983
access to our materials.  To 
accomplish that work, we're 

00:12:08.984 --> 00:12:12.847
going to be on labs and their 
ability to try and do things and

00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:14.848
test our assumptions.  One of 
the things I love about the 

00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:19.810
culture of labs is our -- that 
we do things in the open so that

00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:23.746
while we're learning, we're 
helping others learn.  So we've 

00:12:23.747 --> 00:12:25.993
learned so much from JSTOR Labs 
here this week.  We're thrilled 

00:12:25.994 --> 00:12:29.855
that they're here with us.  
           So that's a great 

00:12:29.856 --> 00:12:33.973
segue into the past week and 
today.  It's been a lively week 

00:12:33.974 --> 00:12:35.974
of looking at 

00:12:37.037 --> 00:12:39.272
collections in new ways, 
engaging users inside and 

00:12:39.273 --> 00:12:42.568
outside of our walls, and 
flash-building.  It's been a 

00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:44.569
week of shared learning 

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:46.677
and a week of demonstrating the 
power of computational access to

00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:50.609
collections.  We love thinking 
about the different ways our 

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.472
collections can be understood 
and the power of computation 

00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:56.752
brings up a lot of more 
opportunities.  Today is going 

00:12:56.753 --> 00:12:58.785
to be a really thrilling day.  
We've got some wonderful 

00:12:58.786 --> 00:13:01.066
speakers at the head.  And we're
going to get to see some 

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.544
fantastic datasets and 
prototypes which will be useful 

00:13:04.545 --> 00:13:07.017
to baseball researchers and data
analysis and hopefully can form 

00:13:09.693 --> 00:13:11.533
a model for other types of 
collections.  

00:13:11.534 --> 00:13:13.370
It's always fun to show what 
could be quickly put together 

00:13:13.371 --> 00:13:17.120
when great minds are together.  
We'll be hearing from the 

00:13:17.121 --> 00:13:19.121
National Museum of 
African-American History and 

00:13:20.402 --> 00:13:24.445
Culture and JSTOR.  And this 
afternoon I'm excited to share 

00:13:24.446 --> 00:13:27.312
that we'll have Clinton Yates, 
Rob Ruck and Jordan Ellenberg in

00:13:27.313 --> 00:13:30.555
a panel discussion.  
           Okay.  As the 

00:13:30.556 --> 00:13:32.556
unofficial empire here, play 
ball.  

00:13:35.006 --> 00:13:37.006
[ Applause ] 

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.310
umpire here, play ball.  
[ Applause ]

00:13:57.904 --> 00:13:59.904
&gt;&gt; I'm Jamie.

00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:05.527
Okay, Yay.

00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:10.648
So my name is Jamie Mears, and I
work 

00:14:11.937 --> 00:14:14.806
for the LC Labs team that Kate 
mentioned.  I'm going to talk a 

00:14:14.807 --> 00:14:18.909
little bit -- I'm going to try 
to frame the day for you, which 

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.947
is a big task because it's a 
little confusing.

00:14:24.026 --> 00:14:26.052
For those of you who dropped in 
for the event today, the biggest

00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:30.420
point that I want you to know 
from the start is that we've 

00:14:30.421 --> 00:14:32.421
been working since Monday 

00:14:34.985 --> 00:14:37.241
around the clock to put together
flash-build products to help 

00:14:37.242 --> 00:14:42.585
people research baseball and 
discover our collections.  And 

00:14:42.586 --> 00:14:45.050
it's kind of crazy that we did 
that.  It's very vulnerable 

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:48.326
exercise, and it's been really, 
really fun.  It's required all 

00:14:48.327 --> 00:14:53.832
of us to really trust each 
other.  And so here we go.  I'm 

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:57.116
going to try to help explain why
we did this and why we're here. 

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.617
So "inside baseball," this is a 
look at "Inside Baseball.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.656
"   I wanted to kick off with an
item from the baseball 

00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:12.992
collection.  It's a picture of 
an indoor baseball team in 

00:15:12.993 --> 00:15:15.285
Chicago, 1897, I believe, and 
it's considered to be -- they're

00:15:17.344 --> 00:15:19.344
considered to be the first 
softball team that ever existed.

00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:23.470
They seem more dapper than a lot
of the other baseball pictures 

00:15:23.471 --> 00:15:25.677
I've seen so far of people, 
maybe playing inside, I 

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.882
don't know, makes you age 
better. 

00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:37.722
This is Inside Baseball to me 
when I think about it, which may

00:15:37.723 --> 00:15:39.723
be scary to some people here.

00:15:43.202 --> 00:15:45.481
So Inside Baseball underneath is
essentially data, and it's so 

00:15:45.482 --> 00:15:48.350
much work, but it's so worth it.
And so hopefully by the end of 

00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:50.351
this 

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:54.318
presentation, you'll see why I 
love this.  

00:15:57.837 --> 00:16:01.379
So this is a picture of the LC 
Labs team.  If we were on a 

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.098
baseball card, you know how they
used to do those action shots 

00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:07.372
for teams that were staged.  
This is not staged but it's not 

00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:09.373
very dynamic either.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.698
But this would probably be us, 
just kind of standing around and

00:16:12.699 --> 00:16:17.845
problem solving together around 
a whiteboard.  I wanted to 

00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:19.846
mention that our team got 

00:16:22.756 --> 00:16:23.995
Abby potPotter here, me and 
Meghan Ferriter who introduced 

00:16:23.996 --> 00:16:26.023
the day.  Not featured here is 
half of our team.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.566
We just expanded to three more 
people, and they have joined us 

00:16:31.567 --> 00:16:33.567
because we are 

00:16:34.717 --> 00:16:37.357
launching a crowdsourcing 
transcription and tagging 

00:16:37.358 --> 00:16:41.057
application that's going to 
launch in the fall.  So if you 

00:16:41.058 --> 00:16:42.699
-- if this talk makes you 
interested in data at all and 

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.554
you want to take a hand in it, 
then that opportunity is going 

00:16:45.555 --> 00:16:48.845
to happen quite soon.  
           Okay.

00:16:52.362 --> 00:16:54.199
So I wanted to talk a little 
about our goals because they 

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.200
feed directly into 

00:16:57.348 --> 00:16:59.592
why we did this event this week.
It's difficult for me -- so the 

00:16:59.593 --> 00:17:04.508
first one is enable 
transformational experiences by 

00:17:04.509 --> 00:17:06.161
connecting users with the 
library and its digital 

00:17:06.162 --> 00:17:08.162
collections.  So some people -- 
people ask us all 

00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:13.130
the time, how do you measure 
impact?  And the way that we 

00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:15.131
think about it is 

00:17:16.489 --> 00:17:18.327
if you see a photograph, for 
example, whether it's a dataset 

00:17:18.328 --> 00:17:20.163
or a single item and it 
transforms the way that you 

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:23.473
think about American History and
Culture, then we've done our 

00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:27.222
job.  So that was partly the 
impetus for the flash-build this

00:17:27.223 --> 00:17:31.117
week.  
           And then our second 

00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:36.491
big goal is to prototype ideas 
and build relationships with 

00:17:36.492 --> 00:17:39.579
stakeholders that will realize 
the library's digital strategy. 

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.580
So you heard from Kate earlier.

00:17:42.643 --> 00:17:44.643
We're launching a digital 
strategy, a 

00:17:47.207 --> 00:17:48.838
new digital strategy, and its 
labs' job to pie plot some of 

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:52.783
those ideas in small, safe ways 
to see whether or not they work 

00:17:52.784 --> 00:17:55.476
for the Library of Congress's 
environment.  

00:17:56.494 --> 00:17:58.565
And then the last goal is to 
strengthen our community by 

00:17:58.566 --> 00:18:00.830
sharing our work for 
transparency, feedback and 

00:18:01.233 --> 00:18:03.685
knowledge exchange.  So that's 
what we're doing now in a 

00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:08.484
very ex-treme sense because 
we're going to demo something 

00:18:08.485 --> 00:18:12.374
for you live that no one has 
ever seen before.  So another 

00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:14.375
important point of this whole 
week is that we spent a lot of 

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:18.333
time documenting all of the 
exercises we went through 

00:18:18.334 --> 00:18:21.000
through the flash-build, all of 
the decisions we made around 

00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:24.205
data transformation.  And that's
something that's a little scary 

00:18:24.206 --> 00:18:26.206
to do out in the open.  But we 
feel it's really important 

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:29.909
because we all learn from each 
other.

00:18:32.209 --> 00:18:33.854
So hopefully by the end of the 
day, there will be a link that 

00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:35.855
we're going to share through 
social media, et cetera, 

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.560
pointing you to where all our 
documentation is so that you can

00:18:39.561 --> 00:18:43.056
take this back to your own 
cultural institutions or 

00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:45.057
anywhere you work to think about
how you can incorporate 

00:18:49.949 --> 00:18:51.480
user-centered design into what 
you do.  

00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:53.481
Okay.

00:18:55.538 --> 00:18:59.855
And labsllc.gov is our home, if 
you want to follow us, you can 

00:18:59.856 --> 00:19:02.535
sign up for our listserv.  But 
essentially, this is the main 

00:19:04.392 --> 00:19:06.236
place to find, you know, 
information about us and the 

00:19:06.237 --> 00:19:09.073
prototype that we're going to 
demo is going to live here in 

00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:15.521
our experiments page.  
           Okay.  So LC Labs.  

00:19:15.522 --> 00:19:18.365
Who are we?  Where did we come 
from?  Two years ago, a little 

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.366
over two years ago now, we were 
formed.

00:19:23.517 --> 00:19:24.742
And we hosted an event called 
Collections of Data, and we've 

00:19:24.743 --> 00:19:28.424
actually done that two years 
running.  In the point of 

00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:30.425
collections of data 

00:19:31.544 --> 00:19:33.544
was an all-day symposium talking
about 

00:19:34.612 --> 00:19:36.638
what does it mean to use data 
and cultural heritage 

00:19:36.639 --> 00:19:39.145
institutions to get the public 
to use it, what types of 

00:19:40.969 --> 00:19:43.454
possibilities are there for 
thinking about how to interact 

00:19:43.455 --> 00:19:47.099
with collections online in 
different ways.  And the first 

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.159
two years, the symposiums were 
very talky, just like I'm doing 

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.266
now.  You know, it was a lot of 
experts coming together to 

00:19:52.267 --> 00:19:55.979
discuss these really important 
issues.  But we wanted to do 

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.655
this year take a spin-off of 
collections of data and actually

00:19:59.656 --> 00:20:01.656
just build something.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.018
So that's kind of the -- I would
say in some ways this is an 

00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:07.047
unofficial third year of 
collections of data, but we're 

00:20:09.487 --> 00:20:10.724
taking all the lessons we 
learned and actually 

00:20:10.725 --> 00:20:13.186
incorporating them into the way 
that we work.  

00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:16.816
So what do I mean by collections
of data?

00:20:19.729 --> 00:20:22.314
This is an example here of a 
tutorial of how to use our API 

00:20:22.315 --> 00:20:25.483
if you were investigating our 
baseball collections which we 

00:20:25.484 --> 00:20:30.205
have many of.  So one of the 
things that we know is that 

00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:32.038
people are aware perhaps of what
an API is.  It's the underlayer 

00:20:32.039 --> 00:20:35.931
of information that's underneath
a website that you can make 

00:20:35.932 --> 00:20:39.826
calls to.  But there's some 
intimidation of what it means or

00:20:39.827 --> 00:20:41.866
how it could possibly be useful 
to someone who happens to 

00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:45.418
stumble upon our lab site.  So 
we've done a lot of work on our 

00:20:49.731 --> 00:20:51.731
site on a page called LC for 
robots of 

00:20:53.637 --> 00:20:54.457
tu fortorials for you to 
investigate our collections 

00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:56.542
through the data itself.  And I 
encourage you to look at that if

00:20:57.972 --> 00:21:04.147
you get inspired by this event. 
           This is another 

00:21:04.148 --> 00:21:06.148
example of 

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.420
collections of data.

00:21:10.725 --> 00:21:12.338
This is an example of a product 
that was built by our innovator 

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:16.663
in residence.  So this is the 
program that we started, and our

00:21:16.664 --> 00:21:18.664
current innovator in 

00:21:20.525 --> 00:21:22.564
residence is the data artist 
here Thorpe.  And the idea 

00:21:22.565 --> 00:21:25.212
behind it is to try to inspire 
people to think about 

00:21:28.495 --> 00:21:30.141
collections and how to form them
serendipitously in innovative 

00:21:30.142 --> 00:21:34.223
ways.  And underlying that is 
data.  So this example is the 

00:21:34.224 --> 00:21:37.667
library of color.  And what 
you're seeing right now is an 

00:21:41.773 --> 00:21:43.773
example of a visual collection 
where he 

00:21:45.033 --> 00:21:47.033
took information from every 
single 

00:21:48.931 --> 00:21:50.931
record from prints and 
photographs and 

00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:54.624
essentially compared this to -- 
took words that you could 

00:21:56.451 --> 00:21:58.519
extrapolate to color and then 
visualized those colors into a 

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.520
rainbow.  And this is a 
screenshot.

00:22:05.131 --> 00:22:07.384
But if you were to use the 
strap- drop-down and look at our

00:22:07.385 --> 00:22:11.460
collection visualized in color, 
you'd essentially see blue and 

00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:13.461
black because it turns out a lot
of titles of books tend to 

00:22:15.182 --> 00:22:17.182
represent darkness or the ocean 
or something like that.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.145
So you can actually, I think, 
intuitively work your way 

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:22.146
through the 

00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:25.831
collections and start to 
extrapolate 

00:22:29.363 --> 00:22:31.227
some theories around formats and
titles, plus it's just 

00:22:31.228 --> 00:22:34.289
beautiful, which is also fun and
valid in its own right.  

00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:40.224
This is another take on 
exploring the library by color. 

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:42.488
This is an experiment that 
exists on our experiments page 

00:22:42.489 --> 00:22:44.489
that was made by 

00:22:46.773 --> 00:22:48.426
Laura Rubel who was a software 
librarian residence with us at 

00:22:48.427 --> 00:22:51.944
LC Labs.  What you're seeing is 
one of our photograph 

00:22:51.945 --> 00:22:54.590
collections extrapolated into 
color palettes so each of these 

00:22:54.591 --> 00:22:58.069
swatches of color represents one
item.  And if you were to click 

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.782
on it, you'd jump back to our 
lc.gov collection and be able to

00:23:01.783 --> 00:23:05.067
explore that item.  And she did 
visualize the baseball card 

00:23:05.068 --> 00:23:07.068
collection.  So if you're 
curious about seeing 

00:23:10.377 --> 00:23:11.995
that, I would suggest you go 
onto our experiments site and 

00:23:11.996 --> 00:23:14.869
look at the baseball one because
it's incredibly beautiful and 

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.537
colorful.  Okay.

00:23:22.812 --> 00:23:25.058
So I've talked a little bit 
about how we've had people come 

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:27.059
to the library to work with us 
to experiment with our 

00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:28.732
collections and our data in new 
ways to get the public 

00:23:28.733 --> 00:23:30.733
interested.

00:23:32.567 --> 00:23:36.703
This was a different angle of 
trying to do that.  We 

00:23:36.704 --> 00:23:40.622
essentially wanted a wide swath 
of people to create.  And so we 

00:23:40.623 --> 00:23:44.918
hosted a challenge called the 
congressional data challenge.  

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:46.961
And the point of it was to get 
people to produce some type of 

00:23:46.962 --> 00:23:48.962
application or 

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:56.135
tool with legislative data on 
congress.above.gov.  We had two 

00:23:56.136 --> 00:24:00.199
winners.  We had 17 entries.  
They were all pretty stellar.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.460
And these two high schoolers, 
Allen 

00:24:07.385 --> 00:24:09.249
Gomez Tagle and Carter Neilsen 
who will be here next week to 

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.250
get an award in person won the 
first place prize.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.201
So we ended up having our first 
and second place winners being 

00:24:16.202 --> 00:24:21.727
high school students out of all 
17, which was amazing and also 

00:24:21.728 --> 00:24:24.589
made us really hopeful that the 
future is looking bright, that 

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
there are people who are really 

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.128
interested in taking our 
collections and creating things 

00:24:31.129 --> 00:24:33.419
out of them in a way that's very
active, and that's definitely 

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.522
what we want to see.  
           So you can look at 

00:24:38.523 --> 00:24:42.192
all the other apps through 
challenge.gov.  There's 12 that 

00:24:42.193 --> 00:24:44.448
were submitted publicly.  Carter
and Allen's is up there, the 

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:49.371
U.S. treaties explorer, but 
there's a bunch of other ones.  

00:24:49.372 --> 00:24:50.812
So if you are interested in the 
data, I encourage you to take a 

00:24:50.813 --> 00:24:52.813
look.

00:24:53.864 --> 00:24:57.569
Okay.  So where we're going, 
what does this have to do with 

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:02.062
this week?  So collections of 
data essentially doing it 

00:25:02.063 --> 00:25:03.691
instead of just talking about 
it, we were really inspired by 

00:25:03.692 --> 00:25:07.152
the baseball Americana 
collection because baseball has 

00:25:07.153 --> 00:25:09.153
a lot of stuff.  There's a lot 
of data.

00:25:12.151 --> 00:25:14.836
It's also a topic that has a 
very wide reach.  And so we 

00:25:14.837 --> 00:25:16.837
thought it would be a way to get
enthusiasts and members of the 

00:25:18.757 --> 00:25:20.026
general public thinking about 
what we're obsessed with, which 

00:25:20.027 --> 00:25:22.027
is data.  

00:25:24.123 --> 00:25:25.967
So JSTOR Labs approached us, 
wanted to play ball with us, 

00:25:25.968 --> 00:25:28.835
wanted to do something.  And, 
you know, we thought, oh, why 

00:25:30.463 --> 00:25:31.962
don't we do something around 
baseball collections.  That's 

00:25:31.963 --> 00:25:33.963
something that we could 
definitely do together.

00:25:36.684 --> 00:25:38.518
So we essentially are being led 
by JSTOR through this effort 

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:41.394
this week.  They are 
facilitating us through the 

00:25:43.446 --> 00:25:45.072
first data jam that we did as a 
team, through the first 

00:25:45.073 --> 00:25:47.510
flash-build we did as a team.  
But we're also competing with 

00:25:47.511 --> 00:25:51.164
each other because we're both 
going to demo our own tools that

00:25:51.165 --> 00:25:53.165
we've been working on 
separately.  Let's just be real.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.200
It's what's happening.

00:25:58.529 --> 00:26:00.556
And so it's been really 
fantastic to learn from them.  

00:26:00.557 --> 00:26:02.398
This is not their first rodeo.  
They've done this with a bunch 

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:05.299
of other cultural heritage 
institutions and it's really 

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.604
been fantastic.  
           Another partner -- or

00:26:11.231 --> 00:26:12.842
collaborator of ours this week 
is the National Museum of 

00:26:12.843 --> 00:26:15.918
African-American History and 
Culture.  So although they 

00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:17.919
haven't been with us kind of 
sweating it out over keyboards 

00:26:19.384 --> 00:26:21.429
for the past four days, they've 
been working with us for the 

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.430
past several 

00:26:25.523 --> 00:26:27.347
months to essentially combine 
some of their baseball digital 

00:26:27.348 --> 00:26:29.348
collections with 

00:26:31.034 --> 00:26:33.274
the library ofLibrary of 
Congress'.  Not to give too much

00:26:33.275 --> 00:26:37.194
away, but the demo that the team
worked on this week is going to 

00:26:37.195 --> 00:26:39.437
let you kind of seamlessly view 
National Museum of 

00:26:39.438 --> 00:26:41.438
African-American 

00:26:42.488 --> 00:26:43.719
History and Culture baseball 
items with Library of Congress 

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.720
items, so it's really, really 
special.  

00:26:47.383 --> 00:26:49.383
And that is what you see here.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.516
So this is an exercise in love 
because when you're talking 

00:26:54.517 --> 00:26:56.983
about bringing data together, 
it's really a negotiation of, 

00:26:58.406 --> 00:27:00.474
you know, what is valuable to 
you in your institution and how 

00:27:00.475 --> 00:27:03.514
you show your collections.  So 
this is, I think, one of the 

00:27:03.515 --> 00:27:05.515
best resources that's going to 
come out of this event.

00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:12.325
This was the data jam that we 
did.  And the whole purpose of 

00:27:12.326 --> 00:27:14.980
this slide is essentially to say
that there's a lot of people 

00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:16.981
behind the scenes that worked on
this.

00:27:18.865 --> 00:27:20.865
We had curators from our 
photographs and prints division.

00:27:23.003 --> 00:27:25.650
We had baseball researchers.  
And then, of course, our LC labs

00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:28.927
team and JSTOR.  It was a full 
house of people trying to figure

00:27:28.928 --> 00:27:30.171
out how to build things that 
would get researchers 

00:27:30.172 --> 00:27:34.690
interested.  
           They don't know I put

00:27:34.691 --> 00:27:38.169
this slide in.  Another thing 
that was really wonderful about 

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.213
this is that the LC labs team 
got to work hand in hand with 

00:27:40.214 --> 00:27:42.214
Chris 

00:27:43.677 --> 00:27:45.717
addAdams and a designer.  And we
got to build this tool together 

00:27:46.924 --> 00:27:49.007
which usually doesn't happen.  
We kind of, you know, work in 

00:27:49.008 --> 00:27:52.485
silos and a project gets passed 
around.  But it was awesome to 

00:27:52.486 --> 00:27:54.486
see everyone's expertise play 
out in realtime.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.664
So this is Griff drawing a very 
small preview of what you're 

00:27:59.665 --> 00:28:01.697
going to see later wire frame of
our application that we built.

00:28:07.849 --> 00:28:10.134
So hopefully that set the stage 
a little bit.  I wanted to make 

00:28:10.135 --> 00:28:12.607
sure everyone was aware in how 
much work has gone into the 

00:28:13.028 --> 00:28:17.298
work.  For LC Labs, if you're 
interested in any of the 

00:28:17.299 --> 00:28:19.299
experiments that I shared with 
you or you want more information

00:28:20.155 --> 00:28:21.567
about the congressional data 
challenge or other challenges 

00:28:21.568 --> 00:28:23.568
that might be coming 

00:28:25.678 --> 00:28:27.678
up, you can e-mail us at 
NDI@LSC.

00:28:28.984 --> 00:28:31.456
gov, follow us on Twitter 
@LClabs, follow us on our 

00:28:31.457 --> 00:28:37.786
listserv or go to our website.  
Okay.  So that's it for me.  So 

00:28:37.787 --> 00:28:40.010
now I'm going to pass it off to 
a collaborator that I just 

00:28:40.011 --> 00:28:42.011
mentioned, the National Museum 
of African-American 

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.340
History and Culture's museum 
specialist, 

00:28:50.626 --> 00:28:52.626
Courtney Belize and Emily Hough.

00:28:55.345 --> 00:28:57.345
[ Applause ] 

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.836
&gt;&gt; Good morning.  I'm Emily, and
this is Courtney.

00:29:11.171 --> 00:29:13.171
And we're part of the 
digitization 

00:29:14.861 --> 00:29:15.062
team at the museum of 
African-American History and 

00:29:15.063 --> 00:29:19.125
Culture.  Our team catalogs the 
museum's objects, digitizes them

00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:23.388
and helps make the collection 
information accessible and 

00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:25.389
discoverable for both users 
inside 

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:28.898
the museum and outside the 
museum.  And today we're going 

00:29:28.899 --> 00:29:30.899
to talk to you a 

00:29:32.027 --> 00:29:34.068
little bit about the objects 
that we featured in this dataset

00:29:34.069 --> 00:29:38.143
for this project and how we 
cataloged them and walk through 

00:29:38.144 --> 00:29:42.659
the data points together.  
           The goal of the 

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.660
museum is to present American 
history through an 

00:29:47.004 --> 00:29:50.301
African-American lens and what 
is more American than baseball? 

00:29:50.302 --> 00:29:52.328
Although we knew the sport of 
baseball plays a significant 

00:29:52.329 --> 00:29:56.432
role in the exhibition sports 
leveling the playing field, and 

00:29:56.433 --> 00:29:58.715
we're familiar with some of our 
baseball objects, we hadn't 

00:29:58.716 --> 00:30:00.716
really 

00:30:02.391 --> 00:30:04.453
ever done a deep dive into the 
-- our baseball-related holdings

00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:08.167
until we did this project.  Once
we pulled the data together and 

00:30:10.207 --> 00:30:12.318
began looking at the various 
subjects and object types that 

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:17.051
connect with the term baseball, 
we were not surprised to see 

00:30:17.052 --> 00:30:19.052
that America's favorite sport 
appears all the way through our 

00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:23.181
collection from Jim Crow's 
segregation in Mississippi to 

00:30:23.182 --> 00:30:27.282
the early days of hip-hop in New
York City.  

00:30:29.722 --> 00:30:31.557
Looking at the numbers within 
the dataset, we have baseball 

00:30:31.558 --> 00:30:33.558
objects 

00:30:34.613 --> 00:30:36.663
from 22 states including -- and 
the district of ColumbiaDistrict

00:30:36.664 --> 00:30:38.757
of Columbia, 16% of our objects 
are from 

00:30:42.448 --> 00:30:44.287
New York city 1/, and 8% of our 
baseball-related objects also 

00:30:44.288 --> 00:30:46.321
have stories to tell about the 
American South.

00:30:52.388 --> 00:30:54.388
If we compare types of objects, 
8% are 

00:30:55.657 --> 00:30:58.102
items of clothing like jerseys 
and hats.  30% are part of the 

00:30:58.103 --> 00:31:00.103
class of objects 

00:31:03.583 --> 00:31:05.583
we call memorabilia and, things 
like 

00:31:06.855 --> 00:31:08.855
tickets, programs, pennants, 
pin-back buttons and autographs.

00:31:10.126 --> 00:31:12.408
The most well-represented class 
of objects are photographs and 

00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:17.353
images, making up 44% of the 
dataset.  

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.052
Analyzing the subject terms 
connected to baseball, a 

00:31:22.053 --> 00:31:24.053
remarkable 34% 

00:31:25.942 --> 00:31:27.990
of our collection -- baseball 
collection, have stories related

00:31:27.991 --> 00:31:29.991
to 

00:31:31.667 --> 00:31:33.919
segregation like this 1920s Wolf
sweater for the Eastern Colored 

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.920
League.

00:31:36.968 --> 00:31:38.635
And 4% of our objects are 
related to musicians such as 

00:31:38.636 --> 00:31:40.636
this Texas Rangers 

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.151
uniform worn by Charlie Pride.  
Before he became one of country 

00:31:46.809 --> 00:31:47.626
music's most successful artists 
ever, Pride was a baseball 

00:31:47.627 --> 00:31:52.785
player.  He was a pitcher for 
the Memphis Red Sox and other 

00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:55.221
Negro league teams before he 
ever kissed an angel good 

00:31:55.222 --> 00:31:59.351
morning.  Pride is now part 
owner of the Texas Rangers and 

00:31:59.352 --> 00:32:01.352
at 84 years old, still trains 
with them every spring.

00:32:03.705 --> 00:32:07.811
           We're able to connect
baseball across various 

00:32:07.812 --> 00:32:10.065
collections and subject areas 
because we're committed to 

00:32:11.486 --> 00:32:13.486
consistent cataloging throughout
our 

00:32:16.221 --> 00:32:17.849
collection using the same 
standards, vocabularies and 

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.850
approach regardless of 
department.

00:32:21.098 --> 00:32:22.521
This allows us to tie together 
thematics reds that appear 

00:32:22.522 --> 00:32:25.792
throughout the collection.  
Things like identity, 

00:32:25.793 --> 00:32:29.072
resistance, connection and joy. 
Starting with baseball, we can 

00:32:29.073 --> 00:32:34.174
follow the data points through 
the three pillars of history, 

00:32:34.175 --> 00:32:36.175
community and culture that form 
the collection.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.640
&gt;&gt; Good morning.  We're going to
start with our history 

00:32:46.692 --> 00:32:50.561
collections.  And since it's 
all-star week, it's only 

00:32:50.562 --> 00:32:52.562
appropriate to start with a 

00:32:53.646 --> 00:32:56.278
collection object that harkens 
back to the beginning.  This 

00:32:56.279 --> 00:32:59.147
pennant from about 1933 
celebrates the Negro league's 

00:32:59.148 --> 00:33:01.148
east/west all-star game.

00:33:03.028 --> 00:33:05.708
The Negro leagues established in
1885 gave African-American 

00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:07.709
ballplayers who were not 
accepted to play in other major 

00:33:08.985 --> 00:33:10.985
and minor leagues a chance to 
play professionally.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.532
The east/west all-star game 
began in 1933, the same year 

00:33:14.533 --> 00:33:16.973
that the MLB all-star game was 
established.

00:33:21.489 --> 00:33:23.489
The game was generated to start 
as a 

00:33:25.208 --> 00:33:28.471
way for the owners to generate 
money essentially.  But the game

00:33:28.472 --> 00:33:32.192
became so much more.  It was a 
way to help legitimize the Negro

00:33:32.193 --> 00:33:34.688
league teams and the 
African-American professional 

00:33:34.689 --> 00:33:37.783
baseball players.  The game was 
the sporting event for 

00:33:38.191 --> 00:33:40.191
African-Americans.

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:43.252
Celebrities like Count Bessie, 
Ella 

00:33:44.975 --> 00:33:46.388
Fitzgerald, Joe Louis and Lena 
Horne threw out the first pitch 

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:49.098
of the first all-star game.  
Though they were celebrated, 

00:33:49.099 --> 00:33:53.386
they still stood as a stark 
reminder that professional 

00:33:53.387 --> 00:33:54.838
baseball, like many aspects of 
American society, was 

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:59.137
segregated.  When we look at the
data points, the term 

00:33:59.138 --> 00:34:00.585
segregation is used to convey 
this very important aspect of 

00:34:00.586 --> 00:34:04.916
history.  The term also links us
to our next object, a poster 

00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:09.864
about the integration of the 
Detroit Tigers.  Nicely and 

00:34:09.865 --> 00:34:11.865
seamlessly done.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.139
In 1947, Jackie Robinson steps 
onto 

00:34:17.414 --> 00:34:20.678
the field to play for the brook 
LingBrooklyn dodgers.  In 1958 

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.544
the Detroit Tigers were the 
second to last team to 

00:34:22.545 --> 00:34:28.259
integrate.  When Ozzy Virgil Sr.
joined the team.  He was born in

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.260
the Dominican republic and was 
the first person of African 

00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:33.951
descent to join the Tigers and 
was also the first Dominican to 

00:34:33.952 --> 00:34:35.952
play in MLB.

00:34:38.434 --> 00:34:40.481
On June 6th, 1958, Virgil went 5
for 5 in his debut with the 

00:34:40.482 --> 00:34:44.766
Tigers.  And despite occurring 
more than ten years after 

00:34:44.767 --> 00:34:46.767
Robinson's first game, the 

00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:50.087
integration of the Tigers was 
still met with protest from 

00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:54.586
staunch segregationists 
including Detroit city council 

00:34:54.587 --> 00:34:57.036
member Billy Regell.  He was 
also a former shortstop for the 

00:34:57.452 --> 00:34:59.452
Tigers.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:04.797
He opposed Virgil's point 
appointment to the team.  This 

00:35:04.798 --> 00:35:06.634
poster sends a clear message 
about his policies and beliefs 

00:35:06.635 --> 00:35:10.514
and gives us a glimpse into race
relations in the city of Detroit

00:35:10.515 --> 00:35:13.761
in 1958.  As you can see, 
several subjects have been 

00:35:13.762 --> 00:35:16.141
attributed to this object 
including segregation, civil 

00:35:16.142 --> 00:35:19.219
rights and race relations.  
Using the term race relations, 

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.220
we can 

00:35:22.316 --> 00:35:24.975
move to our next related be on 
object type, a magazine from 

00:35:24.976 --> 00:35:26.976
1960 featuring notable 
African-American athletes.  

00:35:29.042 --> 00:35:30.455
As professional sports became 
integrated, African-American 

00:35:30.456 --> 00:35:33.538
athletes soon became household 
names.  Though African-American 

00:35:33.539 --> 00:35:36.797
athletes became mainstream, they
were still viewed as other.

00:35:42.122 --> 00:35:44.769
As evidenced by this issue of 
sportSport magazine.  The title 

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:49.067
is "sports: Special issue."   
The Negro in American sports.  

00:35:49.068 --> 00:35:50.700
And it still conveys this idea 
that African-American athletes 

00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:52.701
needed to be looked at 
separately from their white 

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:58.065
counterparts.  The term race 
relations was used for this 

00:35:58.066 --> 00:36:00.132
object because sports magazine 
was founded in 1946 and was one 

00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:03.786
of the first national sports 
publications and serves as an 

00:36:03.787 --> 00:36:05.787
example of how African-American 

00:36:09.265 --> 00:36:12.513
athlete s 'as' achievemented 
were covered.  It included wilt 

00:36:12.514 --> 00:36:17.635
Chamberlain, Willie Mays, Gibson
and Jackie Robinson.  From a 

00:36:17.636 --> 00:36:19.636
data perspective, all of these 
athletes become subjects of the 

00:36:21.123 --> 00:36:22.537
collection objects so that this 
object appears when any of the 

00:36:22.538 --> 00:36:24.538
aforementioned names are 
searched.

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:27.867
Let us look at the data point 
Jackie Robinson to move along to

00:36:27.868 --> 00:36:32.356
our next dataset.  
           Our next set of 

00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:34.357
objects focus 

00:36:35.477 --> 00:36:37.505
around NMHC's collection theme 
of community.  Using the subject

00:36:37.506 --> 00:36:41.029
term Jackie Robinson in a search
of our internal databases brings

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.493
up a variety of objects 
including a ring, magazines and 

00:36:43.494 --> 00:36:47.552
photographs.  The collection 
objects span different aspects 

00:36:47.553 --> 00:36:49.830
of Robinson's career not only as
a baseball player but as a 

00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:54.134
family man and activist who 
impacted both baseball and 

00:36:54.135 --> 00:36:58.228
African-American communities.  
           For instance, let's 

00:36:58.229 --> 00:37:02.912
take a look at this photograph 
from 1954 of Jackie Robinson and

00:37:02.913 --> 00:37:06.944
Harry Owens.  Here Robinson is 
out of uniform, receiving a 

00:37:06.945 --> 00:37:09.584
lifetime membership award to the
Irene Kaufman settlement house 

00:37:09.585 --> 00:37:13.491
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for
his charity work.  The 

00:37:13.492 --> 00:37:15.492
photograph was taken by a 

00:37:16.555 --> 00:37:18.555
community photographer named 
Charles Harris.

00:37:20.462 --> 00:37:22.092
Harris was had a connection to 
baseball, actually, because he 

00:37:22.093 --> 00:37:24.093
helped 

00:37:26.214 --> 00:37:28.051
found and was a player for the 
Crawford Colored Giants who 

00:37:28.052 --> 00:37:30.307
later became the Pittsburgh 
Crawfords.  There's another 

00:37:30.308 --> 00:37:33.573
little baseball connection in 
there.  But Harris was known as 

00:37:33.574 --> 00:37:37.669
one shot, not in a reference to 
his baseball career, but in 

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.899
reference to his photography.  
He was -- his photography mainly

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:44.797
focused on the Hill District, 
which is an African-American 

00:37:44.798 --> 00:37:49.506
community in Pittsburgh, and his
more than 80,000 images provide 

00:37:49.507 --> 00:37:50.941
one of the most complete 
documentations of a minority 

00:37:50.942 --> 00:37:54.203
community in the United States. 
           When cataloging this 

00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:58.069
photograph, it's important that 
the data 

00:38:00.145 --> 00:38:03.042
not only leads ss researchers to
Jackie Robinson but also to 

00:38:03.043 --> 00:38:05.872
Teenie Harris, the notable 
community photographer.  Using 

00:38:05.873 --> 00:38:07.873
another data point from this 

00:38:09.793 --> 00:38:12.461
object, the date, 1954, it will 
lead us to another photograph 

00:38:12.462 --> 00:38:14.462
taken by another 

00:38:15.719 --> 00:38:17.719
community photographer, Ernest 
C. Withers.

00:38:20.646 --> 00:38:24.320
Around 1954, Withers took this 
portrait of Connie Morgan.  

00:38:24.321 --> 00:38:26.321
Withers documented 
African-American 

00:38:27.636 --> 00:38:30.724
communities in the segregated 
South for 60 years.  Morgan was 

00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:31.936
the third woman to play 
professional baseball in the 

00:38:31.937 --> 00:38:36.432
Negro league.  She joined the 
Indianapolis crowns in 1954 as a

00:38:36.433 --> 00:38:38.433
second baseman and was 

00:38:40.295 --> 00:38:42.295
replaced the first woman who 
joined the 

00:38:44.227 --> 00:38:46.666
league, Tony stoneStone.  Many 
saw women having join the teams 

00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:50.325
as a gimmick increased sales 
after integration with MLB, many

00:38:50.326 --> 00:38:53.427
journalists who every coed the 
leagues often wrote about the 

00:38:53.428 --> 00:38:55.428
women's skill and talent as 
players.

00:38:57.495 --> 00:38:59.495
For example, an article covering
the 

00:39:00.996 --> 00:39:02.996
Clowns' game on May 29th, 1954, 
featured 

00:39:04.726 --> 00:39:06.554
in the Afro-American, quote, 
Morgan electrified over 6,000 

00:39:06.555 --> 00:39:08.555
fans when she went far to her 
right to make a 

00:39:13.105 --> 00:39:15.579
sensational stop, flipped to 
stop shortstop and started a 

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.698
lightning double play against 
Birmingham.  End quote.  The 

00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:21.604
great double play excited this 
large community of fans.  And 

00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:23.438
what we found that's so 
prevalent throughout our 

00:39:23.439 --> 00:39:27.754
museum's baseball collections is
the tie to community.  This time

00:39:27.755 --> 00:39:29.755
let us turn to the object 

00:39:30.816 --> 00:39:33.283
type portraits to see how this 
portrait of Morgan can link us 

00:39:33.284 --> 00:39:35.344
to another object reflecting 
community within the museum's 

00:39:35.565 --> 00:39:37.565
collections.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.747
&gt;&gt; The object type portraits 
brings us to the collection of 

00:39:42.748 --> 00:39:46.849
the photographer the reverend 
Henry C. Anderson.  Anderson was

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:48.850
the local portrait 

00:39:49.924 --> 00:39:52.790
photographer in Greenville, 
Mississippi, from 1947 through 

00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:56.693
the 1970s.  Nearly every member 
of the black community of 

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.694
Greenville had their portrait 
taken by Anderson at one point 

00:39:58.939 --> 00:40:00.939
or another.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.245
Anderson documented all aspects 
of Greenville's family and 

00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:06.678
community life during Jim Crow 
segregation including 

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.473
new babies, birthdays, weddings,
anniversaries, graduations, 

00:40:12.474 --> 00:40:16.972
church groups, community clubs 
and, of course, the Little 

00:40:16.973 --> 00:40:18.973
League teams like this one here.

00:40:21.088 --> 00:40:22.518
So we've just seen how our 
subject terms can take us 

00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:24.754
through several community 
photographers.

00:40:27.889 --> 00:40:29.711
But if we use the classification
media arts photography where all

00:40:29.712 --> 00:40:32.405
of our photographs and images 
are grouped 

00:40:36.302 --> 00:40:38.759
under, we can expand and find 
the collection of hip-hop 

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.818
photography where perhaps 
surprisingly we also find 

00:40:41.453 --> 00:40:43.453
baseball.

00:40:47.424 --> 00:40:49.424
This leads us to the culture 
section of our objects.

00:40:53.423 --> 00:40:55.423
In this photograph of KRS1 taken
by Al 

00:40:57.297 --> 00:40:59.573
Pereira in 1991, the rapper 
sports the iconic pinstripes of 

00:40:59.574 --> 00:41:01.574
the New York Yankees.

00:41:03.554 --> 00:41:05.798
KRS1 is an influential emcee 
from the South Bronx.  He 

00:41:05.799 --> 00:41:07.799
started his career as part of 
the 

00:41:09.296 --> 00:41:10.921
duo Boogie Down Productions 
before going solo after the 

00:41:10.922 --> 00:41:13.763
shooting death of his partner, 
DJ Scott la rock.

00:41:17.506 --> 00:41:19.341
And being from the South Bronx, 
KRS1's affinity for Yankees gear

00:41:19.342 --> 00:41:24.664
signifies his ties to the 
birthplace of hip-hop.  Using 

00:41:24.665 --> 00:41:27.114
athleticwear and baseball teams 
in particular in this way is a 

00:41:27.115 --> 00:41:29.115
common 

00:41:30.646 --> 00:41:33.497
style for hip-hop stars like 
KRS1.  And if we follow the term

00:41:33.498 --> 00:41:37.359
hip-hop, we'll see another 
example.  

00:41:39.003 --> 00:41:41.259
This is perhaps the supreme 
example of the intersections of 

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:46.835
baseball, music and fashion, the
iconic baseball cap.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.700
I learned recently, yesterday, 
that 

00:41:52.179 --> 00:41:54.855
baseball historians credit Tom 
Selleck with popularizing the 

00:41:54.856 --> 00:41:59.138
off-the-field baseball cap trend
in the 1970s.  But I think we 

00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:01.139
can all agree that 

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.316
hip-hop is largely responsible 
for the longevity of the trend. 

00:42:06.317 --> 00:42:08.317
This purple Atlanta Braves cap 
from 

00:42:12.035 --> 00:42:13.448
the rapper bigBig Boi was made 
by the preeminent manufacturer 

00:42:13.449 --> 00:42:15.449
of baseball caps 

00:42:16.841 --> 00:42:21.320
newNew Era Cap Company which has
been making caps since 1920.  

00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:23.321
This particular hat was a 
limited 

00:42:25.503 --> 00:42:28.150
release in 2013 in conjunction 
with Big Boi's solo album, 

00:42:28.151 --> 00:42:30.151
vicious lies and dangerous 
rumors.

00:42:32.257 --> 00:42:34.257
In early June 2013, fans who 
attended 

00:42:36.818 --> 00:42:38.256
a CD signing by Big Boi at the 
New Era store in Atlanta also 

00:42:38.257 --> 00:42:40.709
received this limited-edition 
hat inspired by the album.

00:42:45.397 --> 00:42:47.040
Big Boi and Outkast is known as 
the group that brought southern 

00:42:47.041 --> 00:42:49.041
hip-hop into 

00:42:51.476 --> 00:42:53.476
the mainstream and Big Boi is 
seldom 

00:42:54.863 --> 00:42:56.495
seen without his signature 
Braves cap to rep his hometown 

00:42:56.496 --> 00:42:59.955
of Atlanta.  This hat has the 
subclassification clothing 

00:42:59.956 --> 00:43:04.621
fashion.  But if we follow the 
main class clothing or the 

00:43:04.622 --> 00:43:06.622
subject term clothing and dress,
we end up back in the 

00:43:10.381 --> 00:43:12.381
traditional world of baseball 
with This 

00:43:13.864 --> 00:43:18.596
Cardinals jersey that was game 
born by Curt Flood in '66.  He 

00:43:18.597 --> 00:43:21.467
was an all-star player and a 
center fielder for The 

00:43:21.468 --> 00:43:23.468
Cardinals, he won Gold 

00:43:24.516 --> 00:43:29.237
Glove seven consecutive seasons 
from 1963 to 1969.  And during 

00:43:29.238 --> 00:43:31.238
Flood's 11 seasons on the 

00:43:32.497 --> 00:43:35.003
team, the Cards won three 
pennants and earned two World 

00:43:35.004 --> 00:43:37.004
Series rings.  When Flood 
refused to accept a trade 

00:43:40.513 --> 00:43:42.173
away from The Cardinals in 1969,
his talents to the reserve 

00:43:42.174 --> 00:43:44.871
clause helped usher in the free 
agency system which 

00:43:47.951 --> 00:43:50.420
was transformative for the 
culture of baseball.  Flood 

00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:52.857
wrote a letter to the baseball 
commissioner reading, "after 12 

00:43:52.858 --> 00:43:54.858
years in 

00:43:55.953 --> 00:43:58.605
the major leagues, I do not feel
I am a piece of property to be 

00:43:58.606 --> 00:44:02.285
bought and sold irrespective of 
my wishes.  I believe that any 

00:44:02.286 --> 00:44:07.000
system which produces that 
result violates my basic rights 

00:44:07.001 --> 00:44:09.438
as a citizen and is inconsistent
with the laws of the United 

00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:11.439
States and of the several 
states.

00:44:14.788 --> 00:44:17.229
"   Flood's subsequent lawsuit 
against majorMajor League 

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.708
Baseball was unsuccessfully 
argued in front of the Supreme 

00:44:21.709 --> 00:44:23.709
Court in 1972 which sided with 
the league.

00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:28.001
But it eventually led to the end
of 

00:44:29.463 --> 00:44:31.702
the reserve system a few years 
later.  

00:44:36.955 --> 00:44:39.083
26 years later with the Kurt 
Curt Flood Act congress declared

00:44:41.555 --> 00:44:43.555
baseball subject to antitrust 
laws like any other corporation.

00:44:45.876 --> 00:44:47.695
Flood is also responsible for 
the 10-5 rule which is also 

00:44:47.696 --> 00:44:49.696
known as the Curt 

00:44:50.781 --> 00:44:52.211
Flood rule that states when a 
player has played for a team for

00:44:52.212 --> 00:44:55.694
five straight years and played 
in the major leagues for a total

00:44:55.695 --> 00:44:57.952
of ten years, they have to give 
the club their consent to be 

00:44:57.953 --> 00:44:59.953
traded.

00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:04.659
Although Flood's legacy is 
larger than 

00:45:07.393 --> 00:45:09.393
the time he spent playing with 
The card 

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.160
the Cardinals, our final object,
many roundtree radio.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.385
Roundtree was a diehard fan 
living in Gibson County, 

00:45:23.386 --> 00:45:25.386
Indiana.

00:45:28.907 --> 00:45:31.329
Her husband, Herman, bought her 
this radio to listen to the 

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.415
games and keep up with her 
favorite team.  The story is a 

00:45:34.416 --> 00:45:38.892
favorite of mine because she 
reminds me of my own grandmother

00:45:38.893 --> 00:45:40.893
who at 94 years old never misses
a Cardinals game.

00:45:45.408 --> 00:45:48.664
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for taking the 
little journey through our 

00:45:48.665 --> 00:45:50.665
collections.  And it's just a 
small sample of the 

00:45:54.442 --> 00:45:57.122
collections that we shared for 
the event with LLC.  As this 

00:45:57.123 --> 00:45:58.745
graphic shows, by following a 
variety of data points, we've 

00:45:58.746 --> 00:46:02.602
been able to share and explore 
this group of baseball-related 

00:46:02.603 --> 00:46:05.865
collections from the Negro 
leagues to hip-hop.  We were 

00:46:05.866 --> 00:46:08.316
able to connect each object 
based on a set of terms, 

00:46:08.317 --> 00:46:11.596
classifications and cataloging 
fields.  However, we could have 

00:46:11.597 --> 00:46:15.104
utilized a totally different set
of terms and data points to come

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:18.786
up with a totally different set 
of objects.  That's the exciting

00:46:18.787 --> 00:46:20.787
part about our 

00:46:22.251 --> 00:46:24.334
collaboration with LLC and JSTOR
and the flash-build team who 

00:46:24.335 --> 00:46:27.807
have taken a deep dive into our 
data.  What is important is that

00:46:27.808 --> 00:46:31.952
the data is consistent and 
clean.  And so that way people 

00:46:31.953 --> 00:46:36.274
can utilize it in ways that we 
can't even imagine.  On behalf 

00:46:36.275 --> 00:46:38.275
of Emily and myself, we 

00:46:39.316 --> 00:46:41.979
would like to thank our 
digitizeation team, the 

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.011
catalogers who painstakingly 
make sure our records are 

00:46:44.012 --> 00:46:46.012
accurate and consistent, the 
curators who review all 

00:46:49.757 --> 00:46:51.589
of our records, Doug, Laura, 
Elaine and Damian, sports 

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:54.853
curator, for their support on 
this project.  The team at 

00:46:54.854 --> 00:46:56.854
Library of Congress, 

00:46:59.997 --> 00:47:02.449
especially Julia hick Hickey, 
and the team at JSTOR and, 

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.319
again, the flash-build team who 
worked all this week and 

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.158
participated in this great 
event.  Thank you for having us,

00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:09.159
and I hope you enjoy the rest of
your day.  

00:47:11.793 --> 00:47:13.793
[ Applause ] 

00:47:21.634 --> 00:47:24.751
&gt;&gt; All right.  Thanks so much to
the team.

00:47:28.662 --> 00:47:30.662
Next we have Alex Humphries from
JSTOR 

00:47:31.923 --> 00:47:33.957
Labs who's going to come up and 
share about what their wonderful

00:47:33.958 --> 00:47:38.059
team is and what they've been up
to.  And you'll see the first 

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.060
demo, hopefully.  

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.720
[ Laughter ] 

00:47:47.433 --> 00:47:52.363
&gt;&gt; I don't get to see the 
presentation.  Or I do from a 

00:47:52.364 --> 00:47:54.603
very strange vantage point.  Hi,
everybody.  I'm Alec Humphries.

00:47:59.268 --> 00:48:01.268
I'm the director of JSTOR Labs

00:48:02.786 --> 00:48:05.018
.  And I want to start just by 
thanking the Library of Congress

00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:07.019
for being such 

00:48:08.675 --> 00:48:10.675
amazing hosts and going on this 
very 

00:48:12.178 --> 00:48:14.178
quick adventure with us.  A lot 
of things happen in a week, and 

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.086
they have been so supportive and
eager and at every step along 

00:48:19.087 --> 00:48:23.811
the way just wanted to jump in 
with both feet and do.  And we 

00:48:23.812 --> 00:48:25.856
find in our team that learning 
by doing is just the best 

00:48:25.857 --> 00:48:29.356
possible way.  And we'll share, 
as we go, some of the things 

00:48:29.357 --> 00:48:33.475
that we've learned.  
           So first, a little 

00:48:33.476 --> 00:48:35.476
bit of context just for those of
you who aren't 

00:48:39.189 --> 00:48:41.189
familiar with JSTOR or the JSTOR
Labs team.

00:48:42.863 --> 00:48:44.489
JSTOR is a part of a nonprofit 
called Ithaca which helps the 

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:46.490
academic 

00:48:47.628 --> 00:48:49.628
community embrace digital 
transformation.

00:48:51.112 --> 00:48:53.333
We have a number of different 
brands within it, dealing with 

00:48:53.334 --> 00:48:55.334
digital 

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:59.450
preservation, with art and 
strategy and research.

00:49:01.143 --> 00:49:03.143
JSTOR is a digital archive of 
academic literature primarily.

00:49:05.847 --> 00:49:07.847
So it's got 10 million articles 
and 

00:49:09.104 --> 00:49:11.104
tens of thousands of academic 
books, 

00:49:13.022 --> 00:49:15.256
spanning centuries of the 
scholarly record.  So these are 

00:49:15.257 --> 00:49:17.507
the academic journals that if 
you're writing, if you're a 

00:49:19.761 --> 00:49:20.981
scholar or writing your 
dissertation, you're doing that 

00:49:20.982 --> 00:49:25.261
research.  And you do that often
these days online with tools 

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:29.576
like JSTOR.  It's especially 
prominent in the humanities and 

00:49:29.577 --> 00:49:31.577
social sciences, and it has a 
number of -- it's 

00:49:31.652 --> 00:49:33.652
multidisciplinary.  So if you 
are anywhere within those 

00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:37.555
fields, you'll often dip into 
JSTOR.  

00:49:40.466 --> 00:49:42.906
There we go.  The JSTOR Labs 
team is a relatively 

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.640
small team within that 
organization.

00:49:51.097 --> 00:49:53.097
There's five, six, seven of us.

00:49:56.044 --> 00:49:58.044
And our job is to build 
experimental tools.

00:49:59.309 --> 00:50:02.165
And we sort of show the future 
of what research can look like. 

00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.236
We do it -- and the best way to 
see that is through some 

00:50:04.237 --> 00:50:08.044
examples which I'll walk you 
through in just a second.  We 

00:50:08.045 --> 00:50:10.934
approach all of these projects 
collaboratively.  Wherever 

00:50:10.935 --> 00:50:12.773
possible we work with partners 
like the Library of Congress 

00:50:12.774 --> 00:50:16.849
here.  And we do so openly.  So 
we share all the work that we 

00:50:17.054 --> 00:50:19.054
develop.

00:50:20.343 --> 00:50:23.273
We share the code if we can, the
content wherever copyright 

00:50:23.274 --> 00:50:25.314
allows and make that as open as 
possible.

00:50:28.385 --> 00:50:29.621
And we also do it as quickly as 
possible all the way down to 

00:50:29.622 --> 00:50:32.708
doing things in one week.  So I 
think it will be helpful just to

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:37.375
get a feel for that to see a few
of the things that we've done in

00:50:37.376 --> 00:50:41.445
the past.  These are a little 
bit more polished than what 

00:50:41.446 --> 00:50:43.446
you'll see at the end.

00:50:44.504 --> 00:50:46.504
But they'll give you a feel for 
what we've done.

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:49.839
So if we can jump to the 
browser, that would be 

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.840
wonderful.

00:50:56.993 --> 00:50:59.467
There we go.  
           Okay.  So the first 

00:50:59.468 --> 00:51:01.468
project was -- we did 

00:51:03.551 --> 00:51:06.417
this just across the street at 
the Shakespeare library, 

00:51:06.418 --> 00:51:08.418
developed maybe a couple years 
ago.

00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.297
And this is 
understandingUnderstanding 

00:51:10.298 --> 00:51:15.453
Shakespeare.  So if you're 
studying Shakespeare, it has all

00:51:15.454 --> 00:51:17.452
of the plays of Shakespeare, and
I'll go ahead and click on any 

00:51:17.453 --> 00:51:21.358
one.  It has all of the plays of
Shakespeare and all of their 

00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:24.846
cast.  And what we were trying 
to do is find a new way for 

00:51:24.847 --> 00:51:27.287
those people studying and 
writing about Shakespeare to 

00:51:27.288 --> 00:51:29.288
research that work.

00:51:31.375 --> 00:51:33.375
So you'll see this is the text 
of Hamlet.

00:51:35.872 --> 00:51:37.872
The foal library has these 
amazing 

00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:40.129
digital addition editions of 
Shakespeare which are openly 

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:44.255
available.  When we approach 
these projects, they're not sort

00:51:44.256 --> 00:51:46.277
of transactional.  They're not 
-- they're very open and 

00:51:46.696 --> 00:51:48.696
collaborative.

00:51:50.166 --> 00:51:52.610
And I describe them often as 
play dates.  You have your toys 

00:51:52.611 --> 00:51:57.088
and I have my toys and let's go 
play in that sandbox.  And their

00:51:57.089 --> 00:52:00.551
toys were these digital editions
of Shakespeare.  So if you see, 

00:52:00.552 --> 00:52:03.443
the play on the left, and that's
from Folger.

00:52:06.503 --> 00:52:08.323
If you click on one of these 
numbers, each one of those is 

00:52:08.324 --> 00:52:13.263
the number of articles in JSTOR 
that quote that specific line.  

00:52:13.264 --> 00:52:16.318
And we have that for every line 
of every play of Shakespeare.  

00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:18.772
And then if you hover over any 
of those, you can -- any of the 

00:52:18.773 --> 00:52:22.445
thumbnails, you can see how it 
quotes that article, quotes that

00:52:22.446 --> 00:52:24.711
particular line.  And if you're 
a student, it can help you 

00:52:24.712 --> 00:52:27.959
interpret it.  If you're a 
scholar, you can see how that 

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.960
line has been interpreted 
through the ages.

00:52:33.323 --> 00:52:35.767
And if you've got a digital 
humanities bent, you can -- we 

00:52:35.768 --> 00:52:37.768
have an API for this 

00:52:40.219 --> 00:52:42.484
so that you can build 
visualizations on the how 

00:52:42.485 --> 00:52:44.485
Shakespeare has been studied 

00:52:45.737 --> 00:52:47.737
and quoted through two centuries
of academic literature.  

00:52:49.428 --> 00:52:52.309
So this was -- we released a 
couple years ago.  This is the 

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:55.188
kind of tool that we build.  
This has had a really great 

00:52:55.189 --> 00:52:59.490
response.  It's now being 
included in sill buy.  Teachers 

00:52:59.491 --> 00:53:01.491
often tell us that this is a 

00:53:03.756 --> 00:53:06.395
really great way for students to
first dive into academic 

00:53:06.396 --> 00:53:08.396
literature which can 

00:53:09.867 --> 00:53:12.541
be really daunting and hard with
keyword search.  It can be -- 

00:53:12.542 --> 00:53:15.597
they're used to Google and going
to the library.  And this is a 

00:53:15.598 --> 00:53:17.598
very easy way to get into that.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.900
We're now just, to tease 
something, 

00:53:24.777 --> 00:53:26.035
we're currently, who working on 
an expansion called 

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:28.036
Understanding Great Works which 
we hope to go live later 

00:53:32.192 --> 00:53:33.421
this summer, which will be this 
same functionality but for more 

00:53:33.422 --> 00:53:35.422
than Shakespeare.

00:53:37.491 --> 00:53:39.491
It will include the kingKing 
James 

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.779
Bible as well as a selection of 
British literature that we're 

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.872
working on with the studies in 
English literature journal.  So 

00:53:45.873 --> 00:53:48.323
we're really excited about that.
And if you're interested, follow

00:53:48.324 --> 00:53:51.169
JSTOR Labs, follow me on 
Twitter, and we'll let you know.

00:53:52.601 --> 00:53:54.841
Or JSTOR.  
           So that's one tool.

00:53:57.917 --> 00:53:59.536
We built the core of this 
functionality in a previous labs

00:53:59.537 --> 00:54:04.444
week.  And then we spent a lot 
of time making it look prettier 

00:54:04.445 --> 00:54:06.097
and be a little bit more perfect
and adding the rest of the 

00:54:06.098 --> 00:54:11.400
plays.  So let's jump to another
example of something that we've 

00:54:11.401 --> 00:54:13.401
done.  Text analyzer.

00:54:16.096 --> 00:54:19.415
As I said, academic research can
be daunting and challenging.  

00:54:19.416 --> 00:54:21.416
And in various ways.

00:54:22.478 --> 00:54:25.346
And text analyzer, we envisioned
as a different way of doing 

00:54:25.347 --> 00:54:29.428
research to overcome some of the
hurdles.  So text analyzer -- so

00:54:29.429 --> 00:54:33.890
for those of you who aren't 
familiar with it, academic 

00:54:33.891 --> 00:54:35.891
research is often done through 

00:54:36.977 --> 00:54:39.650
either citation mining, meaning 
you follow bibliography one to 

00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:44.108
the next to the next or by 
keyword search like you would do

00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:46.109
in Google but in an academic 

00:54:47.429 --> 00:54:50.483
database or in something called 
Google Scholar.  But those 

00:54:50.484 --> 00:54:53.947
keywords and all of that can be 
challenging to a new student.  

00:54:53.948 --> 00:54:55.948
And if you're doing the citation
mining, you can get stuck in a 

00:54:57.835 --> 00:55:00.477
particular -- in a silo.  So 
what text analyzer does is it 

00:55:02.742 --> 00:55:04.589
changes that by instead of 
searching with words, you search

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:09.143
with a document.  So if you've 
either found an article that is 

00:55:09.144 --> 00:55:10.562
already perfect and about what 
you're writing about, or if 

00:55:10.563 --> 00:55:15.055
you've written the first draft 
of your paper, you can upload 

00:55:15.056 --> 00:55:19.343
it.  So if we can drag the 
sample document over, you just 

00:55:19.344 --> 00:55:21.344
drag and drop it over.  And what
it does is it reads the 

00:55:22.805 --> 00:55:25.240
document, and it figures out 
what the document is about.  And

00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:28.100
it does that not just by looking
at the words but the implied 

00:55:28.101 --> 00:55:32.784
words.  It uses a technology 
called natural language 

00:55:32.785 --> 00:55:34.785
processing and topic models to 

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:39.152
figure out the implied words in 
addition to the explicitly 

00:55:39.153 --> 00:55:41.817
mentioned ones.  It calls 
attention to those, tells you 

00:55:44.463 --> 00:55:46.463
what it found, suggests another 

00:55:47.512 --> 00:55:48.945
selection of them in case 
there's some that are really 

00:55:48.946 --> 00:55:50.946
important to you, and 

00:55:53.017 --> 00:55:54.645
then gives you articles and 
JSTOR articles and book chapters

00:55:54.646 --> 00:55:58.504
in JSTOR that are about the same
materials.  You can then, you 

00:55:58.505 --> 00:56:02.975
know, adjust the -- we call it 
the equalizer at the top, which 

00:56:02.976 --> 00:56:05.030
is a metaphor that probably 
nobody gets anymore.  

00:56:05.844 --> 00:56:10.709
[ Laughter ]
You can add new terms.  And then

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:14.786
when you find the articles you 
want, you can download this.  

00:56:14.787 --> 00:56:17.025
This just won an award a couple 
weeks ago, which we're really 

00:56:17.026 --> 00:56:19.682
proud about, proud of.  And this
is available right on the JSTOR 

00:56:19.683 --> 00:56:23.545
site.  All these tools that we 
build are openly available.

00:56:27.622 --> 00:56:29.036
The access to the JSTOR 
Scholarship, that will often 

00:56:29.037 --> 00:56:31.037
come through your institution.

00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:35.109
But if you're not a member of a 

00:56:36.966 --> 00:56:38.617
university or a library, much of
that content is available for 

00:56:38.618 --> 00:56:42.321
free.  Some of it with 
registration.  Some of it is 

00:56:42.322 --> 00:56:47.660
pure open access.  
           Okay.  That was the 

00:56:47.661 --> 00:56:52.568
other example of something we've
done before.  Let's get to the 

00:56:52.569 --> 00:56:55.620
fun stuff of what we actually 
did this week.  So if we can go 

00:56:55.621 --> 00:56:58.613
back to the PowerPoint. 

00:57:06.625 --> 00:57:09.082
Great.  We showed you that.  We 
showed you that.  All right.

00:57:14.622 --> 00:57:16.862
So first of all, we wanted to 
build -- we knew that we wanted 

00:57:16.863 --> 00:57:19.092
to build a tool about baseball. 
And what I'll do is I'll walk 

00:57:19.093 --> 00:57:22.582
you through the process, sort of
the story of this project.

00:57:25.864 --> 00:57:28.090
It's the story that we've been 
leading the Library of Congress 

00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:30.091
team through 

00:57:31.158 --> 00:57:33.158
this week and sort of enjoying 
that process with them.

00:57:35.196 --> 00:57:37.642
I will say every time we do 
this, it's different.  We're 

00:57:37.643 --> 00:57:41.311
learning all the time and trying
new experiments.  This is the 

00:57:41.312 --> 00:57:43.312
first time we've done sort 

00:57:44.366 --> 00:57:46.404
of the parallel play of two 
teams working evidently in 

00:57:46.405 --> 00:57:49.653
competition.  Here I thought it 
was like the all-star game where

00:57:49.654 --> 00:57:52.713
it didn't matter, and it turns 
out it's like the all-star game 

00:57:52.714 --> 00:57:55.357
where it totally matters.  
[ Laughter ] 

00:57:55.976 --> 00:57:59.870
But that's okay.  We're up for 
that.  We're up for the battle. 

00:57:59.871 --> 00:58:02.311
So let me walk you through this 
process.  This process -- we 

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:05.999
talked about it, I should say, 
as something that happens all in

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.895
one week.  It's true.  A lot of 
work goes on in that week.

00:58:12.785 --> 00:58:14.785
But you can't -- I mean, you run
a 

00:58:16.248 --> 00:58:20.514
marathon of all in one, you 
know, for me, five-hour period. 

00:58:20.515 --> 00:58:23.456
But there's a lot of work to 
prepare for these weeks.  So I 

00:58:23.457 --> 00:58:26.304
don't want to minimize all of 
that preparatory work.  That's 

00:58:26.305 --> 00:58:29.599
really important and it helps us
to run fast these weeks.  So 

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.417
I'll walk through those -- that 
process a little bit.  And then 

00:58:32.418 --> 00:58:34.648
we'll show you what we came up 
with at the other end.  

00:58:35.874 --> 00:58:38.528
Okay.  So I mentioned earlier 
when describing 

00:58:41.876 --> 00:58:43.876
the Folger -- understanding 
Shakespeare 

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:47.415
project that we treat these 
projects kind of like play 

00:58:47.416 --> 00:58:50.257
dates.  And we just decide what 
is the sandbox.

00:58:53.506 --> 00:58:56.168
When we talked to the Library of
Congress team, they suggested 

00:58:56.169 --> 00:58:58.249
organizing this around the 
baseball Americana 

00:59:01.305 --> 00:59:06.007
exhibit because baseball had so 
much interest generally.  It was

00:59:06.008 --> 00:59:08.008
multidisciplinary.

00:59:09.652 --> 00:59:11.652
And there could be a lot of 
interest 

00:59:12.723 --> 00:59:14.723
and multidisciplinary in a way 
that 

00:59:17.041 --> 00:59:17.863
aligns well with J JSTOR's 
collection.  It's really 

00:59:17.864 --> 00:59:20.527
exciting.  And I will say 
personally I'm such a baseball 

00:59:20.528 --> 00:59:23.410
nerd.  I'm so happy that we 
could do this.  There was no way

00:59:23.411 --> 00:59:26.883
that we were not doing this as 
soon as it was suggested.  This 

00:59:26.884 --> 00:59:28.949
has been so much fun, especially
to meet some of my favorite 

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:30.980
baseball writers through this 
process.  

00:59:32.421 --> 00:59:35.124
So we knew we wanted to work 
with baseball.  But what exactly

00:59:35.125 --> 00:59:38.447
were we going to do with 
baseball?  We wanted a little 

00:59:38.448 --> 00:59:40.448
bit more definition.

00:59:41.696 --> 00:59:44.574
And because the Library of 
Congress team had their content 

00:59:44.575 --> 00:59:47.621
and JSTOR had our content, and 
they're not exactly the same.  

00:59:47.622 --> 00:59:49.622
They're quite different.  And 
then when you bring in the 

00:59:51.079 --> 00:59:52.498
Smithsonian, the National Museum
of African-American History and 

00:59:52.499 --> 00:59:56.978
Culture, their content, we were 
really interested in finding 

00:59:56.979 --> 00:59:59.828
ways to bring all of that 
content together to tell a story

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:02.964
and really make it sing.  And so
we were interested in trying to 

01:00:05.613 --> 01:00:07.675
do that using linked open data, 
which I won't get into the 

01:00:07.676 --> 01:00:09.676
technology of because I'd 
probably mess that up.

01:00:12.137 --> 01:00:14.613
But linked-open data is also 
called the smart web.  It's more

01:00:14.614 --> 01:00:18.320
than just links, but it knows 
about the information.  And 

01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:20.321
we've been working through that 

01:00:22.429 --> 01:00:23.838
with Wikidata to enable that.  
So I'll show you a little bit 

01:00:23.839 --> 01:00:25.839
about what comes from that.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.288
So the idea here was multiple 
corpora, multiple collections of

01:00:32.289 --> 01:00:37.608
content and using linked open 
data to connect them.  That's 

01:00:37.609 --> 01:00:39.609
what we wanted to find a way to 
do.  

01:00:39.671 --> 01:00:41.671
I'll tell you a little bit about
the content in JSTOR and how we 

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.004
went about collecting that data.
We'll probably publish some 

01:00:45.005 --> 01:00:49.755
blogs or something that get into
this in more detail.  But just 

01:00:49.756 --> 01:00:51.756
so you have the context for 

01:00:53.653 --> 01:00:56.489
that, we started with -- by 
selecting a set of content in 

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:59.362
JSTOR that is about baseball.  
We did that using a topic model 

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:05.883
similar to what powers text 
analyzer that you saw.  It 

01:01:05.884 --> 01:01:07.884
looked at all of the words 
within 

01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.429
every article to find out the 
likelihood that an article is 

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.859
about baseball, even if the word
is not used.  And we've ended up

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:15.860
coming up with 

01:01:17.171 --> 01:01:19.171
about 25,000 articles through 
the 

01:01:20.224 --> 01:01:21.882
centuries of content in JSTOR, 
articles and chapters that were 

01:01:21.883 --> 01:01:24.571
about baseball.  
           We then used some, 

01:01:24.572 --> 01:01:29.475
again, natural language 
processing to pull out the 

01:01:29.476 --> 01:01:31.709
people and places and 
organizations from those 

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:33.710
articles.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.645
So that we could connect it into
the other -- to the other 

01:01:36.646 --> 01:01:38.646
collections.

01:01:41.147 --> 01:01:42.378
We then used Wikidata to limit 
those people, places and 

01:01:42.379 --> 01:01:47.100
organizations to those related 
to baseball.  Not all of the 

01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:50.381
people in every article was a 
baseball person.  We wanted to 

01:01:50.382 --> 01:01:54.080
keep it focused on really do a 
deep dive on baseball.  And that

01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:58.753
allowed us to krael what's 
called create what's called a 

01:01:58.754 --> 01:02:02.411
knowledge graph.  And then we 
were able to plug into that 

01:02:02.412 --> 01:02:04.412
knowledge graph the material 
from 

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:08.187
Library of Congress and 
Smithsonian and also some 

01:02:08.188 --> 01:02:10.188
material 

01:02:11.879 --> 01:02:13.879
-- some additional data that's 
in Wikidata.

01:02:16.603 --> 01:02:18.434
And that's as geeky as we'll 
get.  At least that kind of 

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:22.495
geeky.  There's so many kinds of
geeky that we embrace.  That's 

01:02:22.496 --> 01:02:24.344
the preparation on the 
technology side, but that's not 

01:02:24.345 --> 01:02:26.345
all that we do in preparation 
for these weeks.

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.110
If we're building a tool for 
baseball researchers, people 

01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:33.589
studying baseball, we have some 
theories about what might be 

01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:38.683
helpful.  We know how people 
research generally.  But we 

01:02:38.684 --> 01:02:42.965
don't know the exact issues 
facing baseball researchers.  

01:02:42.966 --> 01:02:44.966
And so we solve that problem by 
talking to them.

01:02:47.858 --> 01:02:49.893
We did, I think, seven 
interviews with baseball 

01:02:49.894 --> 01:02:51.933
researchers of all sorts.  I 
talked to my favorite sports 

01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:55.150
journalist in the world.

01:03:00.119 --> 01:03:02.572
We talked to Joe Poznanski, he's
awesome.  We talked to 

01:03:02.573 --> 01:03:05.037
historians of baseball, cultural
studies people.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.165
We talked to students and 
scholars.  And in doing that, we

01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:16.235
tried to understand what are 
their challenges?  What are the 

01:03:16.236 --> 01:03:18.261
things that they have to 
overcome that's specific to 

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:21.962
baseball?  We had to understand 
their goals and their practices 

01:03:21.963 --> 01:03:23.986
so that we could help them 
achieve their goals a little 

01:03:23.987 --> 01:03:27.447
faster or overcome one of the 
hurdles.  And so some examples 

01:03:27.448 --> 01:03:29.448
-- and this, I 

01:03:30.539 --> 01:03:33.630
should say, this Joe Perlman is 
not a real person.  This is the 

01:03:33.631 --> 01:03:35.631
embodiment of those seven.

01:03:36.686 --> 01:03:38.729
We sort of chewed them up, 
wrapped them up and put them 

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:42.805
into one personification, and 
it's Joe.  Who's a fine guy.

01:03:47.479 --> 01:03:50.123
So, for example, everybody we 
talk to that talks baseball, 

01:03:50.124 --> 01:03:53.593
history-related classes said 
that on the first day of class, 

01:03:53.594 --> 01:03:56.052
they had to overcome the fact 
and tell their students that 

01:03:56.053 --> 01:03:58.053
this class is not about last 
night's game.

01:04:00.779 --> 01:04:02.779
It's not about how Bryce Harper 
is really stinking this year.

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:06.473
It's about looking at America 
and the 

01:04:07.742 --> 01:04:10.410
story of America, race relations
and labor relations and 

01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:15.281
capitalism and all of these 
wonderful story -- and hopes and

01:04:15.282 --> 01:04:18.142
dreams, but it's looking at the 
story of America through 

01:04:18.143 --> 01:04:22.219
baseball.  And the walk-through 
that we just got of the National

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:26.515
Museum of African-American 
History and Culture was such a 

01:04:26.516 --> 01:04:28.516
great embodiment of that story. 
It was really wonderful.

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:32.212
And all of these people that we 
talked to got as excited about 

01:04:32.213 --> 01:04:35.746
those stories and wanting to be 
able to tell them either through

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.747
their books or their lectures, 
we wanted to find ways to make 

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:41.020
it even easier for them to do 
so.  

01:04:46.354 --> 01:04:48.997
So that was the work we did over
the past couple months, leading 

01:04:48.998 --> 01:04:50.998
up to Monday.

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:54.438
When we all came down here.

01:04:56.303 --> 01:04:57.931
And the first thing we did on 
Monday was -- I think Jamie had 

01:04:57.932 --> 01:04:59.932
a picture of 

01:05:01.615 --> 01:05:03.255
this as well -- was lead a 
design jam.  And these are 

01:05:03.256 --> 01:05:07.524
called a few different things.  
Sometimes called design jams.  

01:05:07.525 --> 01:05:12.293
I've called them idea jams.  
Design studio sometimes.  

01:05:12.294 --> 01:05:13.929
They're various ways -- it's a 
structured brainstorming 

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:15.930
technique.

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:19.475
And there's a few different 
steps that you go through.  And 

01:05:19.476 --> 01:05:21.476
the first one is the one you see

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:25.414
here on theseThese Post-it notes
that Jessica -- who's awesome 

01:05:25.415 --> 01:05:27.415
and in the back -- is ably 
leading.

01:05:30.746 --> 01:05:31.967
And it's a way to highlight and 
bring together all of that 

01:05:31.968 --> 01:05:36.082
research on users and baseball 
researchers that we had done, 

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:38.363
sort of brainstorming what are 
their big goals?  What are the 

01:05:38.364 --> 01:05:42.427
tasks that they need to try to 
achieve?  What are the hurdles? 

01:05:42.428 --> 01:05:44.676
Because those can spark ideas 
for what we can do to make -- to

01:05:44.677 --> 01:05:46.677
help them.  

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:52.027
From there, this was all -- this
design jam was a couple hours.  

01:05:52.028 --> 01:05:54.028
It was a quick brainstorming 
session.

01:05:56.313 --> 01:05:58.313
We did something called an 8x8, 
which is what you see here.

01:06:00.859 --> 01:06:05.334
You see pages and pages of 
pieces of paper with 8 squares. 

01:06:05.335 --> 01:06:07.965
And everybody in the room worked
silently, had eight minutes to 

01:06:07.966 --> 01:06:11.652
draw eight different ideas.  
They then presented their ideas 

01:06:11.653 --> 01:06:17.564
to the entire room.  And we did 
it again, sharing those ideas.  

01:06:17.565 --> 01:06:19.565
And it's a really wonderful way 
to 

01:06:21.688 --> 01:06:24.340
very quickly come up with lots 
of ideas.  And these were all 

01:06:24.341 --> 01:06:29.671
based on and responding to the 
empathy map.  They build on it, 

01:06:29.672 --> 01:06:31.672
helping each one would help a 
user achieve their goals or 

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.121
overcome a hurdle.

01:06:35.173 --> 01:06:37.212
And some of the ideas aren't 
fully formed.  None of them are 

01:06:37.213 --> 01:06:41.313
fully formed.  Some of them are 
more fully formed, but they help

01:06:41.314 --> 01:06:43.339
each other, and it's a very 
generative approach to 

01:06:44.152 --> 01:06:46.185
brainstorming.  
           We then ended the 

01:06:46.186 --> 01:06:49.032
design jam by dot voting.  
Everybody had three dots, could 

01:06:49.033 --> 01:06:52.131
choose the things that were most
exciting, and that gave us a 

01:06:52.132 --> 01:06:54.132
heat map of the ideas that were 
most exciting.

01:06:57.023 --> 01:06:59.023
From there -- so we ended that 
with 

01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:04.055
five or six general ideas that 
we were excited to explore.  But

01:07:04.056 --> 01:07:06.687
we needed to have a way to 
choose between those.  And one 

01:07:06.688 --> 01:07:09.557
of the Hallmarks and one of the 
important parts of these labs 

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.558
weeks 

01:07:13.454 --> 01:07:15.088
is it's focused effort, but it's
iterative effort even within the

01:07:15.089 --> 01:07:19.384
week.  It's not just one week of
work.  We've had baseball 

01:07:19.385 --> 01:07:24.069
researchers coming in to pretty 
much every day this week.  And 

01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:26.730
at each step, we'd be showing 
baseball researchers our works 

01:07:26.731 --> 01:07:30.375
in progress.  Where we are so 
far.  And using their feedback 

01:07:30.376 --> 01:07:32.376
to help us make decisions.

01:07:34.244 --> 01:07:35.860
So at this point, we had -- we 
created a set of paper 

01:07:35.861 --> 01:07:37.861
prototypes.  And you saw a 
picture in Jamie's 

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:43.409
presentation of Grif doing this 
on the LC team.  Paper 

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:45.410
prototypes of different ways 

01:07:47.072 --> 01:07:49.072
that we could go about using 
linked-open 

01:07:50.327 --> 01:07:52.143
data, to help baseball 
researchers do this.  There's a 

01:07:52.144 --> 01:07:54.144
map.

01:07:55.209 --> 01:07:57.869
There was a chrome filter that 
gave us a baseball lens when 

01:07:57.870 --> 01:08:01.131
you're reading about anything.  
And then there's this idea 

01:08:01.132 --> 01:08:05.043
called cultural history baseball
cards.  And that's the one that 

01:08:05.044 --> 01:08:07.044
we ended up running with.

01:08:09.088 --> 01:08:11.146
So then the rest of the week -- 
so by Tuesday, we knew what we 

01:08:11.147 --> 01:08:15.025
wanted to build.  It might have 
even been Monday afternoon.  So 

01:08:15.026 --> 01:08:17.065
then it was about rapidly 
refining and making -- turning 

01:08:17.066 --> 01:08:19.066
that idea into a 

01:08:20.522 --> 01:08:22.553
thing that actually exists in 
the world.  So this -- so I'll 

01:08:22.554 --> 01:08:24.554
show you quickly what that 
evolution looked like.

01:08:27.643 --> 01:08:29.672
And then we'll get to the actual
site.  So this was the design 

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:31.673
jam sketch.

01:08:33.565 --> 01:08:39.046
You can see it's pretty unclear 
what it is.  It's very sketchy. 

01:08:39.047 --> 01:08:41.503
There's a little bit of a flow 
there.  And sometimes with 

01:08:41.504 --> 01:08:43.535
these, you'll have multiple 
sketches, all talking about the 

01:08:43.937 --> 01:08:47.057
same idea.  And we'll bring 
those together.  That turned 

01:08:47.058 --> 01:08:49.058
into the paper prototype, 

01:08:52.213 --> 01:08:53.842
which turned into the first 
design mock-up which we'd show 

01:08:53.843 --> 01:08:57.899
on screen to users to get 
feelings for whether they liked 

01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.900
-- whether they thought the idea
could be useful, where they were

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.593
confused, what made sense.  At 
this point people were getting 

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:07.287
confused between baseball cards 
and like they thought this was a

01:09:07.288 --> 01:09:09.288
collection of baseball cards.

01:09:12.459 --> 01:09:14.459
They weren't seeing the links to
the 

01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:17.531
-- to the materials.

01:09:19.423 --> 01:09:21.252
And there were all sorts of 
other problems, too.  That's why

01:09:21.253 --> 01:09:23.120
we do the research.  And that 
makes it kind of fun and 

01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:25.571
exciting.  
           This is a further 

01:09:25.572 --> 01:09:29.658
refinement of the design.  And 
so now you can see on the 

01:09:29.659 --> 01:09:33.990
baseball card for Jackie 
Robinson, the cultural history 

01:09:33.991 --> 01:09:35.224
baseball card, you know, on a 
baseball card, if you're 

01:09:35.225 --> 01:09:38.284
familiar with them, there's 
often physical -- there's the 

01:09:38.285 --> 01:09:40.551
stats.  Their batting average, 
their E.R.A.

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:48.329
, year-by-year on the lower -- 
on the back of the card.  But on

01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:50.754
the cultural history baseball 
cards, you can get that stuff, 

01:09:50.755 --> 01:09:54.864
those baseball stats, at 
baseballreference.com or any 

01:09:54.865 --> 01:09:56.865
other wonderful place.  Instead 
we have stats about their 

01:09:57.103 --> 01:09:59.103
cultural history.

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.024
So these are links to and stats 
about the scholarly articles 

01:10:04.025 --> 01:10:06.293
about Jackie Robinson, the 
number of photos or videos 

01:10:09.346 --> 01:10:11.602
or objects that are available in
the different collections.  So 

01:10:11.603 --> 01:10:16.285
that's Library of Congress and 
Smithsonian, Wikidata.  So it 

01:10:16.286 --> 01:10:19.365
sort of gives a snapshot of how 
much information we have.  And 

01:10:19.366 --> 01:10:22.196
then you can dive into it.  
           So with that, I think

01:10:22.197 --> 01:10:26.541
we should switch over to Chrome 
and see where it is.  See what 

01:10:26.542 --> 01:10:28.542
it looks like.

01:10:29.598 --> 01:10:31.598
This is the -- there we go.

01:10:33.049 --> 01:10:37.166
Quick, you know, caveat.  This 
is a week of work.  So what 

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:40.227
you're going to see is 
definitely a work in progress.  

01:10:40.228 --> 01:10:41.484
There will be parts that look 
great.  There will be some parts

01:10:41.485 --> 01:10:43.728
that are a little bit buggy 
still.

01:10:47.835 --> 01:10:49.679
And you get to do that when it's
only a week.  We're trying to 

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.680
focus enough to give an idea of 
what this actually is.

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:57.201
So what we have is the cultural 
history baseball cards brought 

01:10:57.202 --> 01:11:00.678
to you by the JSTOR Labs team.  
And the idea is that you can 

01:11:00.679 --> 01:11:05.764
pick a player or historical 
figure, see their cultural 

01:11:05.765 --> 01:11:08.236
history card, and then browse 
through the primary and 

01:11:08.237 --> 01:11:10.237
secondary resources about them.

01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:15.599
These are organized right now by
the number of articles in JSTOR 

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.866
about each of these.  And what's
fun about this -- and if you 

01:11:19.867 --> 01:11:21.698
even show the next 25 or 
whatever -- it's first of all, 

01:11:21.699 --> 01:11:23.699
it's not just players.

01:11:26.593 --> 01:11:28.634
You have Branch Rickey, billBill
James, Marvin Miller.  This is 

01:11:28.635 --> 01:11:31.281
not just the players of 
baseball.  This is the history 

01:11:31.282 --> 01:11:33.282
of baseball sort of told here, 
which is really exciting.

01:11:38.215 --> 01:11:39.432
We envisioned before we go live,
we'll have more than just the 

01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:42.897
article -- number of articles on
this home page.  It will include

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.898
the number of videos and images 
that we have as well.  

01:11:46.161 --> 01:11:48.446
Then when you click through to 
an individual file, who do we 

01:11:48.447 --> 01:11:55.608
have?  Hammering Hank.  We have 
the baseball card that has the 

01:11:57.281 --> 01:11:59.111
data of number of articles and 
images and videos if we have 

01:11:59.112 --> 01:12:03.019
them, physical objects.  We're 
sort of still working on the 

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.654
classifications and how we map 
those to 

01:12:09.376 --> 01:12:10.634
the library's and Smithsonian's 
classifications.  So those are 

01:12:10.635 --> 01:12:15.114
at the top.  And then you can 
browse through.  You can see all

01:12:15.115 --> 01:12:17.781
of the articles right there, 
click through them to get access

01:12:18.796 --> 01:12:20.796
to them on JSTOR.

01:12:21.863 --> 01:12:23.281
Or if you want to look at the 
images, it brings together the 

01:12:23.282 --> 01:12:26.335
different images from all the 
sources.  You can browse through

01:12:26.336 --> 01:12:30.821
those images and then get access
to those images where they're 

01:12:30.822 --> 01:12:35.289
available, the high-resolution 
image, perhaps, that's on the 

01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:38.186
museum's site or the library's 
site.  Then there are some 

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.187
printed materials here as well.

01:12:42.462 --> 01:12:44.306
And I'd just encourage -- I mean
-- so there's a lot of exploring

01:12:44.307 --> 01:12:46.767
that you can do.  All organized 
around people.

01:12:50.848 --> 01:12:52.279
When we talked to the 
researchers and one of the 

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.317
things that led to this was a 
lot of them did want people.  

01:12:55.318 --> 01:12:57.318
They were interested in how to 
connect 

01:12:59.198 --> 01:13:01.198
the different -- the materials 
related to each person.

01:13:04.108 --> 01:13:05.556
They would say that, you know, I
know I'm doing research -- I'm 

01:13:05.557 --> 01:13:10.032
telling this particular story, 
and I don't know if this 

01:13:10.033 --> 01:13:12.077
archive, you know, is available 
at the Hall of Fame.  Is it 

01:13:12.078 --> 01:13:15.163
available here?  So if I could 
have a way to connect those and 

01:13:15.164 --> 01:13:18.036
bring those together, it could 
be valuable.  They also 

01:13:18.037 --> 01:13:20.037
described that when they first 
start their research, they start

01:13:21.716 --> 01:13:23.746
with the secondary literature.  
So that would be the scholarly 

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:29.943
articles in JSTOR.  And then 
they'd do a deep dive into the 

01:13:29.944 --> 01:13:33.203
contextual material.  But that 
depends.  For students, they may

01:13:33.204 --> 01:13:37.323
benefit from seeing the pictures
that help bring the history to 

01:13:37.324 --> 01:13:39.324
life and tell some of the 

01:13:40.739 --> 01:13:43.466
stories like we heard just in 
the presentation from the 

01:13:45.086 --> 01:13:46.511
National Museum of 
African-American History and 

01:13:46.512 --> 01:13:48.512
Culture.

01:13:50.018 --> 01:13:52.018
           I think that's enough
demo.

01:13:55.377 --> 01:13:56.785
We could keep clicking around, 
but let's go back to the 

01:13:56.786 --> 01:13:58.786
presentation so we can get to 
questions.

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:05.554
One thing I should say is that 
this -- I see this right now and

01:14:05.555 --> 01:14:07.597
the team sees this right now as 
probably a little bit 

01:14:10.647 --> 01:14:12.801
more of a proof of concept than 
full-fledged, you know, research

01:14:12.802 --> 01:14:14.869
tool ready for heavy lifting.

01:14:19.967 --> 01:14:21.185
This is more of an idea and an 
evocation of that idea to help 

01:14:21.186 --> 01:14:23.413
people understand what it looked
like but there's still work to 

01:14:23.414 --> 01:14:25.855
do.  Oh, I get to click.  So 
there's still work to do.

01:14:28.926 --> 01:14:30.926
So what we'll do, just so you 
know, is 

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.019
over the coming week or two, 
we'll fix some of the things 

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:36.020
that you might have 

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.100
seen, the alignment issues, the 
bugs 

01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:47.484
that we deftly managed to avoid,
and then we'll release it as a 

01:14:47.485 --> 01:14:50.754
proof of concept.  It will be 
available on the JSTOR site.  

01:14:50.755 --> 01:14:52.755
You can follow me on Twitter.

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:56.905
I'll announce it, and we'll 
encourage everybody to explore 

01:14:56.906 --> 01:14:59.143
it and use it.  And I'll 
probably give some presentations

01:14:59.144 --> 01:15:02.431
about it, conferences and such. 
Just to share what we've learned

01:15:02.432 --> 01:15:06.105
along this way.  Along this 
journey.  

01:15:07.933 --> 01:15:11.028
We do see some opportunity for 
further development.  And the 

01:15:11.029 --> 01:15:13.029
first one is, I think for this 

01:15:14.088 --> 01:15:15.541
to be a really valuable tool, 
the amount of collections and 

01:15:15.542 --> 01:15:18.867
data that's included in it needs
to be more robust.  JSTOR's 

01:15:18.868 --> 01:15:22.138
great.  The collections at the 
Library of Congress and the 

01:15:22.139 --> 01:15:24.013
National Museum of 
African-American History and 

01:15:24.014 --> 01:15:27.075
Culture, that's some really 
wonderful material.  But it 

01:15:27.076 --> 01:15:29.327
feels still a little -- I think 
there's even more that we can do

01:15:29.328 --> 01:15:33.601
by bringing in, for example, the
digital public library ofDigital

01:15:33.602 --> 01:15:36.049
Public Library of America or 
some other materials and beefing

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:38.050
that up.  So that would be work 
that we would 

01:15:42.213 --> 01:15:44.213
love to explore sometime in the 
future.

01:15:46.679 --> 01:15:47.900
We also would love to explore 
some crowdsourced improvement, 

01:15:47.901 --> 01:15:51.773
the knowledge graph that we have
is -- there are going to be 

01:15:51.774 --> 01:15:55.059
errors in it.  That's the nature
of how -- what it looks like to 

01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.060
bring this material 

01:15:58.146 --> 01:15:59.776
together, photographs 
miscategorized or things like 

01:15:59.777 --> 01:16:01.777
that, so we'd love to have an 
opportunity for people to help 

01:16:01.831 --> 01:16:04.264
improve that.  Especially in a 
field like baseball 

01:16:08.623 --> 01:16:10.623
where there's so many citizen 
experts 

01:16:11.672 --> 01:16:13.542
who can help us do that.  
           And then the last 

01:16:13.543 --> 01:16:16.210
area for opportunity -- and 
again, we'll see when 

01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:20.501
we can explore these -- is 
expanding the concept beyond 

01:16:20.502 --> 01:16:23.352
baseball.  They are baseball 
cards but we can call them 

01:16:23.353 --> 01:16:25.353
trading cards.

01:16:27.668 --> 01:16:30.144
But the idea of using people as 
an explorer -- as an exploratory

01:16:30.145 --> 01:16:34.432
tool to multiple collections is 
really exciting.  This is sort 

01:16:34.433 --> 01:16:36.881
of a front end to some of the 
work that's being -- that's 

01:16:36.882 --> 01:16:38.882
working 

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:43.251
in linked-open data and 
Wikidata.  And you can imagine 

01:16:43.252 --> 01:16:45.252
this same kind of 

01:16:46.516 --> 01:16:48.516
exploratory tool for people of 
the Civil 

01:16:49.731 --> 01:16:51.731
War or famous writers or 
anything like that.

01:16:52.991 --> 01:16:54.991
And so we'd be interested in 
exploring any of those.

01:16:56.679 --> 01:17:00.379
           So before we get to 
questions, I want to thank you 

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:04.842
for being here and Library of 
Congress again.  And perhaps 

01:17:04.843 --> 01:17:09.179
most importantly, I want to 
thank the JSTOR Labs team.  So 

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:11.180
if you're on the JSTOR Labs 
team, stand up.

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:18.847
We have Jared and Siobhan and 
Jessica and Matt and Ron and 

01:17:18.848 --> 01:17:20.848
Beth is sitting down.  She was 
sort of a double agent this 

01:17:20.913 --> 01:17:23.388
week.  
[ Applause ] 

01:17:24.205 --> 01:17:27.657
They're amazing.  And I am so 
deeply privileged to be able to 

01:17:27.658 --> 01:17:30.147
work with these guys who can 
pull this together.  My main job

01:17:30.148 --> 01:17:33.010
this week was to buy coffee.  
And I knocked it out of the 

01:17:33.011 --> 01:17:35.484
park.  
[ Laughter ] 

01:17:35.897 --> 01:17:42.396
All right.  Thanks.  Are there 
any questions?  Yeah.  Or 

01:17:42.397 --> 01:17:45.032
comments.  
&gt;&gt; (Away from mic). 

01:17:46.048 --> 01:17:48.048
&gt;&gt; There's a microphone.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:51.932
&gt;&gt; Yeah, hi.

01:17:56.642 --> 01:17:58.073
My name is Hollis Gentry and I'm
a special with the 

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:00.074
African-American history museum.

01:18:03.147 --> 01:18:05.793
I'm also employed with the 
Smithsonian library and a 

01:18:05.794 --> 01:18:07.794
longtime person with JSTOR and I
love JSTOR.  

01:18:08.069 --> 01:18:10.329
&gt;&gt; We love you too.  
&gt;&gt; After registering for this, I

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:12.781
went online to play with your 
text, the drop and drag.  

01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:17.446
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.  
&gt;&gt; And I have one word for you. 

01:18:17.447 --> 01:18:19.292
It is absolutely awesome.  For 
someone who's done a 

01:18:19.293 --> 01:18:22.185
considerable amount of research 
in trying to find 

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:27.508
related data on just anything, 
any given subject, because I do 

01:18:27.509 --> 01:18:28.956
reference, you know.  
&gt;&gt; Yeah.  

01:18:28.957 --> 01:18:30.386
&gt;&gt; It was amazing.  
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's so wonderful to 

01:18:30.387 --> 01:18:33.063
hear.  
&gt;&gt; I was typing, for example, we

01:18:33.064 --> 01:18:37.146
have a transcription project 
where we're digitizing records 

01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:39.147
of federal government records, 
millions of documents.  

01:18:39.203 --> 01:18:41.236
&gt;&gt; Yeah.  
&gt;&gt; And I just typed in one 

01:18:41.237 --> 01:18:43.237
sentence.  I created a document.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.563
And all I said was, you know, 
the bureau was founded on such 

01:18:47.564 --> 01:18:51.655
and such a date, Washington, D.
C., and it generated thousands 

01:18:51.656 --> 01:18:53.656
of hits for me.  
&gt;&gt; Yeah.  

01:18:54.488 --> 01:18:56.324
&gt;&gt; So all I want to say is keep 
up with whatever you're doing. 

01:18:56.325 --> 01:18:59.381
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, thank you.  
&gt;&gt; And in terms of trying to 

01:18:59.382 --> 01:19:01.382
figure out 

01:19:05.097 --> 01:19:07.793
ways to apply this, you want to 
touch with universityies like 

01:19:07.794 --> 01:19:10.861
you're doing already with 
scholars.  But there are 

01:19:10.862 --> 01:19:12.285
different nuances to that 
research that I think you're 

01:19:12.286 --> 01:19:16.427
going to find as you reach out 
to the universities and the 

01:19:16.428 --> 01:19:18.479
different subject areas.  But, 
again, all I can say, it was 

01:19:19.294 --> 01:19:21.294
awesome.  
&gt;&gt; Thank you.  Thank you.  

01:19:22.786 --> 01:19:24.810
&gt;&gt; I didn't have to have any 
training, how to learn how to do

01:19:24.811 --> 01:19:27.647
it.  I looked at it.  I said let
me play with it.

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:32.975
In less than ten minutes, it 
generated all that material.  

01:19:32.976 --> 01:19:34.976
&gt;&gt; I hope somebody is getting 
quotes on 

01:19:37.882 --> 01:19:38.881
this, because, dang, that's a 
wonderful testimonial.  Thanks 

01:19:38.882 --> 01:19:42.773
so much.  Any other questions or
comments?  And we'll be around 

01:19:42.774 --> 01:19:44.774
over break and later.  Over 
there.  

01:19:45.026 --> 01:19:46.655
&gt;&gt; (Away from mic). 
&gt;&gt; There's a microphone coming 

01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:48.656
down to you.

01:19:50.117 --> 01:19:55.641
Orioles fan.  
&gt;&gt; Hi.  I'm Jordan Ellenberg.  

01:19:55.642 --> 01:19:58.709
I'll be on a panel later this 
afternoon.  I'm curious just 

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:03.811
because I'm sort of naive about 
sort of how this information is 

01:20:03.812 --> 01:20:05.812
controlled and what access is 
had to what.

01:20:07.505 --> 01:20:09.543
I mean, cultural baseball cards,
you wanted to, let's say, for 

01:20:09.544 --> 01:20:14.269
each player, I want to see every
time that player was quoted in 

01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:16.270
the newspaper, like every single
thing they said, those archives 

01:20:16.301 --> 01:20:20.379
exist.  What are the barriers to
somebody like you being able to 

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:24.295
just build that in?  So I see 
the complete journalistic record

01:20:24.296 --> 01:20:26.296
of that -- of that player?  

01:20:29.919 --> 01:20:31.919
&gt;&gt; The barriers to that access 
have to do with access.

01:20:34.247 --> 01:20:35.460
I mean, a lot of the 
in-copyright material -- you 

01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:37.461
know, when we were talking to 
the researchers, showing them 

01:20:38.963 --> 01:20:39.765
this, one of the first things 
they said was exactly what you 

01:20:39.766 --> 01:20:41.803
said.  Like oh, my gosh, I want 
to see, you 

01:20:45.083 --> 01:20:47.521
know, how newspapers talked 
about Roberto Clementi when he 

01:20:47.522 --> 01:20:51.657
was just on the team and they 
were, you know, he was forced to

01:20:51.658 --> 01:20:56.946
be called Bob.  I mean, the 
language was terrible.  And I 

01:20:56.947 --> 01:20:59.392
want to see that and I want to 
show it to my students and to 

01:20:59.393 --> 01:21:03.901
help them understand the context
for it.  The biggest challenge 

01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:05.902
to that has to 

01:21:10.247 --> 01:21:12.918
do with access and copyright 
which are reasonable things.  

01:21:12.919 --> 01:21:14.329
The way to overcome that is 
through partnerships with people

01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:16.330
who have, you 

01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:21.973
know, people like maybe pro 
creates or others who have the 

01:21:21.974 --> 01:21:23.602
aggregations of newspapers and 
then we can create pathways 

01:21:23.603 --> 01:21:26.079
through there.  It's a little --
it's another -- it's 

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.973
a bigger challenge to do that 
than with the open material that

01:21:31.974 --> 01:21:34.229
we have with the Library of 
Congress.  So we often, when 

01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.230
we're doing these 

01:21:37.487 --> 01:21:39.940
weeks, focus on the open 
material because it's easy to 

01:21:39.941 --> 01:21:44.893
experiment really rapidly and 
not worry so much about that.  

01:21:44.894 --> 01:21:47.165
And then once we prove the value
of this is a really nifty way of

01:21:47.166 --> 01:21:51.438
doing research, then approaching
those copyright holders or 

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:54.787
people who have access to those 
databases.  Does that answer 

01:21:54.788 --> 01:21:56.788
your question?  
&gt;&gt; Awesome, thank you.

01:21:58.963 --> 01:22:00.963
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

01:22:07.335 --> 01:22:08.960
Okay, well, thank you very much.
And I want to see what the 

01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:11.834
Library of Congress did because 
it's competition.  

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:16.846
[ Applause ]

&gt;&gt; Hello.

01:22:32.708 --> 01:22:34.708
All right.

01:22:37.612 --> 01:22:39.037
So I have a lot of -- we're 
going to start with the starting

01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:41.038
lineup.

01:22:42.743 --> 01:22:44.743
So this is our team.

Here on your left.  Every team 
strength is in its lineup.  And 

01:22:51.367 --> 01:22:53.367
this is ours.

01:22:55.873 --> 01:22:57.301
We have Meghan Ferriter who did 
a lot of planning for the 

01:22:57.302 --> 01:23:01.777
overall event and did a lot of 
coordination on our team.  Jamie

01:23:01.778 --> 01:23:04.416
Mears who you met earlier who 
was also very important.  

01:23:04.417 --> 01:23:07.289
Myself, Abby Potter.  We're all 
part of the Library of Congress 

01:23:07.290 --> 01:23:12.628
labs team.  We worked with folks
from the office of chief 

01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:14.629
information -- office of the 

01:23:15.675 --> 01:23:17.675
chief information officer, Chris
Adams, 

01:23:20.191 --> 01:23:22.662
and Grif Friedman and visiting 
archivist Julia Hickey who we'll

01:23:22.663 --> 01:23:26.356
hear more about what we did with
our baseball data.  And we had a

01:23:26.357 --> 01:23:29.064
lot of great help from our 
summer class of interns who are 

01:23:29.065 --> 01:23:31.065
also around here.

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.280
You'll see them, Eileen Jakeway,

01:23:40.537 --> 01:23:42.537
Yasira, Anda and Courtney 
Johnson.

01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:47.169
We were also coached by the 
JSTOR Labs

01:23:49.386 --> 01:23:51.882
Beth Dufferch rt helping us 
clearly define our goals and 

01:23:51.883 --> 01:23:54.139
move us on over the week.  So 
this is a great team.  And we 

01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.140
started there.

01:23:57.192 --> 01:23:59.655
But actually, we started before 
then during our warm-up which is

01:23:59.656 --> 01:24:01.880
our data prep.  And I'm going to
let Julia talk about that.

01:24:06.189 --> 01:24:09.642
&gt;&gt; Thanks.  Good morning, 
everyone.  First I just want to 

01:24:09.643 --> 01:24:12.089
say my thanks to everyone I've 
gotten to collaborate on this 

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:16.379
project.  Again, I don't work 
with LC directly.  I'm employed 

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.380
by another federal agency and so
this has been an incredible 

01:24:19.438 --> 01:24:21.478
project for me to work on.  And 
if you ever get the opportunity 

01:24:21.479 --> 01:24:25.540
to work with LC Labs, it's 
amazing.  So please take that in

01:24:25.541 --> 01:24:27.541
consideration.

01:24:29.047 --> 01:24:31.047
So what this slightly less scary

01:24:32.353 --> 01:24:34.813
diagram here or chart is than 
what she showed before is what 

01:24:34.814 --> 01:24:36.814
I've come to call the metadata 
crosswalk.

01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:41.613
So this is in other terms, a 
metadata map.  And you'll see in

01:24:41.614 --> 01:24:43.614
the first column to 

01:24:45.218 --> 01:24:47.218
your farthest side over here, 
this is 

01:24:49.314 --> 01:24:51.563
the athor authoritative 
reference for the map.  This is 

01:24:51.564 --> 01:24:53.564
the Merck data that the library 
has related to their digital 

01:24:55.805 --> 01:24:59.305
collections from general topic 
of baseball.  And to the next 

01:24:59.306 --> 01:25:01.306
column over, you'll find the 
export.

01:25:05.427 --> 01:25:08.020
So this is actually, as I think 
Jamie mentioned through the 

01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:13.455
tutorial, you can learn how to 
do a JSON API call and acquire 

01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:15.456
LC Digital metadata.  And we 
used that.

01:25:19.426 --> 01:25:21.865
We plotted that back onto the 
Merc data and moved forward.  

01:25:21.866 --> 01:25:23.310
And the significance here is 
that when we turned to look at 

01:25:23.311 --> 01:25:26.993
the national African-AmericanThe
National African-American 

01:25:26.994 --> 01:25:28.994
History and Cultures 

01:25:30.128 --> 01:25:32.128
collection and their metadata, 
we had to bring it all together.

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:35.863
Holding the JSON data and 
mapping it into the museum's 

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:39.167
data was a significant point and
where we get to provide that out

01:25:39.168 --> 01:25:41.615
to you.  
           And one of the 

01:25:41.616 --> 01:25:45.794
unifying factors was the next 
column over from there, and this

01:25:45.795 --> 01:25:48.249
is the Dublin core.  It's a very
common, simplistic 

01:25:52.343 --> 01:25:55.677
metadata schema.  And this 
united the data such as what you

01:25:55.678 --> 01:25:57.737
see in the final column and what
will be provided in the final 

01:25:57.738 --> 01:26:02.265
dataset.  Some significant 
factors here to look at would 

01:26:02.266 --> 01:26:04.114
include the museum's attributes 
field.  You'll see that in the 

01:26:04.115 --> 01:26:06.565
-- it's about third from the top
or fourth from the top, excuse 

01:26:06.566 --> 01:26:08.566
me.

01:26:10.462 --> 01:26:12.281
And you can follow that through 
and you'll see that's mapped in 

01:26:12.282 --> 01:26:14.565
a number of different fields.  
So this is just some of the 

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:17.872
intellectual work you have to go
through when looking at metadata

01:26:17.873 --> 01:26:20.125
to explore where it needs to go 
into the right 

01:26:23.802 --> 01:26:25.643
fields for proper use, for 
proper querying and certainly 

01:26:25.644 --> 01:26:27.644
for unification 

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:31.358
and bringing two different 
unique heritage institutions 

01:26:31.359 --> 01:26:34.419
together, there's difficulties 
but it's also kind of exciting 

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:36.243
challenges to see that LC's 
collection can very easily talk 

01:26:36.244 --> 01:26:40.479
through and with and form this 
incredible dialogue related to 

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:43.116
baseball and all of the subject 
matter you saw the museum 

01:26:44.749 --> 01:26:45.968
present and what you get to 
explore in our visualization as 

01:26:45.969 --> 01:26:47.969
well.

01:26:49.656 --> 01:26:51.656
So with that I'll turn it back 
over to Abby.  Thank you.  

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:55.566
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Julia.  It seems less
scary when you say it like that.

01:26:57.846 --> 01:26:59.846
Okay.

01:27:02.969 --> 01:27:05.410
So we started off the week 
visiting our -- the baseball 

01:27:05.411 --> 01:27:08.070
Americana exhibit.  And we did 
that to get us loose and 

01:27:11.494 --> 01:27:13.494
ready to play

01:27:14.797 --> 01:27:17.956
.  The docents led us through 
and told us the main themes 

01:27:17.957 --> 01:27:20.219
which are creating and building 
community and paralleling 

01:27:21.845 --> 01:27:23.845
American history.

01:27:24.901 --> 01:27:26.962
So this -- when we were sort of 
walking through the exhibit, it 

01:27:26.963 --> 01:27:30.007
led us to ask sort of questions 
about what we could do during 

01:27:30.008 --> 01:27:34.069
this week.  We wanted to know 
what else our visitors might 

01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:35.490
want to see besides this 
exhibit, as an extension of this

01:27:35.491 --> 01:27:37.491
exhibit.

01:27:38.566 --> 01:27:41.530
We wanted to know what other 
stories our collections could 

01:27:41.531 --> 01:27:43.531
tell and what different 
possibilityies of presentation 

01:27:45.423 --> 01:27:47.054
we could use because there's 
only so much we can see in the 

01:27:47.055 --> 01:27:49.055
exhibit.

01:27:52.963 --> 01:27:54.963
So in order to generate sort of 
the 

01:27:57.029 --> 01:27:58.849
ideas Alex really talked, a nice
overview of what this design 

01:27:58.850 --> 01:28:00.850
session was 

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:04.149
all about, we had some really 
interesting ideas come out of 

01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:08.657
them that I think we'd like to 
pursue later including sort of 

01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:10.658
different phone apps 

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:15.467
and Snapchat filters, you know, 
sort of fun things that we think

01:28:15.468 --> 01:28:17.291
could bring our collections 
closer to the people who want to

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:19.292
use them.  

01:28:20.981 --> 01:28:25.055
And this led us really to think 
about audiences.  So we saw all 

01:28:25.056 --> 01:28:27.056
the work that JSTOR did, 

01:28:29.133 --> 01:28:31.833
interviewing the potential users
of our tools, and we saw how 

01:28:31.834 --> 01:28:34.471
careful they did those 
interviews and got really useful

01:28:37.359 --> 01:28:39.647
feedback.  You know, that 
created a persona.

01:28:43.496 --> 01:28:44.706
And when we were watching that 
work, we thought, well, I think 

01:28:44.707 --> 01:28:48.432
with our collections, with our 
exhibit, with our focus, we have

01:28:48.433 --> 01:28:51.404
sort of a different user in mind
who's more of a lifelong learner

01:28:54.277 --> 01:28:56.944
or a teacher who's trying to 
teach people about community or 

01:28:56.945 --> 01:28:58.945
history and just baseball fans, 
in general.

01:29:02.839 --> 01:29:04.839
So those are the users that we 
have in mind.

01:29:07.013 --> 01:29:09.683
Following JSTOR's lead, we sort 
of jumped right into user 

01:29:09.684 --> 01:29:12.560
interviews, and we quickly 
created these mock-ups of how 

01:29:16.853 --> 01:29:18.853
we could display our 
collections.

01:29:20.137 --> 01:29:23.596
We used time line JS and one on 
a map.  We used RTIF.  These 

01:29:23.597 --> 01:29:25.235
were tools that were quickly 
available to us that we wanted 

01:29:25.236 --> 01:29:28.721
to, you know, try out, see what 
would work and what people would

01:29:28.722 --> 01:29:31.360
respond to.  And we did get some
useful feedback on 

01:29:34.442 --> 01:29:39.360
the concept of displaying things
on a time line or a map.  But we

01:29:39.361 --> 01:29:42.224
thought that maybe we should 
have -- we should sort of go 

01:29:42.225 --> 01:29:46.728
back and sort of kind of mirror 
what JSTOR should have done and 

01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:48.729
start with a wire frame 

01:29:50.139 --> 01:29:54.471
and get sort of more information
about -- you know, because 

01:29:54.472 --> 01:29:56.714
there's a lot of -- when you're 
working with a tool that exists,

01:29:56.715 --> 01:30:01.200
there's limitations there.  What
we learned is we should have 

01:30:05.268 --> 01:30:09.968
started from square one and not 
sort of skip steps.  We used 

01:30:09.969 --> 01:30:14.307
this for the remaining of our --
on the user interviews.  And we 

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:17.365
got a lot of useful feedback on 
this drawing.  We heard that it 

01:30:17.366 --> 01:30:19.366
could -- something like this 
could be used in a classroom, 

01:30:23.753 --> 01:30:25.423
especially the time line aspect,
when teaching a subject 

01:30:25.424 --> 01:30:28.083
chronologically.  We heard that 
adding datasets to our 

01:30:31.529 --> 01:30:33.529
baseball collections data like 
census 

01:30:35.128 --> 01:30:38.005
data or income data would help 
-- would help tell the story of 

01:30:38.006 --> 01:30:40.006
how baseball -- use baseball to 
tell the stories like 

01:30:42.695 --> 01:30:44.751
the great migration or other 
sort of big historical movements

01:30:44.752 --> 01:30:46.752
that sort of take up the whole 
country.  

01:30:48.226 --> 01:30:50.063
We also learned that it would be
meaningful to sort of plainly 

01:30:50.064 --> 01:30:55.499
show what the gaps in our 
collections are, what we don't 

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.500
have and is there a way 

01:30:58.741 --> 01:31:01.021
that we can see that clearly?  
And we also learned that there's

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:04.876
users that have a lot of 
knowledge about what we at our 

01:31:04.877 --> 01:31:07.156
institutions have.  But 
knowledge that we don't have 

01:31:07.157 --> 01:31:09.157
about our collections.

01:31:10.617 --> 01:31:12.617
So if they're interested in 
contributing to and adding their

01:31:17.284 --> 01:31:19.284
knowledge to the things that we 
do

01:31:20.951 --> 01:31:24.210
.  This rapid prototyping also 
is iterative.  And like I said, 

01:31:24.211 --> 01:31:26.211
we shared this with 

01:31:27.495 --> 01:31:31.782
users, five users.  And with 
their comments in mind, it sort 

01:31:31.783 --> 01:31:33.893
of helps us work through 
challenges.  So this is -- I 

01:31:33.894 --> 01:31:35.894
don't know if you can 

01:31:38.204 --> 01:31:39.212
see this clearly, but this is 
our subjects that we are dealing

01:31:39.213 --> 01:31:43.514
with.  So we had 19 columns of 
subjects when we brought all of 

01:31:43.515 --> 01:31:45.515
our collections together.

01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:50.296
And this is really difficult to 
show to a user.  As you can see,

01:31:50.297 --> 01:31:54.374
the biggest sort of subject is 
baseball card.  The second 

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:57.630
biggest is color.  Is that 
useful?  Is that -- so when we 

01:31:57.631 --> 01:31:59.631
keep -- when we 

01:32:00.692 --> 01:32:01.961
think of our users, it helps us 
sort of work through some of 

01:32:01.962 --> 01:32:03.962
these decisions of 

01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:07.281
how we might present data about 
the subject of the items to 

01:32:07.282 --> 01:32:09.282
users.

01:32:11.571 --> 01:32:13.571
So I'm going to pass it over.

01:32:17.037 --> 01:32:19.037
To either of you to talk about 
the --

01:32:21.414 --> 01:32:23.044
so this is the next prototype 
sort of after the paper 

01:32:23.045 --> 01:32:25.091
prototype.  This is what Chris 
made.  Do you want to talk 

01:32:25.092 --> 01:32:27.092
through?

01:32:28.796 --> 01:32:30.796
&gt;&gt; So basically, we had several 
stages here.

01:32:34.704 --> 01:32:36.547
The first was getting all of 
Joy's hard work pulled out of 

01:32:36.548 --> 01:32:40.212
the files which is one of our 
datasets and geocoding so we 

01:32:40.213 --> 01:32:41.227
could put them on a map.  So 
that was part of the early part 

01:32:41.228 --> 01:32:45.301
of the project.  We didn't have 
a whole lot to show because it 

01:32:45.302 --> 01:32:47.302
was basically here's some data. 
Here's the different file that 

01:32:48.381 --> 01:32:51.086
contains the same data in a 
different shape.  And then we 

01:32:51.087 --> 01:32:53.959
started being able to do stuff 
like put things on a map.  So 

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.389
this slide shows -- I think this
was Wednesday -- Tuesday -- 

01:32:56.390 --> 01:33:01.072
Wednesday, yeah.  Tuesday was 
data wrangling.  Wednesday we 

01:33:01.073 --> 01:33:03.101
got this.  Can we go to the next
slide?  Oh, yeah.

01:33:06.143 --> 01:33:07.365
So this is -- good thing -- so 
we actually had three 

01:33:07.366 --> 01:33:09.366
deliverables.  So we had the raw
dataset for people 

01:33:13.123 --> 01:33:16.182
who are comfortable working with
CSV files directly.  We then 

01:33:16.183 --> 01:33:17.636
pulled it into a new 
experimental tool called a 

01:33:17.637 --> 01:33:19.637
dataset which 

01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:22.324
is basically a database with a 
web interface which is kind of 

01:33:22.325 --> 01:33:25.998
nice because we can take that 
data, write any query you want. 

01:33:25.999 --> 01:33:27.862
You can browse through and see 
what it is.  So for people who 

01:33:27.863 --> 01:33:30.710
want to be able to really do 
advanced filtering but don't 

01:33:32.568 --> 01:33:34.817
want to write their own code to 
do it, this is a nice little 

01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:38.089
intermediate step where you can 
look on things.  You can tweak 

01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:40.953
it a little bit.  Some basic 
plots and pull out the data.

01:33:44.002 --> 01:33:46.029
And then the last slide here is 
basically getting into the tool 

01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:49.697
we built, which was intended to 
be sort of the general overview 

01:33:49.698 --> 01:33:54.020
to the collection.  So I guess 
if we wanted to, we could go to 

01:33:54.021 --> 01:33:56.021
the Chrome browser at this point

01:33:58.447 --> 01:34:00.447
and actually show the live 
version here

01:34:01.996 --> 01:34:03.996
.  But basically, the idea here 
is this 

01:34:05.042 --> 01:34:07.278
gives you a way to view all of 
the items in the dataset on a 

01:34:07.279 --> 01:34:10.991
map.  Having the ability to do 
search so you can click on any 

01:34:10.992 --> 01:34:13.032
one of those pins, and you can 
see the items that are in that 

01:34:13.238 --> 01:34:15.238
location.

01:34:18.364 --> 01:34:20.191
You can click on an item and 
pull up the information about 

01:34:20.192 --> 01:34:22.192
that and just scroll down.

01:34:23.890 --> 01:34:25.890
It will pass the picture, and it
will 

01:34:27.992 --> 01:34:30.643
show the metadata, the 
description.  One of the goals 

01:34:30.644 --> 01:34:33.508
that we didn't fit into the 
sprint week was actually linking

01:34:33.509 --> 01:34:35.509
all those things so that when 
you see something tagged with a 

01:34:36.805 --> 01:34:38.642
particular subject, you could 
then see everything else in the 

01:34:38.643 --> 01:34:40.643
collection with that subject.

01:34:44.991 --> 01:34:47.424
And then the last thing here, 
you can just close this.  Click 

01:34:47.425 --> 01:34:50.089
anywhere on the map because we 
want to reset the selection to 

01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:52.090
the whole list.

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:57.055
And then you can drag that time
line slider.  It can be 

01:34:57.056 --> 01:35:00.114
adjusted.  And you can drag that
over.  And it adjusts the whole 

01:35:00.115 --> 01:35:03.802
thing.  And you can drag the 
slider itself.  So if you wanted

01:35:03.803 --> 01:35:05.843
to, you could pick, like, a 
five-year period and then just 

01:35:08.494 --> 01:35:10.120
scrub that forward or backward 
and see how the dataset changes 

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:14.211
over time.  That will also work 
nicely if you mention the -- if 

01:35:14.212 --> 01:35:17.276
you put anything in the text 
field.  So if you're interested 

01:35:17.277 --> 01:35:21.835
in a certain team or league or 
place that's mentioned in there,

01:35:21.836 --> 01:35:24.096
you can filter all of these 
together.  And so we were 

01:35:24.097 --> 01:35:26.132
thinking this is the raw -- this
is the basic overview of the 

01:35:28.434 --> 01:35:29.842
data, somebody who's getting 
here first, they can get an idea

01:35:29.843 --> 01:35:31.911
of what's in here.  They can 
follow specific items back to 

01:35:36.202 --> 01:35:37.615
the source institution or up in 
the toolbar, we also have the 

01:35:37.616 --> 01:35:41.305
links right now to the dataset. 
And at some point there will be 

01:35:41.306 --> 01:35:44.761
a link to the explanatory 
document that says here's how 

01:35:44.762 --> 01:35:46.762
you download this.  Here's what 
you can do with it.

01:35:49.094 --> 01:35:51.094
Here's the rights, the known 
limitations.

01:35:52.342 --> 01:35:54.792
And I really think this was a 
nice way to just illustrate how 

01:35:54.793 --> 01:35:58.490
quickly we can give somebody an 
overview for what's in the data 

01:35:58.491 --> 01:35:59.500
so that they can confirm that it
even answers the question they 

01:35:59.501 --> 01:36:01.501
have in the first place.

01:36:03.577 --> 01:36:05.577
And maybe it inspires some 
questions 

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.884
about why we have so many pins 
in a row in an obscure place on 

01:36:08.885 --> 01:36:10.885
the map.  Whether there might 
have been some 

01:36:13.979 --> 01:36:15.808
confusion in what you were 
searching for matches somebody 

01:36:15.809 --> 01:36:17.850
you hadn't heard of.  It really 
is a good way just to narrow 

01:36:20.335 --> 01:36:22.365
that down interactively before 
you've invested any time loading

01:36:22.366 --> 01:36:25.840
it into your favorite data 
analysis tools.  

01:36:27.869 --> 01:36:30.104
&gt;&gt; So one other thing we wanted 
to focus on was the idea of 

01:36:30.105 --> 01:36:32.343
bringing in even more data.  So 
we're already aggregating data 

01:36:32.344 --> 01:36:36.639
from our collection here at the 
library and the National Museum 

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.128
of African-American History and 
Cultures collection.  So over on

01:36:39.129 --> 01:36:42.174
the right side you'll see a mix 
of items.  That helps 

01:36:42.175 --> 01:36:44.001
contextualize these items.  You 
can look at them in location and

01:36:44.002 --> 01:36:45.835
time and understand them.  But 
as a researcher there may be 

01:36:45.836 --> 01:36:48.698
other information that you want 
to overlay on top that helps you

01:36:48.699 --> 01:36:50.699
understand those even more.  So 
up on the top right of the map, 

01:36:52.363 --> 01:36:53.785
there's a control there where 
you can actually turn on and off

01:36:53.786 --> 01:36:57.264
other layers.  And we've got two
example layers.  The first one 

01:36:57.265 --> 01:37:01.322
shows stadiums.  So if you could
check that one on.  That layer 

01:37:01.323 --> 01:37:03.323
is actually from data we found 
online.

01:37:05.615 --> 01:37:08.492
So someone publicly made 
available JSON did the that that

01:37:08.493 --> 01:37:11.803
shows all of the current 
stadiums in the U.S.  It was 

01:37:11.804 --> 01:37:14.235
easy to overlay that on the map.
You might find a dataset in a 

01:37:14.236 --> 01:37:17.094
standard format and bring it in 
yourself.  Now you can make more

01:37:17.095 --> 01:37:20.771
sense of the data.  The other 
thing is we wanted to see how 

01:37:20.772 --> 01:37:23.421
hard it would be for us to make 
our own dataset.  Thanks to hard

01:37:23.422 --> 01:37:25.444
work on the team if you turn on 
the second one, we built a 

01:37:27.703 --> 01:37:29.735
dataset that has team locations.
So this can sort of aggregate 

01:37:29.736 --> 01:37:32.586
with that other data, it gives 
you a sense of where teams are 

01:37:32.587 --> 01:37:34.653
today and where they were.  And 
you can start to look at how the

01:37:36.313 --> 01:37:38.720
items correspond with those team
locations.  So this is just a 

01:37:38.721 --> 01:37:41.395
sort of hint of what you could 
overlay on here.  It uses the 

01:37:41.396 --> 01:37:45.263
standard format.  So the idea is
you could bring in your own data

01:37:45.264 --> 01:37:47.264
very easily and add it to our 
collection and our data.

01:37:49.815 --> 01:37:52.647
&gt;&gt; Great.  All right.  We can go
back to the presentation.

01:38:00.621 --> 01:38:02.852
I think we're just about -- so 
that link, that short link 

01:38:02.853 --> 01:38:06.388
there, that is where the current
tool is now.  We're also going 

01:38:06.389 --> 01:38:08.389
to be linking that 

01:38:09.487 --> 01:38:11.741
with -- on our experiments page 
on labs.  And we'll continue to,

01:38:11.742 --> 01:38:14.786
you know, work on it. 
So what's next?

01:38:19.084 --> 01:38:21.084
We do want to finish building 
this.

01:38:23.367 --> 01:38:25.367
And we do want users to come use
it 

01:38:26.976 --> 01:38:30.585
and give us feedback and add 
different layers.  So we want to

01:38:30.586 --> 01:38:32.586
give some instructions 

01:38:35.524 --> 01:38:37.524
on how to do that and sort of 
more -- 

01:38:39.208 --> 01:38:42.050
and we do similarly to JSTOR, we
are really interested in 

01:38:42.051 --> 01:38:44.147
different sort of crowdsourcing 
aspects of how this kind 

01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:50.270
of presentation of data could 
work.  We're interested in 

01:38:50.271 --> 01:38:52.271
adding different 

01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:55.590
organizations, different types 
of data 

01:38:57.289 --> 01:38:59.289
to our set.

01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:03.227
And continuing to sort of learn 
more.  One of the big sort of 

01:39:03.228 --> 01:39:05.228
goals of this 

01:39:06.477 --> 01:39:10.210
week was just to sort of have 
this week.  We're done now.  So 

01:39:10.211 --> 01:39:12.677
that was a complete success.  
But we really want to sort of 

01:39:12.678 --> 01:39:16.766
model this same type of process 
with other groups, other groups 

01:39:16.767 --> 01:39:18.767
inside the Library of Congress, 
other groups outside of the 

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:22.469
Library of Congress.  So we're 
really happy with how everything

01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:25.548
went.  We're really excited to 
do more of this kind of thing 

01:39:25.549 --> 01:39:27.549
and share our 

01:39:29.889 --> 01:39:32.528
collections in different and 
more ways like we've just showed

01:39:32.529 --> 01:39:35.392
you, and like JSTOR just showed 
you.  So with that, that is our 

01:39:36.196 --> 01:39:38.196
demonstration.  And we can take 
any questions that you have.

01:39:42.287 --> 01:39:44.287
And I should also say I'm sure

01:39:46.257 --> 01:39:47.475
the other folks would take 
questions if you have questions 

01:39:47.476 --> 01:39:50.465
for them. 

01:39:54.230 --> 01:39:56.230
We have a question, two 
questions.

01:40:05.475 --> 01:40:07.710
&gt;&gt; Could I ask you about the raw
data?  

01:40:12.144 --> 01:40:14.144
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can go back to the

01:40:15.678 --> 01:40:18.198
demo and back to the browser, 
and then there's a raw data link

01:40:18.199 --> 01:40:24.134
at the top.  
&gt;&gt; I think you opened it.  It's 

01:40:24.135 --> 01:40:26.135
those next tabs.  
&gt;&gt; Yeah.  Yeah.

01:40:29.481 --> 01:40:33.209
&gt;&gt; So this is the sequel 
database that you created and 

01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:35.296
worked on?  
&gt;&gt; The nice thing is if you -- 

01:40:35.297 --> 01:40:37.297
&gt;&gt; Here.  

01:40:38.553 --> 01:40:40.553
&gt;&gt; If you click on items, you'll
see the raw item records.

01:40:43.661 --> 01:40:45.738
But the other record -- and you 
can see there's one issue we 

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:49.862
didn't have to deal -- time to 
deal with this week which is 

01:40:49.863 --> 01:40:52.527
normalizing multivalue items.  
We have an answer for that.  

01:40:52.528 --> 01:40:54.528
It's just not ready yet.  But 
basically, at the top there, 

01:40:57.408 --> 01:40:59.088
there's a sequel query builder. 
If you wanted to, you could 

01:40:59.089 --> 01:41:01.089
filter 

01:41:02.427 --> 01:41:04.913
things and just do arbitrary 
expressions for how to group or 

01:41:04.914 --> 01:41:09.191
coalesce things.  So one simple 
example when we're looking at 

01:41:09.192 --> 01:41:11.192
the data, we have data coming in
from a number of sources.

01:41:12.476 --> 01:41:14.100
And fending on what you might 
want to use as a title for an 

01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:16.173
item, the answer can vary 
depending on where it came from 

01:41:18.215 --> 01:41:20.060
and what metadata it had.  
Sequel query, we could say pick 

01:41:20.061 --> 01:41:23.310
the first of these that isn't 
empty and pull that in.  And 

01:41:23.311 --> 01:41:24.946
that makes it easier to give 
somebody a link that shows them 

01:41:24.947 --> 01:41:29.014
things and not have to explain, 
oh, for items like that go look 

01:41:29.015 --> 01:41:31.272
over in this column.  We can cut
that out.  You've done that work

01:41:31.273 --> 01:41:34.999
once.  You don't have to think 
about it again.  If we go back 

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.039
and click on either the 
geography or location columns, 

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.135
these are also specific things 
that were present in the 

01:41:41.136 --> 01:41:43.136
dataset.  And so one of the nice
things we were 

01:41:45.602 --> 01:41:47.602
able to geocode them and then 
the viewer 

01:41:48.644 --> 01:41:50.644
-- oh, go back one more screen 
here to 

01:41:53.116 --> 01:41:55.116
the main list of all the tables.

01:41:57.264 --> 01:41:59.748
And click on either location or 
geography.  This allows you to 

01:41:59.749 --> 01:42:01.749
view those directly.  It also 
just puts them all on the map 

01:42:02.248 --> 01:42:06.363
for you.  So this is a great 
way.  We were able to do the 

01:42:06.364 --> 01:42:10.247
data QA while the main viewer 
was being worked on because 

01:42:10.248 --> 01:42:11.678
somebody else can go look at 
that list and say do we really 

01:42:11.679 --> 01:42:14.951
have an item from this location?
Or confirm that the thing we got

01:42:14.952 --> 01:42:16.952
out 

01:42:18.474 --> 01:42:20.727
of the subject list for 
Salisbury, Maryland, was what it

01:42:20.728 --> 01:42:22.974
geocoded to but it should have 
been North Carolina.  And those 

01:42:22.975 --> 01:42:25.623
are the kind of issues that you 
have for any dataset like this 

01:42:25.624 --> 01:42:29.499
where we're trying to link a 
nonprecise entity to a real 

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.738
value.  And that was great being
able just to 

01:42:35.429 --> 01:42:37.456
let somebody else do that 
independently.  And this is, I 

01:42:37.457 --> 01:42:39.090
think, kind of a nice example 
because you could also explore 

01:42:39.091 --> 01:42:40.943
this.
You could click on any entry in 

01:42:40.944 --> 01:42:46.076
that subject table and show you 
which items it's linked to.  So 

01:42:46.077 --> 01:42:47.518
if you wanted to do some sort of
filtered query or just browsing 

01:42:47.519 --> 01:42:52.005
around that we didn't 
anticipate, that's there as a 

01:42:52.006 --> 01:42:54.043
safety mechanism before you get 
to the point of, well, now you 

01:42:54.044 --> 01:42:57.332
have to load the data and build 
your own tool to query it.  

01:42:58.349 --> 01:43:00.583
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks.  One more 
question?

01:43:03.868 --> 01:43:05.721
On a scale from first base to 
home run, how fun was this?  

01:43:08.733 --> 01:43:12.481
[ Laughter ] 
&gt;&gt; If this is also I was working

01:43:12.482 --> 01:43:16.761
on this week, definitely a home 
run.  I'd say a triple.  Really 

01:43:16.762 --> 01:43:20.663
great.  I work for OCIO so I 
don't get to work with the labs 

01:43:20.664 --> 01:43:22.692
team all the time but it was 
really wonderful working with a 

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:24.942
really enthusiastic group of 
people, having Chris on the 

01:43:24.943 --> 01:43:28.443
team.  Everybody just worked 
really well together.  And that 

01:43:28.444 --> 01:43:30.937
certainly makes it more 
enjoyable.  It was also fun to 

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:35.581
go from having nothing to having
a functional tool and having 

01:43:35.582 --> 01:43:37.204
that tool validated by users, 
listening to them say how useful

01:43:37.205 --> 01:43:40.957
it would be, how they'd find 
things they didn't think they'd 

01:43:40.958 --> 01:43:44.236
be able to find and all that 
kind of stuff.  It was 

01:43:44.237 --> 01:43:48.976
definitely a great week.  
&gt;&gt; Thanks.  

01:43:49.191 --> 01:43:51.191
&gt;&gt; Okay.  All right.  

01:43:53.515 --> 01:43:55.515
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if you 
have a data 

01:43:56.792 --> 01:43:57.816
visualization of the number of 
baseball puns used throughout 

01:43:57.817 --> 01:44:00.898
the week.  
&gt;&gt; We have a running list.

01:44:04.806 --> 01:44:06.837
Yeah, I think our Courtney who's
been leading our communications 

01:44:06.838 --> 01:44:08.903
has utilized almost all of them,
I think.

01:44:13.404 --> 01:44:15.655
But, yeah, that's a subgoal of 
the week.  All baseball idioms 

01:44:15.656 --> 01:44:23.197
all the time.  All right.  Any 
other questions?  All right.  If

01:44:23.198 --> 01:44:25.198
there's no more questions, then 
we will break for lunch.

01:44:28.772 --> 01:44:30.772
And then we are back here at 
1:15.

01:44:32.083 --> 01:44:34.738
We will have a great panel 
discussion with some baseball 

01:44:34.739 --> 01:44:36.739
experts, scholars and fans, and 
we hope that you all come back 

01:44:37.546 --> 01:44:42.691
and ask your questions.  So 
we'll see you at 1:15.  

01:44:45.687 --> 01:44:47.687
[ Applause ] 

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:34.876
. . 

01:57:19.304 --> 01:57:21.304
. . . .

02:07:27.604 --> 02:07:29.604
. . . .

02:20:32.365 --> 02:20:34.365
. . . .

02:41:52.508 --> 02:41:54.508
. . . .

03:01:28.590 --> 03:01:30.590
. . . .

03:19:58.920 --> 03:20:00.920
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome back.

03:20:03.598 --> 03:20:05.598
To our Inside Baseball event.

03:20:07.478 --> 03:20:09.478
For this afternoon, we'll have a
great 

03:20:11.749 --> 03:20:13.749
panel discussion featuring -- 
moderated 

03:20:15.622 --> 03:20:17.488
by our very own Meghan Ferriter,
senior innovation specialist 

03:20:17.489 --> 03:20:19.489
here at the Library of Congress 
labs.

03:20:21.374 --> 03:20:23.224
She's also a sports scholar and 
will be acknowledged to our 

03:20:23.225 --> 03:20:25.225
grill our guests 

03:20:26.685 --> 03:20:28.970
-- not grill them -- but have a 
conversation about baseball and 

03:20:28.971 --> 03:20:33.055
how it has influenced and 
reflected our History and 

03:20:33.056 --> 03:20:37.370
Culture.  I'm going to announce 
the panelists, and they're all 

03:20:37.371 --> 03:20:39.371
going to come out here.  But I 
want to let you know that this 

03:20:40.453 --> 03:20:42.453
is being livestreamed.

03:20:43.932 --> 03:20:45.563
And the video will be archived 
at the Library of Congress, so 

03:20:45.564 --> 03:20:49.025
you will be able to watch this 
again.  And again and again if 

03:20:49.026 --> 03:20:51.026
you want.

03:20:52.857 --> 03:20:54.891
So first the panelists, Jordan 
Ellenberg is a mathematician and

03:20:54.892 --> 03:20:59.181
author, and he uses math to 
uncover the hidden patterns that

03:20:59.182 --> 03:21:01.421
guide our daily lives.  He's a 
professor at the University of 

03:21:05.301 --> 03:21:07.542
Wisconsin-Madison and his book 
how not to be wrong: The power 

03:21:07.543 --> 03:21:09.543
of mathematical thinking is New 
York times' best-seller 

03:21:13.032 --> 03:21:15.271
and one of Bill Gates' ten 
favorite books.  Clinton Yates 

03:21:15.272 --> 03:21:17.713
is a radio host, commentator and
columnist for ESPN's 

03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:23.428
"the undefeated" and a 
Washington Post alumnus.  His 

03:21:23.429 --> 03:21:25.429
work examines the intersections 

03:21:27.769 --> 03:21:29.813
between pop culture, politics, 
race and athletics in 

03:21:29.814 --> 03:21:33.899
contemporary American life.  And
then finally, we have Rob Ruck. 

03:21:33.900 --> 03:21:36.556
He is a sports historian and 
professor at the University of 

03:21:36.557 --> 03:21:38.587
Pittsburgh, whose research 
traces the dynamics of race in 

03:21:40.218 --> 03:21:42.459
majorMajor League Baseball.  
He's recognized as an authority 

03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:44.460
on the 

03:21:45.936 --> 03:21:46.905
history of the Negro 
leagueLeagues and Latinos in 

03:21:46.906 --> 03:21:51.745
baseball.  Ruck's repeat 
publications include the 2011 

03:21:51.746 --> 03:21:54.596
book "Raceball."   So we'll get 
started with our panel.

03:21:59.614 --> 03:22:02.941
[ Applause ] 
I welcome them out.

03:22:09.898 --> 03:22:14.805
&gt;&gt; I think it only matters so 
we're not so close to each other

03:22:14.806 --> 03:22:17.034
that we can't hear each other 
afterwards.  Thanks everyone for

03:22:17.035 --> 03:22:20.506
being here.  Thanks to those of 
you who have tuned back into the

03:22:20.507 --> 03:22:22.568
livestream or if you were here 
already, already have feedback 

03:22:22.569 --> 03:22:26.258
on things that would be 
extremely helpful for sports 

03:22:26.259 --> 03:22:27.889
journalists and performing 
research using cultural history 

03:22:27.890 --> 03:22:31.551
baseball cards.  And if you're 
just tuning into the livestream,

03:22:31.552 --> 03:22:33.368
again, you may have missed this 
morning.  We had some sessions 

03:22:33.369 --> 03:22:38.470
where we were describing a 
week-long process of exploreing 

03:22:38.471 --> 03:22:40.471
collections from the Library of 
Congress, the National Museum of

03:22:41.131 --> 03:22:43.131
African-American History and 
Culture, 

03:22:45.420 --> 03:22:46.844
and articles in JSTOR and the 
JSTOR databases which gave us 

03:22:46.845 --> 03:22:48.890
starting points of conversation.
But the whole reason that we 

03:22:48.891 --> 03:22:52.156
wanted to do this and connect 
with you all is that we have a 

03:22:52.157 --> 03:22:55.835
baseball Americana exhibit here 
at the library.  It opened only 

03:22:55.836 --> 03:22:57.836
about two weeks ago.  We are 
hearing a lot of really 

03:22:57.883 --> 03:22:59.517
interesting things.  And we 
started our week with a tour of 

03:22:59.518 --> 03:23:02.388
that.  We're going to end our 
week with another tour of that 

03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:07.070
space.  And we heard from the 
docents that some of the themes 

03:23:07.071 --> 03:23:10.966
that they are emphasizing and 
the stories that they're telling

03:23:10.967 --> 03:23:12.592
are around convening community 
and paralleling America's 

03:23:12.593 --> 03:23:14.593
history.

03:23:15.851 --> 03:23:18.295
So I wonder if Jordan, you want 
to lead us and step up to the 

03:23:18.296 --> 03:23:21.990
plate first here.  Don't worry, 
we'll talk about some language 

03:23:21.991 --> 03:23:24.233
and baseball idioms as well.  
What are your thoughts around 

03:23:24.234 --> 03:23:26.234
the ways that baseball brings 
people together?

03:23:31.928 --> 03:23:34.252
Jk 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like batting 

03:23:34.253 --> 03:23:36.697
practice.  
&gt;&gt; Also a little bit like a 

03:23:36.698 --> 03:23:38.537
softball pitch.  
&gt;&gt; Well, at least for me, one of

03:23:38.538 --> 03:23:40.538
the things that's so interesting
about the 

03:23:43.866 --> 03:23:44.891
community of let's say fandom.  
That's not the only community 

03:23:44.892 --> 03:23:48.761
around baseball.  There's a 
community of players, people who

03:23:48.762 --> 03:23:51.201
work in baseball, et cetera, et 
cetera.  When I think about the 

03:23:51.202 --> 03:23:53.202
community of fandom which is a 
community that I'm a 

03:23:57.319 --> 03:23:58.537
part of, I think it's 
interesting how chosen of a 

03:23:58.538 --> 03:24:01.192
community it is, right?  Some of
the communities that we're part 

03:24:01.193 --> 03:24:06.074
of we are born into.  You know, 
we don't choose our family.  We 

03:24:06.075 --> 03:24:08.752
don't choose our history.  We do
on some level choose our team 

03:24:10.798 --> 03:24:12.798
that we root for, and yet our 
commitment 

03:24:14.081 --> 03:24:16.972
to that, and I think for most of
us emotionally I think it feels 

03:24:16.973 --> 03:24:20.231
-- is it okay to say -- just as 
deep as our commitment to our 

03:24:20.232 --> 03:24:23.494
historical communities that 
we're part of.  And I think that

03:24:23.495 --> 03:24:25.540
can be like a really good 
learning to think about, like, 

03:24:25.541 --> 03:24:27.541
what 

03:24:28.848 --> 03:24:30.278
does community mean, if I feel 
it so strongly at the same time 

03:24:30.279 --> 03:24:32.279
as I chose it myself, I could 
have chosen something 

03:24:34.594 --> 03:24:37.461
else, in some sense it's 
arbitrary as I think Jerry 

03:24:37.462 --> 03:24:39.512
Seinfeld said, you're rooting 
for laundry, yes, but it 

03:24:39.513 --> 03:24:41.535
matters.  
&gt;&gt; Clinton, Jordan's speaking a 

03:24:41.536 --> 03:24:43.582
little bit to passion.  And you 
do a lot of communicating with 

03:24:45.837 --> 03:24:47.469
people in various media spaces, 
on radio and TV and social media

03:24:47.470 --> 03:24:51.358
spaces.  And I think social 
media is a place where 

03:24:51.359 --> 03:24:53.359
interesting communities convene.

03:24:56.046 --> 03:24:58.046
&gt;&gt; This is true.

03:25:01.148 --> 03:25:01.962
Is Can you share something 
that's either new or interesting

03:25:01.963 --> 03:25:04.196
about communities?  
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think one of the 

03:25:04.197 --> 03:25:07.995
things that's foregotten about 
history.  You can talk about the

03:25:07.996 --> 03:25:10.261
history and the math, but in 
sport itself, the communal 

03:25:11.883 --> 03:25:13.515
context of how it exists, 
everybody has to watch two 

03:25:13.516 --> 03:25:15.516
people do one thing.  And that 
is a very interesting 

03:25:16.778 --> 03:25:18.241
relationship in terms of how it 
forces you to understand the 

03:25:18.242 --> 03:25:20.288
concept of team and the concept 
of performance and the 

03:25:24.992 --> 03:25:26.831
concept of failure in, you know,
the communal sense.  And I think

03:25:26.832 --> 03:25:28.832
that's a large part about 

03:25:29.892 --> 03:25:31.945
why people attract themselves, 
baseball is attractive to them 

03:25:31.946 --> 03:25:34.378
and why it explains about how 
you have to communicate.  

03:25:34.379 --> 03:25:37.059
There's an umpire.  There's a 
manager.  Everybody on the bench

03:25:37.060 --> 03:25:39.060
wears a uniform.  You know what 
I'm saying?

03:25:41.773 --> 03:25:43.773
It's very different 
communication in 

03:25:44.849 --> 03:25:47.310
terms of the basic fundamentals 
of the game that I think apply 

03:25:47.311 --> 03:25:50.773
to how people relate to it, you 
know?  So the laundry in one way

03:25:50.774 --> 03:25:52.802
is very important in a certain 
way because 

03:25:56.456 --> 03:25:59.706
you're not wearing helmets.  
You're not wearing shorts.  

03:25:59.707 --> 03:26:01.947
You're wearing pants and a 
shirt, a button and a belt.  You

03:26:01.948 --> 03:26:04.188
know what I mean?  It is very 
much about a sort of very 

03:26:05.827 --> 03:26:07.827
normalized process that I think 
brings a lot of people together.

03:26:09.671 --> 03:26:12.117
When you talk about social media
and how different people come 

03:26:12.118 --> 03:26:16.144
toward it, everybody is allowed 
to like as a result of all those

03:26:16.145 --> 03:26:18.376
different things going on, a 
different part of the game, you 

03:26:18.377 --> 03:26:21.877
know?  And that's very much, I 
think, what attracts a lot of 

03:26:21.878 --> 03:26:23.878
people to baseball.

03:26:25.339 --> 03:26:26.966
Most people who like baseball 
probably don't even know how to 

03:26:26.967 --> 03:26:29.400
score a game, you know, but they
enjoy the environment around it.

03:26:32.665 --> 03:26:35.713
They enjoy the sounds and sights
of the game.  Without even 

03:26:35.714 --> 03:26:38.357
necessarily caring what happens.
That's a large part that 

03:26:38.358 --> 03:26:42.443
baseball brings to the American 
sporting landscape that I think 

03:26:42.444 --> 03:26:47.149
a lot of other sports have not 
found a way to tap into and why 

03:26:47.150 --> 03:26:49.150
ultimately it is considered 

03:26:50.605 --> 03:26:52.942
America's pastime is because it 
hasn't changed much.  And people

03:26:52.943 --> 03:26:55.179
kind of like that because people
enjoy that in their communities.

03:26:55.385 --> 03:26:59.295
&gt;&gt; Speaking about numbers and 
people not being able to, like, 

03:26:59.296 --> 03:27:02.777
maybe create a scorecard, fill 
it out, even read it afterwards 

03:27:02.778 --> 03:27:06.038
and know what different 
annotations between.  We had a 

03:27:06.039 --> 03:27:08.059
lot of people who asked us 
questions as we were working on 

03:27:09.689 --> 03:27:12.342
prototypes, were we going to 
bring in statistical data.  We 

03:27:12.343 --> 03:27:14.587
said we want to put in some of 
these cultural stories.  I 

03:27:14.588 --> 03:27:15.813
wonder if you can reflect on the
types of communities that formed

03:27:15.814 --> 03:27:19.692
around baseball in Pittsburgh 
and some of your work that 

03:27:19.693 --> 03:27:21.693
you've shared about those types 
of teams and people.  

03:27:23.234 --> 03:27:24.469
&gt;&gt; I'm glad you're not asking me
a statistical question.  

03:27:24.470 --> 03:27:28.340
[ Laughter ] 
&gt;&gt; I'm here, don't worry.  

03:27:28.341 --> 03:27:31.399
Jordan's got that covered.  
&gt;&gt; You know, I'm much more 

03:27:31.400 --> 03:27:34.238
interested in what sport means 
to people than the game itself.

03:27:37.286 --> 03:27:39.286
And when you look at a place 
like 

03:27:40.755 --> 03:27:42.755
Pittsburgh, where baseball was 
the 

03:27:44.211 --> 03:27:47.472
sport, was the pastime for quite
a while, it no longer is.  You 

03:27:47.473 --> 03:27:49.473
see that it allowed different 

03:27:50.924 --> 03:27:51.734
groups of people to feel 
included in a sense of 

03:27:51.735 --> 03:27:56.637
community.  I mean, that whole 
notion of baseball as the 

03:27:56.638 --> 03:27:59.078
ultimate vehicle of 
Americanization for the children

03:27:59.079 --> 03:28:01.079
of 

03:28:02.370 --> 03:28:04.222
immigrants I think is pretty 
valid.  Where that broke down, 

03:28:04.223 --> 03:28:06.223
of course, was over questions of
race.

03:28:08.113 --> 03:28:10.113
And during the half century or 
so that 

03:28:11.604 --> 03:28:13.029
the major leagues were 
segregated, black Pittsburgh 

03:28:13.030 --> 03:28:15.030
created a sporting world of 
itself.

03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:20.950
And an amazing one with two 
Negro League franchises.

03:28:23.436 --> 03:28:26.096
7 of the first 11 men of the 
Negro League selected to the 

03:28:26.097 --> 03:28:28.097
Hall of Fame came 

03:28:29.566 --> 03:28:31.566
to Pittsburgh and much more ever
since.

03:28:32.813 --> 03:28:35.279
But you look at that community, 
that black community, which was 

03:28:35.280 --> 03:28:37.313
fractured by geography, by 
whether they were the old 

03:28:38.329 --> 03:28:40.579
Pittsburghers who had come from 
the northern part of the South 

03:28:40.580 --> 03:28:42.857
in the 1890s, who were better 
off, better educated and 

03:28:47.350 --> 03:28:49.384
lighter-skinned or those who 
came during World War I and 

03:28:49.385 --> 03:28:51.385
after from the Black Belt who 
were not, you saw that it 

03:28:53.710 --> 03:28:55.710
created a sense of community for
black Pittsburgh.

03:28:58.597 --> 03:29:00.597
Which allowed them as the Negro 

03:29:02.296 --> 03:29:04.296
Leagues formed in the '20s and 
had this 

03:29:08.242 --> 03:29:11.303
ak Pell archipelago to feel a 
part of black America.  And I 

03:29:11.304 --> 03:29:13.364
think that had a profound impact
on the ability to build cohesion

03:29:13.365 --> 03:29:15.365
and a 

03:29:16.604 --> 03:29:18.243
positive sense of collective 
self which lasted for quite a 

03:29:18.244 --> 03:29:21.113
while.  
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for 

03:29:21.114 --> 03:29:23.168
sharing more about that.  During
lunch today we talked a little 

03:29:26.835 --> 03:29:28.038
bit about Clinton led us out on 
this one, describing the ways 

03:29:28.039 --> 03:29:32.356
that professionalization of 
major league sports may make the

03:29:32.357 --> 03:29:35.239
sport less enjoyable.  So I 
wonder if you can -- because 

03:29:35.240 --> 03:29:38.530
it's predictable, I should say, 
not less enjoyable, predictable 

03:29:38.531 --> 03:29:40.531
in the sense of it's routine.  
There's less variety.

03:29:43.624 --> 03:29:47.294
There's less excitement over 
what might happen.  And so I 

03:29:47.295 --> 03:29:48.918
wonder if you, Clinton, if you'd
like to respond and maybe lead 

03:29:48.919 --> 03:29:53.423
on your thoughts on this, some 
of the ways that amateur sport 

03:29:53.424 --> 03:29:55.669
or collegiate sports and how 
baseball formed in those 

03:29:57.306 --> 03:29:59.357
communities or in those spaces 
tell us different kinds of 

03:29:59.358 --> 03:30:01.358
stories than professional 
sports.  

03:30:02.481 --> 03:30:04.481
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's actually
a large 

03:30:05.733 --> 03:30:08.177
part of why sort of 
regionization of baseball has 

03:30:08.178 --> 03:30:10.200
led to the sport at the highest 
level of not being as popular as

03:30:11.057 --> 03:30:13.693
other leagues.  Major league 
baseball acts like they're the 

03:30:13.694 --> 03:30:15.716
only form of baseball that 
exists, when in reality, you 

03:30:15.717 --> 03:30:18.972
look at somebody like me, I grew
up playing baseball.  I played 

03:30:18.973 --> 03:30:23.455
here in D.C.  I can name you, 
within, you know, a couple relay

03:30:23.456 --> 03:30:27.344
throws, ten fields I've played 
on in the city.  And that is 

03:30:27.345 --> 03:30:29.812
what baseball is to me, you 
know?  People tell me all the 

03:30:29.813 --> 03:30:33.701
time, oh, my God, how do you 
watch cleej baseball?  I can't 

03:30:33.702 --> 03:30:35.702
deal with the metal bats.  You 
must not have played a lot of 

03:30:37.573 --> 03:30:39.626
baseball growing up.  That's not
real.  What are you talking 

03:30:39.627 --> 03:30:41.627
about?  So what I'm saying -- 
and the reason I 

03:30:45.338 --> 03:30:47.338
bring that up is because it is 
-- it's 

03:30:48.798 --> 03:30:50.437
important to understand that, 
like, what you're referring to 

03:30:50.438 --> 03:30:54.529
in terms of the Negro Leagues 
and how that community came 

03:30:54.530 --> 03:30:57.997
together was about more than 
just achievement at the top.  

03:30:57.998 --> 03:30:59.487
People played because they liked
playing baseball, and that's 

03:30:59.488 --> 03:31:02.973
what's cool about it.  You know,
you go to a high school game.  

03:31:02.974 --> 03:31:06.049
People show up.  The kids are 
there to play.  They're not 

03:31:06.050 --> 03:31:08.101
playing to go to college.  
They're not trying to 

03:31:08.102 --> 03:31:10.979
necessarily make the pros.  They
enjoy spitting seeds and talking

03:31:12.812 --> 03:31:14.849
trash to their friends and 
hitting the ball and picking it 

03:31:14.850 --> 03:31:17.098
up and putting it down.  If 
you're yoonl understanding of 

03:31:17.099 --> 03:31:22.013
what the game is exists from 
just the top level down, you're 

03:31:22.014 --> 03:31:24.103
really selling yourself short on
what a lot of the community of 

03:31:24.104 --> 03:31:27.971
baseball is.  That's why I go to
so many minor league games.  

03:31:27.972 --> 03:31:29.186
That's why I like coaching 
baseball.  Because you're 

03:31:29.187 --> 03:31:31.187
involved with it on a community 
level that is more than just 

03:31:32.875 --> 03:31:35.319
about the achievement, the 
contracts, the trophies, you 

03:31:35.320 --> 03:31:37.320
know, and the TV time.  And that
ultimately to me is what 

03:31:40.668 --> 03:31:42.741
gives back a lot more than any 
what I see on television.  You 

03:31:42.742 --> 03:31:44.742
know, it's knowing the people I 

03:31:46.135 --> 03:31:47.768
know from the game and what I 
was given as a human in terms of

03:31:47.769 --> 03:31:51.448
understanding what it takes to 
you know, make it work.  And 

03:31:51.449 --> 03:31:53.449
that's still something that 
sticks with me.  

03:31:53.738 --> 03:31:54.345
&gt;&gt; I mean, if I can jump in on 
that.  

03:31:54.346 --> 03:31:56.346
&gt;&gt; Of course.  

03:31:58.438 --> 03:31:59.866
&gt;&gt; I mean, one thing, because I 
spoke to from this top-town 

03:31:59.867 --> 03:32:03.760
point of view.  It's very true, 
if you're a fan of your favorite

03:32:03.761 --> 03:32:05.761
sitcom, you're not going 

03:32:06.829 --> 03:32:08.890
to set up four TV cameras with 
your friends.  The only way 

03:32:08.891 --> 03:32:10.552
you're going to experience it is
through the professional lens.  

03:32:10.553 --> 03:32:14.011
&gt;&gt; Or turn it on YouTube, man.  
&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably more now than 

03:32:14.012 --> 03:32:18.287
before.  As you think with 
baseball and with respect to 

03:32:18.288 --> 03:32:20.322
regionalization, I grew up in 
Maryland and hardly anybody I 

03:32:20.323 --> 03:32:23.195
knew played Little League.  Now 
in Wisconsin, and what I have 

03:32:25.651 --> 03:32:27.705
learned is my son plays.  And I 
go there and, like, there's 

03:32:29.139 --> 03:32:31.167
parents there whose kids are not
even in the game.  People in 

03:32:31.168 --> 03:32:33.168
Wisconsin, they'll just drive 
down to the Little League field 

03:32:34.492 --> 03:32:35.291
because you know one of your 
neighbor's kids is going to be 

03:32:35.292 --> 03:32:37.129
there and you're going to see 
people you know or something 

03:32:37.130 --> 03:32:39.130
like that.  
&gt;&gt; Right.  

03:32:39.564 --> 03:32:40.591
&gt;&gt; So I think it is really 
different in different parts of 

03:32:40.592 --> 03:32:44.869
the country.  And there you see 
this extremely organic kind of 

03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:49.604
fandom.  I shouldn't even call 
it fandom.  Organic involvement 

03:32:49.605 --> 03:32:51.605
with baseball -- and if you 
think college baseball is 

03:32:53.016 --> 03:32:54.034
unpredictable, watch 
12-year-olds.  That's a 

03:32:54.035 --> 03:32:55.873
different story entirely.  
[ Laughter ] 

03:32:55.874 --> 03:32:58.543
&gt;&gt; Tell me about it, man.  
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking of two different

03:32:58.544 --> 03:33:01.416
lines of thoughts.  I'm going to
put them together in the same 

03:33:01.417 --> 03:33:03.417
space.  I've heard a little 
mention about some 

03:33:06.360 --> 03:33:08.594
of the artifacts or objects of 
baseball, some of the things, a 

03:33:08.595 --> 03:33:11.040
metal bat versus a wooden bat, 
the uniform that you wear, what 

03:33:11.041 --> 03:33:13.041
you're representing.

03:33:14.097 --> 03:33:15.314
And in some of our work we're 
looking at these collection 

03:33:15.315 --> 03:33:18.779
items.  We are thinking about 
the data.  There's also the 

03:33:18.780 --> 03:33:23.064
representation of an image, what
does that show us?  And I 

03:33:23.065 --> 03:33:25.099
wonder, Rob, if you can share or
reflect on how some of the 

03:33:25.100 --> 03:33:29.384
spaces of baseball or items or 
objects of baseball are changing

03:33:29.385 --> 03:33:32.275
and how that connects to the 
types of the forms of baseball 

03:33:32.276 --> 03:33:35.121
that we see played today or 
other people have played in the 

03:33:35.122 --> 03:33:37.148
past.  
&gt;&gt; Most of the work I've done on

03:33:41.459 --> 03:33:43.459
baseball has been in the 
Caribbean or in 

03:33:44.947 --> 03:33:46.947
black communityies, looking at 
baseball 

03:33:49.028 --> 03:33:52.723
pretty much before integration. 
-- artifacts.  What you have are

03:33:52.724 --> 03:33:55.172
memories.  If you're lucky, you 
find photos.

03:34:00.843 --> 03:34:02.843
The amount of footage is scant

03:34:04.598 --> 03:34:07.270
.  I think, you know, the last 
25 years or so as baseball has 

03:34:07.271 --> 03:34:09.271
become 

03:34:10.328 --> 03:34:13.377
overcapitalized, there's 
increasing stuff.  But in some 

03:34:13.378 --> 03:34:16.423
ways to me, it has less meaning.
It's noise.  The same way I feel

03:34:16.424 --> 03:34:18.424
when I go to a 

03:34:19.493 --> 03:34:21.493
major league ball game, which is
why I 

03:34:22.640 --> 03:34:24.640
don't feel it's as enjoyable as 
a minor 

03:34:26.959 --> 03:34:28.475
league or a Caribbean or a 
little leagueLittle League game 

03:34:28.476 --> 03:34:30.476
because you can't even hear the 
person next to you talk.

03:34:33.050 --> 03:34:35.104
You feel overwhelmed by it.  So 
I'm probably not the one to 

03:34:35.105 --> 03:34:38.044
answer your question.  
&gt;&gt; No, I think that's a perfect 

03:34:38.045 --> 03:34:42.767
way to connect to spaces that 
may be disappearing.  Go ahead, 

03:34:42.768 --> 03:34:47.684
clipt Clinton.  
&gt;&gt; (Away from mic) I was there 

03:34:47.685 --> 03:34:50.154
recently and I wanted to point 
out.  My mother is in the crowd.

03:34:52.375 --> 03:34:54.413
She's from Kansas City, 
Missouri.  The major league 

03:34:54.414 --> 03:34:56.414
baseball museum is there.

03:34:58.690 --> 03:35:00.104
The What it does is, to your 
point about things being scant, 

03:35:00.105 --> 03:35:03.154
that is very true.  There's not 
a ton.  But there is a lot of it

03:35:03.155 --> 03:35:06.228
there.  And what it does -- 
that's interesting -- and this 

03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:09.692
is not necessarily correlated, I
just thought to bring it up -- 

03:35:09.693 --> 03:35:11.727
you realize that what it 
chronicles is as much the 

03:35:11.728 --> 03:35:14.847
history of America as it is the 
history of many things, not 

03:35:14.848 --> 03:35:17.496
necessarily baseball related, 
you know.  And that's sort of 

03:35:17.497 --> 03:35:20.944
what, you know, speaking to your
point about how sports affects 

03:35:20.945 --> 03:35:23.835
people, you know, one of the 
first women owners in sports was

03:35:23.836 --> 03:35:26.292
in the Negro Leagues.  One of 
the first times where they 

03:35:28.770 --> 03:35:30.394
played in those outside U.S. 
communities first, be it the 

03:35:30.395 --> 03:35:32.836
Caribbean, be it Japan, be it 
wherever, you know.

03:35:38.158 --> 03:35:40.812
And it is scant, but it is not 
nonexistent, you know.  And I 

03:35:40.813 --> 03:35:43.271
think that's why collections and
things of this ilk are important

03:35:43.272 --> 03:35:46.116
because everything at some point
becomes scant because you can't 

03:35:46.117 --> 03:35:48.368
keep everything.  You know what 
I mean?  But there are 

03:35:48.369 --> 03:35:51.839
collections that do these jobs 
to keep around what, you know, 

03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:55.175
what people could.  And it's 
really fascinating to look at, 

03:35:55.176 --> 03:35:58.043
you know.  
&gt;&gt; Korea enforced that.

03:36:01.703 --> 03:36:03.703
There's a reason why Buck 
O'Neill was 

03:36:04.786 --> 03:36:07.057
the star of Ken Burns' work on 
baseball.  And I think a much 

03:36:07.058 --> 03:36:09.058
more important 

03:36:10.341 --> 03:36:13.202
figure than Shelby Foot in the 
Civil War.  And Buck's memories 

03:36:13.203 --> 03:36:14.868
and stories and reflections 
steal the show.  

03:36:14.869 --> 03:36:17.525
&gt;&gt; Yeah.  
&gt;&gt; But it underscores how much 

03:36:17.526 --> 03:36:19.526
your 

03:36:22.012 --> 03:36:23.427
point is that questions of 
baseball or are questions of 

03:36:23.428 --> 03:36:26.297
American history.  And perhaps 
no more so than when it comes to

03:36:26.298 --> 03:36:30.788
race.  
&gt;&gt; First of all, I'll second the

03:36:32.622 --> 03:36:34.906
recommendation of the incredible
Negro leagues museum in Kansas 

03:36:34.907 --> 03:36:37.389
City which is I think one of the
best museums in America that 

03:36:37.390 --> 03:36:40.241
I've been to.  And that's also 
to say I think what you say is 

03:36:40.242 --> 03:36:42.509
very right.  So I teach math.  
That's what I do for a living.

03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:47.609
And I find that one way I tell 
stories about math as a teacher 

03:36:47.610 --> 03:36:49.610
is to tell stories about 
baseball because baseball 

03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:52.920
touches math through statistics.
And in the same way, you teach 

03:36:54.776 --> 03:36:56.208
history, Rob, and because 
baseball touches so many things,

03:36:56.209 --> 03:36:58.209
as teachers, one 

03:36:59.518 --> 03:37:01.164
of the ways we can teach 
whatever objective it is, 

03:37:01.165 --> 03:37:03.165
whether it's history, 

03:37:04.225 --> 03:37:05.874
whether it's sociology, 
African-American studies, 

03:37:05.875 --> 03:37:07.294
whether it's math, we can teach 
those through the lens of 

03:37:07.295 --> 03:37:11.390
baseball because baseball 
touches them all.  It's not just

03:37:11.391 --> 03:37:13.030
the story of American history, 
but it is the story of American 

03:37:13.031 --> 03:37:17.730
history.  It's the story of all 
those things put together.  I 

03:37:17.731 --> 03:37:19.777
mean, I meet a lot of kids who 
don't think they care about 

03:37:19.778 --> 03:37:22.661
math, but they know they care 
about baseball and which player 

03:37:22.662 --> 03:37:25.957
is better than another.  You may
-- I mean, you know, a kid who's

03:37:25.958 --> 03:37:31.082
a little kid today.  You say did
you know there was a time when a

03:37:31.083 --> 03:37:34.064
black man couldn't go to 
Woolworth's?  What's 

03:37:34.065 --> 03:37:37.159
Woolworth's?  When you say not 
everybody could play major 

03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:39.160
league baseball.  I think that's
as meaningful.  

03:37:40.828 --> 03:37:42.261
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, it's a huge 
discussion in the sports writer 

03:37:42.262 --> 03:37:44.262
world.

03:37:46.478 --> 03:37:49.037
I'm of the opinion before of if 
you played before immigration, 

03:37:50.061 --> 03:37:51.510
they throw those stats out.  
&gt;&gt; They didn't call it the white

03:37:51.511 --> 03:37:53.529
league.  
&gt;&gt; That's a huge point of 

03:37:53.530 --> 03:37:58.655
contention.  The most famous 
players in people's minds played

03:37:58.656 --> 03:38:00.479
long before integration.  Yeah. 
&gt;&gt; I think the math people get 

03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:02.480
that.  
&gt;&gt; Right.  

03:38:03.168 --> 03:38:04.817
&gt;&gt; If you talk about the 
mathiest people who study 

03:38:04.818 --> 03:38:07.489
baseball, they understand that 
there's a discount that you have

03:38:07.490 --> 03:38:09.490
to impose and you can't avoid 
that.  

03:38:12.589 --> 03:38:14.444
&gt;&gt; We've encountered that this 
week in data that don't match 

03:38:14.445 --> 03:38:17.316
each other, the words that we 
use with subjects we give things

03:38:17.317 --> 03:38:19.317
as professional organizations 

03:38:21.627 --> 03:38:22.842
that categorize nsks, how there 
may be a disconnect between the 

03:38:22.843 --> 03:38:25.912
stories we're talking about, the
oral histories, the discussion, 

03:38:25.913 --> 03:38:27.913
the ways that people talk 

03:38:29.375 --> 03:38:31.412
about baseball or life in 
general, which includes 

03:38:31.413 --> 03:38:33.413
recounting being at a game or 

03:38:34.423 --> 03:38:36.423
being --

03:40:28.110 --> 03:40:31.185
[ Lost audio ] 
&gt;&gt; -- I was pissed.

03:40:33.025 --> 03:40:34.861
They stopped giving away 
scorecards.  I'm, like, what are

03:40:34.862 --> 03:40:36.920
you doing?  
[ Applause ]

03:40:38.333 --> 03:40:40.176
Like you're instantly deleting 
half of the reason why people 

03:40:40.177 --> 03:40:41.398
are going is to remember the 
fact that they were there, you 

03:40:41.399 --> 03:40:45.853
know.  And if you kind of like 
pay -- that is a huge part of 

03:40:45.854 --> 03:40:47.854
baseball in a way that I think 
is very different than a lot of 

03:40:48.514 --> 03:40:51.832
the sports.  
&gt;&gt; I think that connects a 

03:40:51.833 --> 03:40:55.718
little bit also to some of the 
things we mentioned.  Just 

03:40:55.719 --> 03:40:57.552
briefly passing by before ways 
that some of our collections 

03:40:57.553 --> 03:41:03.232
actually surface exclusions, 
what's not there, different 

03:41:03.233 --> 03:41:04.662
types of artifacts that might 
represent types of activities 

03:41:04.663 --> 03:41:06.663
related to 

03:41:09.184 --> 03:41:11.226
baseball, people, even roles.  
We see a lot of players or 

03:41:11.227 --> 03:41:14.108
baseball cards that represent 
players.  We have some managers'

03:41:14.109 --> 03:41:16.736
papers.  We have oral histories.
But we don't necessarily have 

03:41:16.737 --> 03:41:19.212
all the stories where people are
reflecting specifically on their

03:41:19.213 --> 03:41:23.507
experiences of baseball.  In 
your respective fields, I have 

03:41:23.508 --> 03:41:26.957
to get a plug in about this.  We
have resources that may be 

03:41:26.958 --> 03:41:31.671
useful to you.  If you are going
to be looking for different 

03:41:31.672 --> 03:41:32.892
types of research or be 
performing research and wanted 

03:41:32.893 --> 03:41:37.196
to connect with the Library of 
Congress and its collections, 

03:41:37.197 --> 03:41:39.197
what might be types of objects 
and/or collection items you 

03:41:39.827 --> 03:41:41.827
would be interested in?

03:41:42.960 --> 03:41:45.530
&gt;&gt; Hmm.  
&gt;&gt; I'm putting them on the spot.

03:41:47.374 --> 03:41:52.018
&gt;&gt; You know, when I started 
doing research, it was going 

03:41:52.019 --> 03:41:55.273
through microfilmed newspapers, 
putting a dime in every time I 

03:41:55.274 --> 03:41:57.274
wanted to make a copy.

03:41:58.936 --> 03:42:00.936
No laptops, no word processing.

03:42:04.228 --> 03:42:05.660
And I kind of get angry when I 
see how easy it is to look at 

03:42:05.661 --> 03:42:09.236
things.  
&gt;&gt; Sorry, we're trying to make 

03:42:09.237 --> 03:42:11.884
it way too easy.  
&gt;&gt; When I'm listening to all of 

03:42:11.885 --> 03:42:15.831
the stuff you have brought 
together, I mean, I feel as if 

03:42:15.832 --> 03:42:18.680
there was a subject I was 
interested in, I'd be 

03:42:18.681 --> 03:42:20.681
overwhelmed by the 

03:42:21.939 --> 03:42:24.786
amount of material and 
information.  And it would seem 

03:42:24.787 --> 03:42:27.258
to be the next step is not just 
to make all that universe of 

03:42:29.322 --> 03:42:31.322
material possible but figure out
how to 

03:42:33.007 --> 03:42:35.007
filter and prioritize so that I 
can tell 

03:42:36.056 --> 03:42:38.056
my grad students to do it and 
have high expectations.  

03:42:38.508 --> 03:42:40.356
&gt;&gt; This week -- oh, sorry, go 
ahead.  

03:42:40.357 --> 03:42:41.788
&gt;&gt; I think what would be most 
valuable to me, and I think 

03:42:41.789 --> 03:42:45.059
about this as somebody that does
a lot of television at this 

03:42:45.060 --> 03:42:47.932
point would be able to -- if you
could categorize how you see 

03:42:47.933 --> 03:42:52.199
things.  Like if I said I want 
to see every homer that happened

03:42:52.200 --> 03:42:54.472
on July 17th, 1988, you know 
what I mean, around the league 

03:42:58.965 --> 03:43:01.437
or whatever, those kind of 
specificities for visual -- even

03:43:01.438 --> 03:43:04.706
I could listen to them, radio 
calls or whatever.  That to me 

03:43:04.707 --> 03:43:06.707
would be cool because you 

03:43:07.952 --> 03:43:10.515
could -- for whatever reason the
way my brain works, to stay in 

03:43:10.516 --> 03:43:12.516
history and this kind of stuff, 
really speaks to me.

03:43:15.886 --> 03:43:17.927
And that -- that to me would be 
a very valuable resource to 

03:43:17.928 --> 03:43:21.586
know, like, what was happening 
on this day in the world?  Never

03:43:21.587 --> 03:43:23.836
mind in a ballpark.  And can I 
look at them all in the same 

03:43:25.511 --> 03:43:27.144
space and sort of compare them 
and go from there as to how I 

03:43:27.145 --> 03:43:30.166
looked at the rest of the globe.
That to me would be really cool.

03:43:30.167 --> 03:43:32.217
&gt;&gt; That's what I love about 
images of old newspapers, right?

03:43:33.866 --> 03:43:36.321
Because I could read the story 
about the baseball game.  And 

03:43:36.322 --> 03:43:38.322
next to it, there's like a story

03:43:40.854 --> 03:43:42.600
about, like, strak break strike 
breakers and police or what's 

03:43:42.601 --> 03:43:45.668
happening in Asia.  You sort of 
see not just what happened on 

03:43:45.669 --> 03:43:47.669
the baseball field but the 
people who 

03:43:48.956 --> 03:43:50.601
were experiencing that in the 
time, what else was on their 

03:43:50.602 --> 03:43:52.602
mind, you know what I mean?  
That puts it in context.  

03:43:54.091 --> 03:43:55.700
&gt;&gt; Well, I promised we would 
talk about baseball idiom and 

03:43:55.701 --> 03:43:59.981
language.  So let's talk a 
little bit about the ways that 

03:43:59.982 --> 03:44:01.982
baseball is integrated 

03:44:03.047 --> 03:44:05.492
unexpectedly into American 
vernacular.  As, Clinton, who is

03:44:05.493 --> 03:44:09.138
a sports journalist, you 
probably have to find ways to 

03:44:09.139 --> 03:44:11.174
not use sporting analogies all 
of the time.  

03:44:12.603 --> 03:44:14.421
&gt;&gt; That happens for me because 
I'm also a massive baseball fan 

03:44:14.422 --> 03:44:16.461
that talks in baseball lingo 
just as a matter of course.  

03:44:16.462 --> 03:44:18.902
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 
&gt;&gt; It's hard.  I just realized I

03:44:18.903 --> 03:44:20.903
did that earlier 

03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:23.776
when I said a couple relay 
throws.  That's a distance I use

03:44:23.777 --> 03:44:26.225
in my mind.  I'm going to listen
on this one.  

03:44:28.672 --> 03:44:30.917
&gt;&gt; Well, so we think about maybe
let's think about rather than 

03:44:30.918 --> 03:44:35.426
direct metaphors of baseball and
whether or not baseball, we can 

03:44:35.427 --> 03:44:36.866
understand other -- we're 
arguing in our exhibit that you 

03:44:36.867 --> 03:44:40.962
can understand American history 
through baseball or you can see 

03:44:40.963 --> 03:44:43.013
direct metaphor for particular 
points in time or the ways that 

03:44:43.014 --> 03:44:45.879
people organize themselves.  Do 
you have any reflections on 

03:44:45.880 --> 03:44:47.880
that, Jordan?  

03:44:49.775 --> 03:44:51.000
&gt;&gt; I mean, I want to say that in
some sense we're, like, the 

03:44:51.001 --> 03:44:54.662
exact wrong people to answer 
this question because, like, we 

03:44:54.663 --> 03:44:57.926
are immersed and we hear those 
words and that language a lot.  

03:44:57.927 --> 03:44:59.569
So we know what's being referred
to.  And what I suspect is that 

03:44:59.570 --> 03:45:01.570
for a lot 

03:45:03.840 --> 03:45:05.002
of Americans in 2018, they will 
say three strikes.  

03:45:05.003 --> 03:45:07.417
&gt;&gt; Yeah.  
&gt;&gt; But they may not even know 

03:45:07.418 --> 03:45:09.418
what that refers to.

03:45:11.287 --> 03:45:13.536
I mean, when I was I compare it 
to, think about how much of our 

03:45:13.537 --> 03:45:18.228
language is governed by nautical
metaphors.  You say somebody's 

03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:20.264
three sheets to the wind.  I 
don't know what the hell that 

03:45:20.265 --> 03:45:23.027
means.  A sheet was attached to 
a boat.  

03:45:23.842 --> 03:45:26.279
&gt;&gt; Maybe a mast involved.  
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no way that has

03:45:27.309 --> 03:45:29.713
something to do with a boat.  
That's fossilized language.  

03:45:29.714 --> 03:45:32.996
That's gone.  Maybe if there's 
any sailors in the audience, you

03:45:32.997 --> 03:45:34.997
can tell me what it means.

03:45:36.287 --> 03:45:37.746
To be honest, I think for a lot 
of Americans today, a lot of 

03:45:37.747 --> 03:45:41.208
that baseball language is 
probably like that.  There's 

03:45:41.209 --> 03:45:42.657
sort of, like, dimly aware it 
has something to do with 

03:45:42.658 --> 03:45:46.333
baseball.  But they can't really
put a reference to it.  And yet 

03:45:46.334 --> 03:45:50.008
they know what sort of that word
means in English vernacular.  

03:45:50.009 --> 03:45:52.871
And you should ask them.  
&gt;&gt; Not to mention, let's be real

03:45:52.872 --> 03:45:57.178
about the incarceration policies
of this country, involving three

03:45:57.179 --> 03:45:59.747
strikes and you're out.  That's 
as real as it gets in terms of 

03:46:02.147 --> 03:46:04.389
putting people behind bars, 
vis-a-vis the concept of a 

03:46:04.390 --> 03:46:06.390
baseball metaphor making sense 
as to why you should be in 

03:46:07.466 --> 03:46:09.466
prison for the rest of your 
life, it's kind of crazy.  

03:46:11.769 --> 03:46:13.007
&gt;&gt; We think of three strikes as,
like -- 

03:46:13.008 --> 03:46:15.607
&gt;&gt; I would personally hate 
baseball if I was in jail.  

03:46:15.608 --> 03:46:18.455
Like, yeah.  Because that's, you
know, but whatever.  That's sort

03:46:18.456 --> 03:46:21.129
of a different discussion.  
That, to me, that's drilling 

03:46:21.130 --> 03:46:24.204
down as far as you can go.  
Taking away people's freedoms 

03:46:24.205 --> 03:46:26.205
based on the notion of what 
happens when you're 

03:46:28.915 --> 03:46:31.381
in a batter's box, based on a 
pitcher and a catcher and 

03:46:31.382 --> 03:46:33.842
whether or not -- like that's 
crazy.  

03:46:35.762 --> 03:46:38.431
&gt;&gt; Picking up on a little bit of
a thread that you had, Jordan, 

03:46:38.432 --> 03:46:43.107
of you not being the right 
people to ask.  I disagree.  I 

03:46:43.108 --> 03:46:45.108
think you're the perfect people 
to ask these types of questions.

03:46:47.421 --> 03:46:49.035
But I also wonder -- kind of 
related to what you're both 

03:46:49.036 --> 03:46:52.413
talking about, taking baseball 
out of its context, and there's 

03:46:52.414 --> 03:46:53.669
this could be a slightly 
controversial view or it could 

03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:57.325
be something you think is true, 
this idea of a decline of 

03:46:57.326 --> 03:46:59.326
baseball as America's pastime, 
that should it still be 

03:46:59.766 --> 03:47:03.095
America's pastime?  
&gt;&gt; I don't think there is a 

03:47:03.096 --> 03:47:05.811
national pastime anymore.  I 
mean, I think that sporting 

03:47:07.891 --> 03:47:09.891
interests are fractionalized.

03:47:11.759 --> 03:47:13.387
Clearly the NFL is the most 
successful economic sporting 

03:47:13.388 --> 03:47:17.900
league in U.S. sporting history.
Even that could be some sort of 

03:47:19.558 --> 03:47:23.241
existential crossroads for a 
number of reasons.  You know, I 

03:47:23.242 --> 03:47:25.476
look at my students, and I've 
been teaching the history of 

03:47:25.477 --> 03:47:27.477
sport 

03:47:28.772 --> 03:47:28.980
since the late '70s at the 
university ofUniversity of 

03:47:28.981 --> 03:47:30.981
Pittsburgh.

03:47:32.645 --> 03:47:34.283
And it was easy to discuss 
baseball and to have that common

03:47:34.284 --> 03:47:37.414
shared knowledge.  And I think 
Jordan's point is right on the 

03:47:37.415 --> 03:47:41.061
money.  They don't have the 
language anymore.  They don't 

03:47:41.062 --> 03:47:43.062
have the memory.

03:47:46.935 --> 03:47:48.935
I can talk about Bill Mazz Roz

03:47:55.570 --> 03:47:56.802
Mazeroski and Clemente or Lionel
Messi.  I think we're past that 

03:47:56.803 --> 03:47:58.868
point where we have one 
collective sporting experience 

03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:03.156
that is defined by a single 
sport.  

03:48:03.157 --> 03:48:05.039
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you this, though.  
And this is something that I 

03:48:05.040 --> 03:48:08.299
don't know that it's -- I know 
that a lot of Americans take for

03:48:08.300 --> 03:48:11.970
granted.  If you go to another 
country and you throw something 

03:48:11.971 --> 03:48:13.818
to somebody, they will likely 
take it as an assumption that 

03:48:13.819 --> 03:48:17.487
you were throwing it at them and
not to them.  And that is a very

03:48:17.488 --> 03:48:20.972
interesting thing about how -- I
mean -- I'm saying, though, like

03:48:20.973 --> 03:48:22.196
-- no.  
[ Laughter ]

03:48:22.197 --> 03:48:25.034
You get my point.  You know what
I mean?  On a very interesting 

03:48:25.035 --> 03:48:27.271
base level, whether or not they 
care about 

03:48:30.774 --> 03:48:32.200
leg-league baseball big-league 
baseball, the simplest part of 

03:48:32.201 --> 03:48:34.201
the game is integrated into our 
society.  Hey, catch this.

03:48:35.073 --> 03:48:36.922
It's not going to freak you out.
You're probably going to catch 

03:48:36.923 --> 03:48:40.525
it and you'll probably be able 
to send it back without much of 

03:48:40.526 --> 03:48:42.570
an issue.  That's why I think 
baseball will not change as the 

03:48:42.571 --> 03:48:46.095
pastime.  It will simply exist 
in a different part of our 

03:48:46.096 --> 03:48:48.096
brains as a sporting level.

03:48:49.862 --> 03:48:51.904
But what the actions are are 
very much ingrained in who we 

03:48:51.905 --> 03:48:53.948
are in society, you know?  
Throwing and catching is pretty 

03:48:55.525 --> 03:48:57.365
standard American operation, you
know.  

03:48:57.366 --> 03:48:59.609
&gt;&gt; That's a perfect segue into a
question about whether or not do

03:48:59.610 --> 03:49:03.945
you view baseball as an 
international sport?  And I 

03:49:03.946 --> 03:49:06.646
think there's maybe certain 
places in the world that we 

03:49:06.647 --> 03:49:10.542
think of as connected to the 
United States through baseball 

03:49:10.543 --> 03:49:12.173
in a professionalized way, but 
you may also have other 

03:49:12.174 --> 03:49:15.243
reflections that you want to 
share about amateur or community

03:49:15.244 --> 03:49:21.556
sport.  
&gt;&gt; I mean, I think it's both.  I

03:49:21.557 --> 03:49:22.780
mean, I think baseball, more 
than it ever has been, is a 

03:49:22.781 --> 03:49:25.632
world sport.  But it's also a 
world sport whose home is the 

03:49:25.633 --> 03:49:28.498
United States.  I don't think 
there's any contradictions there

03:49:28.499 --> 03:49:32.011
that the U.S. is kind of the 
temple.  And I think it's still 

03:49:32.012 --> 03:49:36.916
true that, like, the greatest 
world players, their ambition, 

03:49:36.917 --> 03:49:39.382
is to not play in Korea, like 
not play in Taiwan, not play in 

03:49:39.383 --> 03:49:41.383
Mexico 

03:49:43.263 --> 03:49:46.021
but to play in the United 
States.  Yeah.  And I kind of 

03:49:46.022 --> 03:49:49.906
like about it that it's -- but 
it's a different mix, right?  

03:49:49.907 --> 03:49:51.728
It's not the NBA has become a 
world sport, too.  It's a 

03:49:51.729 --> 03:49:54.395
different mix of countries.  
Baseball has this kind of sort 

03:49:54.396 --> 03:49:56.848
of a Pacific orientation, right?
Where it's, like -- 

03:49:57.479 --> 03:49:59.479
&gt;&gt; I wish.

03:50:00.761 --> 03:50:02.423
That's going to be the death of 
major league baseball is being 

03:50:02.424 --> 03:50:04.053
concerned about being too 
American.  That's really what it

03:50:04.054 --> 03:50:08.151
is.  You look at the culture of 
the game, you watch the World 

03:50:08.152 --> 03:50:13.262
Baseball Classic where different
nations fill different squads.  

03:50:13.263 --> 03:50:14.080
You've seen this with your 
scholarship on the Caribbean and

03:50:14.081 --> 03:50:17.579
so forth.  It's a totally 
different concept than what the 

03:50:17.580 --> 03:50:21.249
game even is.  From an 
entertainment standpoint, never 

03:50:21.250 --> 03:50:23.499
mind a participation standpoint,
it has to be global in order for

03:50:23.500 --> 03:50:27.442
it to survive.  And that's sort 
of the large mistake I think 

03:50:27.443 --> 03:50:29.487
that the big leagues is making 
is that they're trying to make 

03:50:29.488 --> 03:50:31.488
is very much 

03:50:33.143 --> 03:50:35.581
the sort of Puritanical nonsense
that's boring.  You know, you go

03:50:35.582 --> 03:50:38.644
to so many different places.  
And it's just -- it's more fun. 

03:50:38.645 --> 03:50:40.673
It's a different thing.  It has 
to be global in order for it to 

03:50:42.292 --> 03:50:44.292
be, I think, real for a lot of 
people.  

03:50:47.379 --> 03:50:48.806
&gt;&gt; You watch the Baseball 
Classic, people from different 

03:50:48.807 --> 03:50:51.275
countries, they're not playing 
in the same style as American 

03:50:51.276 --> 03:50:56.597
players.  
&gt;&gt; 1,000%.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, 

03:50:56.598 --> 03:50:58.440
we could break this down on a 
strategy level.  We could break 

03:50:58.441 --> 03:51:00.287
this down on a style level.  You
could break it down on a 

03:51:00.288 --> 03:51:03.942
communication level.  You know 
what I mean?  That's the way 

03:51:03.943 --> 03:51:08.211
people talk.  The way that 
people run bases.  I don't know.

03:51:11.477 --> 03:51:13.110
The aggressiveness with which --
the strategy of the game.  It is

03:51:13.111 --> 03:51:14.326
very different in different 
places across the globe for 

03:51:14.327 --> 03:51:16.327
sure.  

03:51:18.556 --> 03:51:22.335
&gt;&gt; (Away from mic) the kind of 
this is how it's done.  It's not

03:51:22.336 --> 03:51:24.336
done this other way.  
&gt;&gt; Yeah.  

03:51:30.263 --> 03:51:32.263
&gt;&gt; And I 100% am in agreement

03:51:35.101 --> 03:51:37.940
.  I've never noticed the 
players who break those rules, I

03:51:37.941 --> 03:51:39.941
feel like they're 

03:51:41.514 --> 03:51:42.734
less likely (away from mic).  
&gt;&gt; Okay.  I'll give you a great 

03:51:42.735 --> 03:51:44.735
example of this.

03:51:46.174 --> 03:51:48.420
Clint Hurdle is the manager of 
the Pirates.  Hurdle was a 

03:51:48.421 --> 03:51:51.220
number one pick in the draft.  
Hurdle hit, like, 40 bombs in 

03:51:51.221 --> 03:51:55.296
his ten-year career and he's 
been managing in the big leagues

03:51:55.297 --> 03:52:00.656
for God knows how long.  He's 
not a good manager.  Bobby Baez 

03:52:00.657 --> 03:52:01.876
is probably one of the most 
exciting players in all of 

03:52:01.877 --> 03:52:03.877
baseball.

03:52:06.382 --> 03:52:07.823
Javy Baez hit a bomb and Clint 
Hurdle went off about how this 

03:52:07.824 --> 03:52:09.824
is not how you do this and that.

03:52:13.211 --> 03:52:15.659
And I'm, like, Clint Hurdle was 
a bum compared to Javy Baez.  He

03:52:15.660 --> 03:52:17.282
didn't even appreciate the fact 
that he was celebrating 

03:52:17.283 --> 03:52:20.948
something he had done well.  I 
mean, that right there showed me

03:52:22.170 --> 03:52:24.218
exactly all you needed to know. 
Random white guy who was not a 

03:52:24.219 --> 03:52:26.219
very 

03:52:28.928 --> 03:52:31.235
good players felt the need to 
scold, you know, a young Latino 

03:52:31.236 --> 03:52:35.006
player who was showing too much 
emotion for what he felt was 

03:52:35.007 --> 03:52:37.007
appropriate to the game.  That, 
to me, is a massive problem with

03:52:37.050 --> 03:52:40.160
baseball.  Just as a matter of 
course, in general, you know 

03:52:40.161 --> 03:52:42.439
what I'm saying?  You know what 
I mean?  We're going to have 

03:52:42.440 --> 03:52:44.893
fun.  We're not here to talk 
about unwritten rules.  

03:52:47.739 --> 03:52:49.798
&gt;&gt; I'll let you slide on Hurdle.
[ Laughter ]

03:52:52.809 --> 03:52:54.809
Don't dis.  Getting back to your
question.

03:52:57.808 --> 03:52:58.913
The major leagues have always 
seen themselves as a temple of 

03:52:58.914 --> 03:53:00.914
the game.  And they've always 
wanted to dominate.

03:53:06.896 --> 03:53:08.896
But frankly, MLB was never the 
only game of baseball.

03:53:12.216 --> 03:53:13.825
And 100 years ago, the best 
white and black players went 

03:53:13.826 --> 03:53:17.685
down to the Caribbean and played
winter ball.  During the summer,

03:53:17.686 --> 03:53:22.199
players from the Caribbean came 
and played either major or Negro

03:53:22.200 --> 03:53:24.200
League ball depending on whether
they passed for white.

03:53:27.287 --> 03:53:29.287
The demarcation point is 
integration.

03:53:30.734 --> 03:53:33.584
And in the years after that, 
particularly with the expansion 

03:53:33.585 --> 03:53:35.812
of different media and the 
ability to 

03:53:39.884 --> 03:53:41.884
broadcast, the games and the 
islands and 

03:53:44.138 --> 03:53:46.138
in Mexico increasingly suck into
MLB's commercial orbit.

03:53:50.217 --> 03:53:52.217
And that's what I think is 
deadly

03:53:54.138 --> 03:53:56.138
.  I agree with you toegtsly 
about the style.

03:53:57.431 --> 03:53:59.431
A Cuban game, dminian game, 
Nicaraguan game differ from MLB.

03:54:00.318 --> 03:54:02.318
But what's even more fun is the 
style 

03:54:03.529 --> 03:54:05.529
and the stance

03:54:07.237 --> 03:54:09.237
where it's just not piped-in 
music all 

03:54:12.914 --> 03:54:15.203
the time or, you know, per 
pierogi races.  It's just real 

03:54:15.204 --> 03:54:18.275
action.  It's a far more 
exciting experience.  

03:54:20.540 --> 03:54:22.771
&gt;&gt; That might connect back to 
this idea of community and 

03:54:22.772 --> 03:54:24.198
experiencing a game you 
mentioned -- we've heard this a 

03:54:24.199 --> 03:54:28.056
couple different times in the 
conversation.  We've talked 

03:54:28.057 --> 03:54:30.057
about coming together in a fan 
lot style and how people share 

03:54:31.126 --> 03:54:33.365
information or connect with one 
another or the way they 

03:54:33.366 --> 03:54:35.366
anticipate or plan their runs to
the bathroom or next snacks 

03:54:38.474 --> 03:54:40.474
because they know what's coming 
ahead or 

03:54:41.527 --> 03:54:43.609
they want to get on the camera 
if they're in a professional 

03:54:43.610 --> 03:54:48.212
sporting space.  So what are 
some of the ways that you think 

03:54:48.213 --> 03:54:50.260
baseball might provide -- and 
Jordan, I'll maybe ask you to 

03:54:50.261 --> 03:54:52.701
speak to baseball as an 
experience, provides 

03:54:57.063 --> 03:54:58.904
opportunity for people to come 
together or learn something new 

03:54:58.905 --> 03:55:02.771
about the place that they are.  
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm suppose to talk 

03:55:02.772 --> 03:55:06.644
into this now?  Okay.  
[ Laughter ] 

03:55:08.491 --> 03:55:10.119
I mean, I'm going to say 
something, like, very simple 

03:55:10.120 --> 03:55:12.120
about this because I think 
there's this very primal thing 

03:55:13.990 --> 03:55:16.653
where in your life, it's 
actually pretty rare that you're

03:55:16.654 --> 03:55:18.654
among, like, a large group of 
people whose attention is 

03:55:21.787 --> 03:55:24.422
focused in the exact same place 
on the exact same thing.  That's

03:55:24.423 --> 03:55:26.423
an uncommon experience.  
&gt;&gt; All of us here today.  

03:55:26.680 --> 03:55:28.680
&gt;&gt; All of us.  
[ Laughter ] 

03:55:29.979 --> 03:55:30.583
All of us who are not on our 
phones are having that 

03:55:30.584 --> 03:55:33.624
experience.  
[ Laughter ] 

03:55:35.468 --> 03:55:37.468
I mean, okay, it's a little bit 

03:55:39.131 --> 03:55:41.131
embarrassing, but I took my kids
to theThe Eclipse last summer.

03:55:43.399 --> 03:55:45.667
We drove down to Missouri and we
went to The Eclipse.  Standing 

03:55:45.668 --> 03:55:48.513
there in this big field with all
these people all looking up.  I 

03:55:48.514 --> 03:55:50.514
was, like, oh, yeah.  This is 
like baseball.

03:55:53.647 --> 03:55:55.272
Everybody here with this big 
huge crowd all looking up at 

03:55:55.273 --> 03:55:57.509
this round thing in the sky.  
All in the same place.

03:56:00.973 --> 03:56:03.423
So I don't know if that 
experience, if it's meaningful, 

03:56:03.424 --> 03:56:05.247
it's meaningful without actually
meaning any particular thing, 

03:56:05.248 --> 03:56:09.517
right?  It's meaningful in this 
very primal way that I think it 

03:56:09.518 --> 03:56:11.518
feeds some kind of 

03:56:13.534 --> 03:56:17.287
desire for math mass experience 
that we rarely are offered.  

03:56:17.288 --> 03:56:20.549
&gt;&gt; From an experience 
standpoint, I'm not really sure 

03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:22.582
this answers the question.  It's
something I wanted to highlight 

03:56:27.881 --> 03:56:29.881
because of the sort of the 
situation but 

03:56:31.152 --> 03:56:32.991
a couple years ago when there 
were riots, I'm using air quotes

03:56:32.992 --> 03:56:37.321
for those of you listening on 
YouTube, in Baltimore.  The O's 

03:56:37.322 --> 03:56:40.775
played a game where they locked 
out the entire stadium.  They 

03:56:40.776 --> 03:56:43.642
didn't let anybody into the 
ballpark and they played a major

03:56:43.643 --> 03:56:47.523
league baseball game.  I was 
there.  There were probably 50 

03:56:47.524 --> 03:56:49.983
people there covering the game 
which was a super bizarre 

03:56:49.984 --> 03:56:51.984
element of this.  I remember 
thinking at the time we 

03:56:54.293 --> 03:56:56.126
have really failed as a nation 
on a lot of fronts if we're 

03:56:56.127 --> 03:56:58.409
legitimately playing baseball 
games in front of nobody.  

03:57:00.270 --> 03:57:04.351
[ Applause ] 
You know what I'm saying?  For 

03:57:04.352 --> 03:57:06.352
the sake of the game continuing 

03:57:07.419 --> 03:57:08.843
but the actual experience being 
robbed because of some concern 

03:57:08.844 --> 03:57:11.924
about something that may or may 
not happen outside of the 

03:57:11.925 --> 03:57:13.925
ballpark.

03:57:15.185 --> 03:57:17.185
And it was eerie on a lot of 
levels.

03:57:19.721 --> 03:57:21.367
And to the O's credit, this 
year, they've instituted this 

03:57:21.368 --> 03:57:26.069
thing where you can bring your 
kids to the ballpark for free if

03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:27.507
they're under 10 and you can sit
up in the crowd because nobody's

03:57:27.508 --> 03:57:29.508
up there anyway.  
[ Laughter ]

03:57:29.755 --> 03:57:32.419
That's not a knock.  That's a 
legitimate way to get people in 

03:57:32.420 --> 03:57:36.948
the ballpark.  The reason I 
bring that up is it was such a 

03:57:36.949 --> 03:57:38.801
stark contrast of how in the 
same place different experiences

03:57:38.802 --> 03:57:40.802
can be so 

03:57:42.485 --> 03:57:45.556
different and such a profound 
impact on a community.  And I 

03:57:45.557 --> 03:57:48.001
remember talking to people, you 
know, around the ballpark on 

03:57:48.002 --> 03:57:51.701
what I called the ghost game 
were mad.  They were, like, who 

03:57:51.702 --> 03:57:53.702
does this, you know?

03:57:57.262 --> 03:57:59.094
And now, you know, Camden Yards 
is one of the nicest ballparks 

03:57:59.095 --> 03:58:02.775
in America.  To me, it was an 
interesting example of the 

03:58:02.776 --> 03:58:04.776
evolution of what I think it 
kind of needs to be.

03:58:06.877 --> 03:58:08.877
Let people in the ballpark and 
people will like the sport more.

03:58:09.361 --> 03:58:11.361
That's pretty obvious.  To me 
that's a large part of the 

03:58:12.070 --> 03:58:15.562
experience.  It's the biggest 
thing people will see in their 

03:58:15.563 --> 03:58:16.987
lives in one place.  You should 
let people experience that.  

03:58:16.988 --> 03:58:20.054
&gt;&gt; You know, I think the best 
thing about sport is when you're

03:58:20.055 --> 03:58:22.714
playing it yourself, when you're
participating.  The next best 

03:58:22.715 --> 03:58:25.173
thing is when those who are 
competing are people you know 

03:58:25.174 --> 03:58:27.174
and care about.

03:58:29.699 --> 03:58:31.699
We get further and further 
removed 

03:58:33.626 --> 03:58:36.289
till we become these consumers 
primarily on TV or on our phone 

03:58:36.290 --> 03:58:38.290
or something of 

03:58:40.384 --> 03:58:42.004
people who live in different ZIP
codes.  And I think if you flip 

03:58:42.005 --> 03:58:44.005
it 

03:58:46.095 --> 03:58:48.816
historically with baseball, 
between World War I and II, 

03:58:48.817 --> 03:58:50.817
there were 400 or 500 
independent baseball teams in 

03:58:53.033 --> 03:58:56.728
western Pennsylvania.  We had 
two Negro League teams.  You had

03:58:56.729 --> 03:58:59.364
the Pirates.  But the 
independent sandlot and 

03:59:01.419 --> 03:59:03.251
community teams drew far more 
people each week than the 

03:59:03.252 --> 03:59:05.252
professional clubs.

03:59:07.674 --> 03:59:09.852
And a lot of the people who were
playing were people playing into

03:59:09.853 --> 03:59:15.407
their 40s or 50s.  And 40 or 50 
was relatively old.  And they 

03:59:15.408 --> 03:59:20.987
were playing in the neighborhood
where people could walk to work,

03:59:20.988 --> 03:59:22.988
walk there after work, throw 
some 

03:59:24.270 --> 03:59:26.313
money in a passing hat, and 
either see people they cared 

03:59:26.314 --> 03:59:29.995
about or be a part of the 
action.  And that to me is when 

03:59:29.996 --> 03:59:34.351
sport provides the most 
community.  I think we've gotten

03:59:34.352 --> 03:59:36.232
several steps removed from that.
&gt;&gt; I want to pick up on 

03:59:36.233 --> 03:59:39.727
something that you mentioned 
earlier, Clinton, and you had a 

03:59:39.728 --> 03:59:41.978
little bit of a conversation 
about this about some of the 

03:59:41.979 --> 03:59:46.851
greatest players playing before 
integration and also the ways --

03:59:46.852 --> 03:59:49.095
so we've got a couple of 
cross-cutting threads here.  I 

03:59:49.096 --> 03:59:51.096
have only two more seconds.  
This is the second to last.

03:59:52.981 --> 03:59:55.637
So this is a question that's 
about what types of patterns 

03:59:55.638 --> 03:59:58.514
that you've seen in history, 
Rob, and Clinton and Jordan, 

03:59:59.938 --> 04:00:02.857
maybe thinking about the numbers
and what types of what would you

04:00:02.858 --> 04:00:04.858
think is 

04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:09.483
the most important type of 
statistic or form of playing 

04:00:09.484 --> 04:00:12.794
baseball or pattern from players
in the past that we've lost in 

04:00:12.795 --> 04:00:14.795
today's game?

04:00:20.805 --> 04:00:24.718
&gt;&gt; Oh, I mean, if you mean -- if
you really mean statistics, then

04:00:24.719 --> 04:00:27.607
I think the answer is nothing, I
think the statistical richness 

04:00:27.608 --> 04:00:31.085
with which we understand the 
sport today is vastly greater 

04:00:31.086 --> 04:00:32.511
than it was at any point in the 
past.  I think we have 

04:00:32.512 --> 04:00:34.947
everything we had in the past.  
&gt;&gt; Numbers are consistent over 

04:00:34.948 --> 04:00:36.989
time and other things have 
changed.  

04:00:39.901 --> 04:00:42.181
&gt;&gt; I mean, well, apart from the 
fact that as Clinton brought up,

04:00:42.182 --> 04:00:44.182
differences 

04:00:45.470 --> 04:00:46.696
in playing, who was allowed to 
play and who the competition was

04:00:46.697 --> 04:00:48.538
and who was pitching to you.  
That obviously is something you 

04:00:48.539 --> 04:00:50.539
have 

04:00:52.155 --> 04:00:54.155
to do separately from that 
standpoint.

04:00:57.205 --> 04:00:59.205
You know, I think age statistics
gets 

04:01:00.495 --> 04:01:01.721
started in the late '70s, early 
'80s, makes it a mass-market 

04:01:01.722 --> 04:01:04.595
thing.  
&gt;&gt; Does everybody here know who 

04:01:04.596 --> 04:01:07.459
Bill James is?  
&gt;&gt; I'm leaving it people don't 

04:01:07.460 --> 04:01:12.185
know who Bill James is.  He 
brought kind of modern 

04:01:12.186 --> 04:01:15.115
statistical analysis of 
baseball.  People were doing it 

04:01:15.116 --> 04:01:17.116
but Bill James 

04:01:18.993 --> 04:01:23.487
was the person who was, like, I 
can sell my books from the B. 

04:01:23.488 --> 04:01:24.701
Dalton and Waldenbooks.  
&gt;&gt; Further away.  

04:01:24.702 --> 04:01:27.392
[ Laughter ] 
&gt;&gt; He was the guy you had the 

04:01:27.393 --> 04:01:30.082
belief that, like, I can make 
this, like, a mass-market thing.

04:01:32.559 --> 04:01:35.225
Now you go to Miller Park in 
Milwaukee, there's OPS and WHIP 

04:01:35.226 --> 04:01:39.338
on the scoreboard.  It's there 
for everybody to see.  I did not

04:01:39.339 --> 04:01:40.572
think I would see that happen in
my lifetime.  

04:01:40.573 --> 04:01:43.036
&gt;&gt; Right.  
&gt;&gt; I'm of the of the party -- 

04:01:43.037 --> 04:01:46.330
maybe it's obvious that I would 
be -- who thinks that's a good 

04:01:46.331 --> 04:01:50.511
for baseball.  I don't think 
that replaces our fandom with 

04:01:50.512 --> 04:01:52.560
spreadsheets or number 
crunching.  I think it just 

04:01:52.561 --> 04:01:55.449
adds.  It doesn't subtract.  
&gt;&gt; I'm interested to hear what 

04:01:55.450 --> 04:02:00.385
you think about this in the 
terms of statistical forms of 

04:02:00.386 --> 04:02:02.628
baseball -- you know, all this 
other stuff.  I imagine this is 

04:02:02.629 --> 04:02:05.668
not very popular in your world. 
&gt;&gt; I stopped understanding math 

04:02:05.669 --> 04:02:08.512
after Woodstock.  
[ Laughter ] 

04:02:09.324 --> 04:02:11.324
Among a lot of other things. 
&gt;&gt; Wow, what did you take?  

04:02:12.507 --> 04:02:15.369
[ Laughter ] 
&gt;&gt; You know, when you look at 

04:02:15.370 --> 04:02:18.256
all the stats, you just don't 
have that for black baseball.  

04:02:18.257 --> 04:02:20.724
&gt;&gt; Right.  
&gt;&gt; You don't have that for the 

04:02:20.725 --> 04:02:22.725
Caribbean.

04:02:24.190 --> 04:02:26.190
You're using a ball which would 
have 

04:02:28.489 --> 04:02:30.942
been thrown out, you know, 
scrapped but hit the ground.  

04:02:30.943 --> 04:02:33.019
Once in the majors, these guys 
might have played most of a game

04:02:33.020 --> 04:02:36.702
with it.  They're playing with 
terrible lighting on fields that

04:02:36.703 --> 04:02:38.703
are not going to give you a true
hump.

04:02:42.216 --> 04:02:44.216
So the statistical stuff for 
that era mean little to me.

04:02:49.545 --> 04:02:51.596
You know, that Joe DiMaggio can 
say Satchel Paige is the 

04:02:51.597 --> 04:02:53.597
toughest pitcher he ever faced.

04:02:56.114 --> 04:02:57.539
Or when I would talk about the 
Negro Leagues in western 

04:02:57.540 --> 04:03:00.369
Pennsylvania and have guys who 
played for their coal miner 

04:03:02.615 --> 04:03:04.673
team, white guys, stand up and 
tell me how proud they were that

04:03:04.674 --> 04:03:06.320
Josh Gibson hit a home run off 
them.  

04:03:06.321 --> 04:03:08.321
&gt;&gt; Right.  

04:03:09.370 --> 04:03:11.449
&gt;&gt; That resonates with me.  You 
know, the stuff you see in box 

04:03:14.521 --> 04:03:15.736
scores from those days, it's 
shaky stuff.  

04:03:15.737 --> 04:03:17.737
&gt;&gt; Right.  And when I watch a 
game now, I mean, 

04:03:21.708 --> 04:03:23.959
the fun part is the stat -- I 
mean, the stats are part of the 

04:03:23.960 --> 04:03:27.838
game in the context of it is 
part of the notation.  It's part

04:03:27.839 --> 04:03:30.886
of the record.  Like I said, I 
keep score at games.  That's 

04:03:30.887 --> 04:03:33.106
different than statistics, 
obviously.  You know, that's 

04:03:33.107 --> 04:03:35.107
just -- that's a part of the 
game that I'm not going to say I

04:03:36.244 --> 04:03:38.674
don't care about because that's 
not true, but it is not -- it is

04:03:38.675 --> 04:03:41.557
behind the action, you know?  
And that's -- but that's also 

04:03:41.558 --> 04:03:44.612
why it's cool because you would 
never -- you know, you don't 

04:03:44.613 --> 04:03:47.879
remember these things.  That's 
what they're there for.  But, 

04:03:47.880 --> 04:03:50.332
you know, the most important 
stat to me is the one everybody 

04:03:50.333 --> 04:03:54.647
forgets about most, which is 
runs scored.  The player that 

04:03:54.648 --> 04:03:56.877
scores the most is typically the
best player on the team, just so

04:03:56.878 --> 04:03:59.528
you know that.  
&gt;&gt; Actually, can I kind of -- 

04:03:59.529 --> 04:04:01.159
can I follow up on that 
question, too?  

04:04:01.160 --> 04:04:03.835
&gt;&gt; You may.  Of course.  
&gt;&gt; Am I allowed momentarily?  

04:04:03.836 --> 04:04:06.290
&gt;&gt; Of course.  
&gt;&gt; When I think about what's 

04:04:06.291 --> 04:04:09.142
different the way the fans today
experience baseball, I don't 

04:04:09.143 --> 04:04:11.143
think actually the new regime of
statistics makes that much 

04:04:11.226 --> 04:04:15.137
difference.  I think as you say,
what people are watching is did 

04:04:15.138 --> 04:04:19.003
the guy cross the plate or not? 
That's what they're watching.  

04:04:19.004 --> 04:04:21.437
But what I think is truly 
different is to the extent that 

04:04:21.438 --> 04:04:24.291
people -- interaction with the 
business of the sport is part of

04:04:24.292 --> 04:04:27.336
their fandom.  And you brought 
it up and you talked about how 

04:04:27.337 --> 04:04:30.372
it has become more distant and 
more of a consumer operation.  

04:04:30.373 --> 04:04:32.213
It kind of blows my mind that my
son who's 12, he loves playing 

04:04:32.214 --> 04:04:36.313
baseball games on his phone.  He
has one game.  The hitter and 

04:04:36.314 --> 04:04:39.672
pitch comes.  He tries to hit 
the phone to make the bat hit 

04:04:39.673 --> 04:04:42.127
the ball.  He has another game 
where he's the GM of a baseball 

04:04:42.128 --> 04:04:44.782
team.  And he thinks of both of 
those as baseball games on the 

04:04:44.783 --> 04:04:47.563
phone.  You know what I mean?  
And I do think that for this 

04:04:51.230 --> 04:04:53.889
generation of fans, thinking, 
okay, like, how many 

04:04:53.890 --> 04:04:56.139
compensatory draft picks am I 
going to get if I trade this 

04:04:56.140 --> 04:04:58.140
player?  It's part of what 
they're thinking about.

04:05:02.719 --> 04:05:05.578
Not is their base going to get 
over to make that play.  That's 

04:05:05.579 --> 04:05:07.579
a little foreign to me.  And I'm
curious what you guys think 

04:05:10.706 --> 04:05:12.753
about that in terms of this next
generation of fandom.  

04:05:15.028 --> 04:05:17.511
&gt;&gt; There's games based solely on
that, like video games.  Actual 

04:05:17.512 --> 04:05:20.149
consoles where that's all you're
doing.  I don't need that, 

04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:22.746
personally.  I mean, that's not 
a knock.  

04:05:25.028 --> 04:05:26.050
&gt;&gt; You're like the old man 
portion of the program.  

04:05:26.051 --> 04:05:28.092
[ Laughter ] 
&gt;&gt; Well, to be fair, the reason 

04:05:28.093 --> 04:05:31.179
I don't do it, because I'm not 
smart enough to get a handle on 

04:05:31.180 --> 04:05:35.504
it.  That's what it comes down 
to at the end of the day.  I 

04:05:35.505 --> 04:05:38.573
like playing.  That would be the
easy part.  Figuring out the 

04:05:38.574 --> 04:05:40.574
other nonsense is hard.  That's 
not for me.  

04:05:41.873 --> 04:05:43.127
&gt;&gt; One last question and I'm 
going to connect it back to our 

04:05:43.128 --> 04:05:45.128
collections at the library.

04:05:47.810 --> 04:05:49.841
We recently digitized Branch 
Rickey's players and we heard a 

04:05:49.842 --> 04:05:54.164
lot of feedback publicly from 
people who were surprised and 

04:05:54.165 --> 04:05:55.826
excited to see different kinds 
of information within the 

04:05:55.827 --> 04:05:59.290
scouting reports and 
correspondence.  And my question

04:05:59.291 --> 04:06:01.520
is what is an enduring myth that
you think you would like to 

04:06:04.572 --> 04:06:05.505
either dispel or you've recently
myth busted yourself about 

04:06:05.506 --> 04:06:09.844
baseball?  
&gt;&gt; Interesting question.  

04:06:11.077 --> 04:06:13.077
&gt;&gt; You can take your time.

04:06:16.019 --> 04:06:19.483
&gt;&gt; Well, I think a story worth 
noting about Branch Rickey that 

04:06:19.484 --> 04:06:21.484
may not necessarily go in the 
myth context, 

04:06:24.393 --> 04:06:27.440
though, is that -- I'm not going
to say that integrating baseball

04:06:27.441 --> 04:06:29.052
was not the most important thing
that he did because I don't 

04:06:29.053 --> 04:06:33.120
believe that.  But people don't 
know that Branch Rickey tried to

04:06:33.121 --> 04:06:35.121
start a third league.  There was
a national league, American 

04:06:36.401 --> 04:06:38.834
league, and he tried to start 
the Continental league.  Like I 

04:06:38.835 --> 04:06:41.705
always think about what would 
have happened if that had been 

04:06:41.706 --> 04:06:44.332
real, you know what I'm saying? 
&gt;&gt; Like a great pilot.  

04:06:47.408 --> 04:06:48.828
&gt;&gt; If he managed to pull that 
off, like some third league 

04:06:48.829 --> 04:06:51.056
where the big leagues were now 
-- there was, I don't know, 

04:06:52.891 --> 04:06:54.891
insert 15 more cities where 
there were 

04:06:56.145 --> 04:06:59.194
big-league teams now,.  I think 
about that all the time in terms

04:06:59.195 --> 04:07:01.431
of who he was because it was 
more -- like he wasn't just some

04:07:01.432 --> 04:07:04.274
dude trying to get, you know, 
one brother into the bigs.  That

04:07:04.275 --> 04:07:07.776
wasn't what he was.  He was a 
totally larger baseball mind in 

04:07:07.777 --> 04:07:10.637
terms of so many different 
things from a business -- and a 

04:07:10.638 --> 04:07:12.638
growth standpoint.

04:07:14.922 --> 04:07:17.374
And that oddly gets forgotten a 
lot.  Which understandably, 

04:07:17.375 --> 04:07:19.375
obviously Jackie Robinson is 
important to America and 

04:07:20.652 --> 04:07:22.703
baseball is huge in Branch 
Rickey's involvement, but that 

04:07:22.704 --> 04:07:25.998
dude was much bigger than that 
in terms of the specificity of 

04:07:25.999 --> 04:07:27.999
the sport and trying to 

04:07:29.058 --> 04:07:31.058
grow it on an expansion level in
terms of squads.  

04:07:33.568 --> 04:07:34.994
&gt;&gt; Not to pile on Branch too 
much.  You know, I think whoever

04:07:34.995 --> 04:07:36.995
described 

04:07:38.854 --> 04:07:40.479
him as the person that talk 
Machiavelli the strike zone was 

04:07:40.480 --> 04:07:44.112
on the money.  And, you know, I 
thought you were going to talk 

04:07:44.113 --> 04:07:46.211
about the fact he built a farm 
system in the '20s which 

04:07:47.636 --> 04:07:49.636
monopolized hundreds of kids.  
&gt;&gt; Right.  

04:07:50.089 --> 04:07:52.128
&gt;&gt; For the Cardinals.  You know,
Branch Rickey gets a lot of 

04:07:54.825 --> 04:07:55.648
credit, and I think a lot of it 
has been demolished for 

04:07:55.649 --> 04:07:57.649
integration.

04:08:01.023 --> 04:08:04.623
He's not doing it over a social 
conscience question.  

04:08:01.023 --> 04:08:03.023
&gt;&gt; Right.  

04:08:04.078 --> 04:08:05.308
&gt;&gt; He's doing it to monopolize 
talent, win championships, and 

04:08:05.309 --> 04:08:07.309
improve the bottom line.

04:08:12.313 --> 04:08:14.360
And, you know, to me a more 
interesting proposition would be

04:08:14.361 --> 04:08:19.278
what if they had brought in 
Negro league clubs in the late 

04:08:19.279 --> 04:08:23.770
'40s?  And the Negro League 
clubs after integration, which 

04:08:23.771 --> 04:08:25.771
witnessed their fan 

04:08:28.116 --> 04:08:29.949
base crumble overnight, 
petitioned Major League 

04:08:29.950 --> 04:08:31.987
Baseball, bring us in as a high 
minor league.  MLB didn't even 

04:08:31.988 --> 04:08:33.988
answer.

04:08:36.079 --> 04:08:38.079
And you could, you know, if that
had 

04:08:39.952 --> 04:08:42.000
happened, then you wouldn't have
the Pannis movement in 1987 

04:08:42.001 --> 04:08:46.893
where there's no black managers,
GMs, front office or ownership. 

04:08:46.894 --> 04:08:48.771
We're a little bit better now 
but not all that much.  

04:08:48.772 --> 04:08:51.243
&gt;&gt; Not by much at all.  
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much for 

04:08:51.244 --> 04:08:54.729
chatting with me exclusively.  
Let's open up to questions here 

04:08:54.730 --> 04:08:59.940
in the room.  Oh, we've got one 
right there.  Enthusiastic.  So 

04:08:59.941 --> 04:09:01.507
we have some microphones we'll 
bring around.  

04:09:01.508 --> 04:09:03.508
&gt;&gt; Hi.  Charles Martin.

04:09:06.425 --> 04:09:08.715
Thanks to Rob Ruck again for 
your blurb on my book "Lawyer 

04:09:08.716 --> 04:09:10.769
Ball."   I'd like to make a 
statement and a 

04:09:14.940 --> 04:09:16.940
proposal regarding

04:09:18.690 --> 04:09:20.751
the Stultifying of baseball, the
existential turning point of 

04:09:20.752 --> 04:09:22.752
baseball.

04:09:25.381 --> 04:09:27.026
I suggest that they have the 
same -- they relate to the same 

04:09:27.027 --> 04:09:29.927
problem, and they have the same 
solution, which is 

04:09:33.607 --> 04:09:35.607
that baseball, thanks to the 
major 

04:09:41.304 --> 04:09:43.336
league ss and to the congress 
hose whose library we're sitting

04:09:43.337 --> 04:09:46.009
is one of the few legal economic
cartels.  And Mr.

04:09:49.929 --> 04:09:51.361
Yates, the couldn'tContinental 
league would never have 

04:09:51.362 --> 04:09:55.495
succeeded because baseball would
have used its 1922 Supreme Court

04:09:55.496 --> 04:09:57.496
exemption from the 

04:09:58.783 --> 04:10:03.903
antitrust laws to kill it.  This
is how economic cartels behave. 

04:10:03.904 --> 04:10:05.904
They do not innovate.  They kill
competition.

04:10:09.248 --> 04:10:11.248
And the way to solve the 
existential 

04:10:12.570 --> 04:10:15.056
problem of people like Rob Ruck 
no longer enjoy going to 

04:10:15.057 --> 04:10:17.057
baseball games.  Baseball games 
taking three hours.

04:10:21.811 --> 04:10:22.824
Kids not knowing who Mazeroski 
and other people in history are 

04:10:22.825 --> 04:10:26.749
is competition.  You introduce 
competition.

04:10:29.820 --> 04:10:32.261
You will save the game.  The 
game is great.  It's hard to 

04:10:32.262 --> 04:10:36.136
kill.  But Major League Baseball
and Congress are doing their 

04:10:36.137 --> 04:10:38.137
best to kill it.

04:10:42.457 --> 04:10:44.457
Are you going to applaud?

[ Applause ] 
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Gates Ward.  I 

04:10:50.089 --> 04:10:52.373
was just wondering if you think 
that we'll see a woman play in a

04:10:55.016 --> 04:10:58.107
nonexhibition Major League 
Baseball game.  

04:10:58.514 --> 04:11:02.361
&gt;&gt; No.  And I think the reason 
for that is because I would 

04:11:02.362 --> 04:11:04.362
rather just watch women 

04:11:05.441 --> 04:11:07.441
play baseball against other 
women than I 

04:11:10.530 --> 04:11:12.762
would necessarily some, you 
know, notion of egalitarianism 

04:11:12.763 --> 04:11:15.187
through competing against men.  
I have a huge issue with that on

04:11:15.188 --> 04:11:18.672
a lot of levels mainly just 
because, for example, Serena 

04:11:18.673 --> 04:11:21.312
Williams is my favorite athlete 
of all time.  When I say that 

04:11:21.313 --> 04:11:23.313
she's the greatest 

04:11:24.404 --> 04:11:26.657
tennis player of all time, 
people are, like, you mean for 

04:11:26.658 --> 04:11:29.313
women, right?  No.  And 
secondarily, that's not what 

04:11:29.314 --> 04:11:31.314
that is, you know.

04:11:35.233 --> 04:11:36.668
And I -- I would like to see 
more opportunities for women to 

04:11:36.669 --> 04:11:41.186
play baseball, period.  And if 
it has to come only in the world

04:11:41.187 --> 04:11:43.187
in the framework of doing it 

04:11:45.036 --> 04:11:47.036
against a man, that's a major 
problem.  For me.  

04:11:49.672 --> 04:11:51.672
[ Applause ] 

04:11:54.997 --> 04:11:56.997
&gt;&gt; Questions relating

04:11:58.165 --> 04:12:01.042
to the stairs.  The first 
question is the exhibit focused 

04:12:01.043 --> 04:12:03.043
a lot on the evolution of 
baseball.

04:12:04.548 --> 04:12:07.206
And I was wondering what the 
panel's position was on the 

04:12:07.207 --> 04:12:09.207
current changes in the baseball 
rules, whether it be 

04:12:12.924 --> 04:12:15.809
raising the mound as, what, 20 
years ago or introducing the DH 

04:12:15.810 --> 04:12:17.810
or even the new rules that 
they're trying to speed up 

04:12:20.964 --> 04:12:23.420
the game by introducing 
different things.  As an 

04:12:23.421 --> 04:12:26.085
historian or as an ESPN 
commentator or as a 

04:12:26.086 --> 04:12:28.086
mathematician or statistician, 
how does that change the 

04:12:31.033 --> 04:12:32.895
game each time they introduce a 
new rule, or does it change the 

04:12:32.896 --> 04:12:38.405
game for the better or worse?  
&gt;&gt; I mean, I'll just say this.  

04:12:38.406 --> 04:12:40.246
As a mathematician, I value 
elegance a lot.  And I think 

04:12:40.247 --> 04:12:42.312
this concept of having a runner 
start on second base is the most

04:12:43.412 --> 04:12:45.896
cockamamie thing I've ever 
heard.  I can't even say whether

04:12:45.897 --> 04:12:50.284
it would make the game better or
worse and it's just ugly.  I 

04:12:50.285 --> 04:12:52.733
oppose it on that ground.  
&gt;&gt; (Away from mic). 

04:12:55.654 --> 04:12:57.654
&gt;&gt; I went to a game in Nashville
probably a month ago.

04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:04.223
In AAA, they've got pitch clock.
What is it?  It's 30 seconds 

04:13:04.224 --> 04:13:08.584
between batters.  15 seconds 
between pitches.  20 if there's 

04:13:08.585 --> 04:13:13.742
a runner on base.  And, okay.  
You know, like whatever.  

04:13:13.743 --> 04:13:16.809
Conceptually, do I have a 
problem with this.  And then I 

04:13:16.810 --> 04:13:18.630
realized my only issue with it 
was that there's clocks on the 

04:13:18.631 --> 04:13:22.103
field.  The cool thing about 
baseball is there's no clocks.  

04:13:22.104 --> 04:13:23.539
That's like the whole point.  
And there's four o'clocks 

04:13:23.540 --> 04:13:25.540
around.  There's a constant 
countdown happening 

04:13:29.025 --> 04:13:34.549
in your mind which was a little 
bother shm. some.  But then they

04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:36.550
played seven innings, 

04:13:39.278 --> 04:13:40.306
that bay bad boy was over in 
like, 2 hours and 15 minutes.  

04:13:40.307 --> 04:13:44.001
Okay.  Maybe I can kind of deal 
with this.  So I'm not really 

04:13:44.002 --> 04:13:48.147
sure because on the surface, 
it's annoying.  But it worked, 

04:13:48.148 --> 04:13:52.050
you know?  It kept it moving.  
And if that's what your goal is 

04:13:52.051 --> 04:13:54.051
for baseball, then sure.

04:13:56.782 --> 04:13:59.228
But my position on this has 
always been that it's the nature

04:13:59.229 --> 04:14:03.573
of the game.  Batted balls and 
so forth.  What happens during 

04:14:03.574 --> 04:14:07.476
the course of the game is what 
changes people's excitement.  

04:14:07.477 --> 04:14:08.719
Not just the length of time.  
Inserting seven dudes between 

04:14:08.720 --> 04:14:10.720
the 

04:14:11.986 --> 04:14:13.008
sixth and the ninth for matchups
is annoying.  You know what I 

04:14:13.009 --> 04:14:17.002
mean?  That is far more 
aggravating than just the amount

04:14:17.003 --> 04:14:18.834
of time it takes.  You're 
constantly stopping and 

04:14:18.835 --> 04:14:21.672
starting.  And what you're 
getting as an action is not, in 

04:14:21.673 --> 04:14:26.012
fact, that exciting.  That to me
is a larger issue that people 

04:14:26.013 --> 04:14:27.657
don't actually like what's 
happening.  Not necessarily how 

04:14:27.658 --> 04:14:30.699
long it's taking in any matter 
of time.  

04:14:32.531 --> 04:14:33.130
&gt;&gt; We have time for -- sorry, 
Jordan.  

04:14:33.131 --> 04:14:34.564
&gt;&gt; That's okay.  
&gt;&gt; One more question if it's 

04:14:34.565 --> 04:14:36.565
quick.  And maybe another one 
after that.  

04:14:36.795 --> 04:14:39.045
&gt;&gt; Okay.  I'll try to make this 
quick.

04:14:43.726 --> 04:14:45.342
Do you think that the owners' 
preoccupation with making money 

04:14:45.343 --> 04:14:47.343
in the major leagues especially 
has limited the 

04:14:49.842 --> 04:14:51.469
availability for familyies -- 
and obviously it has -- to go to

04:14:51.470 --> 04:14:55.334
the game, but the importance of 
going to the game, having the 

04:14:55.335 --> 04:14:58.013
same experience as somebody like
me that grew up and is 50 years 

04:14:58.014 --> 04:15:02.136
old now would go to the game and
end up behind home plate even 

04:15:02.137 --> 04:15:06.232
though I bought a ticket out in 
the outfield, and now if you try

04:15:06.233 --> 04:15:07.661
and go and do that now and have 
that same experience and 

04:15:07.662 --> 04:15:11.150
actually hear the communication 
between the dugouts and the 

04:15:11.151 --> 04:15:12.989
umpires and the batters and 
stuff is just -- you don't have 

04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:16.856
the same experience when you go 
to the game when you go with a 

04:15:16.857 --> 04:15:20.978
family of four to a game.  
&gt;&gt; I'll say this.  One thing I 

04:15:20.979 --> 04:15:23.830
think modern baseball is doing 
right -- and irritates, too -- I

04:15:25.916 --> 04:15:27.552
think the modern baseball 
stadium, the cheap, faraway 

04:15:27.553 --> 04:15:29.553
seats are really good.

04:15:30.643 --> 04:15:32.906
That wasn't true when I used to 
go to Memorial Stadium in 

04:15:32.907 --> 04:15:34.907
Baltimore.

04:15:35.985 --> 04:15:38.426
I go to Camden Yards and like 
buying expensive seats 

04:15:38.427 --> 04:15:41.125
sometimes, show off to my kids. 
When I sit in the bleachers, you

04:15:42.140 --> 04:15:44.140
really feel in the game.  I 
think it was not as true in the 

04:15:44.602 --> 04:15:48.263
older stadiums.  In one respect,
they're doing more to equalize 

04:15:48.264 --> 04:15:51.135
the experience.  
&gt;&gt; That's an excellent point.  I

04:15:51.136 --> 04:15:53.594
hadn't ever really thought of it
that way.  The stratification 

04:15:53.595 --> 04:15:55.818
between the best and worst is 
not necessarily that different. 

04:15:55.819 --> 04:15:59.409
You know what I mean?  I hate 
sitting behind the plate.  For 

04:15:59.410 --> 04:16:01.845
me it's a bad view and you're 
looking through a net.  I don't 

04:16:01.846 --> 04:16:04.095
actually like that seat.  But I 
do think there's something to be

04:16:07.556 --> 04:16:08.987
said about the family 
experience.  Then again, when I 

04:16:08.988 --> 04:16:13.879
go to baseball games, I really 
kind of only see families.  I'm 

04:16:13.880 --> 04:16:16.533
not really sure what the other 
side of that complaint is 

04:16:16.534 --> 04:16:20.809
because well, yes, it is 
extremely expensive in the basic

04:16:20.810 --> 04:16:22.810
concept and the value of a 
dollar, 

04:16:25.317 --> 04:16:27.582
like I don't -- I don't know who
else is going to ball games.  

04:16:27.583 --> 04:16:29.583
You know what I'm saying?  It's 
not like people are walking in 

04:16:30.247 --> 04:16:31.870
off the street that much 
necessarily outside of random 

04:16:31.871 --> 04:16:35.798
businessmen.  Which by the way, 
I never understand, like 

04:16:35.799 --> 04:16:38.461
businessmen specials.  Why is it
called that?  Like what is this?

04:16:43.966 --> 04:16:46.603
That's such -- that's such an 
antiquated term.  There are 

04:16:46.604 --> 04:16:50.066
still a lot of families going to
ballparks.  And without delving 

04:16:50.067 --> 04:16:52.067
into the intense economics of 
why it costs so much to go 

04:16:54.944 --> 04:16:56.944
to games, you know, it's still a
fun experience.

04:16:58.628 --> 04:17:00.257
And that to me is hard to 
evaluate.  If you don't like it,

04:17:00.258 --> 04:17:03.095
you don't like it.  If you go 
there, you're probably going to 

04:17:03.096 --> 04:17:07.025
have a good time.  And that, to 
me, is effectively the most 

04:17:07.026 --> 04:17:10.320
important thing overall.  No?  I
mean, does that make sense?  

04:17:13.606 --> 04:17:15.655
&gt;&gt; I would just add that I think
smart franchises in the smart 

04:17:15.656 --> 04:17:17.732
sports are cultivating kids and 
building them as fans.

04:17:20.778 --> 04:17:23.240
And I've seen the 
penguinPenguins do that in 

04:17:23.241 --> 04:17:25.052
Pittsburgh by making a large 
block of tickets available at 

04:17:25.053 --> 04:17:29.758
moderate prices to college 
students.  And the success of 

04:17:29.759 --> 04:17:31.820
the team is helped.  But, you 
know, I think, for example, 

04:17:37.511 --> 04:17:39.770
in Dominican Republic, before a 
game, you'd see 30 or 40 kids 

04:17:39.771 --> 04:17:45.588
seated on the outfield walls 
with poles, with nets at the end

04:17:45.589 --> 04:17:47.589
to try to snag balls.

04:17:50.270 --> 04:17:52.324
And they'd become lifelong fans 
in the process.  

04:17:54.375 --> 04:17:56.029
&gt;&gt; I think we will wrap up here.
I want to thank everyone for 

04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:59.898
joining us in person and also on
the livestream and especially 

04:17:59.899 --> 04:18:00.912
thanks to Jordan, Clinton and 
Rob for spending the afternoon 

04:18:00.913 --> 04:18:02.913
with us.  
&gt;&gt; Thank you.  

04:18:04.167 --> 04:18:06.624
&gt;&gt; If you were watching, we will
be archiving the livestream.  

04:18:06.625 --> 04:18:08.020
We'll make that available to 
you.  We encourage you to visit 

04:18:08.021 --> 04:18:10.021
-- what's that?

04:18:11.679 --> 04:18:12.943
Forever on YouTube.  We 
encourage you to visit the 

04:18:12.944 --> 04:18:16.596
exhibit if you haven't seen it 
yet.  I think I will pass back 

04:18:16.597 --> 04:18:19.865
over to Abby to wrap us up here 
on this event.  

04:18:20.281 --> 04:18:22.281
&gt;&gt; Thank you.  

04:18:23.896 --> 04:18:27.828
[ Applause ] 
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much.  

04:18:27.829 --> 04:18:29.872
That was such a great 
conversation.  I wish it could 

04:18:29.873 --> 04:18:32.118
be hours longer.  
&gt;&gt; (Away from mic). 

04:18:33.136 --> 04:18:37.001
[ Laughter ] 
&gt;&gt; I don't know.  The Tigers.  

04:18:37.002 --> 04:18:39.002
Transition year.  It's fine.  

04:18:41.243 --> 04:18:45.368
[ Laughter ] 
But this is just a very short 

04:18:45.369 --> 04:18:49.669
wrap-up just to thank everybody 
that came, thank everybody from 

04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:51.670
the JSTOR team who's 

04:18:54.761 --> 04:18:57.083
still around who really made 
this week very just packed with 

04:18:57.084 --> 04:19:01.364
-- I want to use baseball 
idioms.  I can't think of them. 

04:19:01.365 --> 04:19:03.191
It was a really wonderful week. 
I think this conversation just 

04:19:03.192 --> 04:19:07.293
put a big exclamation point on 
it.  And I just want to thank 

04:19:07.294 --> 04:19:10.037
everyone for coming and tuning 
in.  And thank you, Meghan, for 

04:19:10.038 --> 04:19:11.727
moderating that nice 
conversation.  

04:19:11.728 --> 04:19:13.728
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Meghan.  

04:19:14.943 --> 04:19:20.524
[ Applause ] 
&gt;&gt; And go see a baseball game.  

04:19:20.525 --> 04:19:22.525
And go to the library.

04:19:31.614 --> 04:19:33.614

P.M. ET.
