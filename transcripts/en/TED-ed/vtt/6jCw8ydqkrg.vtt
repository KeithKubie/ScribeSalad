As an experiment,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.486
we gave recordings of the same Walt
Whitman poem to 3 different animators.

00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:14.335
Each interpreted the text

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.826
with no knowledge of what 
the others were creating

00:00:16.826 --> 00:00:20.197
Here's the result.

00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:24.691
"A Noiseless Patient Spider"
by Walt Whitman

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:33.883
"A noiseless patient spider,

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:38.186
I mark'd where on a little promontory
it stood isolated,

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:42.778
Mark'd how to explore the vacant
vast surrounding,

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:47.950
It launch'd forth filament,
filament, filament, out of itself,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.815
Ever unreeling them,
ever tirelessly speeding them.

00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:00.248
And you O my soul where you stand,

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:05.487
Surrounded, detached, 
in measureless oceans of space,

00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:11.555
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing,
seeking the spheres to connect them,

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:16.022
Till the bridge you will need be form'd,
till the ductile anchor hold,

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:24.536
Till the gossamer thread you fling
catch somewhere, O my soul."
