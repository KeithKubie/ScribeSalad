00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.080
- Let's say that I have this green container and inside

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.490
this green container I have some air molecules.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.820
Now the air molecules, we assume that there's

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.340
some temperature, there's some average

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.350
kinetic energy to them but they're all going to have

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.850
different velocities, they're all going to be

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.982
bumping around in different ways.

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.590
Now the way that I've drawn it you might notice something.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.720
On the left hand side, and I'll just draw

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.350
an imaginary line here, this line has no,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.690
no real, I guess you could say structural significance,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.230
it's not like it's actually dividing it, I'm just using it

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.690
to visualize the left and right hand sides.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.210
You see on the left hand side I have

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.520
a higher concentration of my molecules,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.620
higher concentration,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.890
and how do you measure concentration?

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.451
Well the number of molecules per, well the

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:42.950
real way that you should do it is unit volume

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.350
but we're looking at a cross section here.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.890
If I were to take a section that large,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.550
look, I got four molecules here, looks like

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.450
I have about four, three to five molecules

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.420
per section around that size, well if I took

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.090
a that size section on this side I'm getting

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.820
one or maybe two molecules.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.850
And I'm not going to get too precise

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.450
but it's clear that I have a higher concentration here,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.250
I have more molecules that we have drawn at per unit area

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.790
but if we're thinking in three dimensions, per unit volume,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.480
than we have on the right hand side.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.650
So we have a higher concentration on the left,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.850
we have a lower concentration on the right,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.060
lower concentration on the right.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.250
And when you have this situation where you have

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.320
a higher concentration and then a lower concentration,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.420
we call this a concentration gradient.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.250
The concentration is changing from high to low

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.990
and so we call this a concentration,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.980
concentration...

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.020
concentration gradient.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.120
Now what do we think is going to happen?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.950
Let's say this is, this is what our situation is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.290
right when we look at it,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.290
what do we think is going to happen?

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.890
Well these, all of these particles are all

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.190
going to be bouncing around, things get moved

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.150
from the left to the right, things get moved

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.650
from the right to the left, but we have

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.020
more particles on the left that are likely

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.690
to move to the right than we have particles on the right

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.610
that are likely to move to the left.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.250
Remember, they're all moving in different directions

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.850
with these random velocities but I have more

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.990
on this side and they're all bouncing around

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.720
so in any given moment when we have this

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.650
higher concentration on the left I have a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.510
higher chance that I'm going to have stuff

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.620
go from the left to the right,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.090
go from the left to the right,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.120
than I do from the right to the left,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.620
and so as time goes on,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.520
as time goes on it's going to look something like this.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.190
If we let this system stabilize,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.990
if we let this system stabilize

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.850
for awhile it should look like this.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.120
Now let me see if I can do a good job,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.320
a good job drawing it, and I'll just

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.890
draw the molecules, I won't draw their actual,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.750
their actual velocity vectors.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.720
So if we wait awhile, how many molecules did I have,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.560
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.090
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.250
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.931
so now I have one, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:02.090
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.590
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.220
So if we let enough time go by we see that

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.390
we don't, we should no longer have

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.190
a concentration gradient, that the concentration

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.382
should be fairly uniform over time.

00:03:17.382 --> 00:03:19.050
So even if I were to draw that imaginary

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.190
dashed line, if I were to draw that imaginary dashed line,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.390
I should have the same concentration on both sides

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.560
so I no longer have a gradient,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.950
I have no gradient,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.810
and once again there's nothing magical here,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.220
it's not like the molecule said, "Oh, we are less

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.020
"concentrated over there, I somehow have to know

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.850
"to move there," you just have to think

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.810
that these are all just randomly bouncing around

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.720
and if you have a higher concentration on the left

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.790
there's a higher chance that you have bounces

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.890
or you have things moving from the left to the right

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.720
as you do from the right to left.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.550
Even in this situation things are still going to be

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.950
moving from left to right and right to left,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.420
but now that you have the same number on either side

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.650
at any given moment, in any given period of time,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.350
you have an equal probability of things moving

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.920
from the left to the right as you do from

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.690
the right to the left, so you're getting to

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.681
kind of this equilibrium situation.

00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:07.850
Sure, in a given, you know, if you take

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.610
a certain unit of time, maybe that one moves

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.920
from the left to the right, that one moves

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.590
from the left to the right,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.290
that one moves from the left to the right,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.350
but since you have equal concentrations on both sides

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.850
you're just as likely to have the same number

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.420
move from right to left.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.320
And I only did this with 20,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.090
I only did this with 20 particles,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.310
which is a little bit of an artificially low number.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.590
If we're actually talking about concentrations

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.950
of air molecules or as we'll see

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.620
when we think about cellular membranes,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.850
if we think about different types of molecules

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.190
that might be in an aqueous solution,

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.650
we're talking about way more than 20 molecules

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.820
and so you really do think in terms of

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.090
probabilistic large numbers, well hey, the probability

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.360
of something moving from the left to the right

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.620
is the same as the right to left,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.190
and so you're going to have this stability.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.890
Right here there's a much higher probability

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.340
in any given moment of something moving

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.850
from left to right than right to left

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.210
and that's why you see things moving

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.620
from high concentration to low concentration.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.050
Or another way to think about it,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.350
what we just observed here is we saw

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.520
things diffusing down their conf--,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.990
down their concentration gradient.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.130
So this process that we just described, this is diffusion,

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.750
this is diffusion,

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.420
and as we study different types of systems

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.150
we'll see that this is actually very important

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.190
to biological systems and even chemical systems

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.320
because this doesn't require any extra energy

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.150
to move the molecules from here to there,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.650
it's going to happen probabilistically,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.050
it's going to happen naturally and once again,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.820
no magic, just more stuff here,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.390
higher chance moving from left to right

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.050
than moving from right to left.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.580
And I really want to make that point clear.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.290
You can still move from right to left,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.920
for example you might have this character,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.750
maybe his, maybe instead of moving in that direction

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.150
completely possible, completely possible

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.790
that he goes from right to left.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.920
It's not like everything is moving from left to right

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.120
but you have a higher chance, you're going to have

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.220
more things moving from left to right,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.910
so that guy could move in that direction

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.250
because there's just more stuff here.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.490
They're all bouncing around in all, in all different,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.900
in all different random directions.
