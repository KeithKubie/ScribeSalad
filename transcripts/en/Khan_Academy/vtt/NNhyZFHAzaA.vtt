00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.120
Let's now account for the
same series of events,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.930
but instead of doing
it on a cash basis,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.790
let's do it on an accrual basis.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.800
And the whole idea
with accrual accounting

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.650
is to match your revenues and
expenses to when you actually

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.070
perform the service.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.980
So it actually captures
business activity, as opposed

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.080
to just capturing when
cash changes hands.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.930
So let's see what
that actually means.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.320
So in month one, you cater an
event where the cost to you

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.560
was $100.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.390
The customer pays you
$200 for your services.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.890
And what I'll do, I'll do the
accrual accounting right here.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.990
So this is kind of the
cash income statement.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.300
Let's do the accrual
accounting income statement.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.830
So you actually provided
the service of catering,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.170
you got $200 for your services.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.960
So I'll put $200 in for revenue.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.530
And the expenses associated
with that service

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.720
that you provided in
month one is $100.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.810
And so your profit is $100.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.650
So at least for month one, the
cash basis and accrual basis

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.740
of accounting look
exactly the same.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.010
And once again, you
have $100 in cash.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.580
Now let's go to month two.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.890
You cater an event where
the cost to you was $200.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.690
You and the customer
agree that they

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.010
can pay you $400 the next month.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.070
So now it gets
interesting, because you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.754
performed the
catering that month.

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:20.670
And the catering that
you performed that month

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.950
is worth $400.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.050
So in the accrual
basis of accounting,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.670
would say that you
earned $400 of revenue,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.225
even though the customer
did not pay you.

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:36.950
They did not give you the cash.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.680
And the way that you
account for that,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.950
is on your balance sheet you
say that you are essentially

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.510
owed $400.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.420
So this accounts receivable,
this is essentially stuff

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.240
that other people owe you.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.050
You need to receive
this from other people.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.800
But it's an asset.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.330
Other people have an
obligation to you.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.850
So you have an accounts
receivable of $400.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.010
When they pay you
the $400, it goes

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.070
from accounts
receivable to cash.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.280
And then the cost
to you was $200.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.270
So here, all of a sudden,
you performed the service,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.690
the revenues and expenses for
that service are in that month.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.010
And now your profit
here shows $200.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.740
So it is actually
a better reflection

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.850
of what you did it that month.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.240
Now, the reality is that you
didn't get the cash for it,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.440
and you had to spend $200
of cash out of your pocket.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.420
So you're still, just
like the cash accounting,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:40.020
you're still going to have
negative $100 in cash.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.220
Now, let's go to month three.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.510
You get $400 from the
customer the previous month.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.540
Now with cash basis, you
would have added that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.206
to your revenue.

00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:50.235
But here we already
accounted for it

00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:51.360
in the accounts receivable.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.760
We already took that
revenue, but because you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.270
got the $400 in cash, it's
going to just disappear

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.570
from receivables and then go
into cash, because you actually

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.330
got it.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.250
You get $400 from the
customer the previous month.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.715
You also get $200 in
advance from a customer

00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:08.050
that you have to cater
for the next month.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.080
So you did no catering
in month three,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.590
and because you did no
catering in month three,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.180
you have zero revenue
in month three.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.780
And then you also
have zero expenses.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.040
The way that you account
for the $400 that you got,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.560
is that your accounts
receivables goes to 0.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.690
And that goes to cash.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.550
So the negative $100,
you add $400 to it,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.880
so it will become positive $300.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.940
And the way that you account
for this $200 in advance

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.210
from a customer, is you
call that deferred revenue.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.670
You've got the cash there.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.604
So we went from negative
$100, added $400 to $300.

00:03:46.604 --> 00:03:48.520
You get another $200 in
cash, so that gives us

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.480
$500 in cash again.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.160
But we didn't earn any revenue.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.750
That $200, that was a
kind of a cash advance.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.470
So we put that right over
here in deferred revenue.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.300
That's revenue that we're
deferring to a future period.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.240
In the future, we will earn it.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.790
This is now a
liability, because we

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.170
are obligated to
earn that revenue.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.990
And then in month four, we
actually earn the revenue.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.090
So in month four,
we can actually

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.940
put it on our income
statement at $200.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.290
And then we had
$100 of expenses.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.700
So we have this $100
right over here.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.420
And so in month
four, we earned $100.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.350
And once again, $100 went
away from our cash balance.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.860
So we still have $400.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.390
So whether you do the cash
basis or the accrual basis,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.780
you have the same
exact amount of cash.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.320
But what's more interesting
is how the profit

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.716
relates in each of the periods.

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:48.840
And I'll talk about that
in a little bit more depth

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.810
in the next video.
