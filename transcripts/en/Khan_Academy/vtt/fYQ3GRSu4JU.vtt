00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:01.900
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.190
is get some practice, or
become familiar with what

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.182
different angle measures in
radians actually represent.

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:10.095
And to get our familiarity,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.788
we're gonna start with a ray
that starts at the origin,

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:16.067
and moves along, and...

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:19.213
Not moves, and points
along the positive X axis.

00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:21.076
We're gonna start with this magenta ray,

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:25.753
and we're gonna rotate
it around the origin

00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:29.098
counterclockwise by
different angle measures.

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:31.593
And think about what
quadrant do we fall into

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:35.149
if we start with this and we
were to rotate counterclockwise

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.636
by three pi over five radians?

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:37.840
And then, if we start with this,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.281
and we were to rotate counterclockwise

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:41.381
by two pi over seven radians?

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:42.550
Or, if we were to start with this,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.329
and then rotate counterclockwise
by three radians?

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.571
We encourage you to pause
the video and think about,

00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:49.032
starting with this,

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:52.891
if we were to rotate
counterclockwise by each of these,

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:56.433
what quadrant are we going to end up in?

00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:59.422
Assume you've paused the video,

00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:00.538
and you've tried it out on your own,

00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:03.651
so let's try this first
one, three pi over five.

00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:06.700
Three pi over five, so
we're gonna start rotating.

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:09.721
If we go straight up,

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.763
if we rotate it, essentially,

00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:12.967
if you want to think in degrees,

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.483
if you rotate it
counterclockwise 90 degrees,

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:18.100
that is going to get us to pi over two.

00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:20.531
That would have been

00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:24.833
a counterclockwise rotation
of pi over two radians.

00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:27.837
Now is three pi over five
greater or less than that?

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:29.866
Well, three pi over five,

00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:32.176
three pi over five

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:33.620
is greater than,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.404
or I guess another way I can say it is,

00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:39.192
three pi over six is less
than three pi over five.

00:01:39.192 --> 00:01:40.419
You make the denominator smaller,

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:42.671
making the fraction larger.

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:46.069
Three pi over six is the
same thing as pi over two.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.296
So, let me write it this way.

00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:51.322
Pi over two is less
than three pi over five.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.374
It's definitely past this.

00:01:53.374 --> 00:01:55.017
We're gonna go past this.

00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:56.921
Does that get us all the way over here?

00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:58.407
If we were to go, essentially,

00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:00.624
be pointed in the opposite direction.

00:02:00.624 --> 00:02:02.827
Instead of being pointed to
the right, making a full,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.838
I guess you could say 180 degree
counterclockwise rotation,

00:02:05.838 --> 00:02:07.892
that would be pi radians.

00:02:07.892 --> 00:02:08.657
That would be pi radians.

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:10.353
But this thing is less than pi.

00:02:10.353 --> 00:02:12.410
Pi would be five pi over five.

00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:15.508
This is less than pi radians.

00:02:15.508 --> 00:02:17.459
We are going to sit,

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.897
we are going to sit someplace,

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:22.637
someplace, and I'm just estimating it.

00:02:22.637 --> 00:02:25.993
We are gonna sit someplace like that.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.680
And so we are going to sit
in the second quadrant.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.093
Let's think about two pi seven.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.045
Two pi over seven, do we
even get past pi over two?

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:41.276
Pi over two here would
be 3.5 pi over seven.

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:43.846
We don't even get to pi over two.

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:44.995
We're gonna end up,

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:46.714
we're gonna end up someplace,

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:48.315
someplace over here.

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:50.428
This thing is, it's greater than zero,

00:02:50.428 --> 00:02:52.948
so we're gonna definitely
start moving counterclockwise,

00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:54.054
but we're not even gonna get to...

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:56.034
This thing is less than pi over two.

00:02:56.034 --> 00:02:58.993
This is gonna throw us
in the first quadrant.

00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:01.769
What about three radians?

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.278
One way to think about it is,

00:03:03.278 --> 00:03:05.865
three is a little bit less than pi.

00:03:06.403 --> 00:03:10.264
Right? Three is less than pi

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:12.438
but it's greater than pi over two.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.294
How do we know that?

00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:18.294
Well, pi is approximately 3.14159

00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:20.728
and it just keeps going on and on forever.

00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:22.388
So, three is definitely closer to that

00:03:22.388 --> 00:03:24.258
than it is to half of that.

00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:27.776
It's going to be between
pi over two, and pi.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:31.947
It's gonna be, if we start
with this magenta ray,

00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:35.752
we rotate counterclockwise
by three radians,

00:03:35.752 --> 00:03:37.253
we are gonna get...

00:03:37.253 --> 00:03:38.594
Actually, it's probably gonna be,

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:39.756
it's gonna look something,

00:03:39.756 --> 00:03:41.254
it's gonna be something like this.

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.308
But for the sake of this exercise,

00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:45.793
we have gotten ourselves, once again,

00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:48.800
into the second quadrant.
