[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:06.519
[CHEERING]

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:07.560
SCOTT BRADLEE: Thank you.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.650
So what just happened
here actually

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.380
factors into my
whole story of how

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.540
Postmodern Jukebox came to be.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.400
You see, when I
got out of school,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.350
and I moved to New
York City, and I

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.750
was expecting to try to make
it as a jazz pianist-- that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.530
was my goal.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.880
That was my dream.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
And I met with a lot
of failure at first.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.610
I couldn't get a gig anywhere.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.740
I tried some grad school.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.800
It didn't go so well.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.150
And I wound up with $100,000
of student loan debt,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.090
living in a basement,
and having trouble.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.830
I had no gigs or
anything like that.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.831
And then, on a whim,
I just thought,

00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:49.830
what have I got to lose?

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.500
You know, I know that there
was a lot of, at the time,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.510
amateur musicians using YouTube.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.950
And there was a time that
I believe that I was too

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.070
high and mighty, or I was too
good to put myself out there

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.429
on the internet like that.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.470
But then I just thought,
what have I got to lose?

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.500
And I uploaded this
medley of '80s--

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.020
you know, just like we just did,
these '80s hits reinterpreted

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.790
as ragtime piano.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.000
And the next day I went,
and I checked my email.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.150
I had expected to get
maybe 50 hits on it.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.520
And then I see just a
long string of comments.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.790
I hadn't figured out how to
disable comments from getting

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.110
e-mailed every single time.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.480
So I had this long
list of comments.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.560
And I just check it.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.810
And I see that there's
10,000 views on it.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.400
And then check it
a couple of hours

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.470
later-- it's 20,000 views.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.964
And I realized I
just went viral.

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.380
And I didn't know
what that meant.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.020
At first I thought, well,
does that mean I'm famous?

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.880
No, it doesn't mean that.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.160
It doesn't mean you're famous.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.500
But I did know one
thing, you know,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.180
that that was more
people that had

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240
seen me play as a
result of that one video

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.950
than had seen me play live
in all the years of my life

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.480
combined up until that point.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.750
So I realized that, if
there was a way that I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.120
was going to make it
into the music industry,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.560
it wasn't going to be the normal
path of playing $100 restaurant

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.470
gigs, and sending out
demo CDs, and stuff.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.450
I realized that there
was this other way

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.740
to make a career of music.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.070
And that's what I
talk about in my book.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.070
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.677
So thank you for
having me, Anna.

00:02:20.677 --> 00:02:22.260
ANNA SANTOS: Thank
you for being here.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.926
SCOTT BRADLEE: And
also, I got to admit,

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:25.920
I played the Madonna
part of that for you.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.720
ANNA SANTOS: Thank you so much.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.553
SCOTT BRADLEE: I know
you like some Madonna.

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:30.360
ANNA SANTOS: I do like Madonna.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.820
Scott and I have
something in common.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.270
We spent a lot of our childhood
years listening to records

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.940
and making up our own
improvised music videos.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.950
In my case, it was Madonna
and Whitney Houston.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.000
In Scott's case, it
was the grand MJ.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.500
So maybe you could
talk a little bit

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.257
about how you started out, your
early years of piano playing,

00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:51.840
and what Michael
Jackson meant to you,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.132
and other early influences.

00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:55.090
SCOTT BRADLEE: Absolutely,
maybe I'll sit here.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.250
Because I guess that'll
be like-- that feels

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.458
a little more natural, right?

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:03.310
All right, that's much better.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.850
These are nice chairs, too--

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.550
OK, as I fall of it.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.200
So yeah, my early
years of music--

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.730
my first exposure to music--

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.710
happened really when my
parents would play me

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.004
records, like actual records.

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:18.920
They weren't hipsters.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.470
That was just the
medium of the time.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.300
This was the early '80s.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.190
And then for my sixth birthday
I got my favorite record, which

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.180
was Michael Jackson's "Bad."

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.460
And I spent a lot of times
just poring over the lyrics.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.100
I learned how to read
as a result of reading

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.130
his lyrics, which led to kind
of a unfortunate incident

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.290
where my mom had to
try to define the word

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.510
"seduce" to me in the most
G-rated way as possible.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.600
And yeah, I learned
some dance moves.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.250
I tried the moonwalk,
which was just

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.110
kind of walking
backwards at that age.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.190
That's all I could do.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.630
But it was really a
big inspiration to me

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.190
to be able to--

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.014
well, first of all, to learn
to read as a result of it,

00:04:04.014 --> 00:04:05.930
but also to find a type
of music that I really

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.610
connected to when I was a kid.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.020
But then, years later--

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.231
I mean, that's when
you're age six.

00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:12.230
You know, I was age six.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.930
And I listened to that, and
MC Hammer, and all these guys.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.740
But then I kind of just
fell away from pop music.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.231
And I fell away from music in
general until maybe I was 12.

00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:24.230
ANNA SANTOS: And what
happened when you were 12?

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.140
SCOTT BRADLEE: So I had
failed at piano lessons.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.270
My teacher dropped me,
because I didn't practice.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.980
I was just not--

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.360
you know, she just told
my mom straight up,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.030
"he's not really
motivated to do this.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.880
And you're wasting my
time and your money."

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.680
So I stopped taking
piano lessons.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.450
And I was overjoyed at the time.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.610
I didn't like taking
piano lessons at all.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.490
But then, no sooner did I stop,
that I heard a piece of music

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.140
called "Rhapsody in Blue."

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.090
And then it was just
one of those moments

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.090
where I was like, wait
a minute, piano doesn't

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.770
have to be this boring thing
with scales and sonatas

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.730
or whatever.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.930
And George Gershwin, the
composer of "Rhapsody in Blue,"

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.320
had a really seamless
way of integrating jazz

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.792
and classical music together.

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:10.250
So I knew what
classical music was.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.750
I didn't know
anything about jazz.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.130
But when I heard it, I just
fell in love with the sound.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.370
And I decided that I
was going to figure out

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.642
how to play that sound.

00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:19.100
And I started going
to the library,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.684
and taking out cassette tapes,
and just putting it by my hear,

00:05:21.684 --> 00:05:23.766
and trying to figure out
what all these great jazz

00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:26.410
musicians were doing, and really
just a lot of trial and error.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.870
I was from a small town.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.520
There was jazz piano teacher
that I could go to for help.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.710
And this was kind
of pre-internet,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.849
so you had to do it
the old fashioned way.

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.640
ANNA SANTOS: So you're
largely self-taught?

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.973
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:38.973 --> 00:05:40.996
ANNA SANTOS: That's amazing.

00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:42.620
SCOTT BRADLEE: But
it was really great,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.680
in some ways, that I didn't
have too many distractions.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.390
I think, if I grew
up with internet,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.848
you know, it's a
distracting thing.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.820
There's all this
fun stuff to do.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.820
And even learning something
can be overwhelming,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.880
even learning a skill.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.610
Like you look--
"how to play jazz"--

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.160
Google that, and you're going
to get it like so many results.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.400
But for me, the only
way was to listen

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.270
to what other jazz musicians
had done and were doing.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.751
And that's kind of the tradition
of how that art form grows.

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.250
ANNA SANTOS: Right,
and you describe

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.300
in the book that vintage music
was a way for you to escape

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.640
some of the teenage
angst, and loneliness,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.670
or social isolation that
you felt. So talk to us

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.830
a little bit about
that and that kind of--

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.316
the escape and catharsis
that it gave you.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:26.690
SCOTT BRADLEE: Well, I mean,
we all remember high school.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.030
I think for everybody, high
school is like a crazy time.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.700
Or I mean, in my case, I
think even like eighth grade,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.780
seventh grade--

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.120
you know, that's the time--

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.060
that was when I was--

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.010
I grew to the same
height that I am today.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.320
I stopped growing at
like eighth grade.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.870
But I was like 110 pounds.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.277
So my ears were huge
and all kinds of stuff.

00:06:46.277 --> 00:06:48.610
ANNA SANTOS: Parts of your
body grow faster than others?

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.818
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:49.818 --> 00:06:54.200
So those years are
a very awkward time.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.120
I have the photos to prove it.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.120
ANNA SANTOS: We all do.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.220
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.511
And for me, I think that music
really serves as an escape.

00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.760
Because you're very confused
about everything in life,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.244
you know?

00:07:06.244 --> 00:07:07.910
You're trying to fit
in with your peers,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.340
but you're also trying to
establish your own identity.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.390
You're trying to break
away from your parents,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.260
but in like a nice way.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.947
You still love
your parents, but--

00:07:16.947 --> 00:07:19.280
ANNA SANTOS: But you want to
establish you independence.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.270
SCOTT BRADLEE: Exactly.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.260
So for me, I kind of found
that in practicing piano

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.880
and studying jazz.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.790
And whenever I played piano,
whenever I sat at the piano,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.920
it's almost like I went
into this other world

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.500
where I'm just connecting
with this tradition of all

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.530
these pianists from
1920s New Orleans.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.340
So it was kind of like a
very cathartic experience.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.520
I think I used the
word cathartic right.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.530
I think that that's
how that works.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.870
ANNA SANTOS: Yeah, I mean
it's a romantic notion

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.200
to sort of allow yourself to
go back into these bygone eras

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.320
that you don't necessarily
fully understand.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.890
But there's kind of this
escapism and daydreaming

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:58.700
quality to them.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.075
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Yeah, I definitely

00:08:00.075 --> 00:08:02.300
felt like I was an old soul
and that by doing that,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.890
by learning that
kind of music, I

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.557
was connecting
with the generation

00:08:05.557 --> 00:08:06.890
that I should have been born in.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.230
ANNA SANTOS: Right, I
can relate to that a lot.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.130
And so that kind of
took you into this group

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.030
of social outsiders or misfits
within your high school.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.240
And you quickly showed them
your number one party trick,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.750
which was?

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.020
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
so I was really

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.570
into ragtime piano
and early jazz.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.880
And you can imagine, if
you're a 16-year-old kid

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.800
or 17-year-old kid,
that's not what

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.330
other people are listening to.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.770
So all my friends
liked pop music.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.289
Or they liked bands
like the Chili Peppers,

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.990
or they liked gangsta rap, and
they like all this other stuff.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.000
So I would do
things on the piano,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.500
like take, similar
to what I just

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.909
did in the very beginning--

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.340
I would take a song like
"Big Poppa," Notorious BIG,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.450
and turn it into ragtime.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.000
And when I did it
the first time--

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.880
ANNA SANTOS: Pretty genius.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.440
SCOTT BRADLEE: --they just kind
of stopped what they're doing.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.251
They were like, "that's amazing.

00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:57.750
I could recognize
the song in there.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.160
I could hear that."

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.890
Then they were like, "can you
play some Sublime like that?"

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.681
I was like, "sure."

00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:03.260
You know, so I
demonstrated that.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.015
And I didn't really
think too much of it.

00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:07.640
It was just kind of
like a party trick.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.580
But it was a way for me
to kind of share my world

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.950
with my friends.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.450
ANNA SANTOS: It sounds like a
pretty good party trick to me.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.075
SCOTT BRADLEE: You
know, it worked out.

00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:18.940
It was pretty
cool, I got to say.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.451
But that was something I
kind of put aside, because I

00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:22.700
didn't think that was serious.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.400
I didn't think-- no jazz
musicians were doing

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.320
that, no real jazz musicians.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.390
So after high school I kind
of abandoned it for a while.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.060
ANNA SANTOS: Except that
there was one other foray

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.460
into live music
that you did when

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.970
you were still in high school,
the notorious Walmart story.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.970
SCOTT BRADLEE: I begin
the book with this story.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.710
I wanted to start
with my first gig.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.750
And my first gig
was at a Walmart.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.090
And I worked at Walmart.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.610
And I wasn't supposed to have
a gig at Walmart that day.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.620
And because of said
gig at Walmart,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.630
I then got fired from Walmart.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.070
So that was an early experiment.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.410
But my friends
were super into it.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.960
I was just like,
hey, I got this idea.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.380
Instead of just talking about
live music, or talking about--

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.550
why don't we make a band?

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.300
And they're like, well,
where can we play?

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.720
I'm like, well, I got-- you
know, I work at the paint

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.530
counter at Walmart.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.780
Nobody goes there.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.960
It's a small town.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.890
It's a paint counter.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.950
You know, let's go set up
all the instruments there.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.201
I got over the PA system.

00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:25.200
They had a little phone.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.120
You could talk over
the Public Address.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.020
It was supposed to be used
for actual store purposes.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.600
And I was like,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.016
please welcome to
the stage-- you know,

00:10:33.016 --> 00:10:34.410
doing this whole announcement.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.290
And we played 15 minutes.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.407
It just got shut down.

00:10:38.407 --> 00:10:40.740
ANNA SANTOS: I think some of
the people in this audience

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.932
will appreciate your band name.

00:10:42.932 --> 00:10:44.640
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
it was Scott Bradlee

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.894
and His Intergalactic
Purveyors of Funk.

00:10:48.894 --> 00:10:51.060
ANNA SANTOS: And you debuted
with Sly and the Family

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.940
Stone, which is hilarious.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.731
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
some of the classics--

00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:55.470
some of the classics.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.810
ANNA SANTOS: So,
moving away from music

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.720
for a second, another area
that you've dabbled in and been

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.870
successful in is video games.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.850
And you started out--

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.830
well, when you were a
kid, one of the things

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.720
that occupied a lot of
your time and energy

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.570
was tinkering with gadgets,
and pulling them apart,

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.772
and disassembling them.

00:11:13.772 --> 00:11:16.230
And I think a lot of people in
this audience here at Google

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.084
will relate to that.

00:11:17.084 --> 00:11:19.500
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, the only
thing is you guys-- probably

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.290
when you take things apart,
you can put it back together.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.250
I couldn't.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.240
So it was just like a fun--

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.070
I was always very curious
of how things worked.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.840
And I guess later I
started applying that

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.030
to music in terms of
just songs, and kind

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.895
of pulling parts of songs
away from each other

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:37.869
to figure out what
makes up a song, what

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:38.910
makes up a certain sound.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.380
That's how I learned
to play piano.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.860
It was really hearing something
and then reverse engineering

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.070
it, in a way, a process that
I'm sure you guys are all

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.090
familiar with, figuring out the
essential parts of something,

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.120
and what parts are extraneous,
what parts are just

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.160
somebody being creative,
what parts are necessary.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.800
ANNA SANTOS: Right,
and you went on

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.580
to do music for
"BioShock Infinite"?

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.440
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, and
that was my first-- so,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.840
as a result of that
medley where I went viral,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.220
and I did the
ragtime '80s thing,

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.040
I got a call from a
dude that was like,

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.690
"hey man, I really
like what you're doing.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.230
Do you think you could do
that for a video game?"

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.180
And I was just shocked.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.510
Because I had never done a
real gig like that before.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.010
And I remember they were
saying like, oh, well

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.360
what would you charge for
this, or something like that?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.730
And I'm like, "um, well I gotta
ask my manager, and my agent,

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.500
and also my publicist."

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.360
I didn't have any
of those things.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.177
I was just a--

00:12:37.177 --> 00:12:38.760
ANNA SANTOS: Fake
it 'til you make it.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.420
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.470
There was a lot of that.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.890
But I wound up
working on this game.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.260
And at this time, I had
been doing viral videos,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.400
like piano stuff.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.410
But I never worked
with singers before,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.607
mostly because I was kind
of annoyed by singers.

00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:54.690
I just felt like they were
messing up-- no offense

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.060
to the singers here, no
offense to the singer I'm going

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.310
to bring up in a little bit.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.060
But I was like, oh, they're just
going to mess up my piano part.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.460
But then they found
this amazing singer

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.900
there was a Motown
legend, really.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.000
She's sang on all these
old Motown records.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.290
And her name was Miche Braden.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.845
And we put together a--

00:13:13.845 --> 00:13:15.910
I did this arrangement
of "Tainted Love."

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.560
And it was kind of a
1920s style, Bessie Smith

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.550
version of it.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.430
And Miche Braden came, and
she sang the vocal on it.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.240
And, as I was listening to
her sing to my arrangement,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.130
I just had chills all over.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.614
And I just realized this is
what I'm meant to be doing.

00:13:31.614 --> 00:13:33.030
I don't have to
be just a pianist.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.750
I can be a producer as well.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.620
And I can bring other people
into this kind of vintage world

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.810
that I was dreaming of.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.340
ANNA SANTOS: Right, and
that was the very beginning

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.352
of your music collective.

00:13:44.352 --> 00:13:45.810
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Absolutely, that was

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.564
kind of where I got the
idea to explore that route.

00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:51.480
ANNA SANTOS: Would you
like to do another song

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.840
or continue with the story
of the birth of Postmodern

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.472
Jukebox?

00:13:55.472 --> 00:13:57.180
SCOTT BRADLEE: Well
that kind of actually

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.810
segues nicely into how
that influenced what I was

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.250
doing on YouTube at that time.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.150
I had a few subscribers from
doing these viral videos.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.860
I think about three
of those viral videos

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.360
were "Jersey Shore" influenced.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.400
I don't know why.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.660
I'm from Jersey.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.340
I grew up with some
of those people.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.490
It's just the way it is.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.600
I was throwing a bunch
of stuff against the wall

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.300
and just seeing
what would stick.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:26.700
And I started doing a
lot of musical mash-ups

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.800
and also genre
mash-ups, like taking

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.747
two things that maybe
didn't belong together

00:14:30.747 --> 00:14:31.830
and putting them together.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:38.250
And one example was I heard
that the band Nickelback was

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.325
supposed to play at a halftime
of a Detroit Lions game.

00:14:41.325 --> 00:14:42.950
ANNA SANTOS: Everyone's
favorite band--

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.780
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, and
the people of Detroit

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.390
were so enraged by
the mere suggestion

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.230
that Nickelback was going
to be playing in their city

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.970
that they decided to create
a petition against it,

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.120
and not just any petition--

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.184
a Change.org petition.

00:14:59.184 --> 00:15:00.600
ANNA SANTOS: So
you know it's big.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.040
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
so I heard about this.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.584
And I just thought
to myself, well,

00:15:04.584 --> 00:15:06.750
I think that there's a way
to make both sides happy.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.440
What if I came up with a
Motown tribute to Nickelback.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.152
So I got a bunch of
friends together,

00:15:13.152 --> 00:15:15.360
and we recorded-- you know
this is super last minute.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.380
I'm still in my basement.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.505
I'm living in the basement.

00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:20.029
I had a crazy landlord who
you'll hear about in the book.

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:22.320
ANNA SANTOS: Who brought you
quarts of split pea soup--

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.400
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
she was very maternal,

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.858
but she would do
it in a weird way.

00:15:24.858 --> 00:15:26.820
She'd be like, "Daniel"--
she called me Daniel.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.470
Because she didn't
remember my name.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.820
"Did you get the
chicken I left for you?"

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.740
And I'm like, what are
you talking about, Agatha?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.073
She's like, "I left you chicken.

00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:35.460
It's on your air
conditioner outside."

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.760
I was like, I was
gone for this week.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.510
So there'd be rotting
chicken outside,

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:45.171
or there'd be like giant bags of
like 200 bagels just molding--

00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:46.670
ANNA SANTOS: She
meant well, though.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.970
That was her way
of showing love.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:48.690
SCOTT BRADLEE: She
showed a lot of love.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.120
Yeah, she was very sweet.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.430
She's a very sweet woman.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.650
And I got everybody
together in this apartment.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.510
We recorded it
super last minute,

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.750
the day before Thanksgiving,
and put it online.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.500
And then we went
viral in Canada.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.605
So it still counts.

00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:07.980
ANNA SANTOS: Canada
still counts?

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.780
SCOTT BRADLEE: You don't get
to choose where you go viral.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.529
But in this case, we
went viral in Canada.

00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:13.710
And we got a call to play--

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.220
I got a call from a live
nation booking agent.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.050
And she was like,
"hey, so do you

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.260
think you could do a whole--

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.050
I'd love to have a Motown
tribute to Nickelback

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:22.980
perform at this festival.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.050
Can you do a whole set?"

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.860
I'm like, hey, well
we're not a real band.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.671
You know, we only
do that one song.

00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:28.920
And she's like, "yeah, I know.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.810
I know, but could you
learn a whole bunch

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.780
of Nickelback songs?"

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.589
And I'm like, I could.

00:16:34.589 --> 00:16:35.880
But then I had this other idea.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.713
I was like, well, you
know, I got this thing

00:16:37.713 --> 00:16:39.720
that I do with turning
all kinds of songs

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.059
into jazz, into all these
old fashioned things,

00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:43.350
and I bring a bunch of singers.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.490
And they're like,
"actually we're

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.906
just looking for
Nickelback songs.

00:16:45.906 --> 00:16:48.120
Thank you very much."

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.310
So that was actually
when I pitched

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.780
the idea of Postmodern Jukebox.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.540
But instead I got turned
down, because they just

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.120
wanted to hear Nickelback.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.730
ANNA SANTOS: So with the
Nickelback Motown tribute done,

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.900
tell us about how Postmodern
Jukebox came to be,

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.160
that first moment, the first
video in your apartment.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.050
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Well what happened

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.319
as a result of the
Motown Nickelback fiasco,

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.260
or whatever you would call
it, a lot of things happened.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.130
I started to realize
that, by bringing singers

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.558
in that are really talented
and collaborating with them,

00:17:26.558 --> 00:17:28.349
that I could have a
lot more success than I

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.000
could have on my own
just playing piano

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.260
or something like that.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.770
And then the creative
aspect of it,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.630
doing something that
was unexpected-- it

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.400
was similar to playing
music in Walmart.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.170
Nobody really expects
that to happen.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.330
So I realized that I could
do the online version

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:51.390
of my Walmart experiments by
taking songs that you wouldn't

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.150
think would work in a genre, and
putting them into that genre,

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.990
and then just seeing
how people react to it.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.300
And I actually want to
bring a guest up for this.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.990
So we have-- this is one of my
favorite singers in the world.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.840
And she's toured with
Postmodern Jukebox extensively.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.640
She's been in lots
of our videos.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.760
And she's just an all
around awesome human being.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.535
I want to bring up to
the stage Sara Niemietz.

00:18:11.535 --> 00:18:13.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.232
So the whole idea behind
Postmodern Jukebox is taking

00:18:17.232 --> 00:18:19.815
things that you wouldn't imagine
in one style and turning them

00:18:19.815 --> 00:18:23.720
into something else, imagining
how some of the biggest hits--

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.364
or, in this case,
you just a random--

00:18:25.364 --> 00:18:26.530
SARA NIEMIETZ: Medium hits--

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.066
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Yeah, medium hits--

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.960
how they would sound
if they were recorded

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.280
in a completely different era.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.160
And the thing is
that I think maybe

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.370
people that aren't musicians
don't recognize that it's not

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.680
so much about playing--
you don't set out to just

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.314
to learn one genre.

00:18:42.314 --> 00:18:43.730
When you're a
musician, you really

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.140
just learn to be a musician.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.420
And you learn to kind
of move between genres.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.170
And just because a song is
done in one way on a recording

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.545
doesn't mean you can't take
it into other genres as well.

00:18:53.545 --> 00:18:55.128
SARA NIEMIETZ: I
think that's the case

00:18:55.128 --> 00:18:56.840
with a lot of
well-written songs, too,

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.014
like the Pokemon song.

00:18:58.014 --> 00:18:59.180
SCOTT BRADLEE: There you go.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.010
SARA NIEMIETZ: You know, it's
very clear what it's trying

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.150
to express, whether it's--

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.608
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Gotta catch 'em all.

00:19:03.608 --> 00:19:06.650
SARA NIEMIETZ: Yeah, and it
really translates across genre.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.637
And it's very melodic.

00:19:07.637 --> 00:19:08.720
SCOTT BRADLEE: Absolutely.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.640
And Sara, maybe you
can speak on this too.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.520
As a singer, what
goes through your head

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.080
when you're interpreting?

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.520
Because you're not
just singing a song.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.880
And what I love about you is
that you never sing it just

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.114
like a recording or anything.

00:19:21.114 --> 00:19:22.280
You put your own spin on it.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.760
You put your own personal stamp
on everything that you do.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.641
And maybe you could just
tell us a little bit

00:19:27.641 --> 00:19:30.140
how you approach things as a
singer, whether with Postmodern

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.670
Jukebox or with your own
stuff when you're interpreting

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.982
somebody else's song.

00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:37.940
SARA NIEMIETZ: I think,
like Scott, you grow up

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.070
listening to so many genres.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.130
When I sing something
that's country, or jazz,

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.900
or whatever it is,
I don't really go,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.630
OK, I'm going to try to think
what does this sound like.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.900
It's just so integrated into
your mind and your heart

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.300
just from having listened
to so much of it.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.730
Listening has been a really big
part of my musical education,

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.400
like you with the cassette.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.350
I had a little Hit Clips
players, and the old iPod,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.290
and all those.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.070
But really for me, when
I'm singing something,

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.380
whether it's the Pokemon
song, or it's "Lush Life,"

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.680
it's all about the message of
the song and the feeling of it.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.130
So I always start
with the lyrics

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.700
and what it's trying to express.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.270
And then I think, if your mind
is in, in the emotion of it,

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.367
it's going to come out,
regardless of the genre.

00:20:22.367 --> 00:20:23.450
SCOTT BRADLEE: Absolutely.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.950
Yeah, well said.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.139
Awesome.

00:20:26.139 --> 00:20:28.430
All right well, Sara, I'll
let you take a little break.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.721
SARA NIEMIETZ: Yeah, that was--

00:20:29.721 --> 00:20:30.947
talk about catharsis.

00:20:30.947 --> 00:20:31.946
That was intense for me.

00:20:31.946 --> 00:20:33.260
SCOTT BRADLEE: It felt good.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.860
But I'm going to bring you
back, so don't go too far, OK?

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.320
Sara Niemietz, everybody.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.800
ANNA SANTOS: So I'd like to
backtrack just a little bit

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.440
to that first moment that you
really made it on YouTube.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.450
I think a lot of
folks in this audience

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.600
here will be curious
to know how you

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.120
grew your following on YouTube,
maybe some tips and advice

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.970
that you'd give to young
artists looking to do the same.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.790
And I specifically
wanted to ask you

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.660
about a line in the book
that really stuck out for me.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:16.180
When you were recording that
video, the thrift shop video,

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.710
in your New York apartment, and
Robin, your singer at the time,

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.020
said, "don't worry.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.942
I'll be fine doing this.

00:21:24.942 --> 00:21:25.900
It's only the internet.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.090
It's not real life."

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.750
And I'd love to know,
thinking back on that now so

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.630
many years later,
and with the success

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.880
that you've achieved
under your belt,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.470
where is that distinction?

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.770
Is there a line still between
the internet and real life?

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.380
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.760
And yeah, it's a great
observation, too,

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.910
that that line is kind
of blurry in a sense.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.070
There's a sense that
we still don't think

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.300
of the internet as real life.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.320
I know that, for me, when
we played our first show,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.410
I didn't think that anybody
would show up there.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.730
It was Toronto.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.370
And I just thought to myself, I
don't know anybody in Toronto.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.320
I see that we have
videos that are popular,

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.966
and people write,
and everything.

00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:13.590
But it doesn't hit
you as a real thing.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.840
I'd never really met any
Postmodern Jukebox fans

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.270
in real life that I
didn't already know.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.230
So to go to Toronto and
then all of a sudden

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.330
see that there's a whole
audience full of people,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.830
and they're dressed vintage.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.030
At first I was
thinking it was like--

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.290
I heard all these
cheers and stuff.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.720
I'm like, did they book a
famous DJ here or something?

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.020
Like what's going on here?

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.050
And then I saw they were all
dressed vintage, with bow ties

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:34.830
and flapper dresses.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.496
I'm like, oh, nope,
they're here for us.

00:22:36.496 --> 00:22:38.730
OK, let's do this.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.740
But that's when it
felt real for me.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.030
Because I saw the actual--

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.530
ANNA SANTOS: The
physical presence--

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.155
SCOTT BRADLEE: --the
physical presence.

00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:50.400
But that doesn't mean that all
the YouTube stuff wasn't real.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.880
The YouTube stuff is what
gave us a fan base that

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.410
was all over the world.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.220
In the old days, you'd have
to play your immediate area,

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.140
geographic region.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.390
If you're in New York City,
you play in New York City.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.850
And then maybe you can
branch out and go to Philly.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.950
Maybe you can go up to Boston.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.560
Maybe you can hit
another city around you

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.970
and expand your radius.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.550
But with YouTube, you don't
have to do that anymore.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.400
When we started touring,
we did our first US tour

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.510
and our first European
tour at the same time,

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.030
in the same month.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.950
We had as many fans,
even more fans,

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.580
in Prague than we did in the
United States, which was crazy.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.342
So I think that that line is--

00:23:31.342 --> 00:23:33.300
I'm kind of answering
your questions backwards.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.520
But I think that that line--

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.570
is it kind of blurry?

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.774
I mean, it kind of exists
only psychologically.

00:23:38.774 --> 00:23:40.440
For some reason we
don't think of things

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.510
on the internet as real.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:46.170
Certainly we all craft
identities online.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.840
When I post a
picture on Instagram,

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.440
I'll post a picture of me on
stage or doing something cool.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.990
I won't have a picture
of me like eating oatmeal

00:23:54.990 --> 00:24:00.002
in my boxers and spilling said
oatmeal all over my bare chest

00:24:00.002 --> 00:24:00.960
or something like that.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.430
ANNA SANTOS: I mean, who
knows how many views you

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.180
could get with that post.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.050
SCOTT BRADLEE: Maybe I
should be doing that stuff.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:04.710
I don't know.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.890
But--

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:05.685
ANNA SANTOS: You never know.

00:24:05.685 --> 00:24:07.820
There's an audience for
everything, I've learned.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.290
SCOTT BRADLEE: Exactly.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.090
Yeah, I learned about
that Instagram Bread Face,

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.560
where she does this--

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.885
she puts her face on bread.

00:24:15.885 --> 00:24:19.080
I don't understand it, but she's
got way more followers than I

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.290
have, so can't judge.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.511
Internet is a weird place.

00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:24.510
ANNA SANTOS: It sure is.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.176
SCOTT BRADLEE: So
that part is for sure.

00:24:26.176 --> 00:24:28.170
So then, going back to
the thrift shop video,

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.860
that was the first video that we
made where we went super viral.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.110
We got a million
views in a week, and--

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.490
ANNA SANTOS: Incredible, yeah.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.230
SCOTT BRADLEE: We were
not expecting that at all.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.440
Thank you.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.760
Thank you.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.260
ANNA SANTOS: Right,
and you became--

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.240
on day two, you were the
third most watched video

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.449
on all of YouTube, which is--

00:24:43.449 --> 00:24:44.823
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Yeah, it was nuts.

00:24:44.823 --> 00:24:45.450
And it was--

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:45.710
ANNA SANTOS: --mind-boggling.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.668
SCOTT BRADLEE: Because
we see like a thumbnail.

00:24:47.668 --> 00:24:49.380
And it's like Pitbull
and then Beyonce.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.690
And then it's like
us in my living room.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.880
And I'm just thinking,
wait a minute.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.810
That didn't feel real.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.170
That totally felt very surreal.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.990
I'm like, am I the
only one seeing this?

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.280
Are other people seeing that?

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.920
That's crazy.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.800
And Robin, who was
our singer, she

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.070
was my girlfriend at the time.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.832
And she had sung karaoke.

00:25:08.832 --> 00:25:11.040
And she never really performed
or anything like that.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.540
But I knew she had
this great voice.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.480
And I had been pushing
her to sing more.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.376
And she just was always
thinking like, oh no, I'm

00:25:18.376 --> 00:25:19.500
not good enough to do that.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.160
I can't do something like that.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.920
So then finally,
with "Thrift Shop,"

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.522
we had been just
jamming on that.

00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:25.980
And I'm like, we
gotta record this.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.580
And she's like, "well, who
do you want to sing this?

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.460
You work with so many
awesome singers."

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.122
And I'm like, I want
you to sing this.

00:25:31.122 --> 00:25:33.330
And she's like, "I don't
know if I'm ready for that."

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.310
But we wound up doing it.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.870
And we recorded it.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:37.620
And it went fine.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.745
And she felt good about it.

00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:41.039
And I put it online.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.080
And I kind of braced her.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.400
I was like, this
video is really good.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.960
It might get like 10,000
views, which seemed like a lot.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.360
But I was wrong by
a factor of 100.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.230
And the next day,
the first thing I did

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.535
was got a call when she read
like a bunch of comments

00:26:01.535 --> 00:26:02.160
and everything.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.210
She was in tears.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.610
Because of all the
positive comments,

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.200
there was a few
negative ones as well,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.000
like anything that
becomes popular.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.570
She was like just
really distraught.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.029
She felt like she
ruined the video.

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:17.319
And I was like, no, you didn't.

00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:18.280
You did the opposite.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.260
I mean, you just
made this go viral.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.040
This is a million views,
or this is on pace

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.480
to get a million views.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.370
But I was trying to
be very supportive.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.656
So I said, do you want me
to take this video down?

00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:31.530
You know, if it really
bothers you that much,

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:32.321
I can take it down.

00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:34.590
And she was like,
"no, no, it's OK.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.184
Leave it up."

00:26:35.184 --> 00:26:36.600
And I was like,
phew, that's good.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.920
Because I wasn't
going to take it down.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.270
There was no chance I was
going to take that one down.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.160
ANNA SANTOS: So I think
that's a good segue

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.050
into another question
I had for you,

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.180
which was, rising
the way that you did,

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.480
in a forum like
YouTube, and becoming

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.540
an internet band before you
became an IRL, in real life

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:01.580
band to some extent, how have
you, or what kind of advice

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.170
would you give to people on how
to deal with online trolling,

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.180
and bullying, and
that kind of thing?

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.250
I know one of your
tactics has been

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:16.246
to respond to comments with a
free coupon for chicken wings.

00:27:16.246 --> 00:27:17.870
SCOTT BRADLEE: Not
just chicken wings--

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:23.360
it was boneless chili lime
chicken wings from a store

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:23.930
that--

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.510
you know, the coupons had
expired maybe 10 years ago.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.992
It sounds disgusting
to begin with.

00:27:27.992 --> 00:27:29.450
ANNA SANTOS: But
I love how you did

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.400
that, because you were
basically like, well,

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.260
no one can retort to this.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.560
Like who has a comment
back to a coupon?

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.310
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
I mean, I don't know.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.300
I'm not the best example.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.841
I have fun with the
haters sometimes.

00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:41.702
I just write funny things back.

00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:42.410
And I don't know.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.780
It doesn't-- I'm not somebody
that gets bothered that much

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.280
by it.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.930
But there are other people
that do get bothered by it.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.020
And unfortunately
cyber-bullying is a huge thing.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.900
And it's this new problem that
never really existed before.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.870
And there are people that--

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.480
and it's not what people
think of as internet trolls.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.250
You know, it's not just one--

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.090
you know, I think
everybody expects

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.200
it to be a 14-year-old
in a basement somewhere

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.910
or something like that.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:06.451
But it's not.

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:10.779
I mean, all types of people
can be internet trolls.

00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:12.320
But first of all,
you have to realize

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.720
that you're doing something
right if you're getting trolls.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.636
Because that means you're
creating engagement.

00:28:16.636 --> 00:28:19.610
And engagement is such an
incredibly important part

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:24.171
of building a brand, or
building a band in this case.

00:28:24.171 --> 00:28:25.670
If you don't have
engagement, if you

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.940
don't have a conversation
going, then what you're doing

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.220
is not really
connecting in the way

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.150
that it should in order to
take things to the next level.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.930
So it's a really
good problem to have.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.560
I mean, it's a weird thing
that, as artists, artists

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.810
seem to get an insane
amount of criticism.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.210
And it's funny that you
can put something out--

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.145
like all we're doing is trying
to entertain a bunch of people

00:28:46.145 --> 00:28:46.978
and make them smile.

00:28:46.978 --> 00:28:48.770
And people write like
the meanest things

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.340
or just the weirdest things.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.630
One of my early--

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.880
my first video that went
viral, I got the comment,

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.560
"you're amazing at that piano.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.840
Too bad you look like
such a douche bag."

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:01.717 --> 00:29:03.800
And I'm like, all right,
well that's what this is.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.170
All right, so you
have to get used

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.789
to being roasted or whatever.

00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:09.830
ANNA SANTOS: Right and,
like you say in the book,

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.320
once you have haters,
your followers just bond

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.577
together that much more.

00:29:13.577 --> 00:29:14.660
SCOTT BRADLEE: Absolutely.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.264
It kind of strengthens
the overall community

00:29:17.264 --> 00:29:18.680
of the people that
do support you.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.770
Because then they see
almost like-- it's

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.070
like they perceive a threat.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.990
And then they band together.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.490
They just kind of
circle the wagons.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.156
I think that's how
you use that analogy.

00:29:27.156 --> 00:29:28.254
I'm not sure.

00:29:28.254 --> 00:29:30.170
I believe what they do
is circling the wagons.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.480
I believe that's
what it's called.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.090
But at the same time,
you know, if you're

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:39.770
somebody that maybe doesn't
want to read negative things,

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.900
just don't read the comments.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.570
I mean, there are so many people
which I-- my advice for them,

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.136
I think--

00:29:45.136 --> 00:29:46.760
the default advice
should just be, just

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.020
don't read the comments.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:48.980
Give out the stuff.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.300
Don't feed into that.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.100
Don't worry about it.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.420
Because criticism
is mostly invalid,

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.434
like 9 out of 10 times,
on the internet anyway.

00:30:00.434 --> 00:30:01.850
It says more about
the people that

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.150
are writing the comment,
usually, than the people that

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.170
made the video.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:11.390
And it's important to have
a thick skin and develop it,

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.020
certainly.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.390
But if you're
somebody that maybe

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:15.890
has trouble with
that kind of thing,

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.670
then it's better to just
ignore it completely and just

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:20.870
focus on yourself.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.880
Focus on the art that
you want to create.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.540
And I know, for me, I was
very much a perfectionist

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.000
before I put that video out.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.340
Before I did that
ragtime '80s video,

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.620
I didn't have anything
of mine on the internet,

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.564
because I felt like
it wasn't good enough.

00:30:35.564 --> 00:30:37.730
I felt like people were
just going to judge me based

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.662
on my mistakes or shortcomings.

00:30:39.662 --> 00:30:41.870
And in that first video, I
mean, a lot of people did.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.630
A lot of people wrote things
about my piano technique,

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.430
or you made mistakes here.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.400
Blah, blah, blah-- this wasn't
that great, or whatever.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.575
And then I realized,
after I did that,

00:30:52.575 --> 00:30:54.770
that I had just
wasted a bunch of time

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.030
by not putting anything out.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.210
I mean, it didn't
hurt that much.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.335
It didn't sting me that
much to get some criticism.

00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:00.690
I didn't really care that much.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:03.980
And I realized that I was afraid
of just the idea of something

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.072
rather than what the actual--

00:31:08.072 --> 00:31:09.530
I don't know how
to end that sense.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:12.665
But don't be afraid anymore.

00:31:12.665 --> 00:31:14.420
ANNA SANTOS: You spend
quite a bit of time

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.310
in the book going
into that, which

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.250
I found to be really
insightful and I

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.850
think would be really
helpful and reassuring

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.130
to anybody who's kind of setting
out on a creative endeavor.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:32.570
I really liked how you battled
with those perfectionistic

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.940
tendencies but then
found a way to just let

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.270
that go and brought
experimentation

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.180
into your repertoire.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.710
SCOTT BRADLEE: Right,
well there was a couple

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:44.840
of things kind of at play.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.320
For one thing, all of a
sudden I had some subscribers.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.700
From that first video, I got a
few hundred subscribers, maybe

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.420
500 subscribers.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.270
And that was a lot
for me at the time.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.150
I never had people
that subscribed

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.120
or followed what I was doing.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.950
So at that point it
felt worse somehow

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.040
to know that I was letting the
subscribers down by not giving

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.570
them anything than it did to
get criticized for the things

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.270
that I did put out
by a few people.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.970
And it was about creating that--
that created a motivation.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.220
That created an urgency
to put things out.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.846
And I do that to this day.

00:32:20.846 --> 00:32:22.970
I'll announce something
that maybe isn't even done.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.553
I'll be like, we're going to put
out our next album four weeks

00:32:25.553 --> 00:32:26.360
from now.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.530
And then I've announced it.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.432
So I would feel bad
letting people down.

00:32:29.432 --> 00:32:30.890
So I got to follow
through with it.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.100
I've got to make it happen.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.890
I got to not get
bogged down by trying

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.960
to make anything perfect.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.900
And then the other thing at
play is that what I learned

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.940
is that people want
to see the journey.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.290
You know, people don't
care about the failures

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.090
as much as they care
about the successes.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.430
And there's a lot of artists
that were big artists.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.530
And not every song that
they wrote is great.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.290
Not every recording or live
show they did was great.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:58.790
But people still tend to
prioritize the successes,

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.040
because life is just
much better that way.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.460
Why would you focus on
the failures of somebody

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.920
when you can celebrate
kind of what they've done?

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.000
And so I've kept
everything up there

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.120
from the early days, some
early experimentations.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.550
There was a video we did with--

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.630
shout out to Rook out there,
who has been helping out.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.547
Rook's in the book.

00:33:19.547 --> 00:33:20.630
He's a bit of a character.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.564
Talk to him after
the show, if you can.

00:33:23.564 --> 00:33:25.730
Actually, his first show
with us, he sold his pants.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.350
He sold merch for us.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.580
And he's just kind of a--

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.217
you know, quite a character.

00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:32.550
ANNA SANTOS: A guy who comes
through for you every time.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.587
SCOTT BRADLEE: Absolutely.

00:33:35.587 --> 00:33:37.670
One of our early videos,
we used to just goof off.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.770
And we did a video where
he was rapping Einstein.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.380
And we did a Kesha cover,
but we changed all the lyrics

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.257
to be about the special
theory of relativity.

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:48.590
So just like weird things
like that-- and we kept it on.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.300
It's not on brand,
but who cares?

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.460
That's part of the journey.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:57.920
And those kind of
projects like that

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.735
are essential for
people to see, I think.

00:33:59.735 --> 00:34:01.360
I think you shouldn't
be ashamed of any

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.210
of that early experiments.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.460
And you should celebrate them.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.034
Because we learned
from all that stuff.

00:34:08.034 --> 00:34:10.159
And you know, I don't want
to downplay Rook's role.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.739
Because he's also gone on to
engineer some of our biggest

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:15.380
hits, like "Creep," and
"All About That Bass,"

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.440
and "Heroes," which played
during the World Series.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.434
So this is all part
of the journey.

00:34:20.434 --> 00:34:22.850
ANNA SANTOS: Right, and I think
one of the things you also

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:26.030
mention in the book is how
it helps to not take yourself

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.889
too seriously all the time.

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:30.950
So bringing that
levity into the mix,

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:34.460
and doing things that are also
fun and entertaining, and just

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.820
a release, is a way to
mitigate that creative anxiety

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.627
and pressure.

00:34:38.627 --> 00:34:39.710
SCOTT BRADLEE: Absolutely.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:45.020
I think it's really
important to not worry so

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.880
much about upholding an image.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.865
And I think that it's
a dangerous thing

00:34:48.865 --> 00:34:50.239
with social media,
as we all want

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:53.780
to present the most curated,
best version of ourselves.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.940
And a lot of times that kind
of strips us of our humanity

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.712
and, you know--

00:34:58.712 --> 00:35:00.170
ANNA SANTOS: And
your authenticity?

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.140
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.223
And I think it's much more
interesting for people,

00:35:03.223 --> 00:35:06.710
especially nowadays, to see
internet personalities--

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.320
or whoever, vloggers,
celebrities, or whatever--

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.710
be authentic, and just
be themselves, and not

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:17.060
try to be perfect, but
allow them to have some fun,

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.909
to make some mistakes, to do
some stupid things sometimes.

00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:20.450
I don't know.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.410
That's what we're-- you
know, we're all human.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.890
ANNA SANTOS: So going back
to your YouTube engagement

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.500
and that topic, tell
us about the moment

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.260
that you went-- well, first
off, when you started out,

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.444
you had one follower,
one subscriber.

00:35:34.444 --> 00:35:35.610
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, my mom.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.230
ANNA SANTOS: I think you
can all guess who that was.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.860
Tell us about--

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.420
SCOTT BRADLEE: She's a big fan.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.980
ANNA SANTOS: I
mean, she has to be.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.680
Tell us about the moment
that you hit one million.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.666
What did that feel like?

00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:49.040
SCOTT BRADLEE: Well that was
definitely a huge milestone.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.080
I mean, getting back to how
certain things don't feel real,

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.571
that was probably one of those
moments where I saw the number.

00:35:57.571 --> 00:36:00.070
I think I was just refreshing
the page, because we were at--

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.281
it was like three to go,
or two subscribers to go.

00:36:02.281 --> 00:36:04.030
I'm like, well, I want
to see this moment.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.680
And then I saw it
just so I could

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.062
get the screen shot of it.

00:36:07.062 --> 00:36:08.520
But it's not like
a life changing--

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.330
there wasn't confetti cannons.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.160
There wasn't all these
things like that.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.700
You know, it was--

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.500
ANNA SANTOS: Virtual ones--

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.333
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah.

00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:14.890
Yeah, right?

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.120
You know, I was just kind of
probably just hanging out.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.030
I don't think I was
doing anything exciting

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.550
when we hit a million.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.470
ANNA SANTOS:
Oatmeal and boxers--

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.261
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
it was probably more--

00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:27.280
yeah, you're right, actually.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.860
It was the oatmeal in my boxers.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.130
It happens.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.630
But--

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.280
ANNA SANTOS: Authenticity,
authenticity--

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.113
SCOTT BRADLEE: But upon
reflection about it,

00:36:35.113 --> 00:36:37.770
I mean, it's symbolic in
that it was a journey,

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.060
and that there was
a lot of pitfalls

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.080
that came along the way.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.170
Not everything is one
of these, you know--

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:47.260
what do they-- hockey stick
kind of things, you know?

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.870
Sometimes you have
little dips, or you

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.640
have things where you're
faced with challenges.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.220
And I mean, in the book, I
go into all the challenges we

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.160
faced, including one where
it was almost like everybody

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.220
that was in the band--

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.300
it was almost essentially
like the band broke up,

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.910
and I had to rebuild it
from scratch for a second.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.040
ANNA SANTOS: And
how did you do that?

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.970
SCOTT BRADLEE: Well it was--

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.610
first by taking stock of,
what is Postmodern Jukebox?

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.070
I had to answer that question.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.250
Because for a while
I didn't really know.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.110
When I was starting
this out, I didn't even

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.850
know what postmodern meant.

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:19.986
I don't know.

00:37:19.986 --> 00:37:20.860
I never looked it up.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.730
I just thought it sounded cool.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.495
So I had to kind of take stock
of whether this was a band

00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:28.870
or whether it was
something else.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:30.310
And I realized that
it doesn't really

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.480
do it justice to be a band.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.580
Because we had-- you know, how
do we explain certain things?

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.810
We had all these
different singers that

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:35.940
would come do a video with us.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.700
Were they guests?

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.070
Were they regular members?

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:43.110
What was the cut off there?

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.740
We had a bunch of
different drummers.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.960
Do I have to bring them all on
tour for that to be the band?

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.204
ANNA SANTOS: You even had
a subway band at one point

00:37:50.204 --> 00:37:52.370
join you, right, that you
discovered in the New York

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.940
subway?

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.398
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, some do-op
singers came and joined us.

00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:57.540
So another band
joined us on a video.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.560
A giant seven foot clown
named Puddles joined us

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.000
on some videos.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.770
You know, we had
a lot of things,

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.522
when we were defining
the live show

00:38:04.522 --> 00:38:05.980
and what it was--
when I was trying

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.090
to figure all that
stuff out, I had

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.548
to answer a lot of
those questions.

00:38:08.548 --> 00:38:11.620
And eventually I
found that the best

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.560
way to kind of present
the idea of Postmodern

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.591
Jukebox or a Postmodern
Jukebox universe

00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:19.090
was by putting together these
variety shows that were always

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.680
changing, with different
members all the time,

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.499
so that it was more like
you're stepping into a world.

00:38:24.499 --> 00:38:25.540
You're not seeing a band.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.370
You're seeing an experience.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:29.350
And by doing that, that
give me the freedom

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:32.800
to take talented people
from everywhere, everywhere

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.584
I found-- you
know, where I would

00:38:34.584 --> 00:38:36.250
work with somebody
from "American Idol,"

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.905
and then discover
somebody that's

00:38:37.905 --> 00:38:40.030
singing in a coffee shop
that has an amazing voice,

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:43.990
and start working with them,
and put them on a tour.

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:47.170
And by having that kind of
freedom and flexibility,

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:51.250
I was able to take Postmodern
Jukebox much further than it

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.800
would have ever gone if it was
just a simple, quote unquote,

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.580
"band."

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.500
And that's how we
eventually wound up

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.700
being able to send
out multiple groups.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.340
Actually, right now we have
a group on tour over in--

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.270
I forget.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.527
I should know these things.

00:39:05.527 --> 00:39:07.360
But I think it's like
Portland or somewhere.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.591
Sara, you don't know, do you?

00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:09.340
Rook, do you know?

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.450
ROOK: Santa Rosa--

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.590
SCOTT BRADLEE: Santa
Rosa-- thank you, Rook.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.214
ANNA SANTOS: Northern
California, yeah.

00:39:13.214 --> 00:39:15.340
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Yeah, and it's been

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.070
very common that we would
have a group on tour in Europe

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.160
at the same time that we have a
group on tour in North America,

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.900
or South America, or wherever.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.820
ANNA SANTOS: So you
really went from being

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:31.300
a musician, to a performer,
to a music director,

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.210
really, of this giant
global collective.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.830
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
a lot of things.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:41.200
It's definitely a very
unique type of collective,

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.910
I guess you could say, to
work with and to head up.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.750
And because there
was no rulebook,

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.120
and there was no guide
of how to do this,

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.870
and nobody else was really
doing this exact kind of thing,

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.700
we had to kind of
make up all the rules

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.730
as we went along, and figure
out what works, and test out

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:58.430
a lot of things.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.340
And it's just a
lot of AB testing.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.410
Try things so many
different ways,

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.152
and see what gets
the best results.

00:40:04.152 --> 00:40:06.610
ANNA SANTOS: And I think one
of the secrets to your success

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:11.920
has been this openness to
embracing collaboration,

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.840
which you talk about
a lot in the book,

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.290
going from the
sort of lone wolf,

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.390
isolated artist
who is very guarded

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.390
with his creative
output to deciding,

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.710
no, I'm not going to
be kind of that loner.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.690
And I'm going to
actually open myself up

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.545
to the collaborative
efforts of others.

00:40:30.545 --> 00:40:31.920
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Yeah, well I think

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.250
that there's a tendency, when
something becomes successful,

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.710
that the person that is
responsible for the success--

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.570
or maybe not
responsible-- you know,

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:44.340
the person that
represents that success

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.399
can easily become arrogant
or believe that, well, I

00:40:48.399 --> 00:40:49.440
did all this stuff right.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.290
I'm the only one
that can do this.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.240
I need to be doing
all this stuff.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.530
But that's a trap.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.270
That's something
that doesn't work.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.020
And it winds up hurting a
lot of very successful people

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.630
if they believe their
own hype, so to speak.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.730
So for me, when I went through
that experience of rebuilding

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:13.680
Postmodern Jukebox, I decided
to really welcome collaboration

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.080
in all things and
start operating

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.710
in more of a best idea wins
kind of mindset, where I'm just

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.960
trying to identify what
the best idea is. d it

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.940
And doesn't matter
who came up with it.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.669
And that kind of
mentality has really

00:41:26.669 --> 00:41:27.960
helped us get our best to work.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:33.330
And, as a result, our touring
show improved exponentially.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.142
Because I wasn't a director.

00:41:36.142 --> 00:41:38.100
I didn't even know what
blocking meant, when

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.280
people say like "blocking."

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.780
Or people would ask
me about choreo.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.340
I'm like, I don't know.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.174
Make something up.

00:41:42.174 --> 00:41:44.590
There were certain things that
were out of my wheel house.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.490
And I had to accept that they
were out of my wheel house,

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.280
and that somebody else can
do a far better job than I.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.740
And that really led to
a lot of breakthroughs.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.339
To be a leader of
something, you have

00:41:57.339 --> 00:41:59.130
to be able to recognize
the things that you

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.290
can do well and recognize the
things that other people can

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.260
do better than you--

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:02.890
ANNA SANTOS: Yep, absolutely.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.598
SCOTT BRADLEE: --and
accept that, and not

00:42:04.598 --> 00:42:06.480
let that kind of hurt
your ego or anything.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.896
ANNA SANTOS: Right,
and not insist

00:42:07.896 --> 00:42:09.271
on wearing all
hats at all times.

00:42:09.271 --> 00:42:10.145
SCOTT BRADLEE: Right.

00:42:10.145 --> 00:42:11.711
ANNA SANTOS: Yeah,
bring in a team.

00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:12.210
Great.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.565
SCOTT BRADLEE: Just
a few hats, you know?

00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:17.450
A fun hat, like a cowboy
hat or something--

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.056
ANNA SANTOS: Great,
so Scott, let's

00:42:19.056 --> 00:42:20.430
open it up to
audience questions.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:21.430
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, OK.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:22.500
Let's do it.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.917
ANNA SANTOS: Susanna has the
box-- or Jeremy has the mike.

00:42:24.917 --> 00:42:26.916
SCOTT BRADLEE: What is
that magical contraption?

00:42:26.916 --> 00:42:28.900
ANNA SANTOS: It's a
microphone in a box.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.807
It's Google, man.

00:42:30.807 --> 00:42:32.640
SCOTT BRADLEE: You guys
are changing the way

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.357
we use microphones-- crazy.

00:42:34.357 --> 00:42:35.190
AUDIENCE: What's up?

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.842
I've been following you
guys for a year or two.

00:42:37.842 --> 00:42:40.050
Like, I only found out about
you relatively recently.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.720
But there's somebody who
I've known about for a period

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.205
of time since like high school.

00:42:44.205 --> 00:42:45.497
Do you know Richard Cheese?

00:42:45.497 --> 00:42:47.080
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
yeah, definitely.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.140
AUDIENCE: So when I
found out about you guys,

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.670
I was like, holy
cow, this is amazing.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.190
Because it's similar,
but it's different.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.690
It's unique.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:55.290
It's fresh.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.081
It's its own thing.

00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:59.490
So I guess my question is, if
you knew about Richard Cheese,

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:04.530
did that kind of amalgamation
or hybrid chimera-type

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.590
sound that you knew existed
influence you to try

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.610
and experiment and do it
your own, creative way?

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.040
Was any of that in the
back of your mind as

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.520
these things formed
into Postmodern Jukebox?

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.810
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah.

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:20.465
I definitely knew
of his stuff and--

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:21.673
AUDIENCE: And for reference--

00:43:21.673 --> 00:43:25.410
Richard Cheese, everybody, is
a guy who does lounge singing.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.490
But he does
contemporary '90s songs.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.462
So he did like Limp
Bizkit, and Nirvana, and--

00:43:29.462 --> 00:43:31.420
SCOTT BRADLEE: He's done
like System of a Down.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.880
AUDIENCE: System of a Down--

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.590
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, definitely.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.500
It was such a cool idea, too--

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.930
his own interpretation
of that idea

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.610
of taking songs and
making them retro covers

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.780
is completely his
own and very fresh.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.010
And he's got this whole stage
personality and everything.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:51.090
For me, I think I came at
it in a different way that--

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:55.061
you know, when I was doing
these early genre experiments,

00:43:55.061 --> 00:43:56.310
they were more in the ragtime.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.810
It was more of ragtime piano.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:59.820
It wasn't really
utilizing vocals

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:05.160
at all when I was in high
school and times like that.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.470
So it actually kind
of developed along

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.240
a similar line, which
I'm sure he probably

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.323
developed in the same way.

00:44:10.323 --> 00:44:12.510
He probably started
out by singing these--

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:16.680
or even like, if you remember
that Robert Goulet skit

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.470
that they did on SNL with
Will Ferrell and everything,

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:23.190
it was probably something
similar like that.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.650
I think the difference with
Postmodern Jukebox was,

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:28.410
obviously, a lot of people
had done transformations

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:29.490
before I had.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:33.030
And the difference with
us was more of just

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.550
that we kind of crafted a
whole universe around it.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.530
We took this concept,
and we found a way

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:40.761
to kind of build a
whole world of it

00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:42.510
so that we could utilize
different talent,

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.640
and bring them into
our world, and make

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.930
like an ever-changing platform.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.840
And so I guess that's
where we kind of differ,

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.970
but very talented artist.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:51.990
Yeah, he's great.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.823
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:55.249 --> 00:44:56.540
AUDIENCE: You want to go ahead?

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:02.770
So this wouldn't work unless
the songs were also great music

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.510
and well performed
that you're doing.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.659
But one thing that
I find a lot when

00:45:06.659 --> 00:45:08.200
I'm listening to
your songs is you'll

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.950
get 30 seconds into
the song or something,

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.800
and then realize what
it is, and laugh.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.740
It's a delight, just as we
all did with the Pokemon song

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.310
just now.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:16.810
Do you think of
your songs as having

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:20.409
this kind of like comedic aspect
as well as being this kind

00:45:20.409 --> 00:45:21.700
of like serious, awesome music?

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.907
Or is that just me?

00:45:22.907 --> 00:45:24.490
SCOTT BRADLEE: That's
a good question.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:31.330
So I guess I'm definitely
obviously aware that there

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:33.610
is something funny about
taking an Iggy Azalea song

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.680
and imagining how
"Fancy" would sound

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.931
as a flapper anthem in
the 1920s, or taking--

00:45:38.931 --> 00:45:40.680
ANNA SANTOS: Which is
awesome, by the way.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.530
SCOTT BRADLEE: Oh, thank you.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:41.720
ANNA SANTOS: Yeah.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.761
SCOTT BRADLEE: Thank you.

00:45:42.761 --> 00:45:44.110
Yeah, that was a fun one.

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:49.300
Or having a giant sad clown
sing "Royals" by Lorde--

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.030
but, when I approached
these songs as an arranger,

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:55.210
I never want it to
drift into parody.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:57.160
So I take everything
100% seriously

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.535
when it comes to the
arrangement process.

00:45:59.535 --> 00:46:01.660
So even when we did a Motown
tribute to Nickelback,

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.493
it was really important
to me to not just do

00:46:03.493 --> 00:46:06.940
like a funny wink and a nod
kind of spoof on Nickelback.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.780
Because I felt that
that was too easy.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.030
And it wasn't as interesting as
raising some actual questions

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.110
in people's mind.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.200
People would watch
our video and then

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.970
actually pose the
question-- wait,

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.100
I liked this version of
this Nickelback song.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.490
Does this mean that
I like Nickelback?

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:27.490
Or does this mean that I wish
Nickelback was a Motown band?

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.100
Or does it mean that
their song is so good

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.150
that it can work as Motown and
Nickelback at the same time?

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.900
So there was a lot of
these kind of like--

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.720
[MIMICS EXPLOSION]---- kind of
brain explosion moments when

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.580
people would hear those.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.430
And that's because we didn't
want to lead the witness, so

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.930
to speak.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:47.260
We didn't want to
do it as a joke.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.300
We didn't want to
parody anything.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.184
We wanted to just do
these experiments.

00:46:51.184 --> 00:46:52.600
This is what this
song would sound

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.346
like if it was recorded
back then, you know?

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:57.220
ANNA SANTOS: But I mean,
that brain explosion

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:01.030
moment, I think, is the desire
of every creative person,

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.985
right?

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.860
To create that experience
for somebody else--

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.270
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Well yeah, you want

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.230
to challenge your audience.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:07.600
And you want to get people to
think differently about things.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.845
ANNA SANTOS: Defy expectations--

00:47:08.845 --> 00:47:10.570
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, and I
think that any kind of original

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:11.250
work--

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:12.708
and even though
we're doing covers,

00:47:12.708 --> 00:47:14.550
we're approaching
it as original work,

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:16.870
in that it gets the same
sensation, that you're

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.160
seeing something new.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.400
And it's changing the way that
you think about something.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.400
ANNA SANTOS: Absolutely.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.984
Any other questions
from the audience?

00:47:24.984 --> 00:47:26.150
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.780
I want to pass it
down to you after.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.970
Quick question--
so I've heard a lot

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:32.910
about people seeing
your live performances

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.480
or your band in whatever
incarnation it is

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.730
at that moment performing live.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:42.300
But you started out as
a completely online,

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:47.100
kind of separate from
the real world, band.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:53.040
Do you find that performing live
is more satisfying in any way?

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.510
Or is it more stressful?

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.480
Or do you just take
away different things

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.355
from the two different kinds of
ways of expressing your music?

00:48:00.355 --> 00:48:02.230
SCOTT BRADLEE: Well
actually, for most of us,

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.350
it was actually kind
of the opposite.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:05.850
With the exception
of Robin, she was

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.683
the only one that hadn't
come from the world

00:48:07.683 --> 00:48:08.480
of live performing.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.430
And for the rest of us,
we had for many years

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.390
been live performers.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.090
And most of the musicians that
I worked with, and singers--

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.280
and we had done everything
from bar mitzvah

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.830
gigs, to weddings, to
bar gigs at 2:00 AM,

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.050
and all these kind of things.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.740
So in a lot of
ways, that gave us

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:30.360
an advantage when
we went to perform

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.640
as an internet sensation
going to the stage.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.010
Because we had already had
a ton of stage experience.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.020
And for us, the stage
just felt way better

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.340
and felt way more natural.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.839
There's something that's weird
about performing to a camera.

00:48:40.839 --> 00:48:43.340
And kind of the
stylistic reasons

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.840
that I do the videos in the way
that they are-- usually it's

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.085
like a static camera,
and it's very intimate.

00:48:48.085 --> 00:48:50.460
It feels like you're just
sitting on a couch in my living

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.070
room-- is because I want
to create a very casual

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.620
environment for the performers,
where they can feel like

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.880
they're playing just--

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.040
you know, they're
just jamming together.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:58.570
ANNA SANTOS: A small club?

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:00.153
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
jamming together,

00:49:00.153 --> 00:49:02.670
and they're getting the
energy from each other,

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:05.200
since we don't have an
audience to give us energy.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.720
But when you're
in a live setting,

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.930
it's more about taking
energy from the audience.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:14.170
And that's the big difference
between the two genres,

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:15.180
so to speak.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.880
ANNA SANTOS: But the
success of your videos,

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.640
considering that they're done in
this really kind of bare bones

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.930
environment without fancy
effects and gimmicks,

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:25.800
is amazing.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.242
I mean, it's a testament to
your strengths as musicians.

00:49:28.242 --> 00:49:29.700
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Yeah, well we wanted

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.160
to put the focus on the
musicians and the music itself.

00:49:34.757 --> 00:49:37.340
There's a lot of people that are
doing super fancy videos that

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:38.830
look awesome and amazing.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.440
So we took kind of the
counter-intuitive route.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.880
And that was just do the very
simple, camera on a tripod,

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.524
what you see is what you get.

00:49:47.524 --> 00:49:48.940
You know, everything
is done live.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:49.780
We don't do overdubs.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.113
Sometimes there's even mistakes.

00:49:51.113 --> 00:49:52.910
Like, I remember talking
about in the book,

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.035
there was air conditioner
noise in our first album,

00:49:55.035 --> 00:49:57.940
like a ton of air
conditioner noise.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.650
And then, when I
put out the album,

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:01.870
Billboard contacted
me, because it charted.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:05.160
And they asked me, OK, well
who did your album cover?

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.100
Who took the photo?

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.750
Because we're going
to run the photo.

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.767
So I just wrote back,
"photo by self-timer."

00:50:10.767 --> 00:50:12.100
And they're like, "what is that?

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:12.970
Is that a company?

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:16.900
And I'm like, no, it was
the self-time on my camera.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.550
And we just set it on a tripod.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.383
ANNA SANTOS: And the
air conditioner gave it

00:50:20.383 --> 00:50:21.550
a nice 1920s crackly effect.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:22.758
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, kind of.

00:50:22.758 --> 00:50:25.123
Yeah, you know, you can spin
all that stuff, you know?

00:50:25.123 --> 00:50:26.130
ANNA SANTOS: Totally.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:27.730
I think we have
another question.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:28.355
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:28.355 --> 00:50:30.376
Oh, this is cool.

00:50:30.376 --> 00:50:31.750
So the songs that
you guys cover,

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.350
like a "Royals," versus like
a "Creep," or an "All About

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.100
That Bass"-- they're
all really different.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.910
And I was wondering if there's--

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:40.780
are there like songs
that lend themselves

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.132
to being transformed into
this like ragtime sound?

00:50:43.132 --> 00:50:45.090
Or like what do you look
for musically in songs

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:47.110
when you're deciding
what to cover?

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.840
SCOTT BRADLEE: Well I look for
contrast, first and foremost.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:54.610
And a lot of times that's taking
all the expectation of what

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:57.130
people have when they
listen to a song.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.380
It's taking that, and kind
of flipping it on its head,

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.940
and putting it into a
different historical context,

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.070
but having it
somehow still work.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:06.220
So I look a lot at
the lyrics actually

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.280
and the overall
structure of the song.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.360
An example would be
"Sweet Child of Mine."

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.940
When you pick apart all--
you take away Axel Rose.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.420
You take away Guns and Roses,
take away all the guitars.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.070
It's just a folk song, really.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:19.690
Like it's written as verse.

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:20.880
Then there's a refrain.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.580
Then there's another
verse and refrain.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.550
So it's a very old style song.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:26.890
And even the lyrics of it,
"oh, sweet child of mine"--

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:29.830
you can imagine it being
done as an old blues song.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:32.089
So when we did it, we
got that same singer

00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:33.880
that I've worked with
before, Miche Braden,

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.230
from "BioShock Infinite."

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:37.750
And she recorded a
Bessie Smith style vocal.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:41.720
And when you listen to it, it
changes the context of the song

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.220
completely.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.196
But it still works.

00:51:43.196 --> 00:51:44.320
It's just a different song.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.600
Now it sounds like maybe
it's like a mother singing

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.567
to her child in
1920s New Orleans.

00:51:50.567 --> 00:51:51.775
ANNA SANTOS: Yeah, beautiful.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:52.900
SCOTT BRADLEE: So that's when
we're able to kind of-- when

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.650
we're on the money--

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.800
and it's not possible
to do it every song.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.960
And we don't always nail
it every single time.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:04.630
But when we do, that's
usually the result. Actually,

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:05.460
I'd like to try it.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.500
Can I try this little box--

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.100
can we trade?

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.920
All right, you sir.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.460
AUDIENCE: OK, I apologize
if this was already asked.

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.540
I had to step out at
the start of Q and A.

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.000
But you seem to be like
one of the dream successes

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.650
for YouTube.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:28.630
Were there any unnecessary
hurdles or barriers

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:32.130
that it seemed YouTube put
in place towards that success

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:36.305
that maybe my
disallow other people.

00:52:36.305 --> 00:52:37.680
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Well, actually I'm

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.320
trying to think of
where to hold this.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.280
Be careful what you
wish for, right?

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.460
No, you guys can hear
my like this, right?

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.510
OK, all right.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.990
ANNA SANTOS: Welcome to Google.

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.430
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.930
Well, I think not just
YouTube, but pretty

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:53.940
much every social media
platform-- you know,

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.110
they're dynamic platforms.

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:55.740
They change.

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.030
And the algorithms change.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:00.600
And there's a whole
copyright issue that

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.980
changes with all of them, too.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.110
For a while, YouTube
was kind of the Wild

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:05.801
West in terms of publishing.

00:53:05.801 --> 00:53:07.300
Everybody was doing
covers, but they

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.580
were like technically illegal.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.460
Because that's a
whole other thing.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.180
And then Facebook, of course--

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.460
they didn't have content ID.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.342
So there were
publishing companies

00:53:16.342 --> 00:53:18.300
that were just issuing
take-downs of everything

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.508
every time you put something.

00:53:19.508 --> 00:53:22.950
So you kind of had to adapt to
all these changing conditions.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.200
And a lot of the--

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.670
in the music
industry especially,

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:32.120
the technology has accelerated
at leaps and bounds,

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.570
while the legal side
of it has not at all.

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:36.304
And that's--

00:53:36.304 --> 00:53:37.970
ANNA SANTOS: Like in
many sectors, yeah.

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:39.303
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:53:39.303 --> 00:53:43.220
And even the idea of doing
arrangements as an arranger,

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.930
I can't copyright
my arrangements.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:47.120
So there'll be a
reality TV show that

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.030
will take an arrangement of
mine and do it note for note.

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:52.760
And there's no recourse other
than going online, and being

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.890
like, hey, WTF, you know?

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:59.120
So there's a lot of
issues in that we're just

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.450
navigating in a space that
isn't really well-defined yet

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:05.940
in terms of legal aspects.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.540
And then, of course, I
mean, like anything else,

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.580
all these platforms
are going to change.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:15.530
You know, I'm sure that, in
five years or 10 years, Google,

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:17.270
and Facebook, and
Instagram-- they're

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:19.770
all going to be very
different than they are now.

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:24.530
So you really have to be willing
to kind of ride that wave

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:26.121
and just stay on the board.

00:54:26.121 --> 00:54:28.370
I'm trying to use an analogy,
because I saw surfboards

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.870
outside.

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:31.510
So I figure that's a way to
reach the young kids at Google

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.164
or something.

00:54:33.164 --> 00:54:34.580
I'm going to go
switch mikes back.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:35.486
Yeah, thanks Rook.

00:54:35.486 --> 00:54:36.360
You want to try this?

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:36.902
Try this out.

00:54:36.902 --> 00:54:38.234
AUDIENCE: I've used them before.

00:54:38.234 --> 00:54:39.212
You can throw them.

00:54:39.212 --> 00:54:39.920
It's pretty cool.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.086
SCOTT BRADLEE: What, really?

00:54:41.086 --> 00:54:42.415
Throw it to the next person.

00:54:42.415 --> 00:54:43.664
AUDIENCE: Oh, watch your head.

00:54:43.664 --> 00:54:45.650
SCOTT BRADLEE: Hey, that
was almost a lawsuit.

00:54:48.034 --> 00:54:49.700
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming, by the way.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.500
SCOTT BRADLEE: Absolutely.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.710
AUDIENCE: I'm a big fan
of a lot of the songs.

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.190
And so I imagine,
similar to some

00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.690
of the stuff you
were talking about,

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:03.795
some versions actually work a
lot better than other versions.

00:55:03.795 --> 00:55:08.120
And so do you have
some lessons you've

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:13.160
learned along the way about
which versions that you've done

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.234
seem more successful?

00:55:16.234 --> 00:55:18.650
SCOTT BRADLEE: Well I guess
that's a-- that can be tricky,

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:20.858
because you're dealing with
a lot of factors in terms

00:55:20.858 --> 00:55:23.660
of how you define successful.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.840
Some people would define
successful as having

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.760
the most views, for instance.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.780
But we know that--

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.814
I mean, yeah, we know
that that's not the case.

00:55:31.814 --> 00:55:33.230
Because there are
some things that

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:36.110
have a lot of views that you
wouldn't really call successful

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:38.660
or whatever.

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:43.834
So I guess the bigger
question would be,

00:55:43.834 --> 00:55:45.250
when I'm approaching
arrangements,

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:49.350
or when I'm approaching
making content or videos,

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:54.770
is there something that I can
do to have it land more the way

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:56.990
that I intended it to land?

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:58.880
And yeah, I think that
there is in that I

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.521
think that I've found
that you need to always

00:56:01.521 --> 00:56:03.020
be kind of changing
your environment

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.780
or changing the frame
around something very often.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:08.690
And we always try to
kind of experiment

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:10.340
with the type of
videos that we do.

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.960
We don't just
stick to one genre.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.280
We do lots of different genres.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.890
I think the one we put out last
week, or this current video,

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:17.180
is a '70s fuck thing.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.040
We don't do a whole
lot of '70s funk.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.990
But it was really
fun to arrange--

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.920
I love that style.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.990
So it was fun to
arrange in that style.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:27.654
And we also cover
things that maybe people

00:56:27.654 --> 00:56:28.820
wouldn't expect us to cover.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.040
We covered Baby Metal one week.

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.890
And there's only a
few people probably

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:38.190
in this room that are as big
of Baby Metal fans as I am.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:40.670
But if you guys don't
know, it's a J-Pop group.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:45.780
And it's these three girls
that combine J-Pop with metal.

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.659
And it's amazing.

00:56:46.659 --> 00:56:47.700
You've got to look it up.

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.910
Their big hit is
"Give Me Chocolate."

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:51.730
And I'm not making this up.

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:52.770
It's crazy.

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:55.620
And then, when you watch Baby
Metal, then go watch Lady Baby,

00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:02.720
which is two J-Pop singers and
then an Australian wrestler

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.740
that--

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.240
yeah, it's crazy.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.925
ANNA SANTOS: You have
an encyclopedic mind.

00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:10.260
It's staggering how
much is in there.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.260
SCOTT BRADLEE: I spend
too much time on YouTube.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.400
I don't even remember
what the question was.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.000
I just kind of went out on
a rant about Baby Metal.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.962
But no, yeah, I've definitely
learned a lot about that.

00:57:18.962 --> 00:57:20.420
And the other big
thing is learning

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.800
about the editing process.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.150
Sometimes we'll start something.

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.280
And then I'll realize,
even when we're recording,

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.271
that it's not working.

00:57:26.271 --> 00:57:27.770
It just isn't landing
the way that I

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.000
thought it would in my head.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.916
And you have to be willing
to scrap everything

00:57:30.916 --> 00:57:32.870
at any point in the process.

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.000
And that's the way to kind
of get your best work.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.060
If you hold on to something that
isn't working just because you

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:43.702
felt like you put some time
into it, that's a bad move.

00:57:43.702 --> 00:57:45.410
Don't think of it as
cutting your losses.

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:47.510
Just think of it as
editing, like anything else.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:48.897
ANNA SANTOS: Flexibility is key.

00:57:48.897 --> 00:57:50.480
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.480
AUDIENCE: Which pieces
are you most proud of?

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.250
SCOTT BRADLEE: In
terms of arrangements?

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:56.874
Jeez, I'd have to
think about that one.

00:57:56.874 --> 00:57:59.654
That's a tough one.

00:57:59.654 --> 00:58:00.195
I don't know.

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:04.900
You know, I'm grateful
for the successes.

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.870
I'm definitely grateful for the
ones that were the big hits.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.540
But there's definitely a
bunch that were lesser known,

00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:11.950
or maybe didn't
get as many hits,

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:15.340
that I felt like my
work was stronger in it

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.590
as an arranger and everything.

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:16.905
I don't know.

00:58:16.905 --> 00:58:18.113
I'd have to think about that.

00:58:18.113 --> 00:58:20.230
Or I'll just say I love
all my children equally.

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:21.598
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:21.984 --> 00:58:23.650
ANNA SANTOS: Your mom
would be so proud.

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:25.642
SCOTT BRADLEE: I'm
proud of them all.

00:58:25.642 --> 00:58:27.100
AUDIENCE: Speaking
of your mom, you

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.860
mentioned she was your
first subscriber on YouTube.

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.480
I've always wanted
to ask someone

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.462
who kind of hit the top
of their dream industry--

00:58:34.462 --> 00:58:36.670
what are the types of
conversations you had with her,

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:39.340
and-or other members of your
family and friend circle,

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:42.402
as you started hitting
these surreal milestones?

00:58:42.402 --> 00:58:44.610
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, well
I did talk about that a lot

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:45.550
in my book.

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:47.260
And my mom is like
the ultimate mom.

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.849
She's such a mom.

00:58:48.849 --> 00:58:50.890
I don't know how other to
describe it, that she's

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.800
very mom-like in her demeanor.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.400
And she came to my book
release show in DC.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.210
We just did one.

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:00.630
And I brought her on-stage,
because I wanted her--

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:01.110
ANNA SANTOS: That's sweet.

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:02.985
SCOTT BRADLEE: --to talk
a little bit about--

00:59:02.985 --> 00:59:04.240
and she was a little nervous.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.494
And she walked into the piano.

00:59:05.494 --> 00:59:06.910
And then she blamed
it on the fact

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.120
that she drank a little
bit of the punch.

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.750
It was this whole thing.

00:59:13.975 --> 00:59:16.276
From her perspective,
nothing's really changed.

00:59:16.276 --> 00:59:17.650
The whole thing
is kind of weird.

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:19.691
You know, when I first
got a gig at a restaurant,

00:59:19.691 --> 00:59:21.400
like a steady gig
at a restaurant,

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.424
she was just so proud.

00:59:22.424 --> 00:59:23.840
And she was like,
this is perfect.

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.072
This is the gig for you.

00:59:25.072 --> 00:59:26.780
And then, when things
started taking off,

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.090
she's like, ah,
that's a bit much.

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:29.840
You know, like, why
don't you just go back

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.190
to playing in the restaurant?

00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:32.930
She's still pushing me to
go back to grad school.

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:34.840
I'm like, mom, I'm not
going to go to grad school.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.300
She's like, it's going to
look so good on your resume.

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.570
I'm like, what resume?

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:38.780
I don't need to do this.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.946
She's like, if you ever
want to teach at a univers--

00:59:40.946 --> 00:59:42.410
I'm like, mom-- you know?

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:43.240
But she's a mom.

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.250
And I'm very grateful for that.

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.780
Because I think
it's very important,

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.000
when you're experiencing
any success, to have

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.220
people that keep you grounded.

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:56.950
And that's why a big part of
the Postmodern Jukebox family,

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:58.930
essentially, is
made up of friends

00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:02.330
that I've known since I was in
college or even high school.

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:04.880
So I brought them
along for the ride,

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880
and not just along for
the ride, but I have them

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.420
as my trusted gang of people
that can tell me if something's

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.680
good or if it's not.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.600
Because I know that I'll always
get an honest answer from them.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.500
ANNA SANTOS: They'll
be real with you.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.850
SCOTT BRADLEE: Exactly, exactly.

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:18.880
And that's the same thing that
you want from your family.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.730
I'll just say that there
was one funny thing that--

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:23.380
one story about my mom--

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:27.460
she came to one of the shows
that we did in New York City.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:30.230
And afterwards people were
taking pictures with me,

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.756
but they also wanted to
take pictures with my mom.

01:00:32.756 --> 01:00:34.630
Because I had called
her out during the show.

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:37.230
So she was posing for
a lot of pictures.

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:39.010
And she didn't really
know what to do

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.360
when she's posing for pictures.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.080
So somebody got a
picture with her.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.110
And then she started
asking them questions.

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:46.750
And saying like, "oh,
where are you from?"

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.450
And "that's a nice
suit that you have.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:52.300
Are you a scholar of some sort?"

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.592
And the person just was
like, "hey lady, I got to go.

01:00:54.592 --> 01:00:56.800
I'm sorry, I got to get
pictures with the other cast.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.345
I got to get a
picture with Hailey."

01:00:58.345 --> 01:00:59.970
ANNA SANTOS: She
sounds really earnest.

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:01.969
SCOTT BRADLEE: And my mom
just said afterwards--

01:01:01.969 --> 01:01:04.660
she's like, "I felt so used."

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.610
And I'm like, oh, poor mom.

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:07.270
Sorry, mom.

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:08.990
ANNA SANTOS: Mom,
welcome to show-biz.

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:10.897
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah, exactly.

01:01:10.897 --> 01:01:11.980
AUDIENCE: Hi again, Scott.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:12.460
SCOTT BRADLEE: Hi.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.360
AUDIENCE: I just
want to apologize.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.200
SCOTT BRADLEE: Thank
you for making me tea.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.390
That tea was delicious,
the best tea I've ever had.

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.780
AUDIENCE: It was terrible.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:17.890
I tried it afterwards.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:18.910
I was so flustered
the entire time.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.120
SCOTT BRADLEE: No, don't
be down on yourself.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:20.900
It was perfect.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:21.733
It was really great.

01:01:21.733 --> 01:01:23.050
AUDIENCE: OK, good.

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.790
You're such a prolific musician.

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:28.060
And I was wondering, out
of the numerous artists

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.270
in your very diverse
catalog of covers,

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:33.829
has anybody that you really
admire reached out back to you

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:35.620
and said, hey, I really
liked your version.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.578
That meant a lot to me.

01:01:36.578 --> 01:01:41.028
I think covers are beautiful,
because they're kind of--

01:01:41.028 --> 01:01:42.781
it's returning
someone's art to them

01:01:42.781 --> 01:01:44.530
in the same form in
which you received it.

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:47.950
And so I was wondering if
there's anybody that you really

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:51.250
hold dear to your heart who had
any words to give back to you

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.840
that really meant a lot to you.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.810
SCOTT BRADLEE: Well I can
tell you about the first time

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:53.950
it happened.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.540
AUDIENCE: Did
Nickelback say anything?

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.930
SCOTT BRADLEE: I was just about
to say, when we put that out,

01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:01.300
and somebody tweeted the link
to Nickelback, and either

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.835
Nickelback or a representative
on their behalf--

01:02:03.835 --> 01:02:05.710
I'm not sure who runs
their Twitter account--

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:06.900
just wrote back "killer."

01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:10.192
And that was it.

01:02:10.192 --> 01:02:11.650
ANNA SANTOS: That's
all you needed.

01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:13.300
SCOTT BRADLEE: But no, we've
had a lot of great endorsements

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:13.925
by the artists.

01:02:13.925 --> 01:02:15.700
And that's always
been fun to hear,

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.720
to hear somebody that wrote
a song and appreciates

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.640
what you did, and
how you changed it.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.760
And one of our earliest
ones was Beyonce.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.510
She put up a video.

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:27.880
She shared our video
on her Facebook page

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.500
and just wrote "love this."

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.310
And all of a sudden
we had all these--

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:32.600
ANNA SANTOS: That's
pretty phenomenal.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.490
SCOTT BRADLEE: And it
was a great endorsement.

01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:34.330
It was very early.

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:36.020
It was right before
we started touring.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.680
And it was a great endorsement
to have at that time.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.750
So yeah, we hear from
a whole bunch of them.

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:43.330
And that makes it kind of funny.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:45.310
Lorde said that her
favorite cover of "Royals"

01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:47.320
was the version we
did with Puddles.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.565
So that was--

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.815
ANNA SANTOS: If you haven't
seen it yet, check it out.

01:02:50.815 --> 01:02:52.231
SCOTT BRADLEE:
Yeah, so that was--

01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:53.930
ANNA SANTOS: Pretty good.

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:56.360
Well, thank you so much,
everybody, for attending.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.830
And thank you so much to Scott--

01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:58.230
SCOTT BRADLEE: Thank you guys.

01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.460
This is fun.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.820
ANNA SANTOS: --and to
Sara for being here.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.445
SCOTT BRADLEE: Yeah,
thank you to Sara.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.500
ANNA SANTOS: It was a
real treat to have you.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.300
For those of you here in the
audience, Scott is based in LA.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.310
I saw Postmodern
Jukebox last summer

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:14.000
at the Greek Theater in Griffith
Park under a canopy of stars.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.440
And it was an electrifying show.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.310
So if you have the opportunity
to see them live, please go.

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:20.120
Because they're amazing.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:20.700
Thank you.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.240
SCOTT BRADLEE: Thank you, Anna.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:21.590
That was great.

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:22.548
ANNA SANTOS: Thank you.

01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:24.910
[APPLAUSE]
