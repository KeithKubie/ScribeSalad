 (upbeat music)

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.343
- So if you look at Dark
Star it's sort of like

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.478 align:start size:88% position:13%
a comedic student
version of Alien 'cause

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.114 align:start position:0%
 Dan O'Bannon who wrote
 Alien wrote Dark Star and--

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:16.382
 - Oh don't get me
 started on O'Bannon.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:17.383
 - O'Bannon's the best.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.684
You actually have a Dan
O'Bannon-ness about you.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.353
 - Thank you.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:21.354 size:84% position:42%
  - You really sort of look
  very Dan O'Bannon-ish.

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:22.588
(laughs)

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.258
 - Eli, great, I can
 see we're out of time.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.393
Thanks, you, oh my god.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.462
 - It was a great like
 nerding out with you.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.564
 - Oh my god, I could
 do this all day long.

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:33.433 align:start position:0%
- I'm actually cooking
something pretty cool right now.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.403
 It's a new movie where a film
 journalist is taken hostage.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:38.538 align:start size:88% position:13%
 So it's like you're
 literally the

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.139
first person I'm telling it to.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.208 size:88% position:44%
  - That sounds like
  an amazing idea.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.677
- Yeah should be fun,
yeah tell your friends.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.546
 Yeah no, seriously,
 let your friends know.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.648 align:start position:0%
 If you have any friends
 that want to be movie stars.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.283 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh yeah?

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.551
 SO he tells me it's
 about a movie reporter

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.352 size:88% position:44%
 who's taken hostage, right?

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.688
And so he looks at me and he
says hey, tell all your friends

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:58.525
because I'm casting this today.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.361 size:84% position:42%
  - What the fuck
  did you just say?

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.697 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - And that's a big
  deal I take it?

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.599 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, off camera, yeah.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:07.433
- You're so new.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.668
 - It's the real deal.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.369
- Yeah that's what I'm
saying, guys, it's true!

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:12.472 size:84% position:42%
  It's probably going to be
  like a whole franchise.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.241
 - Well of course it
 is, Captain Doughnut.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.376 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Listen, if he thinks
 I'm not getting

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
 points on this
 thing, he is a fool.

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:23.716 size:88% position:44%
  And Britney, you know how
  much I value the back end.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.518
(laughs)

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.619
 - Ha ha gross.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:28.421 size:84% position:42%
  - Don't fucking touch me.

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:30.156 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Can we just be serious
here for a minute?

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.358 align:start position:0%
 All right, if I'm not
 mistaken I'm the only person

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.428 align:start position:0%
 here who's done a two episode
 arc on Franklin and Bash.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:37.530
 You guys remember
 it, I was very good.

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:40.666 size:88% position:44%
 Breckin Meyer, good friend
 of mine said I was sublime.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:43.069 size:84% position:42%
  - Guys, the fact
  of the matter is,

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:46.372 size:88% position:44%
 one of our lives is
 gonna change today.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.576 size:88% position:44%
  Right Christopher?

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.412
- Okay baby let's take a selfie.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:54.714
Oh my god are you okay?

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.582 size:88% position:44%
  - I get it, I have
  like great teeth,

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.384 size:88% position:44%
 I never had braces,
 my skin's perfect,

00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:00.052
 my eyes are beautiful,
 I'm definitely touched

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.154
by the hand of Jesus, but like--

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.421
 - You're so handsome.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:03.489 size:84% position:42%
  - I've really had
  this secret dream

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.024
 of being an actor, you know?

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:07.193
 And my parents they've
 never supported it.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:08.427 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh honey.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.029 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Your parents sound
  like assholes.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:11.130 align:start position:0%
  - I'm just feeling really
  ugly, I don't know.

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.131 size:88% position:44%
 It's just--

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:13.366 size:88% position:44%
 - Okay Christopher?

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.368
You're one of the most
beautiful men I've ever

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:19.405 align:start position:0%
 laid eyes on and I'm including
 myself in a man's wig.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.474 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm gonna get real
 with you for a second.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:25.211
 If you want to be an
 actor, be an actor.

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.647 align:start position:0%
 If you want to be a garbage
 man, be a garbage man.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.749
You know what I'm saying though?

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:32.485
 You need to get out there and
 you need to take what's yours

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:35.188 align:start size:88% position:13%
because you only live
once, as far as we know.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.255
 - You're a lifesaver.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:37.456
- Stop, you're so cute.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.491 size:88% position:44%
 I love you so much.

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:39.458
 - I love you.

00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:40.693
 - I'm like in love with you.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.795
- I'm in love with you,
no, no, but just not.

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:43.796
 - Okay sorry.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.498
 - Just like, I'm gonna do it.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:46.566
- Go, go, yolo!

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.503 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That's good, I
 should hashtag yolo.

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:51.737 size:88% position:44%
  Has anyone ever done that?

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.506
 - Hey buzz buzz buzz.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.843
Christopher David, yes
I'm absolutely an actor.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:59.312 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I wanted to make
something that was more

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.513 size:88% position:44%
  in the Tarkovsky Solaris--

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:01.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Enough about
  that for a second.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.482
 Do you get a chance to
 watch any of the stuff

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:05.051 size:88% position:44%
  they're doing over at TNT?

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.652 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Franklin and Bash,
 you seen any of that?

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:08.688 size:84% position:42%
  It's really good.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.756 size:88% position:44%
 - No, I've been a
 little busy lately.

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.525 size:84% position:42%
  - Dylan McDermott
  Dermot Mulroney

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:13.693
Dylan McDermott Dermot Mulroney.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.628 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Hello, my name is
 Benedict Cumberbatch.

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:17.496
 - I really wanted to
 do something that was

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.732
somewhere between a mix
of Blair Witch and--

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:21.467
 - Let me just give you this.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.136 size:88% position:44%
  I was also playing myself
  in Step Up 3D, information

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.505
on the back and good
luck with this project.

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:29.075
 It looks terrific, it's cute.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.409
 - You're a young James Franco.

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:31.811 size:88% position:44%
 You're Dave Franco.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:35.414
Oh yeah, you're Zac Ef,
no you're Dave Franco.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:36.282
This is the day.

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:37.216
 Shit!

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.451
 - It's interesting because--

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.352 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I hear that you're
  kind of looking

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.521
 for the next big star
 for your next film?

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:44.090 align:start position:0%
  - Obviously Decker talked
  to some other people.

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.458 size:88% position:44%
 - Yeah he sure did.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.293 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - James Franco
 buddy, look at you.

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.062
 You're like a mirror.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.497
 Fuck!

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.432 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I love horror, I
 love science fiction--

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:56.168
 - I was voted most likely to
 get murdered in high school.

00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.703 size:88% position:44%
 - You were?

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.538
 - I don't know if
 you're planning any
 other horror movies.

00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
  - You sort of need a
  good horror movie scream.

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:02.441
 - I have that.

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:03.442
- Can I hear it?

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.443
 - Yes.

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:06.646 size:84% position:42%
  (screams)

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.615
- Yeah.

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:10.650
(laughs)

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:11.517 size:88% position:44%
  - Shut up!

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.085
 (sobs)

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:14.120
 God damn it!

00:04:15.454 --> 00:04:18.391 size:88% position:44%
  - Yeah I'm looking
  for Christopher.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:21.227
 Hey hey, Christopher
 are you in there?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.795
 I can hear something.

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:25.131
 What are you doing in there?

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.400
 Okay, get me when you're out.

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:34.407
 - Hey.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.241
 - Christopher David.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:36.109
 - Hi.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:38.811 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Oh god, does anyone
 have a towel?

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:40.479
- It's the buzz.

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:42.048 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Purell, is my
  Purell over there?

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:45.451 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Buzz buzz buzzes,
Christopher David here.

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:46.452
 - Hey.

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:47.453
(clears throat)

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:48.521
- Buzz--

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.525 size:84% position:42%
  - Do you have a question?

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:56.762 size:88% position:44%
 Do you want me, why
 don't I just start?

00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:58.097 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Let me tell you
 about Mission Fear.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.332
I'm so excited--

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.467 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Yeah I've got
  questions for you.

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:04.036 size:84% position:42%
  Okay Eli.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.771 align:start position:0%
- Do you, you know a lot of
people don't know this about me,

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:08.474 align:start size:88% position:13%
 but I've always
 wanted to do sci-fi.

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.242 align:start size:88% position:13%
  It's like been
  this secret dream.

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:11.444
(laughs)

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.145 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Secret dream, is that
what you just said?

00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:14.580
(laughs)

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:16.382
It's your secret dream.

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:18.517 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Oh my god it's
  your secret dream.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.354 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Christopher, please
 let Eli Roth out!

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:22.155
- Hey what's going on you guys?

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:23.689 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Christopher went
  nuts in there.

00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:25.691 size:84% position:42%
  He's holding him hostage.

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:27.593
 Don't you hurt my Eli!

00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:29.028
 - Not to make this about me,

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.496
 but I feel like this
 might be my fault.

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.565 align:start position:0%
 I accidentally told
 Christopher he was important.

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:33.799
- Why would you do that?

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.501
 - Hey have you guys
 seen my phone charger?

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:36.469 size:88% position:44%
 - Shut up, shut up!

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.237
 - Okay watch out, watch out.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.307 size:88% position:44%
 - Ha ha wow, what a
 talent this guy is.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.675 size:88% position:44%
 - Big news!

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:44.543 align:start position:0%
 Sounds like I'm going to
 be signing up for IMDB pro.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:45.377
 I booked it!

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.380 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yes you did, okay
 we're just gonna

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.715 size:88% position:44%
 take it down a notch, okay?
