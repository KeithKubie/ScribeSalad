00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.060
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.530
Shaffer: I think we'll
go ahead and get started

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.630
because under the conditions
of commuting

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.880
into this city this morning,
it's really impossible to predict

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.480
when people might arrive and
what their voyage will be like.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.110 position:56%
It's my pleasure to welcome you this
morning to the 265th celebration

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.230
of James Madison's birthday.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.790
My name is Roberta Shaffer and I
have the pleasure and privilege

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.420
of serving as the Law
Librarian of Congress.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.180 position:56%
This building that we are in is with
James Madison Memorial Building.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.690
It is the only memorial to
James Madison in Washington,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.890
and I'm going to argue that it
is the most appropriate memorial

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.240
possible to James Madison.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.180
And here are my reasons.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.830
First, even though Thomas
Jefferson gets all the credit,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.390
I think James Madison was
himself a huge fan of books,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.580
a bibliophile if I may say.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.160
He had a large collection
at his estate in Montpelier.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.050
And when he died, he
was very concerned

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.040
about where his books would go.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.870 position:56%
So in my view, that qualifies you as
a lover of books and a bibliophile.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.850
It's also appropriate that
a building for the Library

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.100
of Congress be named for
Madison because he served

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.540
in numerous positions in government
and of course had a huge influence

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.400
on the very form of
government that we have enjoyed

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.720
for all these many years.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.900
The statue that is in Memorial Hall
on the very first floor as you come

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.650
into the building has-- depicts
James Madison holding a book

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.210
and it is an encyclopedia, a
French encyclopedia, nonetheless,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.290
but an encyclopedia that
covers all subject matters.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.020
So, he is memorialized
in his Memorial Building

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.820
with a block in his marble hand.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.740
But the last reason I
think it's appropriate

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.130
that James Madison have a
building that's part of the Library

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.500
of Congress footprint
named for him is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.320 position:56%
because I think he really understood
the idea of America's library.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.620
So anybody who has ever
worked at the Library

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.280
of Congress knows two
quotes by heart.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.470
In fact, I think you have to
recite them after one week of work.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.200
And these are two quotes by
Thomas Jefferson, the first,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.770
"I cannot live without books."

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.490
And most of us who work here share
that very philosophy and passion.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.140
And the second is that there
is no discipline or book

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.580
for which Congress might
not have a need to refer.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.100
And that's a big paraphrase, but
it's something along those lines

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.230
that Congress needs
universal knowledge.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.270
But there is a quote by
Madison that I think talks

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.790
in a little bit different
way about the need

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.790
for America's library
or a national library.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.960
And I'm probably going
to paraphrase it,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.780
and I just wrote it down quickly.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.570
But I'm sure I don't
have it by heart.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.430
But it goes along the lines

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.550
of "Knowledge shall forever govern
ignorance, and people who mean

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.580
to be their own governors
must arm themselves

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.120
with the power of knowledge."

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.080
And this quote or something
very close to it is enshrined

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.550
at the very entrance
to our building,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.640
on the outside of the building.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.040
And to me, that speaks to
giving the people a library

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.670
and not just Congress.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.480
So, that is my argument for why it
is so appropriate for James Madison

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.280
to have this building named for him
and why we're so delighted today

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.880
that you are joining us to
celebrate what would have been his

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.330
265th birthday.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.860 position:56%
And who knows if he was a man of our
times with all of the biotechnology,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.650
he might very well be celebrating
here with us his 265th birthday.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.640
I am going to just very,
very briefly tell you

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.410
about our process for today.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.910
I have no idea what that noise
is, but let's just forget it.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.790
OK. We're going to have a
little bit smaller panel

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.420
than we initially anticipated.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.860
Michael Signer, we advised him
not to try to drive this morning

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.960
from Charlottesville fearing

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.560
that he would hit immense traffic
jams when he hit the beltway.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.730
So, he is not joining us but
please do keep a lookout.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.800
We will reschedule his talk
for sometime later in the year.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.980
He is the author of a new
book "Becoming Madison,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.200
The Extraordinary Origin of the
Least Likely Founding Father".

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.560
And he's also the mayor
of Charlottesville.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.860
We do however have
the distinct pleasure

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.350 position:56%
of David Stewart to my extreme left.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.670
And David's recent book
is "Madison's Gift,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.400
Five Partnerships that
Built America".

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.150
And he will talk to
us about this sort

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.310
of networking skills
of Madison, I believe.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.490
David is the president of the
Washington Independent Review

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.320
of Books, a phenomenal
online book review.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.390
And I urge you to consult it if you
haven't and don't frequently, I do.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:11.560
And he is also a scholar, an author
on a number of other presidents--

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.510
other books on Madison, but
also presidential issues.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.630
I think there's a book on
the Lincoln presidency.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:29.080
And then, to my closer left is Mary
Sarah Bilder, a professor of law

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.510
and distinguished scholar at Boston
College in Boston, Massachusetts.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:42.340
And Mary is particularly a poster
child for the Library of Congress

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.880
because not only has she done
work on a research on Madison here

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.190
within our extraordinary
collections which Jim Hutson,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.030
the chief of the Manuscript
Division will talk to you

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.770
about briefly in a moment.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.440
But Mary also used our
conservation technologies

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.880
to uncover some very interesting
forensics about Madison.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.710
And we're hoping she'll
talk to us about that.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.300
Mary is a scholar in her own right.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.990
But I understand that she comes
from a long line of legal scholars.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.250
So without further ado, I'm just
going to say one or two more things

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.190
and then ask Jim Hutson to come
up to the podium and talk to us

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.610
about the libraries
which collections with--

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.440
of Madison and the 23 other
presidential collections perhaps

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.330
he'll just mention briefly.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.390
But we're going to have
our program this morning.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.390
And then this afternoon,
you are all invited

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.630 position:56%
to a cake reception in Madison Hall.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.770
You can go to Madison
Hall and have cake

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.320
and see the wonderful Madison
inscriptions that are down there.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.680
So, that's just the
very first floor closest

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.670 position:56%
to the Independence Avenue entrance.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.340
And we hope you'll
come and have cake.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.310
In light of the circumstances of
metro today, I would venture to say

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.680
that there'll be more
cake for everybody.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.600
And the happy news is that David,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.240
Mary and Jim actually
have more time.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.000
And I think knowing their
incredible scholarship,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.840
they will use that time very
productively for our benefit.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.650
If you would be so kind as to
complete the evaluation form

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.540
that was in your program, this
will help us with other programs.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:32.630
And I will ask you-- Oh yes, in the
unlikely event of a water emergency

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.950
or other emergency, library
staff will safely escort you

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.460
out of the building.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.640
But for now, if you will
please make sure that any

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.890
of the carry-ons you brought

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.390
for this journey this morning
are safely tucked either in front

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.320 position:56%
or under your own seat, that your
cellphones are not in airplane mode,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.870
but turned off, and
that your minds are

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.090
in their open and upright position.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:04.210
So without further ado, I bring
to the podium my very esteemed

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.260
and honored colleague, Jim Hutson,
chief of the Manuscript Division.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.060
&gt;&gt; James Hutson: Thank you.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.710
[ Applause ]

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.010
Thanks, Roberta.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.310
I wonder if Madison still thinks

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.510
that knowledge will
govern ignorance.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.640
[ Laughter ]

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.400
As you know, he died in a-- I'll
talk just a little bit about our--

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.710 position:56%
the Madison collection we have here.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:37.130
We also have incidentally a--
in addition to Madison Hall,

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:43.200 position:56%
have a Montpelier or which we call
a Montpelier Room down the hall here

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.270
which is a very nice
venue for symposia.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.500
It was a dining hall at one point.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.360
Have they ceased that now?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.090 position:56%
Yeah. But it holds about 300 people.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.070
It has a wonderful view
of-- towards the airport.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:05.240
And-- So, that's also a small
gesture on Madison's behalf.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:14.470
He died in 1836 of course, and
the family was always needy.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.830
John Payne plays into
this immediate--

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:24.470
that's the stepson who virtually
bankrupted Madison I suppose

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.630
with his spending habits.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.550
But Dolley sold some
of the collection

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:34.680
to Congress at 1837 and 1848.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.020
The 1837 sale, I'm going to say
very little more about that,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.400
but that did contain Madison's
notes, which we now have--

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.690
is one of our great treasures.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.650
It's-- We have a group of things
here called top treasures among

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.960
other, the Gettysburg Address,
Lincoln's Second Inaugural,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.670
the rough draft of the
Declaration of Independence.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.490
All of which are very
carefully preserved in a--

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:05.770
deep in the bowels of
the library, in a safe--

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.140
they're-- we hope they're secure.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.320
But the-- No, I mean at one point,
we were thinking of moving them

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.340
to Fort Knox actually,
and did not do that.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.310
That was after 9/11.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:24.860
But they're-- So, they're still
here, Professor Bilder saw those.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.450
We do let people look at
them if they can convince us

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.870
that they have a really need.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.580
Generally-- That's true.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.330
Most kind of valuable manuscripts
are on the library if for instance

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.570
in the Manuscript Division, if
you walk in there and wanted

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.240
to see Madison's papers, we
would ask you or anybody else is

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.270
that we film-- you'd have to use
a microfilm, nobody likes that.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.930
And I get a constant stream of
people coming over and say, well,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.800
you know, I can't-- you
know, I can't use this,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.100
couldn't I see the original.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.050
But-- And generally,
we'll let people--

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:02.050
if people are doing handwriting
analysis or looking at inks

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.210
and so forth, we'll
let them look at that.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.930
And we will let somebody--

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.980
I mean, she's not the first
person who's ever seen this.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.400
And so, we will let people
see some of these treasures.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.650
But they have other-- I mean to put
them on an exhibit, you have to--

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.380
there has to be an armed
guard and that kind of thing.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:28.190
So-- But in any case, the 1837
sale did contain the notes.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:35.450
And I'll leave that alone and not
talk about the nature of the notes,

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.450
which has been a kind of
a subject of [inaudible],

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.340
isn't he the first one
who accused Madison

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.010
for forging the note so to speak?

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.520
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.960
Hamilton [inaudible], OK.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.290
But there's a long--
there's a history of this.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.180
Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:02.010
OK. So, Congress got some papers at
1837 and 1848 and treated these--

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.210
and generally, the 19th century
didn't seem not to have much

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.240
of an appreciation, at
least custodians were,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.150
the sanctity of what we might call,
you know, important manuscripts.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.170
Congress lent some of the stuff
out to William Cabell Rives,

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.950
a biographer, I guess just
sort of handed them over.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:23.760
I mean, Rives was Madison's first
biographer or first-- that's not--

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.770
maybe not true, but
he was well-connected.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.340
So, he got substantial
number of papers.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.360
Eventually, they were returned by
a relative and they're called--

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.660
we call those the Rives's--

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.720
that's the Rives's section
of the Madison Papers.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.570
But I-- Apparently,
Rives did not turn--

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:46.530
Rives's representatives did not
return everything, something.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:52.530
So, we have those papers
leaving and some not returning.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:57.420
And then John Todd Payne of course
who was always broke, and Madison--

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.220
he almost bankrupted Madison,
didn't he, supporting the guy.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.070
Well, he sold some of them off.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:08.440
Really, he sold some of them
off to a man named McGuire,

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:15.450
a lot of them off actually,
something about 2900 of them.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:21.990
McGuire kept them, at his
death, I believe in 1892,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.360
they were auctioned, some of
them, most of them and bought

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.970
by Walter Benjamin, a important
manuscript collector at that point.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.110
He sold them to the
Chicago Historical Society,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.100 position:56%
and the library bought them back
from the Chicago Historical Society.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:47.430
In 1905-- So we got those back.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.220
That's-- That-- It was
after, however, in 19--

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.690
that the State Department in
the 19th century was the keeper

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.280
of government manuscripts,
not the Library of Congress.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.660
The library didn't have room.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.600
You've seen-- Some of you
may have seen some pictures

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.390
of the library just
overwhelmed by paper.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.210
But the State Department was the--

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:13.310
that was the National Archives
until 1903 when the government--

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.320
I don't know, John
Cole I think is out.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.820
Was a law passed or was it just an
executive order ordering the State

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.610
Department to return
whatever archives it had

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.190
over to the Library of Congress.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.490
&gt;&gt; Executive--

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.790
&gt;&gt; James Hutson: I think
it was an executive order.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.660
So, that-- that's how we got--

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:37.250 position:56%
that's how the library really got
the-- most of our great manuscript--

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.310
Washington, Jefferson and others.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.430
The State Department turned--
Because it didn't have any room

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.540
and we just moved into
a large empty building

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.090
in 1897, the Jefferson Building.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:55.450 position:56%
So, that really was the basis of the
Manuscript Division and the source

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.570
of our-- some of our
greatest collections.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:04.680
So in 1905, the State Department
turned over such Madison Papers

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.590
out of its hand, and that
was about 8600 items.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.700
We did, as I say, buy
back those things

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.260
and most of them went to McGuire.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.940
That was about 2,900.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:23.010
And over the years, we've acquired
more by gifts and purchases.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:28.960 position:56%
The present time that, we-- In
1961, there was a program, this was,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.550
you know, at the heart
of the Cold War.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.990
The library was directed by
Congress to microfilm all

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.230
of the presidential papers

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.150
and distribute those
microfilms around the country.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.270
So if we were wiped out here,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.490
there would be microfilm
collections available.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.050
And we microfilmed
Madison Papers of course.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.830
Those microfilm collections
have now all been digit--

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.650
all of them have been digitized,
we just actually finished.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.140 position:56%
Some of the 20th century collections
are huge as you can imagine.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.990
We stopped getting
presidential collections

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.200
when the presidential libraries--
we don't compete with them.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.180
So, Calvin Coolidge is
the last person we have.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:14.410
So, you now-- since they have
been digitized from the microfilm

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.550
and then a new edition is
coming that will correct some

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.850
of the problems of the microfilm.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:27.320
So to finish, if you-- the
papers are now available

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.810
to the public and-- not
however in transcriptions.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.920
If you want those, there's this
massive project at the University

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.070
of Virginia publishing
the Madison Papers,

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.740
transcribed in good transcriptions.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.060
Those can-- Those are also on film
now, the so-called Rotunda Project.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:54.060 position:56%
And there's, as most-- in many
institutes too, you have to have a--

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.900
I mean, you can't-- I don't think
you could probably purchase the

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.680
right to see them at
your home computer.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.430
But most large libraries
would have those--

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.540
would have that edition
as well online.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.350
So, you could see you would
not be troubled with trying

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.730
to puzzle out what Madison wrote.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.960
Although, he had a
good had, a small one.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.110 position:56%
So, that's what I can tell about our
collection, we're very proud of it.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.100
And, you know, we have 23
presidential collections here

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.270
stopping with Coolidge.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.610
We don't have the Adams
family, that's in Massachusetts.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.910
We have film-- microfilms of
those papers in the division.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:37.670
And we don't have Millard
Fillmore and some other luminaries

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.810
of the late 19th century.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:44.720
But it's the place
to go if you want.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.420
Well, not now since everything
is on film and online,

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.370
you don't need to come here.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.190
And that's a problem for us
because we live off statistics

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.580
and the reading all
over the library.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.330
So, that's good news,
bad news thing.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:07.350 position:56%
And so I don't know if we should
prevent, what should we do, Roberta?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.690
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.420
That is correct.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.510
So with that, I'll turn it
back over to the speakers then.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.510
[ Applause ]

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.380
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.020
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder:
Let me put this up here.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.950
I'm delighted to have been invited
to speak on this wonderful panel

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.320
in honor of James Madison's
birthday.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.700
I woke up this morning and my
dear friend, Judge Hiller Zobel,

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.640
had e-mailed me, Happy
Madison Birthday to you.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.800
So, somewhere in the world,
other people know about it.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.060
I'm very appreciative to the
library for having invited me

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.290
and to Roberta Shaffer for
that wonderful introduction

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:57.160
and to [inaudible] for unbelievable
assistance in trying circumstances.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.860
The inability to get here
reminds me a little bit

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.050
of the convention itself.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.740
Madison arrived on time
and then was aggravated

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.250
by everybody else's delay.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.880
So, he would, more
than other people,

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.490
probably appreciate the
difficulties of arriving.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:23.720
I wish I'd thought for myself that
2016 was Madison's 265th birthday.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.280 position:56%
Because I realize now, it would have
been better for my book to have come

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.360
out this year instead of last fall.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.880
2015 was a odd book
to publish a book

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.990
about Madison and the convention.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:41.360
It was the 228th anniversary
of the constitution.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.780
And luckily, I published
with a university press

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.760
that doesn't care about
publicity at all.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.130
And so-- Because it was a
little hard to be like, hey,

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.860
it's the 228th anniversary.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.720
But I came to view
this non-anniversary

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.130 position:56%
as peculiarly appropriate for a book
that argues that Madison's notes

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.790
as taken in the summer of
1787 were not written for us.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.630
In essence, they were not written
for posterity because Madison,

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.230
like the other members of
the Philadelphia Convention,

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:19.060
did not know they were going
to write the Constitution.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.890
And they would have been surprised,
I think, to know that, you know,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.620
you could buy their document
on playing cards, right?

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.920
I mean, they would
just be astounded,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.220
like really, playing cards?

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.230
Or this is my favorite
tchotchke now when I give talks.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.330
I was down at Montpellier,
and sometimes,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.860
I travel with my James
Madison bubblehead,

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.040
but TSA really dislikes it.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.760
It looks like something
strange, heavy material

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.160
and a wire in my suitcase.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.470
So, I've stopped traveling
with that.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.770
It slows me down.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.070
But this is wonderful.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.990
You can get this at
Montpellier when you go there.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.870
It's a magic towel.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.940
You know, it becomes a big towel.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.540
The joke is, it reconstitutes
itself.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:03.010
So, you can go find one of--
you can find one of those.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.280
My book, "Madison's Hand, Revising
the Constitutional Convention",

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.240
is a biography of the note.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.080
And the book argues that the notes
do not date in their entirety

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.080
to the summer of 1787, but
were revised by Madison

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.140
as he changed his understanding
about the convention,

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.240
the constitution and his own role.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.240
And it explores the
manuscript as a text

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.970
and also has a historical
object, basically, an artifact.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.400
And I'm going to be back at the
beginning of May to give a lecture

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.590
in the books and beyond series.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.560
And there, I'm going to focus
specifically on the research,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.110
particularly a lot of the forensic
research that underpins the book.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:45.340
And so, today, I thought I would
just talk generally about Madison

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.420
and the Constitutional Convention.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.840
And I'm going talk about Madison
and the convention and some

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.620
of the themes of my book
through four aspects of Madison,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.780
Madison the notetaker,
Madison the politician,

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.400
Madison the drafter and
Madison the reviser.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.020
And David and I, while being sad
that Michael was not joining us,

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.930
are secretly happy because
there's nothing happier

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.380
than speakers being told they
have slightly more time to speak

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.920
than they originally thought.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.230
So, we're-- I think we're
going to make good use of that.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.410
But we did realize that I
had written my talk to talk

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.840
on the convention, and
Michael was going to handle

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.440
who Madison was, and
we're missing that.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.200
So, I'm going take the liberty
of reading four sentences

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.810
from my book to set Madison up.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.990
So, this all you need to know
about Madison for anything.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.150
This is actually all I talk about
Madison's early life in my book.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:47.050
"Born on March 16th, 1751," hence
the day we're celebrating today,

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.950
"Madison was the eldest
in a large family.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.830 position:56%
At 20, he graduated from the College
of New Jersey, now Princeton,

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.740
and he stayed on an extra
year for additional studies."

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.310
He was of course from Virginia,
and had traveled north to school.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.960
"And afterwards, he
focused on politics.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.940
At 25 years of age, he was elected
to the Virginia Legislature,

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.510
three years later, to the
Confederation Congress.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:17.780
In 1783, Madison was considering
law as a possible profession.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.470
And he eventually decides not to
be a lawyer," and Madison's notes

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.630
that he's taken are
also at the library.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.940
And in that sense, I think, David
and I probably love that aspect

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.850
of Madison, trained a little bit
in law but no longer practicing.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.280
OK. That's all we need
to know to set

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.850
up what I'm going to
talk about Madison.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.780
So, I' m going to talk first
about Madison, the notetaker.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:48.700
In 1815, Thomas Jefferson wrote
to John Adams about Madison's note

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.890
of the Constitutional Convention.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.040
And they were then
not yet published.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.570
And Jefferson remarked, "The
whole of every thing said

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:05.230 position:56%
and done was taken down with a labor
and exactness beyond comprehension."

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.180
And Jefferson wrote that,
"It was the ablest work

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.680
of this kind ever yet executed."

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.700
And Adams says, I will
unlikely not live to see it.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.850
And that was true,
both he and Jefferson

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.670
of course died on July 4th.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.160
Ten years-- 11 years later in 1826.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.980
And to Jefferson, Madison seemed
the consummate, notetaker.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.500
But the reality is
somewhat different.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.140
Madison's most significant
and lasting contribution

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.500
to the convention is
perhaps his notes.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.030
And this record of the
convention usually referred

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:44.570
to as Madison's notes are the most
complete and detailed description

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.280
of the Constitutional Convention.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.120
An official record of the
convention was compiled

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.840 position:56%
by Secretary William Jackson, the
National Archives holds that record,

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.840
and notes also survived
from 10 other delegates.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.140
But Madison's notes are the
only ones that cover every day

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.600
of the convention,
beginning on May 14th

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.910
and ending on September 17th 1787.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.530
And no other notes are as long.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:16.240
The manuscripts comprise of
136 and a half sheets of paper,

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.270
folded in half, and he wrote on big
sheets, and they fold it in half,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.640
with four pages of writing.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.840
He wrote on the front, opened it,
wrote on the second and third page,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.670
reversed it, wrote on the back.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.730
So, it's over 500 pages
of manuscript.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.210
And no other notes depict the
convention as Madison's notes do,

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.260 position:56%
as a political drama with compelling
characters, lengthy discourses

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.900
on political theories,
crushing disappointments

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.240
and seeming miraculous successes.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.470
And the notes are, as the
library catalogues them,

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.430
properly considered a top
treasure of the American people.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.030
But what kind of notetaker was he?

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.210
The notes have often been relied
on as if they'd been taken

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.140
by a court reporter or stenographer
for the Congressional record.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.980
But the original notes
were actually an example

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.910
of a genre we might call
a legislative diary.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:08.130
In the 18th century, legislative
proceedings were closed,

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:13.050
much like the deliberations of
judges and justices remain today.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.520
And we'll forgive anybody, who
at 11 o'clock needs to look

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.330
at their phone, to find out who the
next Supreme Court justice nominee

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.200
is going to be.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.460
What the public had a right to was
the final product, the legislation

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.560
and the formal general
procedural motions.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.800 position:56%
Indeed, although the House of
Representatives would open its doors

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.370
in 1789, the Senate
actually remained closed

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.380
to the public until 1795.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.210
And without published
accounts of debates,

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.240
legislators relied
on private diaries.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.780
So, Madison's notes at the
convention were taken for himself

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.760
and likely Thomas Jefferson.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.260
Madison had taken similar
notes when he had served

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.450
in the Confederation Congress

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.920
and Madison had shared
these with Jefferson.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.270
Jefferson was in Paris since 1784,

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.750
he will miss the convention
entirely.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:06.340
At the convention, Madison's
notes practiced political ideas,

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.050
his strategies and the positions
of allies and opponents.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.450
And the original notes
reflected what he cared about

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.130
and they omitted what he
did not find interesting.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.700
As past scholars, including
Jim Hutson,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.090
have estimated Madison's
notes contain only about 10%

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.140
of what was likely
said at the convention.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.110
But that 10% related
almost entirely to Madison.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.970
Madison's notes were not a
contemporaneous complete account.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.700
Most likely twice a week,
on Wednesdays and Sundays

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.990
when he did his other
correspondence,

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.890
he wrote up rough notes that he
had taken during the proceedings.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.360
His rough notes were likely filled

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.830
with abbreviations he
did not know shorthand.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.820
And the notes began as a fair copy

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.640
of these no longer
extant rough notes.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.120
Thus in the notes, the
longest speeches appear usually

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.230
in Saturday's notes.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.640
Not necessarily because they
were the most important,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.970
but because a Sundays without
meetings gave Madison time

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.120
to decipher his rough notes.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.530
And when Madison wrote about
events that had happened on Monday

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:16.020
or Thursday, he knew what
the convention had gone

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.850 position:56%
on to decide in the succeeding days.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.400
These days therefore were
always written with hindsight.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:28.120
And so, from the first day, Madison
was revising his understanding.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:32.090
Now, I love talking about the notes
with law students because they know

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.300
from firsthand experience that
one cannot take notes while one

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.600
is speaking.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.440
In law schools, we still maintain,
particularly in the first year,

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.600
the formal tradition of
spontaneously calling on people,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.190
Ms. Bilder, tell us about the case.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.420
And you now, at that
moment, your mind is blank.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.270
You cannot sit and try and answer
the question and write notes.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.400
When they're called on in class,
they either leave their notes blank

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.170
or what they often do is they
compose that section later,

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:05.110
reflecting what they realized
afterwards was the right answer.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.400 position:56%
And most of my students tell me that
in their notes, if they write them,

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.350
they're filled with brilliance of
what they must have said in class.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.390
Madison's own speeches in
the notes are thus troubling

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.360
in terms of reliability.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.310
Madison wrote what
he wished he'd said.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:24.550
Indeed, his famous June 19th speech
supporting the national Virginia

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.870
Plan was recorded by a
number of other notetakers.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.390
And in their notes,
it's rather meandering.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.470
But in Madison note--
Madison's notes,

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:39.070
it's a well-organized six-page
disquisition on political theory.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.490
Moreover, in the years
immediately after the convention,

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.740
Madison likely replaced several of
the sheets containing his speeches.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.140
His motivation is unknowable,
but it may have been to clarify

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.030
and expand arguments that he
made or to delete statements

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.860
that he might have
been misunderstood

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.500
in terms of later controversies.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.190
So now, let me, second talk
about Madison, the politician.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:03.570
In famous correspondence,
several years after the convention

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:08.260
with Jefferson, Madison Riley
referred to the naked eye

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.060
of the ordinary politician.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.620
We don't always think of
Madison as a politician.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.870
Now, I think, David's
book does a wonderful job

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.210
of emphasizing this aspect.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.760
And the original notes reflected
Madison's political aspirations.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.760
In them, he emerges as a
proactive political strategist.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.230
The original notes from June
to July 1787 are fixated

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.130 position:56%
on Madison's almost obsessive desire

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.070
to create a powerful
national government

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:41.330
with proportional representation
in both houses.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.030
More than anything,
he wanted the states

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:47.690
to lose their representation
in Congress.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:53.290
Madison came to the convention
desiring what he called the due

00:31:53.290 --> 00:32:00.360 position:56%
supremacy of the national authority
leaving the states, or as he put it,

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:07.220
local authorities, as far as
they can be subordinately useful.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:11.210
OK. He wanted to end equality
of suffrage of the states.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.560
He wanted the national
government to have the power

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.530
in cases requiring uniformity.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.050
He wanted the national
government to even have a negative,

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.810
what we might now call
a veto, over state laws.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.500
He wanted the constitution to be
supreme to state constitutions.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:34.650
As he put it, he planned to strike
so deeply at the old confederation.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:39.510
Madison opposed completely and
thoroughly the federal compromised

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:43.910
that Congress now embodies in which
the house represents population

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.210
in the Senate-- the state.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:49.630
At first, Madison thought he
would succeed on June 13th.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.270
The convention prepared a committee
of the whole report in which many

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.630
of Madison's hopes were realized.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:33:01.220
And in the notes, Madison recorded
this report on its own sheet.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.340
His handwriting is beautiful.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.580
It's carefully spaced.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:11.150
He left the last page blank.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.560
In the many revisions
of the manuscript,

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.230
he never wrote on this blank page.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.700
Other places, he had to even
fill in little scrunchie things,

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.300
he left that last page blank.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.300
Why? June 13th ended a
critical phase of the convention

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.900
and never again would
Madison's vision and that

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.950
of the majority aligned so closely.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.460
Now, those familiar with the
traditional narrative know

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.760
what happened.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.530
The small states successfully
fought back.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.550
They worried about
future political dominance

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:44.420
and the other two large states,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:49.250
Madison rejected repeated
suggestions that he compromise

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.220
and permit one branch of Congress

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.450
to reflect the equal
suffrage of the states.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:58.380
In the notes, he even recorded John
Dickinson warning him privately,

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.450
"You see the consequences
of pushing things too far."

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.820
Madison wrote down the advice,
and then ignored it completely.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.120
He dismissed it.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.780
It would be a fatal error not just
for Madison, but for the country.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.410 position:56%
Madison's commitment to ending
state representation in Congress was

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.000
so strong that he came
up with a plan

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.880
to persuade the three
southern states to join

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.970
with the three large states.

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:29.700
He repeatedly hinted at a
sectional division between northern

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.430
and southern states over slavery.

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:36.810
And Madison then proposed
a bicameral Congress based

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.110
on this division.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:41.480
One branch would represent
free white inhabitants.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:47.110 position:56%
The other would represent all people
free and enslaved African-Americans.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:51.350
But enslaved African-Americans
of course would not vote.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.200
Madison's plan thus
gave voting power

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.960
to states that legalized slavery.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.860
And Virginia, by this calculation,
would have benefited the most,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.930
it held nearly 300,000 people,

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:09.190
enslaved nearly half the enslaved
population in the United States.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:12.020
Madison's idea was
never formally adopted.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.050
But his insistence on a
sectional division over slavery

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.710
and his suggestion that
the slave states needed

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.450
to protect their interests in the
national government instigated,

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.530
I believe, the dynamic that led

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.340
to five constitutional
provisions protecting slavery

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.090
in the constitution.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.480
And although after
leaving the convention,

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.880
Madison would blame South
Carolina and Georgia

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.460
for what has been seen now as an
inevitable compromise over slavery.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.950
Madison was equally at fault.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:44.010
His willingness to embrace slavery

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.500
in the constitution reflected his
personal compromise over slavery.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.550
He believed it to be against the
principles of the revolution,

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.640
but he could not imagine a
multiracial American nation.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.750
He freed no one at his death.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:03.360
Indeed, his will left the
profits from the sale of the notes

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.010
of the convention to the
American Colonization Society,

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.040
a group dedicated to sending
freed African-Americans back

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.120
to Africa specifically Liberia.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.500
Now, on July 14th, I
think fortunately for us,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.340
Madison lost his quest
to prevent the states

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.750
from having equal representation
in one branch.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.790
And Madison was mad.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:29.070
On Monday, he recorded
failed efforts

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.270
to resurrect proportional
representation in both branches.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:36.460
He writes of an early morning
meeting among the large states,

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.270
nothing was accomplished.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:45.030
He complained, "The time was
wasted in vague conversation."

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.480
Although in future years,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.970
he actually became reconciled
to American federalism.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:52.060
Initially, the loss was not
at all palatable to him.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.560
He was so mad.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.780
He went on to do something
he would later regret.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:02.980
A mid-disagreement over
the executive on July 17th,

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:09.860
a motion was made from Virginia
for an executive on good behavior.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.210
That is an executive who would
serve for life without term limits,

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.420
only dismissible through
impeachment.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:22.940
Madison and the Virginians joined
three other states to vote in favor

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:28.120
of it, lifetime tenure
for the president.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.890
Whether or not you agree with
that, it depends on whether

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.510
or not you like the president.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.060
The vote was likely actually
aimed at emphasizing the need

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.080
for the executive to have
free agency from the states,

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.040
but the vote would haunt
Madison after the convention.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.500
It looked like Madison had voted

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.880
for a secret monarchical
national government.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.640 position:56%
And this sheet in the note is one he
replaces and then repeatedly tries

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.560
to explain by adding footnotes
along the side and up the margins,

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.320
it's the sheet that's most
marked up in the actual note.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.510
So now, let me talk about
Madison, the drafter.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:10.590
On July 18th, after this vote,
Madison wrote Jefferson referring

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.410 position:56%
to the drudgery of taking his notes.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:19.320
On July 18th, Madison was just
depressed beyond all anything.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.430
But ironically, it was his
notes that would save him.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:26.300
In fact, if Madison had quit
taking notes on July 17th,

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.840
we would have only his
account of his failures

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.650
and he might have been a permanent
outcast at the convention.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:36.550
But gradually, Madison emerged from
defeat and failure into a new role.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.450
He became a constructive
participant and was chosen

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.950
for the most important committees.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.430
Initially, Madison
was such an outcast

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:49.460
because of his adamant stances
for bicameral representation--

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.290
bicameral proportional
representation

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.630
that he wasn't even elected to
the first drafting committee,

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.690
Randolph was elected instead.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.940
And after the drafting
committee came back,

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.870
each member was given
a printed draft.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.420
And unlike everyone else at
the convention, Madison copied

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.920
in hand the first draft
over into his notes.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.930
This process of copying gave
him an intimate familiarity

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.570
with the structure,
language and substance.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.030
He noticed every word.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:20.410
He even noticed that the
printer had made an error

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:25.730 position:56%
in writing Roman numeral sixth above
both the sixth and seventh articles.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.470
So, he knew the draft as
well as anyone who had served

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:32.210
on the committee and
he had no stake in it.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.000
Madison's notes, now
rougher and more erratic,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.750
reflected Madison's fascination
with the drafting process.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.460
He loved drafting.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.790
He had loved it in the
Virginia Legislature.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.540
He loved words and the
struggle to find the right word.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.800 position:56%
And now in the convention, he turned
out to have a talent for working

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:54.250
out semantic compromises that
sidestep theoretical disputes.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.280
He found himself proposing textual
changes or he was often able

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.920
to point to a later
provision in the draft

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.850
that resolved a seemingly
intractable issue.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:08.170
Madison was thoughtful on questions
about which matters belonged

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.860
on a constitution and which
would be more appropriately left

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.520
to ordinary legislative politics.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.810
And the notes reflected
his growing conviction

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:23.040
that the constitution should
avoid unnecessary specifics.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.420 position:56%
By the third week of August, Madison
was rehabilitated in the eyes

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.100
of the convention, no longer
was he the obsessed proponent

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.640
of bicameral proportional
representation

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.940
and a somewhat petulant loser.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.150
He had become a valued drafter.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:43.920
Now, the notes here reflect the
complexity of the drafting process.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.500
The delegates sent
controversial issues late

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.270
in the convention to committees.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.620
In fact, there were six
committees between August 18th

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.430
and the end of the convention.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.540
The increase in committee
work led the convention

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.380
to change its adjournment
time from 4 p.m. to 3 to allow

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.530
for all the committee work.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.460
In the last three and a half weeks
of the convention, Madison served

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.870
on the three most important
committees, a committee dealing

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:13.580
with slavery, a committee handling
everything that they had postponed

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.700
like including everything
about the president as well

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.810
as the five-men final
draft committee.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:24.310
And at this very moment, when
Madison was completely involved

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.600
in the production of
the constitution,

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.050
his original notes stopped.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:33.840
August 24th 1787 is the last
page of the original notes.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.660
And although there are notes for
the remaining weeks, I argue,

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:41.460 position:56%
in the book that they were composed
two years later in the fall of 1789.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.150
This collapse of the
notes is not surprising.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.940
Madison had little time
given his committee work.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.700
In fact, if you chart
out his committee work,

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.810
there's literally almost no day

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.370
on which he could have
written his rough notes up.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.310
And moreover, he became sick,

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:58.520
something that he was
susceptible to under stress.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.510
And most importantly,
he was too involved

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:06.050
with drafting the constitution
to bother with notes.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:11.430 position:56%
And I think he could not keep
distinct decisions made in committee

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:12.770
with those in the convention.

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:16.600
Thus, at the very moment, when
the convention decided many

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.770
of the issues we debate today,
certain Congressional powers,

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.640
impeachment, the vice
president, the Electoral College,

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.360
all the presidential powers and
the grouping and relationships

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:33.290
that converted the 23 final
articles into our seven,

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:36.250
the notes are the most unreliable.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:41.800 position:56%
But this collapse of the notes
reflected the contemporary inability

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:47.860
of Madison and all the delegates
to see the final constitution

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.420
in the sense that we
mistakenly imagine they could.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.950
The collapse of the notes means
that Madison's great successes

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.640
in the final weeks
are invisible to us.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.330
So finally, let me talk
about Madison the reviser.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:07.220
Two years would pass before
Madison composed the final weeks

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.520
of the notes.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.770
And by then, his rough notes were
undoubtedly difficult to decipher.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.740
And moreover, in the intervening
two years; the convention had begun

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.210
to acquire a different
set of meanings.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:20.940
In fact, as a member
of the First Congress,

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.630
Madison had repeatedly
confronted the difficulties

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.190
of interpreting the constitution.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.970
In addition, he'd champion
the successful amendment

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.250
of the constitution
with 12 amendments,

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.960
the ratified 10 we know
today as the Bill of Rights.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.500
Significantly, Congress's
decision to add rather

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.590
than interweave those
amendments made the constitution

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.580
and the conventions work

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:51.610
for the first time begin
to be seen as sacred.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:56.300
In the fall of 1789, Jefferson
was expected to return from Paris.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.220
And Madison decided
to finish his notes.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.180
He secretly acquired
the official journal

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.500
of the convention from
George Washington.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:12.580 position:56%
And George Washington's diary that
would have recorded this is missing.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.080
OK. Madison made a copy

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.740
of the entire convention
journal, Yale holds that copy.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.040
And then he used this journal
copy to reconstruct the notes.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:26.330
He interspersed the official record
of the proceedings with remnants

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.810
of speeches from whatever remaining
rough notes he had in his memory.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:33.570 position:56%
And then, Madison went back over the
first part of his notes and he began

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.310
to add in more material from
the journal to alter words

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.250
and phrases here and there.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.650
He even substituted three
sheets in early June

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:45.770
to replace earlier unsatisfactory
versions of his speeches.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:50.230
After Jefferson returned, Madison
continued to revise his notes.

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.630
Jefferson became obsessed
that Hamilton

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:58.640 position:56%
and his allies were secretly devoted
to a more monarchical government.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.950
And this devotion had begun at the
convention, Jefferson believed.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:07.430
In the early 1790's,
Madison replaced five sheets.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:12.480
Each containing a speech or
vote capable of being read

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.750
as Madison aligned with Hamilton.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:20.330
Now, you probably wish as he was
given Hamilton is like making

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:23.010
in a 900-dollar tickets, OK.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:25.490
I haven't seen it.

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:28.150
Madison could not completely
rewrite his speeches

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.340
or pretend he had not spoken,
too many members remained alive,

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.750
many with notes, but you
could ensure that sentences

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:38.390
in his own handwriting would not
be used as evidence against them.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.650
In comparing other
versions of his speeches,

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:44.790
I speculate that Madison carefully
eliminated his most controversial

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.960
conclusion and he also sprinkled

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.400
in occasionally Jefferson's new
buzzword, Republican Government.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.330
And during these years, Madison
began to revise the notes

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.770
to convert his diary
into a record of debates.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:01.080
And along the way, he converted
himself into a different Madison.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.690
In the original notes, he's
caddy, grumpy and annoyed.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.060
But by altering a word
here, a phrase there,

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.610
he became the moderate
dispassionate observer,

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.060
thoughtful intellectual founder,

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.520
future statue downstairs,
right, person.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.250
He revised concepts, terms,
narrowed general statements,

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.560
added caveats through--
in cross references.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.950
At times, his revisions
border on fussiness.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.890
And after retiring from
the presidency in 1817,

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.490
Madison continued to
revise the notes.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:37.170
By this point, the Madison-- the
manuscript was covered in revisions

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:41.600
in various shades of ink, some
even showing the shake and slant

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.400
of his later years often
with small slips attached.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.650
Although he repeatedly flirted
with publication he refrained,

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.080
he worried about other accounts.

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.880
By 1829, Madison was finally
the only living member left

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.700
and he settled on posthumous
publication.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:07.180
Only after his death were his
notes finally published in 1840.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.020
I believe that Madison
understood his revisions

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.120
as repeated efforts
to create a record.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.830
His record of what he saw is
significant in the convention.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.590 position:56%
And yet, every revision increased
the distance between Madison's notes

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.030
and the actual convention.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:26.060
As a narrative of the convention,

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:30.700
Madison's notes emphasized his
inability and the other delegates

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.760
to perceive the extraordinary
document

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.450
that the constitution would become.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:39.670
And equally importantly,
the original notes

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.430
of the convention reflect
Madison's inability

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:47.820
to perceive the extraordinary
person that he would become.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:52.340
I think the Madison of
1787 would be astounded

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:56.390
that over two centuries later,
we'd be celebrating his birthday.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:58.730
And so, happy birthday
James Madison.

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:00.530
Thank you very much.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:07.790
[ Applause ]

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:11.510
&gt;&gt; David O. Stewart:
That was a great talk.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:15.060
And we are all, those of us
who tell this particular field,

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.940
in debt to Mary for the
amazing work she's done

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.640
on this treasure of
the American people.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:28.730
And as I told her before, there
were a few times reading our book,

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:32.910
I had thought to myself,
wish I'd known that.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:37.310 position:56%
But I also wanted to thank the
library of course for having us here

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.500
to honor Madison's birthday.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:46.580
I always feel that it takes me a
bit out of the corner of weirdness

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.930
that there are other people
honoring his birthday.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:54.180
And also, to proclaim, maybe not
for the first time, but first time

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:59.020
for me that we have to recognize
that they're-- we are on the edge,

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.460
I hope, of a rebirth of
interest in this era.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.750
And I would call the current
age, the Age of Miranda.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.290
Many of you, you know, there's
already been a reference

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:16.400
to the musical Hamilton
created by Lin-Manuel Miranda,

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:21.610
he was at the White House with the
cast on Monday leading programs

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:24.630
for the high school kids.

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:28.880
And I saw it last year, it's an
amazing show, it's wonderful.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.360
And I did what any author would do.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.640
I immediately went home and
mailed them a copy of my book.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.020
And he wrote a lovely response.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.740
He said, thank you so much.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.310
I know I didn't do
justice to Madison,

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:45.430
but I only had so much time.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:49.810
And I was particularly struck by
this just yesterday when I ran

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:54.210
into a neighbor of mine who
has middle school-aged kids.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.370
I mentioned Miranda would've
been at the White House and all.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:00.420
She said, "Oh, my kids and
everybody at Tilden Middle School

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:04.050
in Bethesda can't stop
singing his songs.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:07.400
And it has apparently
swept the young people.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.630 position:56%
They are all singing Hamilton songs.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:14.460
And apparently in her house,
they-- she has three kids.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.300
They'll actually say, "OK, you sing
Burr's part, you do Jefferson's,

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:22.010
I'll be Hamilton," which is an
amazing explosion of interest.

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:27.850
I am very used to speaking to
crowds of gray heads and the notion

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:30.290
that there are young people
who are getting interested

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:32.370
in this is very exciting.

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:38.080
OK. I became fascinated with
two facts about James Madison

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.640
that led me to want
to write my book.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.420
The first is I really concluded
that he was just so central

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:44.970
to the nation's founding.

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:48.620
He was, in my view, the
second most important figure.

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.220
Washington is above everybody.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.540
You can't touch Washington.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.840
You couldn't touch him
then and you can't still.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.810
Without him, I'm not
sure there is a country.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.630
But I do believe Madison is second.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:02.390
And let me just tick off the
list of his achievements.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.810
He would-- He and Hamilton
were central to the calling

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:08.310
of the Constitutional
Convention in 1787 at a time

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:12.530
when the nation really was drifting
arguably towards more anarchical

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.670
or at least a fractured state.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.030
Of course, the writing of the
constitution, we've heard something

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:21.340
of his involvement in
that and his notetaking.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:27.070 position:56%
The fight for ratification, he and
Hamilton write the Federalist Papers

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:31.480
which are the best political
writing by any Americans ever.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.120
The battle for ratification itself,

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.150
the political fight
he and Hamilton lead.

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:40.350
He is the leading member of the
First Congress, often referred to,

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.770
in that first year, as
Washington's prime minister.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:46.630
He writes the legislation
that creates the government.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:52.270
He writes the Bill of Rights
and fights for their adoption.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:54.720
He confounds the first
American political party,

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.540
then called the Republican Party.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.790
Now, it's still with us,
called the Democratic Party,

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.090
and it's changed a bit.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.850 position:56%
But it was a remarkable achievement.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:07.650 position:56%
He was secretary of state during the
Louisiana Purchase, doubled the size

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.060
of the nation, transformed
the nation.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.830
He was our first wartime president.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:14.900
He led us into the war of 1812.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.960
And I would maintain, and you
can think about this afterwards,

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.890
that he was our only
two-term president

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:25.160
who had a better second
term than his first term.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.590
If you think about the
presidents in our lifetime,

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:30.690
the second term can be
tricky, Iran-Contra,

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:35.520
Monica Lewinsky, housing crisis.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.680
Yet, Madison leaves office really
with an incredible swelling

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.250
of support and prosperity
around the nation.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:46.660
So, that's his amazing
list of achievements.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.220
The second fact though is
that he is so often unnoticed.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.360
I found myself telling
my editor that he's sort

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.390
of the zelig of the founding.

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:58.600
He's always in the picture, but
nobody is paying attention to him.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.870
And it's an interesting
question, why was that?

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.770
There is a flip answer.

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.280
He was short, he was skinny,

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.430
he had a small voice,
he was losing his hair.

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:14.280
And in rooms filled with
noisy people like John Adams

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:18.760 position:56%
and Alexander Hamilton or with large
charismatic figures like Washington

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.810
and Thomas Jefferson,
Madison was easy to miss.

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:27.870
I think that echoes through the
historical memory, and it is true.

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:31.190
But there's another answer that I
think is a lot more interesting,

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:34.940
which is that he really was
different from most great leaders.

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.440
Most great leaders, and you--

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:40.190
if your mind wanders to current
presidential candidates that--

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:46.570
I can't prevent that, they often
have strong streaks of narcissism.

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.330
They need to be at the
front of the parade,

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:51.200
preferably on a white
horse with a band playing.

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.190
They crave recognition and acclaim.

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:55.840
Madison had none of that.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.870 position:56%
There's a wonderful moment when he's
at his inaugural ball as president

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:04.070
in 1809, it's the first
inaugural ball ever,

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:06.480
and an on old friend
comes up embraces him

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.480
and says, "Isn't this wonderful."

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.920
And Madison says, "Well, I'd
really rather be home in bed,"

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.010
which was really Madison.

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:16.970
He cared about results,
not applause,

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:20.350 position:56%
about making the American experiment
and self-government a success

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.490
in realizing the promise
of the revolution.

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:27.380
I was struck by a description
by a long-term colleague

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.610
that under all circumstances, he
was ever mindful of what was due

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:35.450
from him to others and cautious not
to wound the feelings of anyone.

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:38.190
I think many of our leaders
are very mindful of what is due

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:42.780 position:56%
from to them, much less the reverse.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:47.970
I became persuaded also that
many of his great achievements,

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:51.610
really most of them, were the
result of great partnerships.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:55.110
And it was almost as though he
had taken a modern personality

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:58.260 position:56%
assessment, one of these things that
determines whether you're an ISPJ

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:03.430
or an introvert or an extrovert,
and had concluded that he was

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:08.000
in fact short, he was
skinny, he has a small voice

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.810
and he had zero personal magnetism.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:17.780 position:56%
All true. But an honest self
assessment would also have concluded

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.470
that he was smarter than
almost everybody he met.

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:22.650
He had a rear capacity
for hard work.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.830
He had good political
judgment and foresight.

00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:29.850
And he had a gift and that's the
gift in the title of my book.

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:34.670
A gift for working with others
for checking his ego at the door

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:37.260
and making something happen.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:42.290
That gave me the lens to
look at his career as a man

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:45.360
who understood the
power of partnership.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.380
I studied particularly
five partnerships

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.600
because this is a somewhat
condensed program I'm going

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.270
to speed through them.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:58.120
The fifth one I may linger on
for a minute because it was,

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.100
for me, the most interesting.

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:05.840
The first of course was Hamilton
but this was before he could rap.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.660
But he was such a contrast
in character, flashy,

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:12.030
charismatic personality, an
orphan from the West Indies,

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.470
comes with nothing,
incredible talent.

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:19.020
He was good at everything,
he tried soldier,

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:21.900
lawyer, statesman, financier.

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:28.380
And he meets this quiet fellow from
Virginia who's a fortunate son.

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:33.130
His father owns 5,000 acres
of land and 100 slaves.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:37.080
And they connect, this is in
the early 1780's and a Congress

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.820
that was not filled with
distinguished people.

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.610
And they recognized in each
other, I think, two things.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:47.990
One was that they both were
smarter than everybody else.

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:50.120
And that they both were committed

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.640
to making the United
States a great place

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.070
and a great nation in the world.

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.790
They collaborated on the calling

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:04.050
of the convention arguably the
most important step that was taken

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.390
in creating this new government.

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:09.200
And then, at the convention,
Madison had an up

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.310
and down convention as
Marry has described.

00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:14.850
Hamilton had a catastrophic
convention.

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:19.210
He actually gave a speech
that lasted for five hours.

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:21.910
That alone is enough
to cause trouble.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:26.080
But he then, in his speech, argued
in favor of a president for life

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.600
and a Senate that would
serve for life.

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.310
But he came back at the
end of the convention

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:35.320
and announced he would support the
constitution even though no man's

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.960
opinions are more different
from this than mine.

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:42.630
And he's the one who came up with
the idea for the federalist papers

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:47.450
as an advocacy piece to get people
to support the constitution.

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:51.650 position:56%
Because when it was published,
there was much more opposition than,

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:54.370
I think, they had anticipated.

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.330
He tried to recruit
people to help them

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:58.880
with the writing, three
didn't work out.

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.740
He ended up finding-- his
fourth choice was James Madison

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.080
and a brilliant choice it was.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.710
They ended up producing 190,000
words of extraordinary insight.

00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:09.780
Then, they put down
their pens and went off

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.100
and led the ratification fights
in their state conventions.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:16.440
Now, the second alliance

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.180
or partnership was
with George Washington.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.590
He was not a pear, nobody
was a pear of Washington,

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:26.560
I'll quote the great Miranda again.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.240
There's a moment in the show
when George the third learns

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.690
that Washington is resigning,

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:34.160
which he can't believe anybody
would actually give up power.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:37.150
He says, "Can you do that?"

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:41.450
And he hears that John Adams
is going to be his successor

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:46.600
and he says, "Compared to
Washington, they all seem small."

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:54.520
And that was the way our society
had to develop our nation.

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.360
Madison figured out very fast that
if he wanted to have an impact

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.850
on the new nation,
he-- standing close

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.950
to Washington was a great idea.

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:07.290
Washington is famously referred
to as the indispensable man

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:09.380
and Madison made himself
the indispensable man

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.590
to the indispensable man.

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:14.440
He got legislation
that Washington wanted.

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:17.020
He wrote speeches that
Washington needed.

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.410
He famously wrote the inaugural
address that Washington delivers

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:22.830
at the beginning of the government.

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:27.120 position:56%
And there's a wonderful moment then
when Congress receives this address.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.350
It's short, it's very measured,

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:32.330
only asks for one thing,
the Bill of Rights.

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:34.510
And they think, well, we're
setting presidents here,

00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:36.170
we ought to acknowledge the speech.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:39.830
So, they need to come up with
something to say in response.

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:43.110
So, they asked James
Madison to write it.

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:45.730
And then, Washington
gets their response

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:49.310
and he's a courtly Virginian and
he doesn't want to give offense

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.150
so he needs to say
something in replay.

00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:54.080
So, asks Madison to write that.

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.480
So, the early year of the
government is, in many ways,

00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.520
James Madison talking to himself.

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.980
The third partnership
is with Thomas Jefferson

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.440
and that's the one we mostly
think of with Madison.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.740
They were soul mates.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.090
They grow up 30 miles apart.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:14.720
They-- Jefferson was
eight years older

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.370
but they had so much in common.

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:21.230
They were both fortunate
sons with rich fathers.

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:27.170
And I focused on a part of
their relationship which lasted

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:31.340
for 40 years and covered
every subject.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.290
What I focused on was
the achievement, I think,

01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:38.740
they would probably
be least proud of,

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.860
which is creating America's
first political party.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:47.330
This was an era when it was stylish
and necessary for a public figure

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.780
to insist that he really
didn't believe in parties,

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.170
that they were the elements--

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.190
that they were the
instruments of self interest.

01:00:55.190 --> 01:01:02.190
Small minded people were engaged
in factionalism not great leaders.

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:05.830
But Jefferson and Madison
found themselves

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:08.960
with a big problem
in the early 1790's.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.770
Hamilton and his financial
program were being the adopted.

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:16.360
Washington supported them
and did not support Madison

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:21.600
and Jefferson's view that those
financial programs were dangerous

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.710
that they would create a
much more powerful government

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:28.360
than they had intended
or that we should have.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.390
And they needed to oppose it but
they couldn't oppose Washington.

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:38.290
So they began developing what was
originally the republican interest

01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:39.820
in Congress.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.360
Around Madison, he--
like minded Congressman

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.510
and began to gather around him.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:48.450
They then reached out to
political leaders in the states

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:51.200
and ultimately recruited
newspaper editors

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.990
and they formed the Republican
Party by the election of 1796.

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:56.490
They have an actual party.

01:01:56.490 --> 01:02:01.190
In then, in 1800, Jefferson
wins the election.

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:03.580
It's often said that the
true test of a democracy

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:06.420
or a republic is whether you can
have a peaceful transfer of power

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.280
between contending parties.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.660
We passed that test in 1800
with that political party.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:18.240
An externally powerful force
for much of our life as a nation

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.570
but certainly, the first 60 years
from 1800 until the Civil War,

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:24.270
it was the dominant
political party in a way

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:27.190
that we really haven't seen since.

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:32.480
The fourth partnership
was with James Monroe.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.020
Monroe was not somebody
you would ask to write any

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.320
of the federalist papers.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.620
He was a military figure.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.920
I was a little distressed
to find that many

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.570
of his contemporaries
would say of Monroe, "Well,

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:47.940
he's a nice fellow but
he's a little dim."

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.350
And it seemed that Madison

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:54.280
and he had a much more
relaxed relationship with--

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:57.370
the correspondence between
Madison and Jefferson is wonderful,

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.760
it's rich, they talk
about everything.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.590
You know, that design
of hinges and philosophy

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:07.010
and science and some politics.

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:14.440
With Monroe, the subject is
politics and it just feels he--

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.450
Madison doesn't have to work as
hard when he's dealing with Monroe.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:22.730
An interesting feature
of their relationship was

01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:27.570
that they were opponents,
direct opponents twice.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:32.850
First, in a campaign for
the Congress in 1789,

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:36.640
when the first Congress was
elected, Madison was identified

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.170
with the ratification forces.

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:42.820
And the people who opposed
that, principally Patrick Henry

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.060
in Virginia wanted to be Madison.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.730
It was going to be the post--

01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:50.910
he would be the poster child
of the bad constitution.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:55.420
So they recruited this handsome
strapping military veteran,

01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.490
James Monroe to run against him.

01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:00.990
And in an era when people stood
for election rather than run

01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:03.060
for election, and Madison
hated to campaign,

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.060
he really had to campaign
against Monroe.

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:11.030
They went around the district
doing campaign events at churches.

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:16.340
And he did ultimately win
that contest pretty handily.

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.330
But then, 20 years
later they fall out.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:23.460
And I skipped one thing, even
though they opposed each other,

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.640
they pick up their friendship
immediately thereafter

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.570
without any real trouble.

01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:30.970
Twenty years later it
doesn't work that way.

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:33.210
Monroe is in England.

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.500
He's asked to negotiate a
treaty with the British.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:39.100
It's a very tough assignment.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.810
The British and the French are
fighting the Napoleonic Wars,

01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:44.200
it's a duel to the death.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.730
They're both praying on our
shipping and on our sailors

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:51.590
and they could care less about
America, we're military weak.

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:57.580
And so, to try to get some
piece, Jefferson asked Monroe

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.360
to negotiate this treaty.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.630
Monroe spent three years on it,
sends back a terrible treaty.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:05.580
He got nothing.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.610
And Madison and Jefferson
on the first day agreed

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:12.290 position:56%
that they would simply put it in the
files and never speak of it again.

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:18.610
Monroe was mortified and he-- then,
when he comes back to this country

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:23.470 position:56%
in 1908, he allows his name to be
entered as in an opponent of Madison

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:25.950
in the presidential election.

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:32.190
And I could find no trace of
Madison taking any step to campaign

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:35.030 position:56%
for the office of president in 1808.

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:36.340
He must have done something.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.210
I mean, he had to talk
to some people.

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:40.450
It just had to happen.

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:44.230
But with Monroe, you can find
some evidence that he was working

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.800
with a few people on his campaign.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.550
His campaign was really
not a serious matter.

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:50.970
He only got three electoral votes.

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:54.990
But he was bitter and it was a
measure of how bitter he was.

01:05:54.990 --> 01:06:00.480
And for two years, these close
friends for decades did not speak

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.870
and did not have any connection.

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:05.270
They did not correspond.

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:09.380
Ultimately, Madison is-- knows
he's going to end up with a war

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:12.340
with Britain, he needs a
strong secretary of state.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.800
He cannot abide the one he has
a fellow named Robert Smith

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.750
from Maryland who was an
unfortunate public official.

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:22.340
And it was hard to
get fired by Madison.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:28.490 position:56%
But Smith managed too and Madison
at that point reaches out to Monroe.

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:32.770
Recruits him back in to
the family, basically.

01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:36.780
Appoints him secretary of state
and Monroe was a key member

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.560
of his administration,
served as secretary

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.860
of state, secretary of war.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:43.260 position:56%
And for two periods, he served
simultaneously as secretary of state

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:47.550
and secretary of war,
which is unparalleled.

01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:50.570
No on else has ever done that.

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:54.540
Now, the final partnership of
course is with his wife Dolley.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:58.530
You know, I'd like to spend
a minute or two more with her

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:01.760
because she's so much fun.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.330
She was originally Dolley Payne.

01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:09.610
She came from the Virginia
plantation world

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:13.940
but with one big difference
from Madison's background,

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:18.010
her family was Quaker and
when she was a young teenager,

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:22.350
the Quaker meeting in Virginia
decreed that all good members

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:25.510
of the Quaker meeting
would not own slaves.

01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:30.860
So, Mr. Payne freed his slaves and
moved his family to Philadelphia

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:34.680
where he promptly became
a cropper in business.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.670 position:56%
His wife was forced to convert their
house into a boarding house in order

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.940
to keep food on the table.

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:47.930
But Dolley flourished,
she was tall for her time.

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:51.810
She had an hour glass figure, a
mischievous smile, black hair,

01:07:51.810 --> 01:07:55.740
creamy complexion, bright blue
eyes, men liked her a lot.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.270
And I always like to point out
that Madison surely was short

01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:01.680
and he was loosing his
hair and he was skinny.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.120
But of all the frank founders,
he had the hottest wife.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:12.510
Dolley had a first husband,
he and one of their sons died

01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:14.790
in the yellow fever
epidemic of 1793,

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:17.470
leaving her as a single mother.

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:22.690
Madison somehow became aware of her
and fascinated by her, she was--

01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:24.750
she had many suitors not just he.

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:29.070
And you can see her playful
nature and sophistication

01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:32.290
in the letter she writes the
day that Senator Aaron Burr is

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:37.560
to bring Madison over to introduce
him, Burr was actually a lodger

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.970
in Mrs. Payne's boardinghouse.

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:45.450
And Dolley writes that she's going
to meet the great little Madison.

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:48.750
And it's perfect because he was
little but he also was great.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.050
He was rich.

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:51.350
He was intelligent.

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:53.360
He was kind and he was
a political power house.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.260
You could do a lot worse than James
Madison and she understood it.

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:02.660
Writing about Dolley gave me
a chance to see some sides

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.130
of Madison you don't often see.

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:07.980
Let me just mention a couple.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.670
In their first term
in the White House,

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:14.290 position:56%
Dolley's sister Lucy was widowed and
so she moved into the White House

01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:18.810
with her three children and
lived there for three years.

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:22.060
And Madison really enjoyed Lucy
but apparently something he liked

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:26.980
to do was to kiss Dolley in front
of Lucy and turn to Lucy and say,

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:29.680
"Does that make your mouth water?"

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.230 position:56%
It's a little creepy, I'll admit it.

01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:40.070
But, you've never thought about
James Madison that way before.

01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:41.850 position:56%
They never had children of their own

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:44.580
but they were not this
semi-sad childless couple

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.880
that is sometimes imagined.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.370
They had more than 50 nieces and
nephews who often were with them,

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:53.060
which spend weeks and
months living with them.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.970 position:56%
James, although as very dull fellow
in a large setting, was quite lively

01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:02.960
and entertaining in smaller groups
known to tell great anecdotes.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:09.580
Dolley was always fun and it
was always fun with a purpose.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:13.790
They were setting a social
tone for the whole nation.

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:18.700
One of my favorite stories
involves in retirement,

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:23.560
Dolley had grown wider with
the years, James had not.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:27.530 position:56%
And she would load him up on her
back and carry him around the house.

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:32.050
And they ran races on front
portico of Montpellier.

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:34.110
They were fun.

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:39.030
But Dolley was in truth of
political partner as well,

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:43.520 position:56%
she had to be vivacious and
charming and the center of attention

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.900
because James couldn't do it.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.310
And during his presidency,
they would have a couple

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:52.630
of social events a week and she
would started wearing white turbans

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:58.020
of velvet or silk and she would
put flowers in the top or feathers

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.090
or even a piece of fruit.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:03.100
And James would come and
great everybody very soberly

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.620
and work the whole room and
then go off into a corner

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:09.040
with some gentlemen
and talk business.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.500
Dolley would be in the
middle of the room,

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.160
everybody would know who she was.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.740
Everyone would be listening with
one ear to what she was saying.

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:20.810
And she made his career
far more effective.

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:28.420
Indeed, the man who lost
Madison in 1808 wrote

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:32.000
that he had lost to
Mr and Mrs. Madison.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.610
I might have had a better chance
had I faced Mr. Madison alone.

01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:39.770
And Dolley, of course,
is often best remembered

01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:43.580
for saving the Gilbert Stuart
portrait when the British came

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.010
to burn the public
buildings of Washington.

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:50.910
I think, we tend not to appreciate
the importance of that at the time.

01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:53.600
America had no kings,
we had no history,

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.990
the nation was not
even 30 years old.

01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:57.800
What we had was George Washington

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.190
and that Stuart portrait
had been made into prints

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:04.680
and those prints hung
in many American homes.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:08.790 position:56%
And had we lost the Stuart portrait,
it would have been, in fact,

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:11.540
a great blow to American morale,

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:16.220
at a time when having foreign
troops burn our public buildings

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:22.030 position:56%
and our national capital was already
a tremendous blow to our morale.

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:25.040 position:56%
Let me just mention two last things.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.910 position:56%
Mary talked about this and I'm glad.

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:34.370
It's easy for us to get
lost in sort of wonder

01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:36.950
of his times and his achievements.

01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:39.200
But I think it is important
for us never to forget

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.690
that he was a slave
holder for 85 years.

01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:47.510
The question tortured him.

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:50.880
He understood completely the
hypocrisy between what he said

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.480
in terms of being committed to
human liberty and the way he lived.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.780
As a young man, he bought land
up in Mohawk Valley of New York

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.080
and wrote a friend that he hope

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.120
to live there never relying
on the labor of others.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.420
He never did it.

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.610
I think it was awfully comfortable
having those hundreds slaves

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:13.380
and Virginia gave him an
amazing political platform.

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.580
Jefferson was a neighbor,
Washington was a fellow countryman.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.500
It was the biggest
state in the union.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.680
But then, in his retirement
years, again,

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.890
with sort of a nascent
abolition movement,

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:29.000
he became tortured
by this issue more.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.380
He wrote memos to himself about,
which was something he did,

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:38.600
about how he might sell off all the
lands out west and use the money

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.500
to buy slaves out of bondage
and ship them somewhere else.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:46.070
They were all a pipe
dream but it was a measure

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:51.830
of what he really did understand
was unfinished business in his life

01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:56.670
and a permanent mark on his legacy.

01:13:56.670 --> 01:14:00.700
And I have talked a good bit
about his partnerships of course,

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:06.390
but I'd like to close by
focusing again on Madison himself.

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:11.700
He is often portrayed as
this disembodied intellect.

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.470
But I do think his greatest
qualities were his genuineness

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:17.110
and integrity and modesty
and open-heartedness.

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:21.420
That's what all these
different partners found in him.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.460
And I thought that
those qualities shown

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.950
through in the way he received
the news of the Treaty of Ghent

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:29.540
that ended the War of 1812.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.320
It's in February of 1815, he's
living in the Octagon House

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:37.330
over on 17th street because of
course, the White House was burned.

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:42.240
And a rumor arrives that a treaty
has been signed with Britain.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.010
A Pennsylvania senator
rushes to the Octagon House

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:47.080
to ask the president if it's true.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:52.940
Let me just read a couple
of sentence from the book.

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:56.490
"The senator found the house dark,
the president sitting solitary

01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:59.420
in his parlor, in perfect
tranquility,

01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:01.850
not even a servant in waiting.

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:04.740
The senator asked if
the rumor was true.

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.300
Madison bade him sit down.

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:10.390
"I will tell you all I know,"
he said, then confirmed

01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:14.770 position:56%
that he thought there was peace,
but he had no official confirmation.

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:16.570
The senator recalled
with some wonder,

01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:21.540
what he called the president's self
command, and greatness of mind.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.690
The world of 1812 had truly
been Mr. Madison's war

01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:26.940
as his opponents called it.

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.450
It was about principles not gain.

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:33.420
It was fought with a quiet
tenacity often ineptly,

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:38.050
and with endless tolerance
of those who opposed it.

01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.760
A friend of Madison's
wrote years later,

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.780
that the war had been
conducted in perfect keeping

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.420 position:56%
with the character of the president.

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:49.670
And when peace came, Madison
welcomed it a darkened house,

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.910
sitting alone with his thoughts."

01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:53.710
Thank you.

01:15:53.710 --> 01:16:00.950
[ Applause ]

01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:02.250
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:04.790
Shaffer: Well, this has been an
extraordinary morning for me.

01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:11.300 position:56%
I have learned so much about Madison
beyond what I knew as a young child

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.470
that he was the first one to
think about creating a library

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:21.520
for Congress at the
Continental Congress in 1783.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.330
And then also that of course,
he was the sitting president

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:28.460
when we purchased Jefferson's
books and I always believed--

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:33.150
and John Cole, the library's
phenomenal historian can correct me

01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:36.500
for posterity, but I think the
must have had a role in that.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:41.070
But I've learned so much including
David when the origination

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:44.990
of power couple came
into being in Washington.

01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:49.740 position:56%
So, that was just a fabulous morning
to learn more about Jefferson--

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:52.310
excuse me, about Madison--

01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:53.760
&gt;&gt; That always happeneds.

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.060
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.360
Shaffer: I know.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.060
They're so much alike, they get
confused all the time, in fact,

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.010
some people call this
the Jefferson building.

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:05.910
It's just terrific to
learn from both of you

01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:10.270
about really Madison much more
the man and his, you know,

01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:12.350
positives and some negatives.

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:15.880
And maybe we'll be more
forgiving of our leaders

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.350
of today knowing that as well.

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:21.180
We do have a little bit
of time for questions

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.930
and we do have a roving microphone.

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:27.350
Your question will be recorded,
the session was recorded

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:31.420
so please be aware of that
as you ask a question.

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:34.850
And just raise your hand and
a microphone will come to you.

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.150
This person right here.

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:43.420
&gt;&gt; Let me see.

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:52.650
Dr. Bilder mentioned that in the
notes, Madison had in his notes one

01:17:52.650 --> 01:17:58.020
of the significant pages on which
you-- he wrote a lot of footnotes

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:03.870
and a lot of-- all around
the page was an apology

01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:07.550
for his position regarding
an autocratic president

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:11.750
who would serve for
an indefinite term.

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:16.070
And then, David Stewart mentioned
that same thing about Hamilton

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:19.220
that in his five-hour
speech proposed this

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:21.210
and it was not well received.

01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:24.770
I'm wondering if you could--
I'm curious to understand why--

01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:31.170
what was the thinking behind their
belief that this was a good form

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:34.650
of a good aspect of
the government to have,

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:37.770
a president who would serve
without a definite term?

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:40.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder:
Well, I'll start and then--

01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:44.410
and David who wrote but also
in his first book can chip in.

01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:51.000
There-- Hamilton gives this great
speech, this long speech in June

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.360
and people have different
interpretations about it.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.490
Did he really mean it
or did he not mean it.

01:18:56.490 --> 01:19:03.560
I believe it was a strategy,
at that time, the national plan

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.530
that had been proposed by the
Virginians was under attack

01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:12.930
by the small states who wanted
a very weak-- a weak plan.

01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:18.210
And I think my own view on this
is that Hamilton basically agreed

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:25.260
to walk in and give a speech
that suggested that the--

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.660
that there could be
a far worse plan.

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:29.730
And Hamilton's plan was
actually never adopted.

01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:33.150
He never introduced it formally,
he just spoke and if you look

01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:35.710
at the plan that was
recorded by Madison,

01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:38.090
Hamilton went out of his
way to make everything

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:41.020
like as extreme as possible.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.450
So, I think in a funny way,

01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:44.550
I don't know if people
remember a very fine book

01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:47.160
by political scientist
Graham Allison,

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.780
that argues that policy
makers inevitably move

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:54.020
to the B position once presented
with an A and C. And so,

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:58.500
I happen to believe that
Hamilton created a C position

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:02.100
under which the national
plan became seen as moderate.

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.940
I think that was plausible because
Hamilton was from that world

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.540
and he did want strong power.

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.050
So, I think that explains
Hamilton's position, I--

01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:15.520
you know, there was no
president in the western world

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:18.870
so they were trying to figure out
what a president would look like

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:24.270
and they were really wrestling with
this incredibly difficult notion

01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:27.990 position:56%
of how did you get the president
elected and then allow the president

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.770
to be independent of control.

01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:34.020
And at that time, they assumed
the president would be elected

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:36.610
by Congress and that the
senate would be elected

01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:38.120
by the state legislators.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.310
So, for Madison, the anxiety
is that the president is going

01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:44.490
to become a man totally
of the state legislatures.

01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:51.600
And so, at that moment he, I think,
votes strategically thinking,

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.820
arguably maybe this would
be better but more likely

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.580
that it would shock
people into trying

01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:01.130
to think how you make the
president more independent.

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:04.770
And it's still a really
difficult question.

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:07.370
So, in some ways, I think
they're both moments

01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:09.210
where there's strategic moments.

01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:13.640
But David's also written about
particularly the Hamilton part.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:14.940
&gt;&gt; David O. Stewart: Yeah.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:19.510
Hamilton may have been
interested in the strategic notion

01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:23.900
that it would terrify the
state's rights people.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:27.850
But I do think it was
what he believed in.

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:30.270
I think he did believe
it was critical

01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:36.020
to have a powerful executive,
an independent executive

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.110
and both Hamilton and Madison
worried about stability.

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:44.850
It's a point on which
Madison often disagreed

01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:48.730
with Jefferson, one of the few.

01:21:48.730 --> 01:21:51.890
And Madison cared about stability.

01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:57.320
So, my reading of Hamilton's
moment in the convention

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.390
and his later behavior
where he basically leaves

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:04.160
because he's being denounced,
many other delegates talked

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:08.750
about what a dopey
idea his speech was.

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:12.000
And his fellow New York
delegates have also left

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.300
that he just can't be much
of a contributor anymore.

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:19.500
So, he comes back for couple
weeks later but he's mostly gone

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.880
after that-- maybe a
week after the speech.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:27.750
So, I see it as much more what
Hamilton really would have liked.

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:33.910
For Madison, I think it was a
mistake, he may have been sort

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:37.110
of peeved, as Maria suggested.

01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:40.310
It's wonderful in his
notes he says what--

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:43.390
and it's sort of embarrassing,
I shouldn't say wonderful.

01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:46.710
He says, "Well Dr.
McClurg recommended it."

01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:50.590 position:56%
Who was a very obscure member of
the Virginia delegation and I wanted

01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:53.060
to sort of support Dr. McClurg.

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:56.590
And he makes a big point that
Washington did not support it

01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:57.890
in order to protect Washington.

01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:01.750
This is in, you know, he's
writing the notes years later.

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:10.720
But I think in that moment,
he goofed, he made a mistake.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:20.000
And that's much more how
I'm inclined to read it.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.300
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.740
Shaffer: Any other questions?

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:28.310
Yes, right here.

01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:32.180
&gt;&gt; Well, as you say
that Madison, you know,

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:36.730
they probably at the time didn't
realize how impactful this document

01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:39.570
would be but-- and this
may not be a fair question,

01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:44.560 position:56%
but can you speculate, either of you
or both on what Madison would make

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.930
of the arguments of
original interpretation

01:23:48.930 --> 01:23:54.190
versus the constitution being
a living breathing document?

01:23:54.190 --> 01:23:56.890
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: You
know, I think one of the things

01:23:56.890 --> 01:24:02.730 position:56%
that probably interests a lot people
who've worked on this is you--

01:24:02.730 --> 01:24:08.600 position:56%
is at the very moment they finished
the constitution, they already began

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.430
to disagree over what it meant.

01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:13.290
So, I believe there is no moment

01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:16.330
when the constitution
is not contested.

01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:20.400
The debates over ratification
were basically different ways

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.810
of reading the constitution.

01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:25.450
And Madison was fascinated in this.

01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:29.440 position:56%
There's a great debate in the very
beginning of the very first Congress

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.470
over the question since
the Senate has

01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:35.530
to prove the presidential
appointments,

01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:37.790
how do you remove presidential
appointments?

01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:39.390
Does the Senate get
involved in that?

01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:42.430 position:56%
Or does the president-- it's
something called the removal debate.

01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:46.550
And Madison writes letter
after letter to people.

01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:50.690
This is great and wonderful and
the document doesn't say anything

01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:54.220 position:56%
and there's these four positions and
how are we going to figure it out.

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.570
And so, I think-- and at the time

01:24:56.570 --> 01:25:00.040
in the first Congress some
people argue they ought

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.260
to follow what the people
of the convention said.

01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:05.460
And actually, most of the people
of the convention say, "No,

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.960
don't follow what we said,
let's think this through,"

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.250
because the document
is already ambiguous.

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:17.620
So, I think my own view is that
they built a document deliberately

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:22.610
broadly so that it would have
more power than the articles

01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:24.510
of confederation which
had written itself

01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:27.180
out of existence within
the first decade.

01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:29.160
So, that would be my own view.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.100
I don't know what David's
going to say.

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.680
&gt;&gt; David O. Stewart: Well,
that's exciting, isn't it?

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.980
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Yes.

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.280
I can guess.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.280
&gt;&gt; David O. Stewart: I've never
understood the originalist position

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:45.480 position:56%
very well as a litigator, I wouldn't
look at the constitutional provision

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.220 position:56%
and if it was clear, I didn't have a
law-- then I didn't have a law suit.

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.880
And if it wasn't clear, then I
could go in and argue about it.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.790
And if it's not clear well then,
we don't have an original position.

01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:59.450
So, you know, if the case gets to
the Supreme Court it's not clear.

01:25:59.450 --> 01:26:04.200
There was a wonderful exchange
in an argument a few years back

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:09.980 position:56%
over violent video games and Justice
Scalia was hammering some poor

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:14.740
lawyer about, you know, what did
James Madison think of, you know--

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:20.960 position:56%
and Justice Alito broke in and said,
"Council, what Justice Scalia wants

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:26.530
to know is what was James Madison's
position on violent video games."

01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:28.720
The world has changed.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.580
You just can't have
this frozen thing

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:34.170
and we never have as Mary said.

01:26:34.170 --> 01:26:37.960
So, it's a puzzle to me.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.580
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:45.760
Shaffer: Seeing no other questions,
I'm going to invite you once again

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:50.840
to our cake reception in Madison
Hall this afternoon at 1 o'clock.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.660
I hope you will come to that.

01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:55.530
But more importantly, I
actually hope that everyone

01:26:55.530 --> 01:26:59.250 position:56%
in the room particularly, the people
who work at the Library of Congress,

01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:03.790
will be in this building often
and will be very proud to be here.

01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:06.550
And for those of you
who do not work here,

01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:10.250
I hope you will visit the
library physically or virtually.

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:13.260
We count virtually
also so don't worry

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:16.030
if you come virtually,
it's not hurting us.

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:20.050
And in fact, we are delighted
that technology that, I guess,

01:27:20.050 --> 01:27:24.740
Madison did not have the benefit
of, enables us to reach greater

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.120
and greater audiences everyday
with more and more materials

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.770
and more sophisticated
technology because as I think,

01:27:31.770 --> 01:27:34.400
everyone in this room knows,
in addition to Madison

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:40.500
and the other presidents, we have
just the most incredible asset here

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.920
that any asset could ever be.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.000
And that is the asset of knowledge.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.330 position:56%
So please enjoy the rest of the day.

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:50.650
Have an easy journey
wherever it is that you have

01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:52.740
to go after this morning.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:57.320
And we thank you so much for coming
today knowing that it's never easy

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.630
in Washington to get around.

01:27:58.630 --> 01:28:01.780
But this morning was a
real, real challenge.

01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:05.510
Thank you very, very much
and thank our speakers.

01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:08.630
[ Applause ]

01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:12.290

of the Library of Congress.
