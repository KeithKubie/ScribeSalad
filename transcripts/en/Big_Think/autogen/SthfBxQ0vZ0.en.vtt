00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.900
So somewhere in all of this studying the biology
behavior, somewhere in there when you’re

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.000
realizing activity levels in this part of
the brain one second before this act: what

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.520
you had for breakfast all the way back to
like what culture your ancestors evolved to—All

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.010
of these are influencing your behavior.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.630
Most of these variables we’re not even aware
of.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.630
They’re subliminal.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.030
We never would have expected it.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.520
Inevitably somewhere in there you’ve got
to sit down and start having the Free Will

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.520
Discussion.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.530
So is there any free will in there?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.421
And the polite thing that I’ve sort of said
for decades is that “Well, if there is free

00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:53.219
will, it’s in all the boring places, and
those places are getting more and more cramped.”

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.370
If you want to insist that today you decided
to floss your teeth starting on your upper

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.760
teeth rather than your lower teeth, rather
than the other way around, that that is an

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.990
act of free will—Whatever, I’ll grant
that one to you.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.840
That’s where the free will is.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.880
In reality I don’t think there’s any free
will at all.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.330
If you look at the things that come into account
as to whether or not someone is going to do

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.400
the right thing in the next two seconds amid
a temptation to do otherwise, the variables

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.350
in there reflect everything from whether they’re
having gas pains that day because of something

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.900
unpleasant they ate that morning—That makes
us more selfish, more impulsive, et cetera—to

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.790
what epigenetic effects occurred to them when
they were a first trimester fetus.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.320
When you look at the number of things we recognize
now that are biological—organic—where

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.381
500 years ago or five years ago we would have
had a harsh moral judgment about it.

00:01:56.381 --> 00:02:00.180
Instead we now know oh, that’s a biological
phenomenon.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.340
When we look at that, either we can say the
last 500 years of realizing all of this biology

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.390
is going to stop right here and there’s
never going to be a new piece of knowledge

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.650
in that area—Yeah, there’s areas of behavior
we still can’t explain biologically.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.530
But if all you can do is see the logical direction
we’re going with that is what we’re going

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.249
to get to the point is recognizing yeah, we’re
biological organisms.

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:31.329
This notion of free will, for want of a less
provocative word, is nothing but a myth.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.730
What’s going to be really challenging though
is to figure out how you structure a society

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.959
that actually runs humanely built around the
notion that we are merely biological organisms.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.980
And that one I haven’t a clue.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.860
If someone tells me, you know, “Oh, nice
shirt you’re wearing today,” and I say

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.920
“Oh gee, thanks!”

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.220
I’ve just shown that on some fundamental
level I have trouble accepting there’s no

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.260
such thing as free will.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.930
No: actually I picked this shirt today because
the culture I come from has these values and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.519
my visual, you know, color receptors told
me that this shirt matches with this.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.180
You know you still have a reflex to attribute
some sort of free will and sort of tiny little

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.180
domains.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.340
If that’s going to prove horrible and too
difficult to overcome, that’s fine.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.700
Where we need to do the heavy lifting is when
we’re making judgments about volition in

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.420
areas where we harshly judge people.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.260
There we really have to do the hard work of
thinking through that there’s not a lot

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.419
of free will going on there.
