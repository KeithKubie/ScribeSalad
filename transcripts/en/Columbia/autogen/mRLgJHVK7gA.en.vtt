don't conceding so much ground now what
 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.420
don't conceding so much ground now what
is interesting is on the one hand we

this discourse about immigration as a

that by the right and now our division

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740
that by the right and now our division
 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.959
that by the right and now our division
between the two is quite unclear to me

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:21.969
between the two is quite unclear to me
 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:26.429

so this evolution of the right makes

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:26.439
so this evolution of the right makes
 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:28.469
so this evolution of the right makes
sense in fact they're talking about race

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479
sense in fact they're talking about race
 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.059
sense in fact they're talking about race
they are talking about national identity

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:30.069
they are talking about national identity
 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:32.819
they are talking about national identity
but we know that national identity means

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:32.829
but we know that national identity means
 

00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:36.449

2007 50 made it very easy to understand

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:44.799
2007 50 made it very easy to understand
 

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:47.069
2007 50 made it very easy to understand
that was us versus them and there was a

that was us versus them and there was a
 

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:50.489
that was us versus them and there was a
racialization of them then of course we

00:07:50.489 --> 00:07:50.499
racialization of them then of course we
 

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:54.749
racialization of them then of course we
meet all kinds of people oh and us only

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:54.759
meet all kinds of people oh and us only
 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.709

meant us white people implicitly and
 

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:01.919
meant us white people implicitly and
we're more explicitly now this

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:01.929
we're more explicitly now this
 

00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:04.649
we're more explicitly now this
racialization of the so called

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:04.659

immigration issue is not specific to the
 

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:10.229
immigration issue is not specific to the
right I think the reason why we can

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:10.239
right I think the reason why we can
 

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:11.879
right I think the reason why we can
worry about what's going on price today

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:11.889
worry about what's going on price today
 

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:15.209
worry about what's going on price today
and this I think introduces a difference

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:15.219
and this I think introduces a difference
 

00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:17.339
and this I think introduces a difference
with the American situation is that

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:17.349
with the American situation is that
 

00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:19.529
with the American situation is that
accommodation would race place

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:19.539
accommodation would race place
 

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:23.459
accommodation would race place
differently and in particular now we can

differently and in particular now we can
 

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.950
differently and in particular now we can
look at

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960
look at
 

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.570
look at
French situation you see that so the

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:28.580
French situation you see that so the
 

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.889
French situation you see that so the
