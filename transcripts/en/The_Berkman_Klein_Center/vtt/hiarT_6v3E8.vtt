00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So the fourth of our Beta Sprints to be presented,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
John Butler and Wendy Lougee will describe enhanced discovery

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
through open linked data and crowd sourcing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I don't know if it's possible for one of the presenters at some

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
point to give a sentence or two on open linked data...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We're going to move to more of a conceptual model here.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Very targeted in the area of government publications from

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
content and services point of view.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is a project a collaborative project that is being

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
put forth by University of Minnesota, by HathiTrust,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we have here present its -- members from the trust,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and we have the community -- committee of cooperative --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Mark Sandler, the director of the CIC.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This is a flatter presentation, particularly following the Harvard presentation.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Great job, guys.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So the idea here is to create a critical mass of content

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
valued and in demand by the community

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and build context sensitive

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and need of services around it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we do this by proposing innovative

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and scalable approaches using HathiTrust as a real-life test bed.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
As the larger -- largest publisher of information in the world,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
-- as the largest publisher of information in the world,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the federal government provides key information resources

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that encompass all aspects of US history and culture

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and the development of access and discovery

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
processes that enhance how citizens work with their government.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Because the information resides primarily in the realm of the public domain.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You can see obvious opportunities for exploiting this information.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We anticipate that government information will be a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
significant part of the DPLA.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So I'm going to start here with content.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The amassing of large-scale content.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Since 2009, it's a comprehensive of approach to amassing these documents.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Using a framework of digitization,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
facilitated by Google and others. The accessing

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and archiving of this content by HathiTrust,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and corresponding print management strategies bringing

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
together four regional depositories.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And just to note that we have the opportunity through the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Google work here to share these digital files.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The status of this is that we're seeking a potential

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
digitization target of these printed documents of 1.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
5 to $2 million and therefore,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
we have thus far I think in existence 300,000 in HathiTrust digitized by CIC

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and an additional  200,000+ by other Google partners.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We recognize the challenges here of accurate identification of these government publications.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The sourcing of the documents and their corresponding metadata,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and the enhancing of this digital corpus by useful

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
services, and that's largely what this project is about.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The HathiTrust held its first Constitutional convention

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
this past weekend or the weekend before ,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and one of the ballots that passed was to initiate a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
timing process for a business model

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and operational plans for the creation of the complete

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
government couple of publications.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
That's it's really quite well with this proposal.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Moving on to these services,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
contextualized services around government publications.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We've been working with a community of government

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
publications libraries to identify what would be the most valued services?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
One is to deal with the problem of US government,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
department and agency name changes,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
as you encounter that confusion

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and chaos in searching and navigation

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and the second really is to provide some sense making in

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
terms of legislative histories. That is,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
how do we link these documents together in some kind of genealogical fashion?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So we propose to use concepts of linked data.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
To deal with both.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But primarily with the name agency changes.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Is example you see some of the variants of the US Coast

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Guard including the life-saving service preceding name,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and the reverse cover service and on work.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
-- cutter. When a user searches for Coast Guard,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
our were they aware of these changes over time?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Troubling not. We are seeking to use linked data

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and RDF triples to move away from that concept didn't

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
insert -- in terms of soul research and retrieval

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and leveraging the relationships between one data store

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
of bibliographic data and existing external

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
or internal data stores were name authority changes can be better managed.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And so there are a growing number of data aware stores out there.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Including the library of comment -- Library of Congress,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the virtual international Authority file, and so forth,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
these are just waiting to be tapped in order to create

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
on-the-fly relationships between documents

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and information service -- objects that reside in one

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
place and that of another.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And here's a little bit of flow how we might imagine this working with the HathiTrust.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Moving from a catalogue heading,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
using an RDF triple that relates one entity object in HathiTrust

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
or information point  to that where it exists in another

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
data store and returning a related name,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
a related piece of information based on the request.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It could be presented back to the user on-the-fly.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It could also be used to enhance records

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
or enhance queries that the user would be conducting within the search engine.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And here's an example of how that might actually play out

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
in the user interface. Searching for US Coast Guard,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
a touch to these other data or services,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
they deal with the variants names preceding

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and following names. And either by explicit

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
or implicit inclusion of these alternate names,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
could be embedded in the search without the user having

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
awareness of those three nations.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The other objects of our project is to make sense out of legislative histories here,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and this is probably the least ugliest slide that I could find.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We hear a lot about sausage making with legislative

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
histories, and it really is the case here.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
This is a daunting challenge here as we look at the find. relationships again,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
the key to this project is building relationships between information objects, documents and such.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
How do we do that with legislative histories?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Here's the simplified version of that. Hard to read here, but again,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we see this as a combination of algorithm that proper --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
approaches, clustering documents, public Law numbers,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and interventions by the professional government

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
publications community as well as possibly end-users

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
understood and editorial controls.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And those are the interventions thereby tagging

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
or perhaps even the intervention of these -- the creation

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
of these RDF triple users.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And the keyword search that would help us a stack these

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
documents up in some kind of related history.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So just to wrap up here again,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
we're talking about the continued a massive of government

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
obligations content on which we can create, build, interesting and useful services.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And finally, again, this is the front slide here.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Our proposal was submitted as a short video,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
the URL is there. I don't know if it's Obama blog site,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
John. I know we put it up on the wiki site as well.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
That's another resource for that. Thank you.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Excellent, John, thank you.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Applause]

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I have a hunch that my friend -- my friend Carl would like to say something.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I will send the mic in his direction.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I have a question.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You say you're authorized to share those government documents with the government,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
with the government printing office.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
One is, do you feel at all interested in getting access?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And can you share those documents with other groups such

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
as public resource or in the archives

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
or commercial operations or whatever?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
To this point,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
there is no interest from the government office.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
That's been expressed. To that second question,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Google's willingness to share with other partners, --

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Really the discussion we had with Google was specific to

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
GPO. And you know, I guess always go back

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and talk about that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I think it would just be -- what's the nature of the

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
vision that someone wants -- for which someone wants to

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
use these documents? I wouldn't foreclose it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Our specific escutcheon with them was that.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Okay. Other comments on this?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Yes, Sir?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
As the mic goes along,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I would say the GPO would be a wonderful part or in this as well.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I'm not sure if someone is here from GPO,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but we welcome participation..

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I'm a retired vice president of a digital company,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and my response ability was in government documents but I

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
want to comment a little bit on the difficulties that

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Mark and his colleagues have alluded to.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
If you consider that congressional committees are either

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
standing committees or standing committees,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
the standing committees are fairly long-term,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and they're seldom more than 100 of them.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
They're not internal, even though -- not eternal.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
But the special committees are completely different thing.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Either select committees -- special committees,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
there have been over 6000 of them in American history so far.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And the names of these special or select committees

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
often do not appear on the reports

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
or documents themselves.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
They'll have some kind of a name,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
but it will be a crucial role,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
like a committee of that part of the president's message

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
of the third instinct.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Now comes the real name is locatable in the House

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
or Senate Journal for that session,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
but it doesn't appear in the document itself.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It's not something that ever could be extracted by full

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
search. Requires research I through cataloging

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
or some other form of intense research to get it straight.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So all of this is by way of saying perhaps,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
it can be a very, very complicated process.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Thank you. Acknowledged. Awesome.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I think we're going to move on, but any response to this?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I think we recognize the complexity of these problems, and in fact,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that's what's inspiring us to try to do -- chip away at

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
it with some scalable methodologies here.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
But fully acknowledge these are very complex information

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
structures, if they exist at all.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Fantastic, team, thank you so much.
