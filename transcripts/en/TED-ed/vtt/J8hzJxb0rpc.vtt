00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:08.802
The World Wide Web,

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.636
where you're likely watching this video,

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:13.251
is used by millions of people every day

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.211
for everything from

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:15.335
checking the weather,

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:16.404
ordering food,

00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:17.218
and chatting with friends

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:18.305
to raising funds,

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:19.322
sharing news,

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.125
or starting revolutions.

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.328
We use it from our computers, our phones, even our cars.

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:25.496
It's just there,

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:27.050
all around us, all the time.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.717
But what is it exactly?

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:32.051
Well first of all, the World Wide Web is not the Internet,

00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:34.905
even though the terms are often used interchangeably.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.607
The Internet is simply the way computers connect to each other

00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:39.470
in order to share information.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.145
When the Internet first emerged,

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:44.161
computers actually made direct calls to each other.

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.426
Today, networks are all around us,

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:49.023
so computers can communicate seamlessly.

00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:50.757
The communication enabled through the Internet

00:00:50.757 --> 00:00:51.855
has many uses,

00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:54.805
such as email, file transfer, and conferencing.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:56.192
But the most common use

00:00:56.192 --> 00:00:57.995
is accessing the World Wide Web.

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:00.607
Think of the Web as a bunch of skyscrapers,

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:02.533
each representing a web server,

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.618
a computer always connected to the Internet,

00:01:05.618 --> 00:01:08.449
specifically designed to store information and share it.

00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:10.138
When someone starts a website,

00:01:10.138 --> 00:01:12.694
they are renting a room in this skyscraper,

00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:14.241
filling it with information

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.942
and linking that information together

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.869
in an organized way for others to access.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.646
The people who own these skyscrapers

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.033
and rent space in them

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:23.368
are called web hosts,

00:01:23.368 --> 00:01:24.887
but anyone can set up a web server

00:01:24.887 --> 00:01:27.200
with the right equipment a bit of know-how.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.156
There's another part to having a website,

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.992
without which we would be lost in the city

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:33.426
with no way of finding what we need.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.061
This is the website address,

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.664
which consists of domain names.

00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:38.397
Just like with a real life address,

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.326
a website address lets you get where you want to go.

00:01:41.326 --> 00:01:43.199
The information stored in the websites

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:44.737
is in web languages,

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.869
such as HTML and JavaScript.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.775
When we find the website we're looking for,

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.033
our web browser is able to take all the code on the site

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:55.084
and turn it into words, graphics, and videos.

00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:57.532
We don't need to know any special computer languages

00:01:57.532 --> 00:02:01.320
because the web browser creates a graphic interface for us.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.783
So, in a lot of ways,

00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:05.283
the World Wide Web is a big virtual city

00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:06.893
where we communicate with each other

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.259
in web languages,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.618
with browsers acting as our translators.

00:02:10.618 --> 00:02:12.866
And just like no one owns a city,

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.332
no one owns the Web;

00:02:14.332 --> 00:02:15.949
it belongs to all of us.

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.785
Anyone can move in and set up shop.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:19.840
We might have to pay an Internet service provider

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.474
to gain access,

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.368
a hosting company to rent web space,

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:25.865
or a registrar to reserve our web address.

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.948
Like utility companies in a city,

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.984
these companies provide crucial services,

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:31.366
but in the end,

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:32.986
not even they own the Web.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.823
But what really makes the Web so special

00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:36.617
lies in its very name.

00:02:36.617 --> 00:02:37.950
Prior to the Web,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.533
we used to consume most information

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.027
in a linear fashion.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.863
In a book or newspaper article,

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:45.284
each sentence was read from beginning to end,

00:02:45.284 --> 00:02:46.832
page by page,

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:49.533
in a straight line until you reached the end.

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.572
But that isn't how our brains actually work.

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:53.865
Each of our thoughts is linked to other thoughts,

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:55.574
memories, and emotions

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:58.611
in a loose interconnected network, like a web.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:01.315
Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the World Wide Web,

00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:04.517
understood that we needed a way to organize information

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.852
that mirrored this natural arrangement.

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.618
And the Web accomplishes this through hyperlinks.

00:03:09.618 --> 00:03:11.890
By linking several pages within a website

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.163
or even redirecting you to other websites

00:03:14.163 --> 00:03:16.950
to expand on information or ideas immediately

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.450
as you encounter them,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.524
hyperlinks allow the Web

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:22.516
to operate along the same lines as our thought patterns.

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:24.663
The Web is so much a part of our lives

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:26.516
because in content and structure,

00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:28.683
it reflects both the wider society

00:03:28.683 --> 00:03:30.807
and our individual minds.

00:03:30.807 --> 00:03:32.571
And it connects those minds

00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:34.266
across all boundaries,

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:36.182
not only enthnicity, gender, and age

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:37.812
but even time and space.
