00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:09.606
&gt;&gt;Good afternoon.

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:12.636
Welcome to the culminating
event of Fading Footprints.

00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:16.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's a big day for King
Middle School's seventh-grade class.

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.486
It's the day they present
their class project,

00:00:19.826 --> 00:00:24.486
a CD-ROM featuring Maine's endangered
species, to an audience of parents,

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.346
teachers, and experts at
Portland's Audubon Society.

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.636
&gt;&gt;Boy: First we took research
on the Internet and stuff,

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:35.036
and then after that, we had to
format it right, doing drafts.

00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:40.386
It took me about 10
drafts to get this right.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:43.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Producing the CD
was an ambitious undertaking,

00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:46.396
especially for a school that
serves the most ethnically

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:49.286
and economically diverse
population in the state,

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:54.816
a school where 28 different
languages are spoken and 60 percent

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:57.586
of students qualify for
free and reduced lunch.

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:03.236
But it's just one of a series

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.776
of impressive productions
the school has turned out,

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:08.266
byproducts of a curriculum
designed to bring

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.236
out the best in every student.

00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:14.556
&gt;&gt;Right now, if I was in a
moat, I would become very ill.

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:15.306
A moat is very polluted.

00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:17.346
&gt;&gt;Scott: The model that we
use is expeditionary learning,

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:21.716
outward-bound, so it
focuses on hands-on learning.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.256
We try to integrate science,
social studies, math,

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:27.786
and English with technology,
with artwork,

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:31.236
with community members,
fieldwork, etc.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Fading Footprints
CD includes a student-made video

00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:36.876
that illustrates the
production process.

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:38.866
&gt;&gt;For the Fading Footprints kickoff,

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:41.456
David Sparks came in
and brought animals.

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:44.836
He talked about the animals'
habitat and how they survive.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.566
Then we started our
research using our laptops.

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:49.486
&gt;&gt;Scott: We don't use
textbooks, per se.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:52.716
The students can sit here right on
their computers with the air ports,

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:55.246
and we can do a lot of our
research right here in class.

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:58.096
&gt;&gt;We were also using our
library and many books to try

00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:01.766
to find some information, and
Internet, we use our laptops a lot.

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:04.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Through digital
production, students learn

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:10.836
to collaborate and contribute
their many different talents.

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:13.646
In music class, they recorded
soundtracks for the CD.

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:18.846
In art, they painted
scientifically accurate watercolors

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:21.106
of their animals.

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:22.966
&gt;&gt;It talks about fieldwork,
and they're out

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:24.876
and they're playing
with other fishes.

00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:28.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And in video-production
class, they made the movie

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:29.936
about the making of the CD.

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:34.096
&gt;&gt;On our winter walk, we learned
about how animals and plants survive

00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:36.236
in Maine's harsh climate.

00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:39.546
&gt;&gt;David: We're looking at ways for
students to deepen their knowledge

00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:40.886
and work with their own knowledge

00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:43.096
so that they can become the
authors of their own learning.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:46.996
All schools should be making
things with their students

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:49.586
that force the students to
show us what they've learned,

00:02:49.976 --> 00:02:53.846
and it's in the making of things
that kids actually do their learning.

00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:56.536
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To give their
products professional polish,

00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:58.996
the school has connected
with local businesspeople,

00:02:58.996 --> 00:03:01.476
like print-shop owner
Philip Rhinelander.

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:04.296
&gt;&gt;Now, would these students
take a particular species

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:06.466
and concentrate on that?

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:06.756
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:10.796
&gt;&gt;The focus started with just
helping them print the newsletter,

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:13.356
and then it turned out, "Gee,
wouldn't it be wonderful

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:14.966
if every kid could take home a book?"

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:17.766
And so we were able to help
them by donating those.

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:21.596
And then we find our
relationship with them is so good

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:23.226
that they'll come in,
"We need CD covers."

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:24.586
"Sure, we'll do them for you."

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:26.866
It's a synergy that just
seems to have come together.

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:29.556
To be part of that is very exciting.

00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:30.976
&gt;&gt;So, we have Kayla filming,

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:33.546
and we have like three
angles of her filming.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:37.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school has also hired
an accomplished documentary filmmaker

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:39.746
to help students improve
the quality of their work.

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:43.286
&gt;&gt;Huey: My mission is to
show them how to make,

00:03:43.286 --> 00:03:47.056
I guess you'd say good movies, movies
that rise above just being imitations

00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:48.366
of everything they've seen.

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:51.456
&gt;&gt;I think what matters more is
what the flow of the video is.

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:53.686
&gt;&gt;Huey: Having an audience,
I think, is great.

00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:55.516
I mean, it puts you on the line.

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:58.796
It's not just like, "Well,
I meant to do this," or,

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:01.666
"I was going to do this,"
or, "If you let me tell you,

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:03.036
you can really understand it."

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:07.176
So I think that is an interesting
part of the educational component

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:10.316
of this, and hearkens back
to this thing of quality.

00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:11.556
You want to stand up there.

00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:13.086
You want to show them
your best stuff.

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:17.026
And so that permeates
the entire process.

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:20.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since implementing
the project-based curriculum,

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:23.376
King principal Mike McCarthy
has seen the test scores

00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:27.356
of King's diverse student body
go from the bottom one-third

00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:29.416
to the top one-third in the state.

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:32.566
&gt;&gt;Michael: I've heard people
describe what a gifted

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:34.146
and talented classroom
would look like.

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:37.726
It should include field experiences,
and it should include technology.

00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:39.846
It should include independent work.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.376
It should include work
that is in depth.

00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:43.416
Well, that's basically what
our school is [Applause].

00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:46.876
&gt;&gt;Scott: Every kid has
their own finish line

00:04:46.876 --> 00:04:48.896
and some kids might
have done seven pages

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:51.226
and some kids might have
done three paragraphs.

00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:51.776
That's okay.

00:04:52.106 --> 00:04:52.946
They have done their work.

00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:54.146
They're on the CD.

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:57.536
They have completed what they can
do, and it's the best they can do.

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:02.176
&gt;&gt;Michael: Our whole goal is that
every student here can have access

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:04.986
to high-quality learning and
produce high-quality products.

00:05:05.256 --> 00:05:09.366
One kid said, "Nobody feels stupid
around here anymore," and I think

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:10.826
that was one of our
highest achievements.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.386
