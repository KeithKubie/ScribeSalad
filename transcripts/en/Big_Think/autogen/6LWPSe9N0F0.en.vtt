could have said 15 or 20 years ago the

time doesn't only fly it accelerates now

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840
time doesn't only fly it accelerates now
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.320
time doesn't only fly it accelerates now
I really know that accelerates if I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330
I really know that accelerates if I
 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330

few weeks ago it's probably a few months

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800
few weeks ago it's probably a few months
 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.210
few weeks ago it's probably a few months
ago if I think I saw someone or did

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220
ago if I think I saw someone or did

something a year ago it was probably

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660
something a year ago it was probably
 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.760
something a year ago it was probably
three years ago because my old sense of

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770
three years ago because my old sense of
 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.669
three years ago because my old sense of
time is subject to this acceleration and

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679
time is subject to this acceleration and
 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.370
time is subject to this acceleration and
that's interesting but little panic

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380
that's interesting but little panic
 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.169
that's interesting but little panic
making is there's also something

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179
making is there's also something
 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.150
making is there's also something
exciting about it and interesting about

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160
exciting about it and interesting about
 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.449
exciting about it and interesting about
it and you're constantly getting used to

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459
it and you're constantly getting used to
 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.430
it and you're constantly getting used to
the idea that people are 20 who you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440
the idea that people are 20 who you
 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.100
the idea that people are 20 who you
think of as 12 people are not who you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110

80 and 75 when you think of is 50 and 40

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.190
80 and 75 when you think of is 50 and 40
and that's interesting

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.510
it's a great question why time

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520
it's a great question why time
 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.030
it's a great question why time
accelerates as you get older I suppose

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040
accelerates as you get older I suppose
 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.440
accelerates as you get older I suppose
because the reality at the end becomes

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450
because the reality at the end becomes
 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.300
because the reality at the end becomes
practically closer I don't know if that

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310
practically closer I don't know if that
 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.449
practically closer I don't know if that
explains it completely but I believe I'm

not alone in this perception it's like
 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.310
not alone in this perception it's like
some physical process it's like when the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320
some physical process it's like when the
 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.050

hourglass is going to sand seems to go

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
hourglass is going to sand seems to go
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.540
hourglass is going to sand seems to go
very quickly at the very end and the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550
very quickly at the very end and the

water out of the bathtub it's something
 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.240
water out of the bathtub it's something
like that
