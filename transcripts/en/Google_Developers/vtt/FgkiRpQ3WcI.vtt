UTTAM TRIPATHI:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.222
to this new, exciting
episode of GDL

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:11.305
that we're recording out
of the head of our studio

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:12.330
here in India.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.180
And with me, I have our guest
for today, Amrit Sanjeev.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.000
Amrit is the lead organizer of
Bangalore Android User Group.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.250
He's also an Android
developer, and has

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.220
built some really
interesting apps that

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.740
are out there on the Play Store.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.020
One of apps that he has one the
Play Store is called Paperboy.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.110
And what Amrit plans to
talk to us today about

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.680
is his experience of using
some of the innovative ways

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.570
of getting customer feedback,
and making the app look

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.805
much nicer in terms of
the user experience,

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.540
and also fixing some
of the bugs and issues.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.040
So before we get
started, Amrit, why

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.320
don't you quickly
introduce yourself

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.610
to the users in a
little bit more detail,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.120
and talk about your app that
you have been working on,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.637
and what are the things that
you used innovative channels.

00:00:55.637 --> 00:00:56.470
AMRIT SANJEEV: Sure.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.670
Sure.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.360
The app that I was
actually working on

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.880
was a news reader application.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.254
I was using the feed [INAUDIBLE]
back in to get the data.

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:06.265
And then we have
a very visual feed

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.800
to actually help the news as
actually conveyed to the user.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.070
One of the things that I
wanted to work really hard on

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.770
was the user
experience of the app,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.350
and I wanted to get a lot more
feedback on the application

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.800
from the general community.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.500
For doing that, I
used three channels.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.080
One is the in-app
feedback channel.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.470
A second one is using
Google+ communities.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.315
And the third one was using
the alpha/beta test channel.

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:31.190
UTTAM TRIPATHI: OK,
that's interesting, yeah.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.890
So this in-app feedback
thing that you talked about,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.437
so how did it really work?

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.770
Where were the users giving
the feedback, at what stage?

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.520
And how were you
collecting that feedback?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.290
And then how did you use that
in your development cycle?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.620
AMRIT SANJEEV: So from an
in-app feedback perspective,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.030
the end in-app feedback
model is to allow the user

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.490
to give feedback from
within the app itself,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.140
so that he's within the context.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.370
The result is much
faster, and you

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.940
don't get premature negative
ratings for the app.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.740
To measure the effectiveness
of it, what I did was initially

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.930
I gave a link for the user,
where the user could send me

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.919
an email with the feedback.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.820
And from there, I
improved upon it

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.260
by opening the email application
within the app, where

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.550
they could send it again.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.980
The third model was to have
it within the app itself.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.016
And I saw that the
amount of feedback,

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:22.390
and the relevance
of the feedback

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.600
increased multifold
when I was using it

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.120
within the application.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.680
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Well,
that's interesting.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.340
Because you're
getting feedback right

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.842
from the user when he
or she is using the app,

00:02:33.842 --> 00:02:36.300
I'm pretty sure their feedback
would be much more relevant.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.425
So I think that
makes a lot of sense.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.610
What about the other things
that you talked about,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.940
Google+ communities and
alpha/beta channels?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.832
How did you use them?

00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:46.040
AMRIT SANJEEV: To kind of
improve the user experience

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.470
of the app, what I actually
did was I first identified

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.280
the relevant communities
within Google+.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.250
Then I gave them my application,
the link to my application,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.800
and also the ideas that I'm
really looking forward to.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.550
And for me, the two channels
that really worked really well

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.880
was Android Apps, and also
the Android Design community.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.760
Both of these communities
gave great feedback,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.880
and some of them
helped me quite a lot

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.640
in terms of refining the app,
getting those finer details

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.120
right, and also telling me
the perspectives and the rules

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.640
behind how they engineer stuff.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.750
As an engineer, from a
technical perspective,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.380
I was kind of OK doing things.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.160
But from a design
perspective, there

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.201
are new things that I
learned from the community.

00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:25.540
And people were very open
and willing to teach you.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.150
And that was the
best part of it all.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.080
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Perfect, yeah.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.170
And alpha/beta channels?

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.961
AMRIT SANJEEV: So the
alpha/beta channel, I

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:32.420
saw a lot of benefit using that.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.450
So the way I had
actually structured,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.924
was that the alpha channel
was useful within the app.

00:03:36.924 --> 00:03:39.340
So the nightly bills used to
go within the app development

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.940
team.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.740
And the beta channel was used
for a demography of users

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.230
that I had actually chosen
based on different age

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.020
groups, different
devices that they had,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.410
their reading patterns,
and things like that,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.580
so that I had a very
varied set of users

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.810
within the beta community.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.960
So we released the stable
version to the beta community,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.700
they would actually test the
app and give you feedback

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.990
on it, things for you to improve
before you hit the main market,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.930
where it is open for everybody.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.930
So when the beta
test channel is kind

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.210
of giving the approval for what
you have, then you actually

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.390
pushed it to the main
community, the amount

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.598
of feedback that you were
getting in terms of changes

00:04:15.598 --> 00:04:17.149
was much less.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.251
UTTAM TRIPATHI: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:21.750
So using all these three things
that you had described right

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.192
now, what kind of impact
did it have on your app?

00:04:25.192 --> 00:04:26.650
Did it improve the
ratings that you

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.300
were getting from the users?

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.870
Did it impact the downloads?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.280
What kind of impact did you see?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.870
AMRIT SANJEEV: I saw an increase
in downloads, definitely.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.050
The user experience of the app
was increased dramatically,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.685
because people were actually
giving me that feedback.

00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:42.060
The third thing which I found,
which is most interesting,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.190
was that my app
rating did increase.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.060
And in that, the most impactful,
or the most interesting thing,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.812
has been the fact that people
who were actually giving me

00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:53.770
three stars, and then
went ahead and changed it

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.230
because I was
getting that feedback

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.962
and I was communicating
back to them.

00:04:56.962 --> 00:04:59.170
And every time there was a
change, or an improvement,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.160
or the feature they
requested has come in,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.500
I was able to communicate it
back directly into their app.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.080
So when they were
opening the app,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.610
they got the message that your
feature has been implemented.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.050
And that made people
very happy, happy enough

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.760
that they came back
to the Play Store

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.385
and changed the rating
to a higher one.

00:05:14.385 --> 00:05:16.510
UTTAM TRIPATHI: I would
like to do that same thing.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.040
If I give a feedback
to a developer,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.170
and he or she goes
back and implements it,

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.930
it makes sense to go back
and give a higher rating

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.040
because they implemented
what you had requested.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.280
So perfect.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.140
Thanks.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.750
I think this is
really interesting.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.540
So for our viewers,
if someone wants

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.570
to use some of the methods
that you just described,

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.280
what would be the
starting point?

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.450
How can they get started?

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.300
Is there documentation
available online

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.440
that they can just go to?

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.900
What would be your
suggestion for that?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.830
AMRIT SANJEEV: For
the in-app feedback,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.130
there are actually
libraries by which

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.460
you can very quickly test.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.439
I tested two libraries,
Apptentive and also HockeyApp.

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.980
They were the ones
that I've actually

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.100
tested and saw
their differences.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.730
So they're very
easy to integrate.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.105
They've been
[INAUDIBLE] in a way

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:02.920
that you write
minimal amount of code

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.690
to integrate them
within the app.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.560
And for alpha/beta test
channel, developer.android.com

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.324
has all the details for it.

00:06:10.324 --> 00:06:11.740
And the [INAUDIBLE]
also gives you

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.185
the interface to do
that very easily.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:18.060
There is not much of a
difficulty doing that,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.018
and you can manage your
application very easily

00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:21.350
at that point.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.933
UTTAM TRIPATHI:
Perfect, yeah, I think

00:06:22.933 --> 00:06:23.960
that makes a lot of sense.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.376
So thanks a lot
once again, Amrit.

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:28.500
It was a pleasure having
you on our show today.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.480
And we look forward
to having you

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.990
for more shows in the future.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.070
So thanks a lot for
sharing your insights,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.664
and all of best with your
development projects.

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:39.580
AMRIT SANJEEV: Thanks.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.260
Thanks for the opportunity.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.840
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Thanks viewers.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.660
So with this, we'll
sign off from the show.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.130
But do keep watching
GDL shows as we continue

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.085
to share some of the
insights from developers

00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:51.080
across the world.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.830
Thanks once again.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.920
See you.
