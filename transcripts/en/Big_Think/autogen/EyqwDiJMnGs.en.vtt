electrons orbit around the nucleus of an

electrons orbit around the nucleus of an
 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.409

atom the same way planets orbit around a

atom the same way planets orbit around a
 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.600

star if you think about the way we

star if you think about the way we
 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.029

depict atoms in art we actually have the

depict atoms in art we actually have the
 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.410
depict atoms in art we actually have the
nucleus in the center and then the

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420
nucleus in the center and then the
 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.759
nucleus in the center and then the
nucleus of course is where you find the

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769
nucleus of course is where you find the
 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.800
nucleus of course is where you find the
protons and neutrons and then we have

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810
protons and neutrons and then we have
 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.380
protons and neutrons and then we have
