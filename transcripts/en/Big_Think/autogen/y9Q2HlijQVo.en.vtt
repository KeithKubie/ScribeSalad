I think we think that happiness is

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069
I think we think that happiness is
 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.369
I think we think that happiness is
something that you find or if you reach

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379
something that you find or if you reach
 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.580
something that you find or if you reach
some level in a company or school then

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
some level in a company or school then
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.410
some level in a company or school then
you're happier and what we're finding is

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
you're happier and what we're finding is
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.820
you're happier and what we're finding is
that happiness is not something that

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
that happiness is not something that
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.720
that happiness is not something that
happens to you

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730

happiness is a work ethic there's
something that requires our brains

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
something that requires our brains
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.780
something that requires our brains
trained just like an athlete has to

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790
trained just like an athlete has to
 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.760
trained just like an athlete has to
train in order to become happier we

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770
train in order to become happier we
 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.380
train in order to become happier we
actually have to focus our brains down

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
actually have to focus our brains down
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.390
actually have to focus our brains down
on things that actually move us forward

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
on things that actually move us forward
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.940
on things that actually move us forward
instead of getting stagnating and the

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950
instead of getting stagnating and the
 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.980
instead of getting stagnating and the
things that for example stressing about

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
things that for example stressing about
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.330
things that for example stressing about
things are outside of our control

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
things are outside of our control
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.880
things are outside of our control
doesn't move us forward at all so what I

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
doesn't move us forward at all so what I
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530
doesn't move us forward at all so what I
think we need to be able to do is to not

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
think we need to be able to do is to not
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.990
think we need to be able to do is to not
only change the formula for success to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
only change the formula for success to
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580
only change the formula for success to
help us to be able to focus upon this

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
help us to be able to focus upon this
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.160
help us to be able to focus upon this
idea that if we prioritize happiness it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
idea that if we prioritize happiness it
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.260
idea that if we prioritize happiness it
will then raise our success rates but

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
will then raise our success rates but
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910
will then raise our success rates but
also a recognition that is something

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
also a recognition that is something
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.080
also a recognition that is something
that we actually have to be conscious

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
that we actually have to be conscious
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.180
that we actually have to be conscious
about on a daily on a daily basis

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
about on a daily on a daily basis
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.740
about on a daily on a daily basis
there's something that actually requires

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
there's something that actually requires
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020
there's something that actually requires
effort it requires training it requires

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
effort it requires training it requires
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.760
effort it requires training it requires
us to be all focus our attention on this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
us to be all focus our attention on this
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.280
us to be all focus our attention on this
and we do so I think the thing that we

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290
and we do so I think the thing that we
 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.770
and we do so I think the thing that we
oftentimes think is that if people get

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
oftentimes think is that if people get
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.139
oftentimes think is that if people get
happy they'll stop working hard or that

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
happy they'll stop working hard or that
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.899
happy they'll stop working hard or that
happy people are unintelligent and what

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
happy people are unintelligent and what
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.580
happy people are unintelligent and what
we're finding is just the opposite

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
we're finding is just the opposite
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.599
we're finding is just the opposite
I think it's the most counterintuitive

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:08.609
I think it's the most counterintuitive
 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.999
I think it's the most counterintuitive
thing we found which is happiness

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009
thing we found which is happiness
 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.709
thing we found which is happiness
actually raises an individual's

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719
actually raises an individual's
 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.289
actually raises an individual's
intelligence and their success rates we

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
intelligence and their success rates we
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.330
intelligence and their success rates we
find that is you know that the happy

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
find that is you know that the happy
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249
find that is you know that the happy
people happy people aren't always the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
people happy people aren't always the
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.899
people happy people aren't always the
smartest people we know that there's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
smartest people we know that there's
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.879
smartest people we know that there's
I've met tons of people that are very

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889
I've met tons of people that are very
 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:25.219
I've met tons of people that are very
successful and not happy and people that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
successful and not happy and people that
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440
successful and not happy and people that
are extremely intelligent and not happy

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
are extremely intelligent and not happy
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.269
are extremely intelligent and not happy
so we might assume that those two things

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279
so we might assume that those two things
 

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.039
so we might assume that those two things
are divorced but now what we really

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
are divorced but now what we really
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899
are divorced but now what we really
realized in the science is that both of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
realized in the science is that both of
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.839
realized in the science is that both of
those individuals are actually

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849
those individuals are actually
 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.039
those individuals are actually
underperforming what their brain is

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
underperforming what their brain is
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.109
underperforming what their brain is
actually capable of and if we have more

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
actually capable of and if we have more
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.269
actually capable of and if we have more
role models or companies and schools of

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:41.279
role models or companies and schools of
 

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:43.339
role models or companies and schools of
individuals are positive and infect

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349
individuals are positive and infect
 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:44.690
individuals are positive and infect
other people with that positivity

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
other people with that positivity
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.760
other people with that positivity
rippling out through those mirror neuron

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
rippling out through those mirror neuron
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.800
rippling out through those mirror neuron
networks not only can we raise the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
networks not only can we raise the
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.389
networks not only can we raise the
levels of happiness and engagement or

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
levels of happiness and engagement or
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.489
levels of happiness and engagement or
our schools and companies again but will

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499
our schools and companies again but will
 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:54.980
our schools and companies again but will
actually rate their levels of successes

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
actually rate their levels of successes
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.259
actually rate their levels of successes
as well
