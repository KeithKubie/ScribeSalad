00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:02.015
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:03.694
is get a little bit of practice

00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:06.537
estimating dividing with decimals.

00:00:06.537 --> 00:00:09.064
So for example, we wanna
figure out approximately,

00:00:09.064 --> 00:00:12.576
that's what these kind of
squiggly equal sign means.

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:14.862
This means approximately equal.

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:19.632
So what does 80 divided by
1.94 approximately equal?

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:21.353
So we wanna estimate what this is.

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:24.581
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:26.252
So before we even look at these choices,

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:28.840
how would we try to do this in our head?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.450
Well, we could say 1.94, it's
hard to do that in our head

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.159
to divide it into 80 but
it's awfully close to two.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:37.590
So we could say this is close to,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.276
this is approximately
equal to 80 divided by two

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.176
'cause once again, 1.94
is awfully close to two

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:46.930
and then this is easy to figure out.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.602
That is going to be equal to 40.

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:50.184
So our first expression, you could say

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:52.427
is approximately equal to 40.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.487
Is it exactly equal to 40?

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:55.404
No but it's pretty close.

00:00:55.404 --> 00:00:57.528
So I would select that choice.

00:00:57.528 --> 00:00:59.767
Let's do another one.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:00.828
So pause this video

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:03.598
and see if you can figure
out the approximation.

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:07.431
What is 209 divided by
three roughly equal to?

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.079
So once again, here we don't
have any clear decimals.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.019
If we were to divide it out,

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:16.031
we would get a decimal
answer for our quotient

00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:18.643
but what we could do is
well, is either one of these,

00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:20.726
is for example 209,

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:24.685
is it close to a multiple of
three that we might recognize?

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.724
Well, you might immediately recognize,

00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:28.804
well, if you think about
multiples of three,

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:30.435
you think in terms of,

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:35.032
well, three times six is
18, three times seven is 21.

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:37.282
Well, this is close to 210.

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:42.743
So this is approximately
equal to 210 divided by three.

00:01:42.743 --> 00:01:44.700
Now, why is this interesting?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.956
Well, 210 is just 21 times 10.

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:51.423
So if 21 divided by three is seven,

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:55.909
210 divided by three is
going to be equal to 70.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.053
So once again, 209 is pretty close to 210.

00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:00.645
Remember, we're just estimating

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:02.396
and so 209 divided by three

00:02:02.396 --> 00:02:05.418
would approximately be equal to 70

00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:08.151
which is that choice right over there.

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.560
Let's do one more example.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.030
So once again, pause the video

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.533
and figure out what 6.86 divided by 1.12

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.700
is approximately equal to.

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:22.386
Alright, so here I would just try to round

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:23.653
to the nearest whole number

00:02:23.653 --> 00:02:26.228
and see if that helps
my division in my head.

00:02:26.228 --> 00:02:28.728
So 6.86 is approximately seven

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:32.472
if we round up to the nearest whole number

00:02:32.472 --> 00:02:34.162
and if I say seven divided by,

00:02:34.162 --> 00:02:36.746
and if we round down, 1.12,

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:37.930
seven divided by one,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.248
this is much easier for
us to do in our head.

00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:42.205
So that is going to be seven.

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:43.880
Now, once again, it's
very important to realize

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.144
these are estimations.

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:48.616
It's not going to be
exactly equal to seven

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:50.777
but it's definitely gonna
be much closer to seven

00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:52.527
than 70, 700 or 7000.
