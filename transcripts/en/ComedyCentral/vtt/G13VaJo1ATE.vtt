00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.436
Hey Bojack. You ever meet any 
Boston celebrities?

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.438
Well, one time at Bristol Farms,

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:08.508
Ben Affleck and I did reach
for the same bunch of grapes.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.777
Oh, he eats grapes just like us?

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.146
Hey, Ma,
Ben Affleck eats grapes.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.680
He don't eat grapes!

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:17.450
BoJack said
he fed Affleck grapes.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:20.353
He was graping it up
with the Daredevil himself.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:23.489
-This is the greatest day
of my life.
-(GROANS)

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:26.192
Hey, I don't suppose you boys
would have any interest

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:27.860
in maybe playing some
touch football later?

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:31.130
Are you kidding? Touch football
with a star like you?

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:32.732
That would be mad wicked pisser.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.400
Ooh, you know what else
we got to do?

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.336
We got to watch
the Cryane video.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.838
-(LAUGHS)
-Ooh, that sounds good.
What's that?

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.473
No, we don't need
to revisit that.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.175
When Deedee was 16,

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.343
we made up a secret pen pal
for her named Leo.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:45.711
-(LAUGHS)
-Guys...

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.547
We all took turns
writing her letters,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.650
pretending to be this
sensitive boy from Cambridge.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.285
It was wicked messed up.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:55.788
"Oh, Diane,
we're two misunderstood souls.

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.657
Everyone else is a phony.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.326
Yours forever, Leo."

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.394
-(LAUGHS)
-What?

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.829
After six months of letters,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.531
we hired a homeless guy
to pretend to be Leo

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.800
and take her
to the homecoming dance.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.769
-MARTY: Look at her.
-GARY: Watch, watch this part.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:12.505
<i> -I like your boutonniere.</i>
-(LAUGHTER)

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:13.973
(CRIES)

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.808
GARY:
Why don't we watch this
every day?

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.310
-Look at her face.
-Now that's a good prank.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.378
I was humiliated.

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.380
Yeah, you wouldn't get it.
It's a brothers thing,
right, brothers?

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:23.516
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.285
You know,
it's nice that years later
we can all laugh about this.

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:28.588
Yep, my therapist
thinks the same thing.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.390
I'm gonna go meet
with the funeral director.
Any of you boys want to come?

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.659
Nah, I ain't so big
on funeral homes, Deedee.

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:35.495
All them dead bodies,
they give me the jeebies.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.797
Yeah, Deedee,
why do we got to go?

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.967
Fine, none of you have to go.
I'll take care of everything.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.269
Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:44.604
Come on, BoJack.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:45.905
Why you got to take
BoJack with you?

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:48.341
-Boo! Boo!
-(BLEATS)

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.577
Boys, you have stolen my heart
like Dave Roberts
stole second base.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.713
Hey! He knows our things!

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.516
I must go now,
but I'll see you all
at the funeral, okay?

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.851
And when I do,
you're all getting noogies.

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.987
-Funeral!
-Yeah!

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.891
ALL: Funeral! Funeral! Funeral!

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.893
â™ª (CHURCH MUSIC PLAYING)

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.362
Tell me about your father.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.498
Well, he was a mean,
sadistic alcoholic,

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.066
who never supported
anything I did,

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.569
and actively delighted
in seeing me fail.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.504
Hmm, I see.

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:21.908
Sounds like you're looking for
our Piece of Shit Dad Package.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.709
That would be too good
for my father.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:26.913
Might I then suggest
our Piece of Shit Dad Package

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.115
Would Be Too Good
For Him Package.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:30.548
Yeah, that's the one.
