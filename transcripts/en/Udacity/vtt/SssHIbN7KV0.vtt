00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.990
Now we talked about the need for

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.450
labels when you want to talk about MAC,
or multi-level security.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.670
And we even said, well, user has
a certain label, file has another label.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.940
And we have to say, we have to check,
if user with this label L1,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.580
should he or she be able to access
the document that has label L2?

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.940
So we have to sort of
compare these labels.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.990
So here, we're going to explore
how that comparison might work.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.040
So let's just talk about labels of the
type that we discussed in the context

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.100
of the military intelligence community
and how they access information.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
So, sensitivity, how sensitive data is.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.910
We said that, we had those circles,
top-secret is the most sensitive,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.990
secret, next level,
then classified, and unclassified.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.220
We had restricted in the middle there,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.410
but I'm just picking
these four examples.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.290
So what does this greater than mean?

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.470
So we are saying that, these levels
are actually ordered totally.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.050
And by total order, what we mean here
is that if I pick any two of these,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.720
I can tell you which one is more
sensitive than the other one.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.520
So TS is the most sensitive.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.140
If you took TS and
any other of these levels,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.500
then we know that this is higher, or
is greater than, the other level.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.990
Similarly, secret is greater,
or higher, than classified.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.430
So this greater really means it's
higher level of sensitivity.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.390
And total order basically means,
when you pick any pair so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.130
the relations and various kind of
orders that you can define for

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.880
the elements that are in a given set,
that's where it defines a relation.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.750
So the total here means you pick
any two elements of this set,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.650
and there is an order between them, so

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.490
one is always going to be more
sensitive than the other one.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.590
Here we see that through this greater
than sign, symbol that we have.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.810
We do know that labels have a level,
sensitivity level.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.880
But they also have a compartment.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.630
And we said compartments are sort of
sets of different topics or categories.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.711
And how do you compare sets?

00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:13.080
You take set S1 and S2.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.140
S1 may be contained in S2,
S2 may be contained in S1, or

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.750
neither set may be
contained in the other one.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.170
So if set S1 has some
elements that S2 doesn't, and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.930
vice versa, then neither set
will be contained in the other.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.750
So when you have sets, the way you
compare them is containment, or

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.090
subset, or
is one a subset of another one?

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.460
And we know that that
order is a partial order.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.510
So total order is when,
pick any two, and

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.050
one always is greater than or
higher than the other.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.280
When you talk about sets,
we know there are going to be

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.750
pairs of sets where neither
one contains the other one,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.690
and they're not going to be ordered,
so that's called partial order.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.215
So we'll explore this a little
bit more through examples.

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:03.510
But if a label is going to have two
parts, one part is totally ordered,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.080
one part is ordered sometimes and
not comparable at other times, so

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.390
that's the partial order.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.260
So when we talk about actually ordering
labels, we had to look into the label.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.820
We have to look into
the sensitivity level.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.240
What are the sensitivity levels?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.428
If the labels that we're comparing is
L1 and L2, then we are to look at L1's

00:03:24.428 --> 00:03:29.160
sensitivity level and L2's sensitivity
level and how they compare.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.260
And then we're going to look at the
compartment of each one of those, and

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.130
then compare those compartments.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.320
And by comparing both parts,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.740
then we going to be able to
decide how to order the labels.
