00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:16.366
I first tried online dating
my freshman year of college,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.682
which was in 2001,
in case you can't see my wrinkle.

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.696
Now, as you may have noticed,
I'm six-feet tall,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.705
and when I arrived at my chosen university

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:29.045
and realized our men's Division III
basketball team averaged five-foot-eight,

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.426
I abandoned the on-campus
scene and went online.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.178
Now, back then, online dating
was pretty close to the plot

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.442
of "You've Got Mail."

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.617
You'd write long emails
back and forth for weeks,

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.616
before you finally met up in real life.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.379
Except, in my case,
you'd realize you have no chemistry

00:00:44.403 --> 00:00:46.672
and so now, you're back to square one.

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:50.077
So, while online dating
has changed a lot in the last 17 years,

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.834
many of the frustrations remain the same.

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:55.553
Because here's what it does well.

00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:58.029
It broadens your pool of potential dates

00:00:58.053 --> 00:01:01.005
beyond your existing social
and professional circles.

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:03.974
And here's what it doesn't do well.

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:06.299
Literally everything else.

00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:08.307
(Laughter)

00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.497
A few things you should know about me:

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.379
I'm an action-oriented overachieving
math and theater nerd,

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:15.077
who ended up with an MBA.

00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:18.252
So, when things aren't working out,
I tend to take a step back,

00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:21.675
apply my business toolkit
to figure out why, and to fix it.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:24.299
My love life was no exception.

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:28.767
The summer before I turned 30,
I took myself on a relationship off-site.

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.229
Which means I went camping solo
in Maine for a week,

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:34.595
to do a retro on my track record
of mediocre relationships.

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:38.141
Because the thing was,
I knew what I wanted in a partner.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:42.205
Kindness, curiosity, empathy,
a sense of purpose.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.807
And yet, here's what I chose for online:

00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.648
Ivy League degree, six feet or taller,

00:01:48.672 --> 00:01:50.712
lives within 12 subway stops of me.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:54.010
It's not that I intentionally
prioritized those things,

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:57.204
it's just the easiest to vet for online.

00:01:57.228 --> 00:01:58.998
It kind of is like a résumé review,

00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:01.387
which is why these guys
looked great on paper

00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:02.944
and never quite fit me.

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:06.021
So when I went back online
in the spring of 2016,

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:10.506
I decided to reengineer the process
through some classic business tools.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.545
First, I went to OkCupid,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.847
because I wanted to avoid
the gamification of swipe-based apps.

00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:18.442
And also, because I wanted
a writing sample.

00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:21.252
Next, I set up a sales funnel,

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:23.363
throwing out any sense of my type,

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:27.196
and instead defining the criteria
that would qualify a lead.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.387
An inbound message had to do three things:

00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:32.577
had to be written in complete sentences
and with good grammar;

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.678
it had to reference
something in my profile,

00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:37.006
so I know it's not
a copy-and-paste situation;

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.806
and it had to avoid all sexual content.

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:41.911
I figured this was a pretty low bar,

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:44.434
but it turns out,
of my 210 inbound messages,

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:46.847
only 14 percent cleared that hurdle.

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:48.037
(Laughter)

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.307
Next, I wanted to meet in real life
as quickly as possible,

00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:54.323
because the things I cared about,
I couldn't see online.

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:56.109
But the research, and my experience,

00:02:56.133 --> 00:03:00.114
shows you only need about 30 seconds
with someone to tell if you click.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.723
So I invented the zero date.

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.732
The zero date is one drink, one hour.

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:08.688
With the goal of answering one question:

00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:11.149
Would I like to have
dinner with this person?

00:03:11.173 --> 00:03:12.553
Not "are they the one"?

00:03:12.577 --> 00:03:15.973
Literally, "Would I like to spend
three hours across the table

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:17.147
from this person?"

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.799
You tell them you have a hard stop --

00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:22.466
drinks with girlfriends,
a conference call with China --

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.363
it doesn't matter, they don't know you.

00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:25.853
The point is one hour.

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:29.125
If it's awesome,
you schedule a first date.

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:32.291
And if it's not awesome,
you downshift into entertainer mode

00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:35.474
and you workshop a few new stories
for your next networking event.

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:39.363
Plus, because it's just an hour,
you can squeeze up to three in one evening

00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:43.299
and then you only have to do your hair
and pick out one great outfit a week.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.220
The zero date also gave me a chance
to see how they responded

00:03:46.244 --> 00:03:47.910
to me asking them out.

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:51.156
I figured not everyone
would dig my moxie, and I was right.

00:03:51.553 --> 00:03:55.077
Of my 29 qualified leads,
only 15 replied to my message,

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.768
and of those, six scheduled a zero date.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.315
My first zero date
was with a set designer.

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:01.593
And we were both into yoga

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:03.668
and preferred our bagels
with peanut butter,

00:04:03.692 --> 00:04:05.152
so it looked pretty promising.

00:04:05.176 --> 00:04:08.096
But two minutes in, I could tell
it wasn't going to be a thing

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.668
and I was relieved not to be
spending dinner with him.

00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:14.037
After that, I was a little nervous
about going to my next zero date.

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:16.870
But we had agreed to meet
on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:18.958
with a flask of whiskey
to watch the sunset,

00:04:18.982 --> 00:04:21.402
and honestly, it was two blocks
from my apartment.

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:24.331
Plus, this guy had a podcast,
I have a podcast,

00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:27.307
worst case scenario,
we can talk about our podcasts.

00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:30.214
Then, Chas set down next to me.

00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:32.666
And this kind and empathetic man

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.767
told great jokes
and asked even better questions.

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:39.994
He was a lawyer and a writer,
and his eyes twinkled when he laughed

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:42.026
and they squeezed tight when I kissed him

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.478
and at some point in the evening,
our zero date became a first date.

00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:49.573
And two years later, we have a washer,
dryer and two house plants together.

00:04:50.064 --> 00:04:53.381
Now, I can't promise
you're going to end up with house plants.

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:55.130
But the point of this story

00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:57.865
is that online dating
doesn't have to suck.

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.412
Don't treat it like a game,
and don't treat it like a resume review.

00:05:01.436 --> 00:05:04.229
Instead, use it to source
and qualify leads

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:07.710
and then get offline as quickly
as possible with the zero date.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.039
Because the point of this isn't swiping.

00:05:11.063 --> 00:05:12.697
It's finding your person.

00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:14.595
Good luck.

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:18.185
(Applause)
