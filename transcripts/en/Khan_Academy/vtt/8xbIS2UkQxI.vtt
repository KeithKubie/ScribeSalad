00:00:00.605 --> 00:00:02.424
- [Voiceover] Oh look, it's my cousin Fal!

00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:03.952
Cousin Fal, what can I do for you?

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:05.184
- [Voiceover] Hey Sal, what's up?

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:07.128
- [Voiceover] Oh, well not
much, I'm just sitting here

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:10.407
thinking about what
video I should do next.

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:11.799
- [Voiceover] Well then
maybe you can help me.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.141
I'm starting a shape collection.

00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:15.341
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
how do you need help?

00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:16.949
- [Voiceover] Well look
at these shapes over here!

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.393
I have no way to classify them!

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:21.772
- [Voiceover] Okay, well
there's a bunch of ways

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:23.164
that you could classify them.

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:25.588
The first way, you could think about

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:28.828
how many sides each of these shapes have,

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.081
so that's one way

00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:31.428
to think about it,

00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:32.760
how many sides they have.

00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:34.262
- [Voiceover] How do I figure that out?

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:37.114
- [Voiceover] Okay, well
let's look at each of these

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.287
and think about how many sides they have.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:42.798
So this first shape right over here

00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:44.560
this is one side.

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:47.140
We see this kind of
straight right over here,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.427
it's the straight line
between these two corners,

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:51.719
so that's one side.

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:54.846
Two sides, three sides,

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:56.754
and four sides.

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:59.671
So this shape right over
here has four sides.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.275
- [Voiceover] Okay, I think I get it.

00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:02.699
What about this shape right over here?

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.559
- [Voiceover] Okay,well let's see.

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:06.322
This one, well same idea,

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:08.945
this one also looks like it has one,

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:12.420
two, three,

00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:14.693
and four.

00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:16.522
Four sides.

00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:18.008
- [Voiceover] What about this one?

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:19.592
- [Voiceover] Okay, well this one,

00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:20.865
actually this is interesting.

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.594
This one actually had no corners,

00:01:22.594 --> 00:01:24.565
and it has no sides,

00:01:24.746 --> 00:01:27.176
there's no straight edges over here,

00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:28.808
this thing is all curved.

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:30.512
So since it has no corners,

00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:32.409
it also has no sides,

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.045
or at least the way that
I'm thinking about it.

00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:35.835
So I would say that this one over here

00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:37.620
has zero sides.

00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:40.906
Let me write that a
little bit neater for you.

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:43.018
- [Voiceover] Okay yeah, I like
to write things really neat.

00:01:43.018 --> 00:01:44.859
- [Voiceover] Okay, zero sides.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.118
And it has zero corners.

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:48.619
Actually let me write
them for all of them.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.016
This one has four sides,

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.143
and we could also count the corners.

00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:55.486
We have one, that's
where the two sides meet.

00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:58.942
One, two, three, four corners.

00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:03.115
This shape over here,

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:05.401
it also has four sides,

00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:06.569
we already counted that and it has

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.117
one, two, three, four corners.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.945
So four sides and four
corners actually describes

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:14.570
both of these shapes,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.220
this one has zero sides and zero corners--

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:18.561
- [Voiceover] What about the green one?

00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:20.635
- [Voiceover] Okay, well let's just see.

00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:22.870
One side, two sides,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.448
three sides, and four sides,

00:02:25.448 --> 00:02:29.833
and it also has one,
two, three, four corners.

00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:33.028
So this is also four
sides and four corners

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:35.259
is also true of that one there.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.443
- [Voiceover] Do all shapes have

00:02:36.443 --> 00:02:37.583
four sides and four corners?

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:38.768
- [Voiceover] No no, not at all.

00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:39.834
I mean this one right over here had

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:41.101
zero sides and zero corners,

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.004
and actually this last
shape right over here,

00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.524
doesn't seem to have four
sides or four corners.

00:02:45.524 --> 00:02:46.734
If we count them,

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:50.046
we have one side, two sides,

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.604
and three sides.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:54.888
So this one has three sides,

00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:57.259
and if we count the corners we have

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.766
one corner, two corners, and three,

00:03:01.642 --> 00:03:03.595
and three corners.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.645
- [Voiceover] Oh, thanks a
bunch Uncle-- Cousin Sal.

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:07.374
But I always get confused whether

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:09.688
you're my cousin or my uncle.

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:11.220
But I'll call you Cousin Sal.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.921
But I read in a shape magazine

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:15.982
that there was other
ways that I can classify.

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:17.158
I can classify based on

00:03:17.158 --> 00:03:19.142
whether the sides have the same size.

00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:21.694
So which of these have all the sides

00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:22.823
are the same size?

00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:24.616
- [Voiceover] Okay, well calm down.

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:26.030
Let's look at this.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.576
So if you look at this
one, it has four sides.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.676
But we see, that this
side right over here,

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:34.646
this green side, is clearly shorter

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:36.512
than this purple side.

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:39.353
So all the four sides here
are not the same length.

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:41.724
But if we look at this
shape right over here,

00:03:41.724 --> 00:03:45.712
this side at least looks like
the same length as this side.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.631
And that looks like the
same length as this side,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.796
and that looks like the
same length as that side.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:51.815
So it looks over here like

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.675
all four sides are the same length.

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.624
And that's also true for this shape.

00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:57.902
This side looks the same
length as that side,

00:03:57.902 --> 00:03:59.654
looks the same length as that side,

00:03:59.654 --> 00:04:01.426
looks the same length as that side.

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:03.710
That's also true for
this three-sided shape.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.066
This side looks the same
length as that side,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.105
This is the same length as that one.

00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:10.925
- [Voiceover] Oh, thank
you so much Cousin Sal!

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:13.437
I'm ready to go classify
my shape collection.

00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:14.846
This is awesome!

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:17.561
- [Voiceover] Well I'm
glad that I could help!
