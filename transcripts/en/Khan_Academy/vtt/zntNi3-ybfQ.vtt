00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
 

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.180
Let's say I have
the subspace v.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.730
And this is a subspace and we
learned all about subspaces in

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.510
the last video.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.240
And it's equal to the span
of some set of vectors.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.910
And I showed in that video that
the span of any set of

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.710
vectors is a valid subspace.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.310
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.910
It's going to be the span of v1,
v2, all the way, so it's

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.030
going to be n vectors.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.100
So each of these are vectors.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.920
Now let me also say that all of
these vectors are linearly

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.970
independent.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:43.850
So v1, v2, all the way to vn,
this set of vectors are

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.100
linearly independent.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.370
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.800
Now before I kind of give you
the punchline, let's review

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.600
what exactly span meant.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.280
Span meant that this set, this
subspace, represents all of

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.380
the possible linear
combinations of

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.800
all of these vectors.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.060
So you know, I could have all of
the combinations for all of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.880
the different c's.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.600
So c1 times v1 plus c2 times v2,
all the way to cn times vn

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.405
for all of the possible c's
and the real numbers.

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:24.140
If you take all of the
possibilities of these and you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.610
put all of those vectors into
a set, that is the span and

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.540
that's what we're defining
the subspace v as.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.810
Now, the definition of linear
independence meant that the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.690
only solution to c1, v1, plus
c2, v2 plus all the way to cn,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.920
vn, that the only solution to
this equally the 0 vector--

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.650
maybe I should put a little
vector sign up there-- is when

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.220
all of these terms
are equal to 0.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.890
c1 is equal to c2, is equal
to all of these.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.570
All of them are equal to 0.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.660
Or kind of a more common sense
way to think of it is that you

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.670
can't represent any one of these
vectors as a combination

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.990
of the other vectors.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.660
Now, if both of these conditions
are true that the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.430
span of this set of vectors is
equal to this subspace or

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.950
creates this subspace or it
spans this subspace, and that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.560
all of these vectors are
linearly independent, then we

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.560
can say that the set of
vectors-- maybe we call this,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.450
we could call this
set of vectors s.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.140
Where we say s is equal to v1,
v2, all the way to vn.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.210
It's equal to that
set of vectors.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.780
We can then say and this
is the punchline.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:54.280
We can then say that S, the
set S is a basis for v.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.580
And this is the definition
I wanted to make.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.790
If something is a basis for a
set, that means that those

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.230
vectors, if you take the span
of those vectors, you can

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.390
construct-- you can get to any
of the vectors in that

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.820
subspace and that those
vectors are linearly

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.860
independent.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.280
So there's a couple of ways
to think about it.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.330
One is there's a lot of things
that might span for something.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.480
For example, if this spans for
v, then so would-- let me add

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.870
another vector.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.060
Let me define another set.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.750
Let me define set T to be
all of set S: v1, v2,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.010
all the way to vn.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.150
But it also contains
this other vector.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.970
I'm going to call it the
v special vector.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.730
So it's going to be essentially,
the set S plus

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.120
one more vector.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.790
Where this vector I'm just
saying is equal to v1 plus v2.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.800
So clearly, this is not a
linearly independent set.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.355
But if I had asked you what the
span of T is, the span of

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:09.520
T is still going to be
this subspace, v.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.550
But I have this extra vector
in here that made it

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.190
non-linearly independent.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.500
This set is not linearly
independent.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.250
So T is linearly dependent.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.030
So in this case, T is
not a basis for v.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.450
And I had showed you this
example because the way my

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.820
head thinks about basis is,
the basis is really the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.510
minimum set of vectors that I
need, the minimum set-- and

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.180
I'll write this down.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.250
This isn't a formal definition,
but I view a

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.300
basis-- let me switch colors--
as really the-- let me get a

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.120
good color here.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.960
As a basis is the minimum-- I'll
put it in quotes because

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.620
I haven't defined that.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:07.470
The minimum set of vectors that
spans the space that it's

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.810
a basis of, spans
the subspace.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.570
 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.680
So in this case, this is the
minimum set of vectors.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.360
And I'm not going to prove it
just yet, but you can see

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.550
that, look.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.950
This set of vectors right
here, it does span the

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.440
subspace, but it's clearly not
the minimum set of vectors.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.560
Because the span of this thing,
I could still remove

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.330
this last vector here.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.410
I could still remove that guy
and still-- and then the span

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.230
of what's left over is still
going to span my subspace v.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.140
So this guy right here
was redundant.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.300
In a basis, you have
a no redundancy.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.050
Each one of these guys is needed
to be able to construct

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.520
any of the vectors in
the subspace v.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.770
Let me do some examples.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.700
 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.550
So let's just take some
vectors here.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.450
Let's say I had to find
my set of vectors, and

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.170
I'll deal in r2.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.135
So let's say I have
the vector 2, 3.

00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:25.990
 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.610
Let's say I have the
other vector 7, 0.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.390
So first of all, let's just
think about the span, the span

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.620
of this set of vectors.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.090
This is a set of vectors.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.450
So what's the span of S?

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.360
What's all of the linear
combinations of this?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.470
Well, let's see if
it's all of r2.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.670
So if it's all of r2 that means
the linear combination

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.700
of this could be-- we could
always construct anything in

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.270
r2 with the linear combination
of this.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:07:00.920
So if we have c1 times 2,
3 plus c2 times 7, 0.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.240
If it is true that this spans
all of r2, then we should be

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.280
able to construct-- we should
always be able find a c1 and a

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.140
c2 to construct any
point in r2.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.000
And let's see if we
can show that.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.650
So we get 2c1 plus 7c2
is equal to x1.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.810
And then we get 3c1 plus 0c2.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.280
Plus 0 is equal to x2.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.970
And if we take this second
equation and divide both sides

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:37.710
by 3 we get c1 is equal
to x2 over 3.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.920
And then if we substitute that
back into this first equation,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.210
we get 2/3-- I'm just
substituting c1 in there.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.100
So 2/3 x2.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:57.140
2 times x2 over 3 is 2/3 x2.
plus 7c2 is equal to x1.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.160
And then, what can we do?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.090
We can subtract the 2/3
x2 from both sides.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.000
Let me do it right here.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.390
So we get 7c2 is equal
to x1 minus 2/3 x2.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.000
Divide both sides of this
by 7 and you get c2.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.840
Let me do it in yellow.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:22.890
You get c2 is equal to x1 over
7 minus 2 over 21 x2.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:29.670
So if you've given me any x1 and
any x2 where either x1 or

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.980
x2 are a member of the real
numbers, we're talking about--

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.799
well, everything we're going to
be dealing with right now

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.350
is real numbers.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.159
You give me any two
real numbers.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.190
I take my x2 divided by 3 and
I'll give you your c1.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.380
And I'll take the x1 divided
by 7 and subtract

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.410
2/21 times your x2.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.780
And I'll get you your c2.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.830
This will never break.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.410
There's no division
by any of these.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.390
You don't have to worry about
these equaling a 0.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.930
These two formulas
will always work.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.640
So you give me any x1 and any
x2, I can always find

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.360
you a c1 or a c2.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.730
Which is essentially finding a
linear combination that will

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.070
equal your vector.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.020
So the span of S is r2.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:15.360
 

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.250
Now the second question is, is
are these two vectors linearly

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.910
independent?

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.690
And linear independence means
that the only solution to the

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.450
equation c-- let me
switch colors.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.810
The only solution to the
equation c1 times the first

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:40.790
vector plus c2 times the second
vector equaling the 0

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.660
vector, that the only solution
to this is when both

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.970
of these equal 0.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:46.870
So let's see if that's true.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.780
We've already solved for it, so
if x1-- in this case, x1 is

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.220
equal to 0 and x2
is equal to 0.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.500
This is just a special
case where I'm making

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.300
them equal to 0 vector.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.340
If I want to get the 0 vector,
c1 is equal to 0/3.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.140
So c1 must be equal to 0.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.130
And c2 is equal to 0/7
minus 2/21 times 0.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.620
So c2 must also be equal to 0.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.540
So the only solution to this
was settings both of these

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.040
guys equal to 0.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.190
So S is also a linearly
independent set.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.700
 

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.240
So it spans r2, it's linearly
independent.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.610
So we can say definitively, that
S-- that the set S, the

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:46.280
set of vectors S is
a basis for r2.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.180
Now, is this the only
basis for r2?

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.530
Well I could draw a trivially
simple vector, set of vectors.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.310
I could do this one.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.950
Let me call it T.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:10.290
If I define T to be the set 1, 0
and 0, 1, does this span r2?

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.970
Let's say I want to generate
the-- I want to

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.420
get to x1 and x2.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.820
How can I construct that out
of these two vectors?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:27.850
Well, if I always just do x1
times 0, 1 plus x2 times 0, 1,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.970
that'll always give me x1, x2.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.380
So this definitely
does span r2.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.960
 

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.670
Is it linearly independent?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.260
I could show it to you.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.880
If you wanted to make this
equal to the 0 vector.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.630
 

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.900
If this is a 0 and this is 0,
then this has to be a 0 and

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.330
this has to be a 0.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.360
And that's kind of obvious.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.810
There's no way that you could
get one of the other vectors

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.700
by some multiple of
the other one.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.810
There's no way you could get a
1 here by multiplying this by

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.640
anything and vice versa.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.225
So it's also linearly
independent.

00:12:04.225 --> 00:12:09.960
 

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.260
And the whole reason why I
showed you this is because I

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.300
wanted to show you that look,
this set T spans r2.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.620
It's also linearly independent,
so T is also a

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:27.210
basis for r2.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.600
And I wanted to show you this
to show that if I look at a

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.980
vector subspace and r2 is a
valid subspace of itself.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.640
You can verify that.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.880
But if I have a subspace, it
doesn't have just one basis.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.290
It could have multiple bases.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.450
In fact, it normally
has infinite bases.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.880
So in this case, S is a valid
basis and T is also a valid

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.580
basis for r2.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.410
And actually, just so you know
what T is, the situation here,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.020
this is called a
standard basis.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:00.560
This is the standard basis.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.850
And this is what you're used
to dealing with in just

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.550
regular calculus or
physics class.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.450
And if you remember from physics
class, this is the

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:11.830
unit vector i and then this
is the unit vector j.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.180
And it's the standard basis for
two-dimensional Cartesian

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.320
coordinates.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.990
What's useful about a basis is
that you can always-- and it's

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.310
not just true of the standard
basis, is that you can

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.940
represent any vector
in your subspace.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.480
You can represent any vector
in your subspace by some

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.050
unique combination of the
vectors in your basis.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.220
So let me show you that.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:47.220
So let's say that the set v1,
v2, all the way to vn, let's

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:57.240
say that this is a basis for--
I don't know-- just some

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.480
subspace U.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.730
So this is a subspace.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.970
 

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.720
So that means that these guys
are linearly independent.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.640
And also means that the span of
these guys, or all of the

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.880
linear combinations of these
vectors, will get you all of

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.260
the vectors, all of the possible
components, all of

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.950
the difference members of U.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.370
Now what I want to show you is
each member of U can only be

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.300
uniquely defined by a unique set
of-- a unique combination

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:28.910
of these guys.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.520
Let me be clear about that.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.440
Let's say my vector a is a
member of our subspace U.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.370
That means that a can be
represented by some linear

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.730
combination of these guys.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.230
These guys span U.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.950
So that means that we can
represent our vector a as

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:52.010
being c1 times v1 plus
c2 times v2.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.430
These are vectors.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.930
All the way to cn times vn.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.860
Now I want to show you that this
is a unique combination.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:06.700
And to show that I'm going to
prove by contradiction.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.270
Let's say that there's
another combination.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.080
Let's say I could also represent
a by some other

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:17.410
combination, d1 times v2 plus
d2 times v2 plus all the way

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.940
to dn times vn.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.130
Now, what happens if I
subtract a from a?

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.410
I'm going to get the 0 vector.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.160
Let me subtract these
two things.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.880
If I subtract a from
a, a minus a is

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.970
clearly the 0 vector.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.250
It's clearly the 0 vector and
if I subtract this side from

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.250
that side, what do we get?

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.720
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:49.390
We get c1 minus d1 times v1 plus
c2 minus d2 times v2, all

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.400
the way to-- I'm at the point on
my board where it starts to

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.260
malfunction.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:16:00.510
All the way to c-- you can't
see it. cn minus vn.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.760
It's showing up somehow.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.890
 

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.070
cn minus-- no, it's
messing me up.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.670
Let me rewrite it on the left
right here where it's less

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.050
likely to mess up.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:16.580
The 0 vector, I'll write
it like that.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:23.920
Is equal to c1 minus d1 times
v1 plus all the way up to cn

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.740
minus dn times vn.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.570
I just subtracted the
vector by itself.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.510
Now, I told you that
these are a basis.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.520
There's two things that-- when
you say a basis, it says that

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.270
the span of these guys
makes the subspace.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.970
Or the span of these guys
is the subspace.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.040
And it also tells you that
these guys are linearly

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.360
independent.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.530
So if they're linearly
independent, the only solution

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.120
to this equation-- this is just
a constant times v1 plus

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.660
another constant times
v2, all the way to a

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.250
constant times vn.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.730
The only solution to this
equation is if each of these

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.490
constants equal 0.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.990
So all of those constants
have to be equal to 0.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.179
Over here before it messed up,
this has to equal 0, this has

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:10.910
to equal 0.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.440
That was a definition of
linear independence.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.220
And we know that this is a
linearly independent set.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.660
So if all of those constants are
equal to 0, then we know

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:25.170
that c1-- if this is equal to 0,
then c1 is equal to d1, c2

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.690
is equal to d2, all the way
to cn is equal to dn.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.660
So by the fact that it's
linearly independent, all of

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.250
these-- each of these constants
have to be equal to

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.540
each other.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.410
And that's our contradiction.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.280
I assume they're different, but
the linear independence

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.370
forced them to be the same.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.380
So if you have a basis for some
subspace, any member of

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.060
that subspace can be uniquely
determined by a unique

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.870
combination of those vectors.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:57.370
And just to hit the point home,
I told you that this was

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.270
a basis for r2.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.130
And my next question is,
and I just want to kind

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:02.980
of backtrack a bit.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.120
If I just added another vector
here, if I just added the

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.310
vector 1, 0, is S now
a basis for r2?

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.170
Well no, it clearly will
continue to span r2, but this

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.210
guy is redundant.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.330
This guy is in r2.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.760
And I already told you that
these two guys alone span r2.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.630
That anything in r2 can be
represented by a linear

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.800
combination of these two guys.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.160
This guy is clearly in r2, so
he can be represented by a

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.000
linear combination of
these two guys.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.660
So therefore, this is not a
linearly independent set.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.085
This is linearly dependent.

00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:41.830
 

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.250
And because it's literally
dependent, I have redundant

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.250
information here.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.700
And then this would no
longer be a basis.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.770
So in order for these to be a
basis I kind of have to create

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.620
the minimum set of vectors that
can span, or the most

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.500
efficient set of vectors that
can span, in this case, r2.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.969
