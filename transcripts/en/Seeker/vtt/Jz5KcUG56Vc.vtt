00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.509
Scientists have just grown one of the most
sophisticated mini brains in a petri dish!

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.549
But even crazier, the mini brain attached
itself to a spinal cord and muscle tissue

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:11.690
that twitched!

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.670
Granted, this tiny brain was about the size
of a lentil, but this still holds incredible

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.750
promise for the future of how we study our
brains.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.590
Now, you might be wondering why would we grow
brains in the first place.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.561
Well in the past, scientists were confined
to studying the brain during autopsies, but

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.599
observing a dead brain could only get us so
far.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.510
What neuroscientists really want to know is
how the human brain and nervous system develop.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.780
Yes, we have MRI’s, EEGs and CT scans etc.,
which capture brain activity and have taught

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.949
us a lot about what we know today.

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.820
But this new method brings us one step closer
to trying to understand the cause and possibly

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.390
find treatments for neurological disorders.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.820
Officially called, cerebral or brain organoids,
these 3D tissues are generated from human

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.850
stem cells which allow modelling of brain
development in vitro.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.620
Essentially allowing scientists to monitor
brain development in a petri dish.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.800
Now, we’ve been able to grow these organoids
for a number of years, but this is the first

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.380
time that we’ve been able to attach a spinal
cord to the tissue and see muscles contract.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.500
So how did they do it?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.130
Well, it all begins with stem cells taken
from skin samples.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.360
The stem cells are placed into 3D culture,
where they undergo the initial phases of embryonic

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
development.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.190
Next, they’re implanted in droplets of Matrigel,
a gel containing proteins that support the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.610
cells growth.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.930
The droplets were then placed into an orbital
shaker to help stimulate the stem cells to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.980
transform and grow into the ball-like clusters
of neural tissue.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.600
This is where researchers had been running
into problems.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.830
Previously, once the organoid reached a certain
size, its center wouldn’t get as many nutrients

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.760
or oxygen, putting an end to its growth.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.970
And This where the new research comes in.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.500
The scientists used an “air-liquid interface
culture”, allowing the tissue access to

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.410
the nutrient rich-liquid below and the oxygen
above.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.610
To demonstrate this, they used a tiny slice
of organoids on a porous membrane, surrounded

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.590
by a nutritious solution.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.020
This allowed for the mini-brain model to develop
in the dish for up to a year, thus producing

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.970
more sophisticated and mature organoids.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.790
The next step was to monitor the neural activity
of the mini brain model.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.310
In order to do that, the researchers placed
a spinal cord and some back muscle from a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.950
mouse’s embryo next to the mini brain to
observe whether or not its neurons would grow

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.910
out to connect with them.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.310
Over the next 2 to 3 weeks, the neurons did
just that and connected with the spinal cord

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.721
to send out electrical impulses.

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:41.360
And guess what happened?!

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.090
THE MUSCLES TWITCHED!

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.680
It’s the first time cerebral organoids had
demonstrated an ability to control muscle

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.680
movement.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.540
This new discovery also furthers our knowledge
into understanding how neurons connect up

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.220
inside the brain and with the spinal cord.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.900
The models can also allow scientists to monitor
the progression of certain neurological disorders

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.830
like schizophrenia and autism, conditions
where neuronal connections are believed to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.890
be damaged.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.650
But growing mini brains hasn’t come without
controversy.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.130
Some believe that regulations must be drawn
in order to address the future implications

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.930
of this type of research.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.860
For example, could these brains develop consciousness?

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.560
Well, at their current size, no.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.420
The mini-brain is still only pea-sized and
contains about a couple of million neurons,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.209
now I know that sounds small, but it’s actually
twice the number of neurons in a cockroach’s

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.209
brain.

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.040
Which suffice to say, is still pretty far
away from a fully developed human brain that

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.680
has over 80 BILLION neurons.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.130
Which is why the researchers acknowledge that
their mini brain is far from reaching consciousness.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.120
But what happens when these mini-brains continue
to grow in size and complexity, will it become

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.120
an issue then?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.750
It’s a question that some ethicists are
pushing to find the answer to especially as

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.120
the research is moving so quickly.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.310
But as research progresses, these miniature
brains can start helping us to better understand

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.850
the fundamental questions about our brains.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.980
So what do you think?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.660
Should we be growing brains in a petri dish?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.410
