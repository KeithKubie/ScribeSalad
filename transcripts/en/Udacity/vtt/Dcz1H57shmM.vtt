00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
As almost always with vertex cover, there is a number of possible solutions here,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.480
but the minimum vertex cover will always be of size 4.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.660
I'm going to give you the solution that I found.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.250
I could for example put this vertex here into the vertex cover. This one, this one, and this one.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.830
Then I have these edges covered by this vertex here.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.310
I have these edges covered by that vertex, and this vertex here covers these 2.

00:00:27.310 --> 99:59:59.000
This vertex here covers the rest.
