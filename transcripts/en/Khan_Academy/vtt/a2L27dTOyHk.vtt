00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:01.765
- [Voiceover] What I'd
like to do in this video

00:00:01.765 --> 00:00:03.747
is make an informal argument

00:00:03.747 --> 00:00:06.446
for why the formula for
the area of a circle

00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:09.525
is Pi r squared.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:10.523
And we're gonna start

00:00:10.523 --> 00:00:14.901
just with the most traditional
definition of the number Pi

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:16.563
and that's that and I'll just do it here

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:18.391
in a corner some place

00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.311
that Pi is equal to the ratio

00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:24.110
of the circumference and
the diameter of the circle

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.312
or the ratio of the circumference

00:00:25.312 --> 00:00:27.143
to the diameter of a circle

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:28.165
or, of course, we could write this

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:29.426
as ratio of the circumference

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:30.937
to, instead of the diameter,

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:32.919
I could write two times the radius

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:35.425
or I can multiply both sides
times two times the radius

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:38.605
and we get our traditional
formula for the circumference,

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.708
for the circumference of a circle,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.367
but once again, this literally
just comes straight out

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.936
of the definition for the number Pi.

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:49.449
The number Pi is defined as the ratio

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.551
between the circumference
and the diameter,

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.173
so you just multiply both sides out of it

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:55.845
times the diameter, you
get the circumference

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:59.317
is equal to Pi times the diameter.

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:01.899
Now, we have the circumference
formula right here,

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.721
once again, this comes out
of the definition of Pi,

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.388
but from this, I'd like to at
least get an intuitive feel

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:11.997
for why the area formula
is given by Pi r squared

00:01:11.997 --> 00:01:14.027
and to think about that,
we're going to approximate

00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:17.844
the area of polygons,
the areas of polygons,

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.213
that are inscribed in a circle.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.835
So over here, I have this, what's this?

00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:24.921
There's a five-sided
polygon right over here

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:28.491
and its area is going to be equal to,

00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:30.660
so the area of this polygon,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.692
it's going to be five times the area

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.017
of each of those triangles

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:36.486
and the area of each of those triangles,

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:39.402
the height is a, the base is b,

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:41.634
so it's going to be base times height

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:46.138
or height times base times 1/2.

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:48.655
So this, once again,
five times ab over two,

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.553
it's not that good of an approximation.

00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:54.801
This would be the area of
just the inscribed polygon,

00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:56.506
so we're definitely underestimating

00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:58.251
the area of the entire circle

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.853
or leaving out all of these little,

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.855
these little chunks
outside of the polygon,

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.603
but still inside of the circle.

00:02:03.603 --> 00:02:05.835
But as we add more size to the polygon,

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:08.368
we see that we're leaving out less.

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:09.666
We see, when we have now,

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.991
this is a one, two, three, four,

00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:14.951
five, six, seven-sided polygon,

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:17.971
we're leaving a little bit less.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.696
We're underestimating still,

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:21.474
but we're underestimating by less.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.976
This area that we're giving up

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.018
isn't as large as this
area right over here.

00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:29.315
So in this approximation,
we have, what did I say?

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.257
Seven triangles? One, two, three, four,

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:33.339
five, six, seven triangles.

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:34.901
And the area of each of those triangles

00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:38.094
is once again ab over two.

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:41.606
Now, a and b here are different
than a and b over here,

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:43.624
and notice what's happening.

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:45.482
As we increase,

00:02:45.482 --> 00:02:48.792
as we increase the number of triangles,

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:52.612
not only is it approximating
the area of the circle better,

00:02:52.612 --> 00:02:55.008
but a is getting longer.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.870
And you can see, you could imagine,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.028
as we increase many,
many, many more triangles,

00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:01.694
a is going to approach r.

00:03:01.694 --> 00:03:05.048
Now another thing to think
about is what is seven,

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:07.377
what is seven times b approaching?

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:09.426
So we're saying that a is approaching r

00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:12.268
as we add more of these
sides of the polygon,

00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:13.663
as we add more triangles,

00:03:13.663 --> 00:03:16.486
now what is the number of triangles

00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:19.577
times the base of the triangle,
what is that approaching?

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:22.849
Well this is going to
approach the perimeter of the,

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.904
or this is going to be the
perimeter of the polygon,

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:28.585
so seven times b is that plus,

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.087
let me actually, let me draw this,

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:33.900
it's that plus that

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.014
plus that,

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:35.935
I think you get the point,

00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:37.730
plus that,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.519
plus that,

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.354
plus that,

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.122
plus that.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:46.893
So once again, seven, let
me write this at seven,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.830
times b, that is the
perimeter of the polygon,

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.932
perimeter,

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:57.824
perimeter of the polygon.

00:03:57.824 --> 00:03:59.306
So think about what's happening.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.868
As we have more and more
sides of the polygon,

00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:06.082
our a, our height of
each of our triangles,

00:04:06.082 --> 00:04:09.058
is going to approach our radius,

00:04:09.058 --> 00:04:11.955
is going to approach the radius.

00:04:11.955 --> 00:04:14.164
It's going to get the height
of each of the triangles.

00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:15.165
It's gonna get longer and longer,

00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:16.867
it's gonna approach the radius as we have,

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:19.512
as we approach an infinite
number of triangles,

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:22.315
and then the number of polygons we have,

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:23.162
not the number of polygons,

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:26.449
the number of sides we
have times the bases,

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.665
that's going to be the
perimeter of the polygon

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:30.657
and as we add more and more sides,

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:31.698
as we add more and more sides,

00:04:31.698 --> 00:04:35.348
the perimeter of the polygon
is going to approach,

00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:38.781
is going to approach,

00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:41.764
is going to approach the
circumference of the circle.

00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:44.784
I'll write it out, circumference,

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.326
circumference,

00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:49.889
and you'll see that even
more clearly right over here.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.845
So, once again, how many
sides do I have here?

00:04:53.845 --> 00:04:57.665
I have one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:00.671
seven, eight, nine, 10 sides,

00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:03.404
so this, I can write the
perimeter of the polygon

00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:06.973
as 10 times b

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:11.344
and then if I multiply
that times a over two,

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.047
if I multiply that times,

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.391
we'll use another color.

00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:17.448
a over,

00:05:17.448 --> 00:05:18.938
let me just write it like this,

00:05:18.938 --> 00:05:22.421
times a over two,

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:25.792
I'm once again approximating
the area of the circle

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.174
'cause a times b over two,

00:05:28.174 --> 00:05:31.394
that's the area of each of these triangles

00:05:31.394 --> 00:05:33.933
and then I have 10 of these triangles,

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.309
but now let's think about
this more generally.

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:39.038
Let's think about it if I were to have n,

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.534
if I were to have an n-sided polygon,

00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:43.679
so I have n-sided polygon,

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:46.366
then I'd be approximating the area

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:50.480
as n times b,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.441
n times b,

00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:53.319
we see this right over here.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.665
When n is equal to 10,
you have 10 times b.

00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:58.191
So it's n times b

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.861
times a over two.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.373
Times a over two.

00:06:04.373 --> 00:06:06.005
I just wrote,

00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:07.697
this isn't something mysterious.

00:06:07.697 --> 00:06:11.253
The base times the height divided by two,

00:06:11.253 --> 00:06:12.197
this right over here,

00:06:12.197 --> 00:06:14.517
that's the area of each triangle

00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:16.949
and then I'm gonna have
n of these triangles,

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.856
so this is our approximation for the area,

00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:20.887
so let me write this,

00:06:20.887 --> 00:06:24.367
the area is going to be
approximately that right over there.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:27.656
It's going to be n, the
number of triangles I have,

00:06:27.656 --> 00:06:29.685
times the area of each triangle.

00:06:29.685 --> 00:06:30.881
Now what's going to happen,

00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:33.046
as n approaches infinity,

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:36.546
as I approach having an
infinite sided polygon,

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.304
as I have an infinite number of triangles,

00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:40.085
so let's just think this
through a little bit.

00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:41.216
'cause this is where it gets interesting.

00:06:41.216 --> 00:06:43.106
Now this is the informal argument.

00:06:43.106 --> 00:06:46.378
To do this better, I'd have to dig out

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:49.032
a little bit of calculus, but
this gives you the essence.

00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:50.844
So let's just think about what happens

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:54.069
as n approaches infinity.

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:56.275
So, as n approaches infinity,

00:06:56.275 --> 00:06:58.738
we've already said, as we
have more and more sides

00:06:58.738 --> 00:07:01.250
and we have more and more triangles,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.221
a approaches r,

00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:05.122
so let's write that down.

00:07:05.122 --> 00:07:07.773
So, a is going to approach r,

00:07:07.773 --> 00:07:11.785
the height of the triangles is
going to approach the radius

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:14.257
and what else is going to happen?

00:07:14.257 --> 00:07:18.309
Well, n times b, the
perimeter of the polygon,

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:19.850
the perimeter of the polygon

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.102
is going to approach the circumference.

00:07:22.102 --> 00:07:23.903
So, a is going to approach r

00:07:23.903 --> 00:07:28.385
and n times b is going to
approach the circumference,

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:30.274
is going to approach the circumference,

00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:31.816
or another way of thinking about it,

00:07:31.816 --> 00:07:33.748
if it's approaching the circumference,

00:07:33.748 --> 00:07:37.479
we could say that n times b

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.031
is going to approach
two Pi times the radius

00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:41.573
'cause that's what the circumference

00:07:41.573 --> 00:07:44.163
is going to be equal to.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:47.245
So, if a is approaching the radius

00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:50.736
and nb is approaching two Pi r,

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:53.667
well then, what is the entire,

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:56.668
what is the area of,

00:07:56.668 --> 00:07:59.217
what is the area of our polygon

00:07:59.217 --> 00:08:03.859
or what is the area of
our polygon going to,

00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:06.221
or, the area of our circle going to be?

00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:10.452
Well, it is going to approach,

00:08:10.452 --> 00:08:13.104
it is going, or I should
say, the area of our polygon

00:08:13.104 --> 00:08:14.515
is going to approach,

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:17.417
nb is going to approach two Pi r,

00:08:17.417 --> 00:08:19.419
nb is going to approach two Pi r.

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:21.901
Instead of nb, I'm writing two Pi r there.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:24.142
a is going to approach r.

00:08:24.142 --> 00:08:26.433
a is going to approach r,

00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:28.725
and then I'm dividing it,

00:08:28.725 --> 00:08:31.725
and then I am dividing it by two.

00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:33.792
So as n approaches infinity,

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:35.954
as we have infinite number
of sides of our polygon,

00:08:35.954 --> 00:08:37.726
an infinite number of triangles,

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.428
the area of our polygon
will approach this,

00:08:40.428 --> 00:08:42.129
which is equal to what?

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:43.720
Well you have two divided two

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.811
and then Pi r times r

00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:49.662
is equal to Pi r squared.

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:53.474
So as we approach having
infinite number of triangles

00:08:53.474 --> 00:08:55.326
and infinite, I wanna keep that there,

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.107
infinite number of sides,

00:08:57.107 --> 00:09:00.219
we see that we approach
the area of the circle

00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:02.341
and as we approach the area of the circle,

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.161
we are approaching Pi r squared.

00:09:04.161 --> 00:09:06.023
So hopefully this gives
you an intuitive sense

00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:07.414
why this right over here

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:11.759
is the formula for the area of a circle.

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:14.136
You could think about it as the area

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:17.908
of an infinite sided polygon

00:09:17.908 --> 00:09:19.470
that is inscribed in the circle,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.042
which will be equal to
the area of the circle.
