00:00:03.784 --> 00:00:08.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.070
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
everybody to Talks at Google.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.440
Thank you for coming.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.730
My name is [? Egal. ?]
And today I'm

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.030
pleased to bring in
Dr. Nathalia Holt.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.050
A few words about Dr.
Holt before she jumps in.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.720
Nathalia, a fellow
Bostonian, is a former fellow

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.790
at the Reagan Institute of
Mass General Hospital, MIT,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.060
and Harvard University,
the University

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.630
of Southern California,
and Tulane University.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.050
She's a science
writer, and the author

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.690
of a highly acclaimed
book named "Cured,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.690
the People Who Defeated HIV."

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.000
Today she presents her new
book, "Rise of the Rocket

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.450
Girls," which looks like this.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.620
Her book does a
fine balancing act.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.450
On the one hand she lays forward
an untold, touching, diverse,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.520
and almost unbelievable story of
female rocket science pioneers

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.590
from the JPL Labs in
Pasadena, California.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.200
On the other hand,
she captures a time

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140
very different from ours.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.020
Or is it?

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.990
Let me just quote, "Motherhood,
the career she was formed for,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.170
loomed large,
believes one heroin.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.840
Schoolteacher, nurse, secretary.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.550
Those were the options
before her, ponders another."

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.760
Well, by November
9th 2016 the US of A

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.140
may be a tiny bit different
place, but for now

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.000
Dr. Nathalia Holt.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.816
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:48.070
NATHALIA HOLT: Thank you.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.420
I'm so excited to be
here today and talk

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.220
to you about "Rocket Girls."

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.890
I actually came across this
story in a very unusual way.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.320
In 2010 my husband and
I were expecting a baby.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.980
And we were having a really
difficult time coming up

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.440
with names.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.150
My husband finally
suggested Eleanor Frances.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.400
And I wasn't sure.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.460
The name's a little
old fashioned.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.160
And so I did what
parents do these days,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.030
and I Googled the name.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.310
And the person that
came up was a woman

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.790
named Eleanor Frances Helin.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.800
And there's this beautiful
picture of her in the 1960s.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.290
She's accepting
an award at NASA.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.080
And I was just shocked
by this picture,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.030
because I had no idea that women
worked at NASA at this time,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.500
much less as scientists.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.440
And so I wanted to learn more.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.920
And what I found was
that she wasn't alone.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.250
There was actually a large group
of women, all working at NASA.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.490
They started in the 1940s.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.950
And they were
hired as computers.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.050
So before all of the digital
devices we have today,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.550
a computer simply meant
a person who computes.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.720
And laboratories needed
to hire computers

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.510
to do all the calculations
in their laboratory.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.740
So these women started out at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.120
in Pasadena, California.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.800
And this is a laboratory
of misfits really.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.890
It's a group that was
started by the Suicide Squad.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.690
And some of them were
students at Caltech.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.110
Some of them weren't.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.130
But they did a whole number
of reckless experiments

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.640
at that university.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.780
They ruined landscaping.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.650
They mixed nitrous
dioxide with wood alcohol

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.440
inside one of the buildings,
creating a toxic gas that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.180
ended up completely rusting
a brand new, expensive wind

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.320
tunnel.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.760
And then finally, they blasted
off the side of a building

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.320
with one of their experiments.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.010
And at this point
Caltech had enough.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.110
They said OK, you
guys have to leave.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.500
So they went out to this
isolated canyon in Pasadena

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.060
and started doing their
experiments there.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.160
And at the time
rocket science was

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.650
considered a fringe science.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.650
You would never want to call
yourself a rocket scientist.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.330
It just wasn't something
that was respected.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.170
And there was this
very pervasive feeling

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.100
in the scientific community
that the work they were doing

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.130
would amount to
nothing, and that it

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.830
would be impossible for a rocket
to ever leave the atmosphere.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.480
So they continued
their experiments.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.030
And then remarkably enough,
in 1939 they got a small grant

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.160
from the US government.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.660
And this was actually
the first time

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.399
the government was investing
in rocket research.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.089
And with this money they
hired two computers.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.880
They hired friends of theirs,
a husband and wife team

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.200
named Barbie and
Richard Canright.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.040
They were both
very good at math.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.530
And so altogether
the Suicide Squad

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.610
started working on
something called JATO,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.090
or Jet Assisted
Take Off, where they

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.050
strapped rockets on to
airplanes and then ignited them.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.020
And they ended up having
some success here.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.160
So here's a team with
one of their airplanes.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.216
And you can see
Barbie on the far end.

00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:49.340
She's the one in the skirt.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.430
So pretty easy to pick out.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.430
And because of
their success they

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.220
were able to get another grant.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.650
And they were using this
technology now to lift bombers.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.650
So with this new
grant Richard Canright

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.700
was promoted to engineer.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.370
But Barbie was not.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.940
And this was just to be
expected at the time.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.930
Women were not engineers.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.720
And she was really very happy
to have her job as a computer.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.450
In the 1940s there were
so few options for women

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.350
interested in math and science.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.670
And so she felt very fortunate
to have this position.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.170
So with Richard promoted the
lab hired a few more computers.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.430
They hired a man and two women.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.830
And one of those women
was named Macy Roberts.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.210
Now, Macy was a
lot older than most

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.880
of these young,
crazy, reckless people

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.250
at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.940
And so the director
ended up, in 1942,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.310
making her supervisor of
the computing section.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.470
And she decided that although
men applied to her group,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.950
she wasn't going
to hire any men.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.970
She wanted it to be all women.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.750
And so today this would
be a lawsuit of course.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.880
But back then the
idea was that she

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.760
wanted to create this really
cohesive family group.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.270
And she worried that if
she hired men they simply

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.800
wouldn't listen to her.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.510
And so she hired a lot of women.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.160
And these women came from all
different kinds of backgrounds,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.090
all different education.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.370
But what I found when
I interviewed them,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.360
and many of them are
still alive today,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.320
is that they all loved math.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.460
They just had a passion for it.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.180
So the education, many of them
only had high school degrees.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.530
And at the time college degrees
weren't really a prerequisite.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.620
So this wasn't a big deal.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.160
But some of them
did have degrees.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.150
One of those is this woman
here named Janez Lawson.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.210
She was the first
African-American hired

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.640
in a technical position at JPL.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.470
And she had a degree in
chemical engineering from UCLA.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.130
So today she would have just
been hired as an engineer.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.760
But back then she was
hired as a computer.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.930
So these women all
worked together.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.810
They worked mostly
with paper and pencil,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.000
but they also had these really
clunky Friden calculators.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.190
And these calculators
look really complicated,

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.440
but they could do very little.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.620
They could do sort of basic
addition, subtraction.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.960
Later models could
do square roots.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.120
And the women would have
races with these calculators

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.587
to see who could do the
equations the fastest.

00:07:14.587 --> 00:07:16.670
But they really took a lot
of pride in their work.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.420
And they felt like they were
on par with the male engineers.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.740
They felt very respected
in their positions.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.230
Even though, of course, they
were paid quite a bit less.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.190
And so the women were
doing calculations

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.340
for early missiles.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.730
They were working on the
Corporal, the Sargent missile.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.690
And at the lab the
feeling was that they

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.430
didn't want to work
on weaponry, but they

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.080
had to to pay the bills.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.820
But what they really wanted
to do was space exploration.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.310
There simply wasn't
money in that.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.340
But slowly they started
using this weaponry,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.540
and twisting the
calculations they had made

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.210
for missiles into exploration.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.540
And so we see this on
September 20th, 1956,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.010
when the women used their
calculations for a big rocket.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.640
And what they end up doing is
they take their calculations

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.120
for the Sergeant missile.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.620
But they don't use
the full missile.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.670
They take a small model
of it that the women

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.030
called Baby Sergeants, and
they strapped them together

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.120
like this.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.940
And they put them
on different stages.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.570
So they make three different
stages strapped together

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.150
with these Baby Sergeants.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.430
They have a big
rocket on the bottom.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.750
And on September 20th,
1956, they fire this.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.590
And it's a really
big exciting moment

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.590
because they have so
much success here.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.059
They're able to lift off this
rocket, called Jupiter C,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:41.610
to an elevation of 3,335 miles,
which is a record at the time.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.000
And although they are
so excited by this

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.050
there is a bittersweet feeling
too, because at the top

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.650
are just sandbags.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.620
What they wanted to be doing
was launching a satellite.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.750
And they could have
in 1956, and it

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.100
would have been the
world's first satellite.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.870
But the contract had already
been given to the navy.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.570
So JPL just had to wait.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.860
On October 4th, 1957, the
Soviet Union launches Sputnik.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.970
And you can imagine how
frustrated they are at JPL.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.760
The women are just
seething because they

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.220
know that they could have
launched a satellite a year

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.440
before.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.350
But finally, when a second
Sputnik is launched,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.820
enough pressure is finally
put on the Eisenhower

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.910
administration
that they give JPL

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.170
the go ahead to do a satellite.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.900
And so they work on this.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.990
They take their Sergeant, Baby
Sergeants that are all strapped

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.760
together, they do
the exact same set up

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.410
as they had for Jupiter
C, but this time they

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.460
have Explorer 1, the
first American satellite,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.070
perched at the top.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.540
And on January 31, 1958,
they launch the rocket.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.330
And in the control
room that night

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.550
are several women who are
instrumental to the project.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.000
But probably none is more
important than this woman

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.660
here, Barbara Paulson.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.300
So she had already been working
in the lab for a decade.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.540
She started when
she was a teenager.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.730
And this night she
is the one plotting

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.860
the trajectory of the
satellite as it leaves Earth.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.120
And so she's sitting at the
light table with her paper

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.030
and pencil doing
this all by hand.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.100
And over her shoulder
are Richard Feynman,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.330
the famous physicist, and
the president of Caltech.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.950
And everyone in the room is just
waiting for her calculations

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.260
to know if this mission
is going to be a success.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.390
And when she finally calculates
that, yes, the satellite has

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.620
made it, the first American
satellite is a success,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.600
the room just erupts
in celebration.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.740
It is such an exciting
moment for Explorer 1.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.590
And in that moment
is the birth of NASA.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.460
Nothing will be the same now.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.040
So now the women
leave behind missiles.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.200
They leave behind
weaponry forever.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.900
And they begin working
on space exploration.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.540
And the hours change.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.450
Now they're working a
lot of really long days.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.572
They frequently have to work
24 hours during a launch.

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:58.280
They have to be there
in the control room

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.950
when a launch is happening.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.070
And this is all happening
at the same time

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.410
where they're at the age
they're getting married,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.790
they're starting families.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.200
So this is Barbara
Paulson in 1958.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.830
And there was no
maternity leave then.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.980
So there was really
this expectation

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.770
that you would have
to leave your job.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.290
In 1960 only 25% of mothers
worked outside the home.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.930
And so the women at JPL
would hide their pregnancies

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.160
as long as they could,
knowing that they might never

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.030
make it back.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.060
But at the same time that
they're becoming families

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.860
there's another threat looming.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.950
And those are IBMs.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.760
And what I found is that
at other NASA centers,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.770
when IBMs came in the
humans that worked

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.080
as computers lost their jobs.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.600
And this is frankly what I
expected when I first started

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.810
researching this project.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.080
I figured that the women at
JPL would probably end up

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.220
leaving once computers came in.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.440
But this didn't happen.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.950
Instead they kept their jobs.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.040
They were so valued.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.895
And there was so much
distrust of IBMs at the time.

00:12:05.895 --> 00:12:07.520
There was a feeling
that these machines

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.010
were really unreliable.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.770
So it became the women who
were sent to the IBM training

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:12.620
schools.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.242
They were the ones that learned
the early computing languages.

00:12:15.242 --> 00:12:17.450
And they were the ones that
became the first computer

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.240
programmers in the lab.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.270
So against my
assumptions, the women

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.210
stayed there
through the decades.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.820
And it was that computers that
was constantly changing around

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.560
them.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.070
And one exception is this
computer, an IBM 1620,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.300
that has a really special
relationship with the women.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.790
And it's kind of a big part
of the story in the book.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.670
The women named it [? Cora ?].

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.430
And she kind of becomes a
member of the women computers.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.920
She has her own little room, of
course, that's air conditioned.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.920
But they have a name plate
outside the door that

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.296
has the names of all the
women computers, and then

00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:51.420
[? Cora's ?] at the bottom.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.090
So she's very
important in all this.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.670
So while they're working on
this cutting edge technology,

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.960
they're also dealing with
gender norms of the day.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.040
And one of these
was beauty contests.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.340
So the lab did hold
these beauty contests.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.780
And the women even
participated in them.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.470
Barbara Paulson was a second
runner up and Miss Guided

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.630
Missile.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.480
And that contest
was later changed

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.870
to Queen of Outer Space.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.240
And these contests
just seem ridiculous.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.360
But yet, what I found
is that really in a way

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.880
they highlight the progressive
hiring policy of JPL.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.070
You couldn't have held a beauty
contest at any other NASA

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.980
center because they simply
didn't hire enough women.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.030
And they were also part of
all of these social events

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.080
the lab had that was
really different at JPL

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.600
than other NASA centers.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.530
There were constantly
dances and groups.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.550
And what I found was that the
employees spent so much time

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.170
together at work, and
then so much time together

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.730
in these social
events, that there

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.760
were many important friendships
that were forged here.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.540
And when it came time
for male engineers

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.690
to write up their
findings and to publish,

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.200
they often included
their female colleagues

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.910
on these publications.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.640
And this was just
not done at the time.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.980
This was so unusual.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.120
And it really changed the
longevity of their careers.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.940
So one of my favorite
beauty contest stories

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.340
is the Queen of
Outer Space in 1964.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.840
And so at the time
they were working

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.170
on something called the Ranger.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.650
And so these were early
probes to the moon.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.880
They were trying to find
a landing site that would

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.880
be suitable for astronauts.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.010
And there was a lot of
tension happening in the lab

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.030
then, because while they had
to do these moon missions,

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.570
the real focus for
many of the engineers

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.150
and scientists at the
lab were for the planets.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.600
They felt that the moon
was not interesting.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.390
It wasn't scientifically
important.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.960
And what they wanted to do was
to get a spacecraft to Venus.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.990
And so there were actually
competing missions

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.330
at the time to the
moon and to Venus.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.680
And much attention
from moon missions

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.160
ended up getting
diverted to the planets.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.880
And because of this what
we see is just failure

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.010
after failure of these
Ranger missions to the moon.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.480
And Ranger 6 was a big moment.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.830
They're waiting for the
lander to land on the moon.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.800
They're trying to see if they
can pick the right landing

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.340
site that can support a lander,
and can support astronauts

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.770
in the future.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.550
And so many of the
NASA administrators

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:28.810
are waiting in Washington
DC until they get word.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.710
And President Johnson
is on the line.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.820
They're waiting for the
signal to come through.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.320
And as they're
waiting they suddenly

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.262
hear breaking in, "Spray on Avon
and walk in fragrant beauty."

00:15:39.262 --> 00:15:40.720
And it turns out
that they actually

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.370
crossed feeds with the Miss
Outer Space contest at JPL

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.040
during this.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.660
So this a very embarrassing
moment for JPL,

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.520
but even more
embarrassing is the fact

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.690
that Ranger 6 never makes it.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.400
It crashes.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.500
They still have another
failure on their hands.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.100
And now they're
really at the end.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.680
And NASA tells them, if
you can't make this work,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.612
if you can't make this
next mission a success,

00:16:03.612 --> 00:16:05.320
we're just going to
scrap the whole thing

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.440
and you're not going to
be a part of this at all.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.910
And so finally Ranger 7 lands.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.140
It is a success.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.320
And they're able
to get the pictures

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.300
from the Sea of
Tranquility and realize

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.470
that, yes, this is a perfect
spot for astronauts to land.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.430
And this, of course, happens
in 1969 with Apollo 11.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.960
And the women's fingerprints
are all over this mission.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.580
The Saturn 5 rocket
that started it

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.390
was a big part of building
on what the women did.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.870
The fuel that was in
the rockets was all

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.460
developed from the
women's calculations.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.020
And even those first
words, "One small step,"

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.120
was made possible because
of the Deep Space Network

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.510
that the women built.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.650
So the other momentous
thing that happened in 1969

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.510
was the women finally
became engineers.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.910
This is a really big moment now.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.890
They're no longer computers.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.970
They've gotten a raise.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.330
They've gotten the prestige
of being engineers.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.200
And one of these women
is named Helen Ling.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.190
And she had an
amazing career at JPL.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.790
After Macy Roberts retired
she became supervisor.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.700
And she was a big force
in bringing women back

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.609
after they'd had a baby.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.819
She was the one that would
do the calls to women

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.400
and ask if they wanted
to come back to the lab.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.180
And she presented a very
strong example of this herself,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.270
because before any
maternity leave

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.310
was able to sort of scrap
together enough vacation time

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.040
to take six weeks off after
the birth of her second child

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.230
and come back to the lab.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.130
And so it's really
because of her

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.150
that they created this culture
of working mothers at JPL.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.070
And now by the late '60s
she's on a new mission.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.780
She's decided that
she really wants

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.260
to increase the number of
women engineers at JPL.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.270
And the way she does this is she
finds women who are very bright

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.910
but don't have degrees
in engineering.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.630
They have bachelor's degrees in
math, or in computer science.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.470
She hires them and
then encourages

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.340
them to go to night school.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.700
And because of
this policy, which

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.620
was really much like Macy
Roberts of hiring as many women

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.650
as she could, she was able to
fill the lab with engineers.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.790
And one of those women
is named Sylvia Miller.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.110
So Sylvia was hired as a
computer, kind of right

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.540
at the end of computers, and
then went to night school

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.310
for engineering.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.430
And one of the early projects
she worked on in the '70s

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.740
was called the grand tour.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.460
And this was a really
exciting project

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.490
to explore the solar system.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.320
But unfortunately
NASA at that time

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.060
was undergoing
massive budget cuts.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.100
So they slashed the project.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.650
And what Sylvia and her
colleagues in this picture did

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.090
is they decided that they
didn't want to give up on this.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.340
So they came in one weekend
and they designed this really

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.250
audacious trajectory to go
explore the solar system.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.860
And what they did
was they figured out

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.650
a way to use something
called gravity assist

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.200
to move from planet to planet.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.550
So they would send a
spacecraft out, and then

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.590
use the gravitational
pull of a planet

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:06.062
to spin it around and send
it off to the next planet.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.520
And they kept this
all under wraps.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.395
They didn't want to tell
anyone, because they

00:19:09.395 --> 00:19:11.940
feared that if they told
the administrators what

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.710
they were doing the project
would just get canceled.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.770
And so this mission
eventually became Voyager.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.670
And it's because of
this mission that we

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.810
have all of these
beautiful glimpses

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.370
into the planets of
our solar system.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.740
And one of the Voyagers has
even left our solar system

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.730
and entered interstellar space.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.490
It's the first human
made object to do so.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.900
And after working on this
Sylvia became director

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.690
of the Mars program office.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.762
And so she worked with
many of the other women who

00:19:42.762 --> 00:19:43.595
were once computers.

00:19:43.595 --> 00:19:47.090
So Barbara Paulson, and
Sue Finley, and Helen Ling.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.040
And that large group.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.880
And they sent many rovers to
the red planet, some of which

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.390
are still roaming today
with all of their programs

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.830
inside of them.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.530
And it really is incredible how
long their careers have been.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.660
They've been 50 year
careers at NASA.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.060
And in 2013 I held this
reunion of the women

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.460
at JPL, where we brought
back as many of the women

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.300
as we could to the lab.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.260
And I was really shocked to find
how little recognition there

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.910
has been of their work.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.980
In 2008 NASA held a big
gala in honor of Explorer 1,

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.766
the first American satellite.

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:27.390
But they didn't invite the women
who were a part of that night,

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.100
not even Barbara Paulson
who was such a critical part

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.720
of that mission's success.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.220
But probably the most tragic
of the stories is Sue Finley.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.660
So Sue Finley was hired
in 1958 by Macy Roberts.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.620
And she is NASA's longest
serving female employee.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.490
But in 2004 NASA
decided that if you

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.930
don't hold a bachelor's degree
you can't be an engineer.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.170
And Sue Finley, who
was hired at a time

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.600
before bachelor degrees
were really necessary,

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.880
was then demoted.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.550
And so her engineering
title was taken away,

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.170
and she was put on
an hourly salary.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.400
Despite this, she
loves being in the lab.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.910
She's currently working on
Juno, our mission to Jupiter.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:15.310
And really the only sad part for
her is filling out timecards.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.320
She loves her job and her
work that she's doing.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.070
So writing this book I feel
is important for bringing

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.030
recognition to these women
who really deserve it.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.450
But it's also important for
women in technology today.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.140
We're seeing a very
sad situation, where

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:35.020
in 1984 37% of all bachelor's
degrees in computer science

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.780
were conferred to women,
and today that number

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.160
has dropped to 18%.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.720
So my hope is that these stories
can serve as an inspiration

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.260
to women that are interested in
pursuing these careers today.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.840
So we did name my
daughter Eleanor Frances.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.860
And she is named, in part, for
a woman that I have never met

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.000
but whose story I hope will
one day inspire my daughter

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.470
to do some exciting things.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.812
Thanks so much.

00:22:02.812 --> 00:22:05.728
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:10.039 --> 00:22:11.330
AUDIENCE: That's a great story.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.070
Thanks.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.720
And as you implied,
it's not unique.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.500
You know, there are a lot
of other organizations

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.510
where the human computers,
mostly women, transitioned

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.930
into programming.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.650
IBM itself, for example,
a lot of famous women

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.240
from the sort of earlier
days of programming languages

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.090
and compilers, and so on.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.040
But, again, as you
point, that does

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.740
seem to be going
away, going backwards.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.907
Do you have any thoughts about
why, or how to address that?

00:22:41.907 --> 00:22:42.740
NATHALIA HOLT: Yeah.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.660
It's interesting.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.070
I think an interesting
case is Harvey Mudd.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.490
So in five years they increased
the number of women graduating

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:57.050
with degrees in computer science
from 12% to I believe 40%.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.700
And they made a
number of changes.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.170
They made changes
in the structure

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.480
of their introductory
computer science courses.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.040
They made some other changes
offering more research

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.360
opportunities and sending women
to a conference on females

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.170
in computer science.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.520
And I think it's probably
a combination of things.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.050
But it's nice if we can
look to programs like that,

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.620
and see the changes
they're making

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.180
that hopefully can inspire.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.150
I do think it's important
to have role models as well.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.240
I know for myself there's many
times when I've thought, well,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.570
if Barbara Paulson
did this in 1959,

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.420
I'm sure that I can
manage it today.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.918
So there is value
to that as well.

00:23:34.918 --> 00:23:38.830
AUDIENCE: You said a lot of
these women have retired since.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.330
Do you have a sense of have
they gone on to do other things,

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.576
or are they just, you
know, hanging out?

00:23:43.576 --> 00:23:46.130
NATHALIA HOLT: Oh, they had
very long careers at JPL.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.430
I mean, they had
50 year careers.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.050
So now they're mostly in
their late 80s, early 90s.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.520
So I mean, it's amazing
how active they are.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.730
And it's incredible how
vivid their memories are.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.530
I was really shocked
by that, just how

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.870
much detail they can
remember of how missions went

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.639
and what their life was like.

00:24:04.639 --> 00:24:05.180
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.513
I'm just trying to figure out
how to use that experience

00:24:07.513 --> 00:24:08.750
to motivate other people.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.260
I guess your book is
the way to do that.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.514
NATHALIA HOLT: Thanks.

00:24:12.514 --> 00:24:14.430
AUDIENCE: This may seem
like a silly question,

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.837
but the women that
were hired initially

00:24:17.837 --> 00:24:19.670
because they were good
at math, how did they

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.590
become good at math?

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.510
I mean, women were
actively discouraged

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.370
from taking math courses.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.060
And math seems like it's
a little less accessible

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.440
than other subjects like
maybe history, or philosophy,

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.400
or something like that.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.770
What did they do to
gain their math skills?

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.630
NATHALIA HOLT: You
know, it's interesting,

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.700
because it's not
always that they

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.710
did that well in their classes,
but they really enjoyed math.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.480
And I heard over and over again
that they were the only girl

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.780
in their math classes.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.060
That was certainly a common
thread that went through.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.610
Most of them took as much math
as they could in high school.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.820
So I think it really just
comes down to their passion

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.270
for the subject and their
ability to pursue it.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.320
There's a few cases
where even women

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.420
that didn't graduate from
college, such as Sue Finley,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.290
she did take some college math.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.790
And she couldn't get
the math that she

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.110
needed at her women's college.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.310
So she ended up going
to a men's college

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.280
and taking courses there.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.020
So they found a
way to get it, even

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.400
if it wasn't as accessible as
it could have been at the time.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.920
Thank you so much for coming.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.570
[CLAPPING]
