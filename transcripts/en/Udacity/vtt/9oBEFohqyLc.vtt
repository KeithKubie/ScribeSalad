00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.939
My name is Ginny Foos, and I'm honored to be here. And it actually brings back

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.619
some really great memories. When I was ten,

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.350
I was on a television show outside of WGBH

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.650
in Boston, which is where I grew up. And I was one of five panelists that

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.060
had disabilities. And we, filmed for two years.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.678
And it was a real coming of age experience

00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:28.681
for me because, we were asked to sit on very hot

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:33.224
seats, talking about how do you feel about being different, how

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:36.963
do you feel about being teased. And not only was I

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:41.642
saving in psychological cost, I didn't have to see a shrink.

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:45.545
&gt;&gt; I was actually being paid for talking about my feelings. And

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:50.240
I really bonded with the other four individuals. And it was really neat.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.080
unfortunately, we did not stay on air for

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.040
the two years, but scholastic educational services picked us

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.930
up. And this was right when the mainstreaming act

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.492
was really coming into play. When, when I started

00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:05.305
kindergarten, I was not allowed to go to the

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:07.250
local school. I had to go to a special

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.540
school, even though intellectually I'm no different than you

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.410
are. but the mainstreaming act took place in 1972.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.620
&gt;&gt; And by first grade, I was then able to go to a local public

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.550
school. So, jump ahead seven or eight years,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.830
which was when we were filming Feeling Free.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.470
The, the thought was, we, we have to

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.440
expose the public to diversity so that students

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.380
can become comfortable when these other students are

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.350
suddenly sitting in the desk next to theirs.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.140
&gt;&gt; Right!

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.210
&gt;&gt; So it was a really neat experience,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.490
my other panelists, or, friends, I guess, would be the better word. we, we, we

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.280
did audition, and, so, they were able

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.500
to get some of really awesome articulate kids.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.263
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:55.812
&gt;&gt; One had cerebral palsy, one became blind

00:01:55.812 --> 00:01:59.260
during the process of our show. And so

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.680
that was very interesting to befriend somebody that's,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.940
I, when I first met her could see.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.720
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.480
&gt;&gt; And when we

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.199
finished, could not see at all.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.220
&gt;&gt; And remind me again, how old were you at this time?

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.830
&gt;&gt; I was, ten. Ten to 12. Right in those crucial years, yeah.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.040
&gt;&gt; So at, was this the same age where you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.790
were noticing, I mean, how old were you when you,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.780
sort of, noticed yourself that you were different from other

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.530
people. And maybe you, when your parents also noticed this.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.060
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question. my

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.580
parents were given the diagnosis when I was

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.660
18 months old. And they wonder to this day

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.570
whether or not that was a delayed diagnosis that

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.250
no one had the heart to break it to them. now this was pre DNA testing, this was

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.200
all based on X-rays, and femur length. Femur is

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.010
what they really go for in measuring the femur

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.470
length. and there we were sitting in Boston, one

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.310
of the top medical communities in the country and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.820
the gentleman that gave my parents the, diagnosis

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.745
was T Barry Brazefin, who was sort of the

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:08.310
Dr. Spock, not the Sci Fi doctor Spock but

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.300
the sort of, the pediatric voice of America in

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.520
the 70s. And so I love to tell people that I was diagnosed by that man, myself.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.380
So they knew when I was 18 months old.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.470
I think many little people like myself did not

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.280
come to their own realization until they're in school.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.373
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:27.850
&gt;&gt; Because that's when the teasing really starts.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.020
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.580
&gt;&gt; And the accessibility, if you will. Especially back then.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.960
You know we're talking about the 70's. There wasn't any

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.850
Americans with Disability Act. So that's when I was having

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.300
to struggle to, to access what my fellow students were accessing.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.300
&gt;&gt; Did you notice so,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.120
what kind of, experience did you have with

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.480
other students? Was it entirely negative from the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.870
beginning? I mean, did, were people, you know,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.940
were kids mean, were they, did they tease a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.740
lot, did they, you know, did the just

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.230
sort of look unsure, you know, seeing something different

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.550
from themselves, what kind of interaction was it,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.730
and did it change as you went through schooling?

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.410
&gt;&gt; luckily, I grew up in a very educated community.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.430
You know, 30 minutes away from MIT, Harvard, you know,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.310
all of the Ivy Leagues in Boston. and I think

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.560
that's, that speaks a lot to,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.090
kids and their val, you don't have value system but their manners and so forth.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.240
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.410
&gt;&gt; So I don't remember getting teased too much. I'm sure I did and how

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.120
much of that I have sort of put under the surface.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.175
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:47.790
&gt;&gt; And forgotten about. but I, I don't it, I have a tougher time even today

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.410
when I'm in an inner-city environment where my, the people surrounding me, don't

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.170
have the same etiquette. And don't have

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.120
the same education, the same exposure. And that's

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.630
really where I struggle more than where I grew up. In a suburb of Boston.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.850
&gt;&gt; Well,to get a bit more of that sort of educated thought and idea I

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.340
want you to tell us you know, as a medical condition of dwarfism

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.310
what is, what do you know is the cause of shorter stature? And in

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.000
particular in your case, what is the, what is the cause of, of this?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.870
&gt;&gt; Well, remember there are over 200 different types

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.690
of dwarfism, achondroplasia being the most common. So if

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.590
you were to meet another little person in your life,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.290
most likely they would have achondroplasia. So I can only

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.510
really speak to achondroplasia. it is a dominant gene, it

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.720
is also a mutation. So, what that means is, an

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.690
individual can have achondroplasia for two reasons. One would be

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.890
their parents have it, and it's been inherited as it

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.330
was with my children. The other would be, it's a

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.740
genetic mutation, which is a complete Unexplained event, which is

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.000
what it was for me. I, I'm the only little person in my family. My little

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.300
brother is six three and my parents, my

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.860
grandfather was a genologist so you can image

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.310
he spent a lot of time looking into this. and I am the only dwarf in my family

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.008
of origin. But I then went on to meet my husband who also has achodroplasia.

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:16.361
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:18.890
&gt;&gt; We got married and we

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.300
have three children. I gave birth to two of them and I flew to Moscow for the

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.180
third one. To adopt from an orphanage. who also

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.760
has achondroplasia but clearly not from me or my

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.590
husband, she, from all we know, which is

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.190
really not much, is a mutation as well, her

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.870
parents were average height and I suspect in Russia,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.960
it's a lot harder to be a little person.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.390
&gt;&gt; Sure

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.520
&gt;&gt; Are you familiar with the gene that

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.990
is actually mutated in most cases of achondroplasia?

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.610
&gt;&gt; The FR. The FGFR3 gene.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.000
&gt;&gt; That's it. That's what I am.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.890
&gt;&gt; okay.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.390
&gt;&gt; There's a reason I don't teach science. I'm, I'm an

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.850
English and drama teacher and Spanish teacher not a science teacher. So

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.400
yes, very familiar. I, I don't spend a whole lot of

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.310
time conversing about it. what is really, really cool is that when

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:19.520
the gene was discovered. In 1994. In 1992, the National Convention was in

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.890
San Francisco. I was eight months pregnant. We had both my in-laws there as well

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.590
as my parents, and when we have a National Convention that Little People of

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.710
America puts on. A gaggle of healthcare

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.490
providers fly in, that have specialized or have

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.690
an interest in, dwarfism. And so, they'll be no less

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.610
than 15 or 20 geneticists from around the country. Sometimes we

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.500
even have international geneticists. And we all volunteered ourselves for

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.430
blood draw, when I was eight months pregnant. And they sent me

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.520
home with a vial for umbilical blo, blood that I was,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.040
when I was going to give birth a month later

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.580
so that they could get umbilical cord blood. So, I

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.750
like to say we had a little bit of something

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.790
to do with the discovery of the gene two years later.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.570
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:18.550
&gt;&gt; Now, on that note I have two children that I gave birth to. One in

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:24.854
August of 1992, the other in November of 1997. The gene was discovered in

00:08:24.854 --> 00:08:31.911
1994 or 5. So that meant that my pregnancies were very, very different. In 1992,

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.278
the only diagnostic tool that they could use

00:08:35.278 --> 00:08:38.933
was ultrasound. And again, they were looking at

00:08:38.933 --> 00:08:44.067
the femur in the fetus And they could not measure that accurately until I was 24

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:49.930
weeks pregnant. So at that time, they told me, and I was actually being seen

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:55.990
by the gentleman that wrote the growth charts for fetuses at UCSF,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.980
and he was the one reading my film, my, my measurements, from the ultrasound.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.290
And he said, Jenny, this is a tough one. He said, that femur

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:11.670
is in the seventh percentile. And typically, if we're looking at a heterozygote.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.980
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.000
&gt;&gt; Meaning that the embryo fetus has gotten the gene

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.500
from one of you. That femur is going to be

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.070
over the tenth percentile. Right around, between the tenth

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.330
and the twentieth or thirtieth, or something. and you're

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.160
coming in at the seventh, and that makes us very

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.891
concerned, that perhaps you are carrying a homozygote. And

00:09:29.891 --> 00:09:34.210
a homozygote, what that means in, in lay term

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.620
is a double dominant. And in achondroplasia, they have

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.540
found that to be lethal. The baby is born and

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.730
lives no more than a week. Typically more

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.210
a matter of hours. Without life support. So

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:54.140
it was a really tough call. So, we went ahead and, and, went with what we

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.680
thought was right, and Alex was born, and

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.510
obviously he's still with us. He's 20 years

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.780
old, so he must be a heterozygote. Although he has had a lot of medical issues.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.160
&gt;&gt; True.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.780
&gt;&gt; jump ahead five years

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.730
later, and in between that, by the way,

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.570
I'd flew to Moscow to adopt the second child.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.620
I'm pregnant again with our now 15 year old,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.700
and I have an amniocentesis at ten weeks. And

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.570
within a week, I get a phone call

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.370
from a genetic counsellor at Baylor University in Texas

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.650
telling me, you have a heterozygote. 100% certainty. So

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.940
you can imagine the difference in the stress involved

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.490
around both pregnancies.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.520
&gt;&gt; So do you think it's a, in your mind, knowing

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.510
in advance, is a good thing. You want to know even

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.620
aside from your case. Cause there's also a possibility that if

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.885
you're two heterozygotes have children that neither that a child gets. But.

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:52.820
&gt;&gt; Does not get the gene.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.910
&gt;&gt; Does not get the gene.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.140
&gt;&gt; So what that means in lay terms is I could have had you.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.540
You could have been my child!

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.180
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.930
&gt;&gt; I would have been 15, but nonetheless. So there is as much

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.270
of a possibility that I would have what we would call an average sized

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.350
child or even an above average sized child. I have friends that are

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.370
my size, very good friends. Whose only child, a son, is six foot four.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.265
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:14.265 --> 00:11:17.150
&gt;&gt; So, I had as big of a chance of that as

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.820
I had of a lethal situation. Both of those being 25% chance.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.140
And then I had a 50% chance of having the hetrozygote where

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.110
the kid gets the gene from either me or my, or my husband.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.321
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.580
&gt;&gt; And that's what we wound up with.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.400
We did never, we never experienced the, homozygote, thankfully.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.740
&gt;&gt; Thankfully, yeah.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.530
&gt;&gt; Although I have many friends that have.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:42.150
&gt;&gt; What, so now I'd like to, just maybe talk a bit more about that, because

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.620
that seems like it could be a challenge.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.980
Just, I guess first, in your mind then knowing.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.110
Having this information. Being able to know this information up front, right, at

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.350
the beginning of your pregnancy early on. Is that something that's important to

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.740
you in the process? Was that something you were happy to know about

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.912
or do you wish you kind of couldn't find out maybe until later?

00:11:59.912 --> 00:12:03.010
&gt;&gt; I'm going to skirt that a little bit and I'm going to

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.790
talk about it in third person because it's such a personal choice.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.040
&gt;&gt; Sure. I'm going to tell you that I

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.780
have friends that fall into all of these different categories.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.222
I have one friend that buried three babies in

00:12:15.222 --> 00:12:17.862
five years because they kept coming up with that

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:21.440
25% chance. I have one friend who has two

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.400
average sized children. So they came up with that

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.420
25, the other 25% twice. and I have friends

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.180
that have said, oh, we'll never get pregnant. Because

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.990
we don't want a dwarf child. We went through

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.120
so much ourselves. We would never want that for our,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.500
a child. I have friends that say, I'm scared

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.840
to death of having an average-sized child, which I

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.250
don't understand because I teach high school. You know,

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.810
that is not a big deal. And I have these

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.000
great friends in L.A. whose son, as I just

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.400
told you, is six foot four. so, you know, this,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.910
this choice that we are now given, or the

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:03.620
access to this technology, maybe is, is very, very powerful.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.260
I'm going to tell you a quick story. We, we had a regional conference in Los

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:14.440
Angeles about a year ago. Three women, all in their twenties, all kind

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.150
of grew up together, by default, I mean not necessarily in the same town,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.850
but because they've been Little People of

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.280
America members all of their lives. All pregnant.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:31.640
Now, they all have had the testing. One of them did not want to have

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.810
the testing, for religious reasons. But, far

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.590
along into the pregnancy, decided. I don't want to

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.610
go through baby showers. I don't want to

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:45.660
decorate a nursery, unless. There's a reason to.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.940
So, it's not going to change anything about

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.690
the pregnancy, I'm going to go through the pregnancy,

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.180
but I need to know. And so she knew

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.820
she was carrying a double dominant. And there she was,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.680
with a smile on her face, with the other two

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.920
women, one of whom had already buried a double dominant,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.890
and was on her second try. And knew that

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.050
that one, I believe was going to be average size. And

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.090
then the third young woman, knew that she was having

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.780
a heterozygote dwarf and there they were all happy and

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:23.460
talking, and I just, the strength that the girl had that knew she had

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.640
a double domet inside of her, was just amazing. It gets a little bit more

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.700
sad. So, the baby lived a few hours, they waited the three months that they were

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:42.150
told to wait, They got pregnant again. And again, had the double dominant. And,

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.560
and kept it. And that's their own choice, and

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.993
aren't we lucky, in this country, that we have choices.

00:14:49.993 --> 00:14:54.530
&gt;&gt; Right. how much, I mean, I can't imagine, you know,

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.810
the, the strength and the sort of, the, having to go through

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:03.940
a situation like that personally. how much of the strength going through

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.270
the actual reproductive process, you know, the, the joys and the pains

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.270
of giving birth and, and the specifically in this

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.690
case you know, being able to have access to

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.400
this information and knowledge. When you do find out

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.150
information if it's not the information you want, how

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.100
much of that strength is derived from you personally

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:26.100
versus a community maybe of, of other people. of,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.220
of other little people talking to the other people

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.390
about this how, how is a community itself either

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.930
helped or hurt in any way?

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:39.280
&gt;&gt; Well again I can't speak from personal experience.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:49.350
you know I, this, this again, this technology is bittersweet. It really is. I

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.820
can say that, belonging to a support

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.990
group like Little People of America offers a

00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:01.870
tremendous amount of support. And we all know these statistics. We've been told

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.460
these statistics since. I knew what my odds were when I was ten years old. And

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.150
babysitting. And knew that I wanted to have

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.040
children. And I wanted to be a teacher. I.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.350
Did that influence my selection of mate? Did

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.610
I say to myself, oh I better not find,

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.130
I better not fall in love with another

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.920
achrondroplastic, because we have a 25% chance of having

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.270
a homozygote? Absolutely not. Do I ache for my

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:32.070
boys, who will most likely, by mere fact of,

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:37.180
numbers will wind up with achondroplastic woman? And this will be on

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.230
the table. Do I ache for them? Before they are even you know,

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.190
really dating? Absolutely, I ache for them. That this is a

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:51.038
reality in their life and so the support from the community is there.

00:16:51.038 --> 00:16:55.902
Now, again,

00:16:55.902 --> 00:16:59.210
if, the one thing I've learned over the years is just

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.730
because we're all little, does not mean we have the same politics.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.069
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:09.410
&gt;&gt; Does not mean we have the same religious convictions. And so

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.760
I actually have found myself in a very awkward position. One of

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.500
the reasons I'm sort of skirting away from. my position on this

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.140
is that one too many times I have stated my position on this

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.569
to another little person, who is just as educated about this as I am

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.680
about this as I am and they have gotten up off of the conversation and

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.850
walked away. And so, the support is

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:39.120
there. But, the naysayers, or the conviction, the convicted people are

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.810
also there. So it's, it's, it's a very very delicate discussion.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.330
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.130
When, when was your first introduction to this

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.970
community of, of other little people? did you find

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.660
that when you were still growing up as a

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.680
kid? Or is this more of something you were,

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.530
became, became more active in as an adult? I

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.340
suspect, that my parents came home after being delivered

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:08.480
the diagnosis by Brazelton, who probably gave them, not

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.730
the website, because there were no websites. But the

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.850
phone number of the local Little People of America,

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.600
which I will now from here on out call LPA

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.200
contact. And I suspect that by the time my

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.880
parents got home, because there were no cell phones back

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.150
then, they called the local contact and said, when

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.443
is your next get together? So, I have known, nothing

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:34.197
else but LPA. I was raised in LPA. And

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:37.026
the analogy that I use with new parents I'm often

00:18:37.026 --> 00:18:39.441
put in touch with, because I, I have sort

00:18:39.441 --> 00:18:41.925
of a, little bit of a handle in, in the

00:18:41.925 --> 00:18:44.685
medical community here in the bay area, both at

00:18:44.685 --> 00:18:49.032
Stafford, at UCSF, and at the children's hospital Oakland, everybody

00:18:49.032 --> 00:18:51.863
has my phone number. So I'm often, my husband

00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:54.347
and I are often put in the position to be

00:18:54.347 --> 00:18:57.038
that phone contact, or in this day of age, the

00:18:57.038 --> 00:19:02.180
email contact. And so the advice I give those people,

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.460
that originally, you know, the first Talk is typically

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.340
over the phone, or on the computer. It's not face

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.320
to face. Is I try to really stress the importance

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.000
of joining LPA right then and there. Because it's more

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.230
for the parents, at that point, than it is

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.560
for the kid. And the analogy that I use, is,

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.760
you know? We've all been on airplanes where the flight

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.130
attendant does her, his or her spiel. And they say.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.390
Parents in event of emergency put the oxygen on yourself

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.110
first and then assist your children. It's exactly the same

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.340
thing in any sort of support group as far as

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.090
I'm concerned. Those parents need to get to, educated, they

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.170
need to get their head wrapped around this, so that

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.620
when the kid does off to school at five years

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.230
old, and comes home in tears, because they couldn't reach

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.890
something. Because they were teased. because they couldn't reach the cafeteria

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.210
line, whatever. Those parents are ready to go. They've been told in advance

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.070
that those are the questions that kids are going to have. They have contacts of

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:09.000
other parents whose kids are a couple years older. And, it just doesn't,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.420
that's just the way it should be done. And, and often times, I'll be honest,

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:21.700
we have had very eye opening conversations with 40 somethings that were not

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:27.180
encouraged by their families To come to LPA. And they have now found us on their

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:34.085
own. And here they come. And often, with drink in hand at the dinnertime dance,

00:20:34.085 --> 00:20:36.530
they're, they've got their head in their

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.680
hands, saying, what did I miss? Where have

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.570
I been? And you know who they're mad at?

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.920
&gt;&gt; Their parents.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.368
&gt;&gt; Their parents.

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:49.930
&gt;&gt; So, Ginny, I just want to know a little bit more about you. Why don't

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.720
you Just tell me where you're from and I want to know what, what you do for fun.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.380
&gt;&gt; I grew up in a suburb of Boston called Lincoln,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.970
Massachusetts. we had, we, we, were on the train line and

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.180
I don't remember which line but I could. I was going

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.320
into Boston on my own when I was 12 years old.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:05.570
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.020
&gt;&gt; I

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.790
don't know if my parents would have allowed that in

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.150
this day of age but, so lots and lots of

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:15.010
fun. Great place to live. And then I moved to

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.990
Colorado. My father was transferred just as I was starting high

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.230
school. And that was a little bit unfortunate. It was

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.260
two weeks before high school started, and we were uprooted. it

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.510
was the best decision for my father but maybe not

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.020
for me so much, because, you know. it, it's hard for

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.370
a little person to break into a new situation. Especially right in the middle

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.500
of hi, at the beginning of high

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:42.170
school. but anyways, stayed in Colorado Springs. for

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:46.620
all for years, and then got out of Dodge. Colorado Springs and my politics do

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:52.949
not align well. So decided to come west to the bay area for college.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.340
and I've been here ever since. And, I believe that was about 25 years ago.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.850
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.910
&gt;&gt; As far as hobbies, I kind of try to get into whatever my teenage

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.535
and above children are into. So that we can maybe spend some time together.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:07.710
[LAUGH]

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.830
and I'm not And, I'm first in what it is

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.375
that they're talking about. So, that's in every, ever evolving process.

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:16.375
&gt;&gt;

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:16.023
[LAUGH].

00:22:16.023 --> 00:22:21.440
&gt;&gt; and no matter how hard I try I, I don't seem to be up to snuff enough. But

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.850
I, I by default I have to know how

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.050
to sew, I do sew. economically these days it doesn't

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.410
make sense to sew your clothes, it's cheaper to

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.260
buy them. But by default I have to alter clothes.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.360
So I, I am in front of my sewing machine

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.460
at least twice a month, altering pant, pant length and

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.510
sleeve length.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.170
&gt;&gt; So, what is that...I've never thought about that before, but

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.184
I mean, where, where do you shop? I mean, do you,

00:22:48.184 --> 00:22:50.070
are you, I mean, do you have to shop in different

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.110
areas or places for things than most people? I'm a good old

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:58.010
size eight, like 60% of women out there. And so I'm

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.480
buying the same stuff your mom's buying. I'm bringing it home and

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.375
cutting it off at the knee and probably tapering it a

00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:06.490
bit, 'because I don't want it this wide what it. You know

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.670
at the knee it would be this wide so I'm tapering

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.930
it. And I'm altering it, the same thing on the sleeves

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.960
&gt;&gt;

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.610
&gt;&gt; Because our torsos are not affected. As

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:15.700
you can see, you and I are pretty much.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.170
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Sitting

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:16.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:16.740
&gt;&gt; At the same height.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.590
&gt;&gt; That's really interesting. and what kinds of

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.310
hobbies do your kids get you into besides,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.090
&gt;&gt; they usually involve technology or soccer, so I'm,

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:32.990
I'm slowly learning the ropes on, social media. Soccer,

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.580
I'm just really struggling with it. I sort

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.280
of complain that there's a fraternity in my house

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.340
and I'm the outsider. dinnertime conversations always come

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.745
to soccer and I kind of disappear and nobody notices.

00:23:47.745 --> 00:23:48.745
&gt;&gt;

00:23:47.745 --> 00:23:49.600
[LAUGH]

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.740
Well in sort of in line with a lot

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.100
of these everyday items, I'm, I'm really curious and

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.920
I'm sure other people are too. What are, are

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.080
there any advantages to having a slightly shorter stature in

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.200
general? this is a very common question. And I

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.030
always say to myself, I gotta write it down.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.020
because I never, you know, am fully prepared. But

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.090
in this instance I, I did think about it some.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.650
let's start with the disadvantages. Cause I it, that, that's a

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:23.840
shorter list. The grocery store It's horrible. And I haven't quite

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.810
figured out the best time to go. If I were not

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.870
little, the best time to go, clearly, would be 6:30 or 7:00

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.420
in the morning, when I'm awake because it's not crowded. But

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.220
it's a very bad time for me to go when it's

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.970
not crowded, because there aren't people in the aisles to turn

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.990
to and say, can you hand me that jar up there. So,

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.405
I think the compromise is more like 10

00:24:43.405 --> 00:24:45.870
a.m. You know, which unfortunately because I don't

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:51.250
work full time, I can do that. And, I can always pretty much count on waiting no

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.050
more than two or three minutes for somebody

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.890
to show up in the aisle. I'm not going to

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.700
go to customer service every time I need

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.870
help. You get very savvy at flirting with people.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.870
&gt;&gt;

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.354
[LAUGH]

00:25:00.354 --> 00:25:02.530
&gt;&gt; To get what you need. So I

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.790
will strike up a conversation instantly, with the

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.750
main motivation being that I need that can

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.040
of tomatoes at the top of the counter.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.040
&gt;&gt;

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.322
[LAUGH]

00:25:11.322 --> 00:25:17.360
&gt;&gt; other disadvantages, it really depends, its hard

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:23.510
to go into communities that are less educated and less mannered. Because

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.480
we are so comfortable in, in our community, which, granted,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.090
has gotten to know us. On so many different levels...

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:31.130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.160
&gt;&gt; Over the last 20 years. My husband and

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.240
I, both our careers, myself as a substitute teacher and

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.180
he as a an IT guy for small

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:45.270
businesses in our immediate area, we're very well known.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:45.595
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:25:45.595 --> 00:25:49.290
&gt;&gt; only because people don't forget us, you know. It's not

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.380
a comment on our personality. However, I've, been told that we sort

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:57.410
of have magnanimous personalities as well. so we get really

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:02.570
comfortable in our environment. And then when we step out to a different

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:08.110
environment and the reaction is totally inappropriate, it's, it's,

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.810
it's a slap in the face. It's a reminder.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.270
Can you, I mean if you're comfortable, can you

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.530
give us an example of a negative reaction that you.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.730
&gt;&gt; I actually can have, I can give you two. And, and, and they're a little

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:23.000
bit different. one of them was pure ignorance.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.850
There's nothing more upsetting to me than to be

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.320
in an environment where it's the adults. That are

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.020
grabbing the children and saying, look at the midget, come

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.900
here, come here Frankie, come look at the midget. I

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.590
can not believe that in this day of age that

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:43.710
still happening. But when I go into inner city environments,

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.260
in a grocery store, you know grocery stores are really

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.020
harsh places for me to be. Not only because of

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.910
the physical thing but you're trapped. You know, you're in

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.750
a grocery store line, and you can't go

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.000
anywhere, and you've got kids with their fingers

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.650
right, five feet away from you. And you're

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:06.020
trapped. So that is definitely, you know, hard. The

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.100
other example of ignorance was an educated ignorance,

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.350
if I dare say. The five of us

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.723
were on our bikes in San Francisco by

00:27:14.723 --> 00:27:17.950
the Palace of Fine Arts. Like we're riding our

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:24.015
bikes around, and we rode in front of a tour bus

00:27:24.015 --> 00:27:28.950
from, with tourists from another country, that their cultural

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.710
norm is to be curious, and to be scientific. And they

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:38.250
forget appropriate behavior in that quest for

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:43.090
curiosity! And so, we can pretty much assure that when we go by

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:48.350
a tour bus, of, or a group of tourists from other countries. Those video cameras

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:53.110
are trained on us like snipers. And my husband has gotten to

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:57.690
the point. He's a very very patient man. But he will walk up right

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:02.650
to the camera, and say you will delete that picture. He gets very upset.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:03.380
&gt;&gt; I imagine.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.750
&gt;&gt; And imagine having 50 of them on your family. You feel like there

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.570
are snipers on you.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:15.080
&gt;&gt; What's the difference in your reaction to how other people

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.760
respond to you? Versus how people may respond to your children. Is, are, are

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.800
your feelings about this trait different for yourself versus how you see

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.790
other people react to it maybe your children or other relatives or friends?

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.870
&gt;&gt; I am the biggest mama bear you will

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.900
ever meet. You mess with my kids watch out.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:39.470
&gt;&gt; Enough said. what

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:44.100
let's go back to some of the, some of, some of the advantages.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.802
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:28:44.802 --> 00:28:45.009
[LAUGH]

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:46.009
&gt;&gt;

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:45.228
[LAUGH]

00:28:45.228 --> 00:28:49.300
&gt;&gt; Because that's a longer list. It really is. advantages, let's

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.720
see. Well here's a hybrid. Why don't we do the hybrid first.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:52.960
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.560
&gt;&gt; The spotlight is always on. Fair enough.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.070
&gt;&gt; So you can be, entertaining. And the life

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.170
of the party. And everyone wants to talk to you.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.130
&gt;&gt; You could could get a, a special spot on Tales from the Genome.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.940
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.130
but let's say I've had a bad day. The spotlight's still there. I

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:19.940
actually have a deeper appreciation for public figures. Because by default,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:25.150
we have become public figures. I feel I,

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.230
I, can't imagine being somebody like Angelina Jolie

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.850
and Brad Pitt with their children. And talk

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:35.330
about being hunted. You know, and, and, not being able to go out for a meal.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:42.252
Without, the intrusion. So, that's the negative side of that spotlight.

00:29:42.252 --> 00:29:45.819
&gt;&gt; Well actually, and to go on a quick tangent, you

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:50.691
made me realize, you know, the way little people are portrayed in

00:29:50.691 --> 00:29:55.389
the media, what aspect, I mean, what are your thoughts on

00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:59.615
that? How, how are little people portrayed in your mind? Positive, negative,

00:29:59.615 --> 00:30:03.670
in-between, mix, and how do, what is your reaction to that?

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:09.630
&gt;&gt; Our Sidney Poitier is Peter Dinklage. I am so proud

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:15.500
of him. And I want, along with hundreds of other little people, mostly female by

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:20.660
the way, want to meet him. For better, for worse, he's not involved

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.670
with our group, and I can't comment as to why. I would say

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:33.150
he's quite busy these days he is the top billed actor on

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:39.160
one of the most popular TV shows right now. He has been consistantly on the show

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.530
from, I believe, day one. they're not killing him off, like they kill

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:49.714
off everybody else. He, he will be king. I don't follow the show, but I

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:52.512
have enough friends who are thinking, you're crazy.

00:30:52.512 --> 00:30:55.377
Why aren't you following the show? He's going to

00:30:55.377 --> 00:31:01.755
be king. And, I would like to, my husband is not into the blood and gore and

00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:08.340
sex to the degree that they are. But, I, I am keeping my eye on him. He

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:14.440
is our Sidney Poitier. And he is up for his second Emmy in two years. Right now.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:14.830
&gt;&gt; So

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.780
he's really been sort of a, for you. a

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.760
big pivotal figure. And, and a good image of

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.270
being, like. Everybody else. And he's super popular. and

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.990
it's, it's, it's almost not even. I don't want to say,

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.870
not noticed as a trait. But it's, it's not

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.080
important in who he is, necessarily, as far as, it

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.950
happens to be part of him. And so that

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.830
gives visibility to the trait, but the focus on him

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.210
is not because of his stature.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.145
&gt;&gt; Not in this particular

00:31:42.145 --> 00:31:42.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:42.590
show.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.570
&gt;&gt; Right. Exactly.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.060
&gt;&gt; he had sold himself to the devil a

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.170
couple a times. He's tried real hard in the interviews

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.800
that I've seen not to. I mean he has been

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.220
eating out of tuna fish cans for a, you know,

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.630
the beginning of his career. While offers of being

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.890
leprechauns and, and, Santa's elves and so much were being

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.200
thrown at him. He, he, really was keeping true to

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.850
himself. There are a couple of pieces of work that

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.910
I would prefer that he had not done. But

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.080
for the most part, he redeemed himself with Station

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:19.230
Agent, for which he got an Oscar and he, come to find out, he's been in a lot of

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.110
little stuff, I'm going home to watch, another tv

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.420
series he was in, seven episodes on, because I'm just

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.310
so curious. I think it's a shame that he

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:33.050
has not identified with our group, because he has so

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:39.410
much to offer. up and coming pep, students

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.520
that want to maybe delve into the film industry.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.200
&gt;&gt; Well, outside of Peter Dinklage, as far

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.590
as media portrayal goes. Even you know, maybe

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.620
not in the Hollywood sense, just in news

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.530
or TV, what else have you noticed about portrayal?

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.082
&gt;&gt; in the last decade, there has been a lot of curiosity

00:32:58.082 --> 00:33:01.220
with little people for a while. And I don't know if

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.790
I'm allowed to say this, We were nicknaming the TLC network

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:09.400
The Little Channel. Because they seemed heavily interested. At one point

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.720
there were five or six different series going on involving little people.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.435
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:33:13.435 --> 00:33:15.990
&gt;&gt; So now that we've, seem to have lost

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.060
our luster a bit. And we were one of them.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.270
But only for two episodes. Only for two. And

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.800
we. We get very defensive. What we did was not

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:29.010
reality TV. We, we, we, we prefer to call it documentary

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.250
TV, is what we did for two episodes. So, I, I

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.740
think the word has finally gotten out what the correct terminology

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.480
is, but just in case, let me educate you on that.

00:33:41.746 --> 00:33:49.290
terminology, as you may know, evolves in different groups. So in the

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:54.220
African American community, my mother, who was raised in the south in 30s and

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:59.850
40s was told to call that com, that population something. That I'm not even

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:06.810
comfortable speaking, but that's what they were called. And well they were

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:10.179
called Negros, not the other one, Negros. And you

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:12.920
know, I think when I came around to school

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.980
in the 70s, we were told no, the word

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.380
is black, and I've used the word black. And now

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.790
when I use the term black, I'm told, oh

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.239
no, it's African-American. But then it gets even more

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:28.460
confusing cause I have some African-American friends that say,

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.090
I wasn't born in Africa, I'm not African-American, I'm black.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.170
So, there's a lot of confusion around that, and then not to mention what the

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.440
rap stars are doing with the terminology. So,

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.996
the terminology. When, when Little People of America

00:34:42.996 --> 00:34:45.174
was first formed in 1957, the name

00:34:45.174 --> 00:34:49.835
was actually Midgets of America. It was primarily

00:34:49.835 --> 00:34:55.025
a venue for entertain, entertainers. and they kind

00:34:55.025 --> 00:34:57.215
of made light of the union, for lack

00:34:57.215 --> 00:35:00.940
of a better word. Well then slowly, educated,

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.110
serious people started joining the group. And one

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:08.680
of the first tasks I had, was to get rid of the word midget. Now what's

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:13.940
wrong with the word midget, for me and many others, it conjures up the image of

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.970
vaudeville, when they were called midget performers. And

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.210
they would go around, much like a travelling circus.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:27.530
And they would get on stage. And you would see, a little person

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:32.550
like myself, with a cigar hanging out of their mouth, and a diaper on.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.820
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.360
&gt;&gt; And making total fools of themselves. So when

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.570
I hear the word midget, that's what I conjure

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.190
up in my mind, as do, many in our

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.360
organizations. So I think the word is finally dying.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.370
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.630
&gt;&gt; occasionally

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.200
it will be used, In hockey leagues, it's

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.190
still used up in Canada, a, a, signifying the

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.490
younger kids I think, and and I, I think

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.630
the little people group up there has been really

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:05.130
working on that. so the terminology that I'm

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.410
comfortable with, long-winded answer, is I'm comfortable with little

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.950
person and I'm comfortable with dwarf, because that's what

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.810
I was raised with. Now, that's not to say

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.770
that my children, and they're okay with that too, but

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.440
maybe my grandchildren will have come up with a new term.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.480
&gt;&gt; Right. Actually, and, and I probably won't

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.050
include what I'm about to say, but you made

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.520
me think of it, and it's just so amazing

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.510
to make the connection that, y'know, I think in

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.200
the, as far as sexuality is concerned in the

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.620
gay community. I mean the evolution of those, of

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.680
the nomenclature of the name, and what people are

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.970
comfortable with and, in one way I'm fascinated with,

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:42.760
because it's a group identifier. And I honestly think people should,

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.650
y'know, we should respect groups enough to call them what they want

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.880
ot be called. You know, and I think in the gay community,

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.320
you know, there are people who live and die by the word

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.780
queer. you know, that's what they want to be called. They reclaimed

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.070
it. There are other people who identify as gay. There are other

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.970
people who identify, you know, you know I, I, in several different

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.550
ways. And the community argues about it all the time. You know,

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.030
internally you know, like, no we shouldn't use

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.170
this word, or we shouldn't use that word. And

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.000
then that can even be confusing for people in

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.825
the outside looking in cause then they're like well.

00:37:12.825 --> 00:37:13.820
&gt;&gt; What do we do?

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:19.010
&gt;&gt; What do we do? so it, it's amazing to parallels there between.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.420
&gt;&gt; That's that book that I want you to read.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm definitely going to check that out.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:26.450
&gt;&gt; So I have an adorable story to tell of my 15 year old who.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.620
I need to remind myself is indeed a

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.270
really great kid because sometimes I, I forget that.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.810
He was a, a coach this summer for

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:41.830
summer sports camp, he's very, very athletically minded and

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.980
unfortunately, do to being only four feet tall.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.350
is not athletically bodied. Now, put him amongst other

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.330
little people and he's going to bring home the gold

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.900
medals. But, when the population is one in 20000,

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.640
that's just not going to happen on a daily, weekly, it happens on an

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.480
annual basis. So next week, we're going to the world games for little

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.450
people, and I suspect that my 15 year old will be setting records

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.750
in all of the different events that he is going to be doing.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.060
&gt;&gt; So exciting.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.220
&gt;&gt; So he, with my urging, took this job over the

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:20.588
summer where he was a coach in training with a third party

00:38:20.588 --> 00:38:24.880
sports camp. And every day, I would say, okay,

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.920
you gotta give me one story, you know, based on

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.040
the day, tell me one little thing that happened.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.920
And one of these days, he came home, he says,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.290
well, something interesting happened today. So I stopped everything

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.470
I was doing, so I could listen. But you can't

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.360
ask too many questions, because then he closes up

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.830
again. He says, somebody asked what time it was, and

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:50.340
I pulled out my cell phone. And the kid said, what?

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.510
You have a cell phone? That's not fair. You're only eight.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.370
And Ben said, no I'm about to be 16, and the kid

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:05.695
said, oh, that's right you're a midget. And Ben said,

00:39:05.695 --> 00:39:08.800
[SOUND]

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.250
well actually Sammy, I'm, I'm not a midget. Midgets a

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:18.790
really mean word, I would rather you call me a dwarf.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.180
Or a little person but you know what, Sammy? You met

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.340
me two days ago so you should be calling me Ben.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.590
&gt;&gt; What a great answer.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.470
&gt;&gt; And I said, Ben, was there an audience for that

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:34.080
discussion? He said nope, there was just me and Sammy. And

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:39.700
I said, Ben, some'ing tells me, that when they all went home,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.140
Sammy got into the car and told his mother about the whole conversation. And Ben

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.390
said oh, mother, pfft. The next day, Sammy brought

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:54.640
Ben a card that was handwritten in cursive about how

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.626
great it was to have Ben as his coach, and that he would never use the M-word

00:39:59.626 --> 00:40:00.354
ever again.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.510
&gt;&gt; What is, what is driving a car like? I mean do you,

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.640
I mean, do you have any, like, do you have to have something?

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.800
&gt;&gt; What is driving your car like?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.270
&gt;&gt; Well I know, but I'm asking like, foot pedals though. Like, is that?

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.650
&gt;&gt; I do.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:10.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.940
&gt;&gt; I have we have extension pedals.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.580
&gt;&gt; Oh okay.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.872
&gt;&gt; That bolt on to the

00:40:15.872 --> 00:40:16.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.080
that you use. There are steel bars With,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.250
you know, C clamps and all that hardware

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.190
that I don't know what it's called. Takes

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.820
about 45 minutes to put them on. Not much

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:31.680
fun. takes about 10 minutes to take them off. So I could drive your car if I

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.270
brought my extra set of extension pedals and

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.860
I was totally limber and could fold myself up

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.210
[LAUGH]

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.080
into a small little ball and be upside-down with

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.090
my, hex wrenches and all that sort of stuff. And

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.100
if you wanted to drive my car, no problem, you

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.500
would just have to take them off, and I would

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.250
ask you very nicely to put them back on

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:54.490
when you were done. So, when I was going down

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.420
to Los Angeles to interview during college, with the you

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.670
know, the film industry, I rented a car in Burbank,

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:08.100
and I put them on myself in my business suit. And proceeded to get on the

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.450
five in Burbank, and about 300 yards between,

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.040
ahead of the intersection of the five and

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:23.230
the ten, my gas pedal falls off. And I have nowhere to go. Except for the

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.590
shoulder that really wasn't a shoulder. And I

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.920
had to drift, because there was no gas.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:33.310
So there was not enough room on the shoulder to open the driver's door for

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:39.050
somebody to come help me. So, Eventually, a

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:44.280
Latino guy pulls over, and between

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.880
his limited English. My limited Spanish. He offered to help. But he had to get

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.310
into this rental car and drive it with me in it. And drive it off

00:41:54.310 --> 00:42:01.150
of this freeway. In order to do it. So I was saying a few prayers at that

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.210
point, and everything was fine. He fixed it and

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.880
he followed me, he asked if he could follow

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.430
me to where I was going to make sure I got there. That was the last time I

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.938
ever put extension pedals on a rental car. Soon

00:42:14.938 --> 00:42:19.340
after that, the, I don't know if it was

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.380
Reagan or Bush, But one of them did something

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:27.020
very nice, called the Americans with Disabilities Act. And

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.490
that means, now, that, as long as I give

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:34.280
my rental car company 24 hours notice, they have

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.820
to have a car waiting for me with hand controls. So I just did it today as a

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.890
matter of fact for my trip next week, and

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.430
doesn't cost me any extra. I get to walk

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.660
right off that airplane into my rental car just

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:49.720
like you do. I had to get comfortable with driving

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.910
with hand controls, and it's hard. legal or not,

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.060
I used to, still maybe do use my cell phone

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.490
a little bit when I'm driving. And you can't

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.980
do that with hand controls because one hand is always

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.070
on the steering wheel. And the other hand is

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:08.199
on the mechanism that acts as your gas and brake.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.550
&gt;&gt; I want you to, if you can, list for me, if

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.310
you can, quickly, some advantages. Other

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:17.642
advantages. We sort of, we keep getting sidetracked

00:43:17.642 --> 00:43:17.746
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:17.746 --> 00:43:19.470
&gt;&gt; Well, a spotlight was the hybrid. Okay? So

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.960
let's work up from the, the, the spotlight thing.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.820
people remember me, that's kind of the spotlight, too.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.310
But if I want to jog somebody's memory over

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:31.529
the phone. And I'll say, hey, this is Ginny

00:43:31.529 --> 00:43:34.315
Foos, your little customer. Oh yes, how are you?

00:43:34.315 --> 00:43:35.880
[LAUGH]

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.180
So I get the information quicker.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.830
&gt;&gt; It's an identifier.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:42.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:48.520
&gt;&gt; When I get tickets to a show. I'm kind of stretching it a little

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.610
bit because I just identified the fact that you and I are sitting about the

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:56.410
same height. But, if somebody like really tall sits in front of me, I can't

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.890
enjoy the show. If people stand up, like they do in a concert, forget it,

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:05.780
I can't see anything. So I explain this. Now what's interesting is,

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.990
is that, Ticketmaster, when they say

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.370
disabled seating, they're really thinking about wheelchairs.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.345
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:44:13.345 --> 00:44:17.880
&gt;&gt; Because it's all about numbers. I mean the same thing with the Americans

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:22.090
with Disability Act. The, the architectural standards

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:26.020
that were set were for people in wheelchairs.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.470
So if I were to stand up right now next to

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:32.750
you, you and I would be about the same height, but you've

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:37.980
got long arms that I don't. So ATM slides, gas

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.890
station slides, you know all of that is meant for you in the wheelchair.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:43.461
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:44:43.461 --> 00:44:47.070
&gt;&gt; They're like three inches too tall for me. It's beginning to change a

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:51.150
bit. I'm having an easier time with the brand new gas pumps. I think

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.380
there's been enough yelling and screaming from the

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.180
dwarf population. And, and we've become more of an

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.720
advocacy group. Our current president is awesome and totally

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.190
into advocacy. So maybe his efforts are paying off.

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:07.875
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:16.010
&gt;&gt; But, so, so, long story short. I tend to ramble. the tickets,

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:19.030
I can say I need good tickets, and I get good tickets.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.020
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:26.700
&gt;&gt; so that's an advantage. we went camping recently, and I was able to stand

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.160
up in my tent and change my clothes, whereas the average size friends could not.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.960
&gt;&gt; Definitely encounter that problem before.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.220
&gt;&gt;

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.030
Anything. What about airplanes?

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Airplane travel is, I would

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.310
argue, more comfortable for me but the difference

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:54.460
is is that my feet are dangling. Look at right now and yours are not. So

00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:00.210
mine are going to maybe go to sleep, but when I've gone on a long flight,

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:05.620
if there happens to be an empty seat next to mine, I can actually lay down.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.620
&gt;&gt;

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:05.870
[LAUGH]

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.050
&gt;&gt; The flight attendants don't like it much, but

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:12.660
I can. If, I would do the exact same thing!

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.970
okay. let's, I want to pivot and ask two,

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.200
we're going to try to wrap up here, and I'll

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.150
ask two different questions. I'm going to ask two different

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:27.500
kinds of questions. first, I'm going to go with is,

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:32.870
knowing everything you know now as yourself

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.670
and with the current technologies even maybe thinking

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.110
about the possible advances in technologies that

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.770
we'll have in the future. in your life

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:45.210
time or even possibly beyond that. Would

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.580
you change, would you choose to be different?

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.520
And, sort of variation of that, you know,

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.786
if you could choose this for your children.

00:46:54.786 --> 00:46:59.348
how would you?

00:46:59.348 --> 00:47:05.540
&gt;&gt; I think, like, my first answer is, we call it the magic

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:10.610
pill. You know, if you had been able to take a magic pill to not be a dwarf.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.840
And I think my response to that magic

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.900
pill would have been different depending on what

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.680
decade of my life you were asking about.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.900
I would most likely have taken that magic

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.750
pill in middle school and probably high school. Prior to that, I don't think I

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:32.726
really care, I was just a kid I've never faced outright discrimination in my job

00:47:32.726 --> 00:47:33.440
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.750
So I think that magic pill may have

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.390
been taken between middle and high school but after

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:44.060
that you kind of get awfully comfortable in

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:49.010
your skin. So. I often ask the question when

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:51.470
I'm teaching. And by the way, every time

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:53.420
I go into a new classroom as a substitute

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.100
teacher. I almost have to address this. What's

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.880
funny is when I'm, if I'm teaching, a primary

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.820
grade, up to, like, second grade. The conversation lasts about two minutes.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.490
And then they all want to tell me about their dog, or something.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.340
If I go into high school, it, they can milk it for

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.450
a good 45 minutes. And then I get into a little bit

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:18.160
of trouble. because I don't do what I'm s, there to do.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.340
And I'm not quite sure if they're milking it because they would

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.340
prefer to talk about this and try to, you know, pull the

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.050
wool over my eyes, and not do the work that the teacher

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.460
has left for them, or if they're genuinely interested. I'd like to believe

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:34.570
it's, it's a combination of those two things. But the question I posed

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:39.920
to them is, do you think it's harder to be born disabled or

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.535
to become disabled later on in your life. And the people that are really

00:48:44.535 --> 00:48:44.780
[UNKNOWN]

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:50.020
and thinking have actually, it blows my mind, when they give me the answer that

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.570
I am looking for which is this. Most

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:56.830
definitely it's harder to become disabled because something

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.520
has been taken away from you. With

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.440
the exception, perhaps, of being blind or deaf.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.310
Because if you become blind later in life,

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.870
you know what things look like. So you

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:11.970
can reference that when you can no longer

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:15.190
see them. When, if you become deaf later

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:21.540
in life, you've learned how to talk. You can talk, and I just, I just want to

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.620
kiss them when they give that answer because

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:26.660
they truly are thinking about it. And so

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.170
when I think about our soldiers that come

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:35.672
home, disabled. I really feel for them. Especially soldiers

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:42.330
who were big, strong, buff guys and girls. And they no longer

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:47.700
are. And I, and I feel for them. And I'm so proud of them when they turn that

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.120
around and they become the wounded warriors.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.550
Or the wheelchair rugby team or something that

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:57.740
they're putting that energy in, they're channeling

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.230
it into a different realm, a positive realm.

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.730
&gt;&gt;

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.930
so let's end with, with one question on, You

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.610
know for, for someone it's it sounds like you

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.570
know, being a little person can have its challenges,

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.600
probably like most traits, regardless of what the specific trait

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.240
is. Going through middle school can always be rough

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.810
and everybody's at different stages in their life. When,

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:24.040
if you could give a message to. You know,

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.900
young people in particular but anybody who feels different specifically.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.030
It could be something so obvious like something like stature. It could

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:36.690
be something hidden. you know. What, what do you say to people who

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:41.020
have their own struggles. And particularly with your perspective. How, how would

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:45.360
you tell them to. To what's the best way to handle their struggle?

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:50.970
&gt;&gt; This is probably trademark, but it does get better.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:57.110
It's a catchy phrase, but it's so true.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:59.220
&gt;&gt; So, in general if, if you can

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.760
just get through middle school, and find some friends.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.200
&gt;&gt; And high school.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:02.770
&gt;&gt; And high school.

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:08.030
&gt;&gt; And you live in a progressive area like the bay area. Because I think that

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:11.030
if you, if you live in a sheltered,

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:16.860
less educated, conservative area, you're going to meet more obstacles.

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:20.590
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.220
I think that does it for us right now. Thank you so much.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:26.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.760
&gt;&gt; I appreciate it.
