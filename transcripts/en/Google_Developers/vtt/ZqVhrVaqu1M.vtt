[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:10.560
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.060
TODD KERPELMAN:
Hey, there I/O Live.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.476
Todd Kerpelman
here, and I am here

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:17.010
with Jen Tong, who is apparently
using the power of the cloud

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.780
to find new planets.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.115
No big deal.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.165
JEN TONG: Yeah, why not?

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:22.040
TODD KERPELMAN: Sure.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.040
So, Jen, what is going
on here at this booth?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.940
JEN TONG: So behind us,
we see Project PANOPTES,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.730
which is an open source project
that includes open source

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.380
hardware that is
composed entirely

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.020
of commercial,
off-the-shelf components.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.000
And it is intended
to be low-cost enough

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.860
for educational
institutions and hobby

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.500
astronomers to build
these robotic telescopes

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.925
and contribute to the project.

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:43.800
TODD KERPELMAN: And so
what happens once they

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.180
build these robotic telescopes?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.860
How are they discovering stars--

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.444
or planets, I should say?

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:49.860
JEN TONG: So the
way they discover

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.670
planets around other stars is
by combining their efforts using

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.730
the cloud.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.970
So what happens is, each
night, the telescopes

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.970
will all wake up
and look at the sky.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.850
And they'll get a bunch of
great images of the sky.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.560
And then, when the
day comes, they'll

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.240
go to sleep but not really.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.730
They're going to start uploading
all their data to Cloud

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.080
Platform.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.330
And from there, we can
combine all the data together,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.030
aggregate it, and
then, from that,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.507
we can infer the existence of
planets around other stars.

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:21.090
TODD KERPELMAN: And how do you
infer the existence of planets?

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.580
JEN TONG: So planets are
very hard to see directly,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.180
because their stars
are very bright,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
and there's lots of glare,
and they're very far away.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.370
In fact, a star only looks
like one pixel on the camera.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.540
So we have to use some
trickery to do that.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.320
So instead of looking
for the planet directly,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.920
we look for a
dimming of the star

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.050
when the planet moves
between us and the star,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.190
kind of like an eclipse.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.795
Or we call it a transit
in the more general case.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:48.420
TODD KERPELMAN: And
so the general idea

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.520
is you've got hundreds
of telescopes, all

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.740
around the world, taking
pictures of the night sky.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
They combine all those images
up to Google Cloud, which

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.720
analyzes them all and
looks for a star that

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.699
dims on a regular
enough basis that you

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.740
think it must be because
there's a planet passing

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.610
in front of it.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.750
JEN TONG: That is
exactly correct.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.520
So we're able to infer
that just by having

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.811
a whole bunch of samples from
having a very large fleet

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:08.699
of telescopes.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.630
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow,
that's very interesting.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.930
Now, if I remember from
being three years old,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.430
stars do twinkle.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.010
How can you tell that a
star is dimming because

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.420
of a planet passing in front
of it versus normal star

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.210
twinkling?

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.034
Which is totally
a technical term.

00:02:24.034 --> 00:02:25.200
JEN TONG: Totally technical.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.380
And that's a great
question, because that's

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.240
part of the stuff that
makes PANOPTES special.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.660
Because we're using commercial,
off-the-shelf cameras instead

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.814
of specialized
astronomy sensors,

00:02:35.814 --> 00:02:37.230
we have to compensate
for the fact

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.630
that those cameras are
designed to take color photos.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.700
Because when a camera
takes color photos,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.890
it filters some of the
light out using a thing

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.250
called a Bayer filter.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.272
And when the star twinkles, it
moves around that Bayer filter.

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:50.730
And it makes it much harder to
count the number of photons.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.480
Because we don't know
how much are getting

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.026
filtered out by
the Bayer filter.

00:02:54.026 --> 00:02:55.650
So the way we compensate
for that is we

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.810
look for another star,
in the same picture,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.630
that has the exact
same amount of twinkle.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.807
And from that, we can
do a relative brightness

00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:06.390
measurement, because we know how
bright those stars should be,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.100
because we can
identify the star.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.089
And that's how we kind of
cancel out the twinkle.

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.380
TODD KERPELMAN: And I'm
contractually obligated to ask,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.020
what awesome Google Cloud
Platform features are you using

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.609
to power Project PANOPTES?

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.650
JEN TONG: PANOPTES definitely
kind of illustrates

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.680
that boring uses of the cloud
can enable really cool stuff.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.470
So we are using
some simple stuff.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.870
We're using some of the
simple security controls.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.810
We're putting a service account
on each one of the devices,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.630
so we can control access
to a specific telescope,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.512
can access a specific part
of our storage buckets.

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:38.220
And then we're using
Google Cloud Storage

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.350
to store all of that data.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.865
And then we're aggregating
it on Google Compute Engine.

00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:44.490
TODD KERPELMAN: And
so the general idea

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.080
is anybody can get involved.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.940
They can build
their own telescope.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.500
And they can be part
of this project.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.580
And then, if they
find a star, they

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.820
can name it after themselves.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.310
Is that basically it?

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.360
JEN TONG: Well, naming stars
is a more complicated issue.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.460
And individual
PANOPTES telescopes

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.650
don't actually discover
a star themselves.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.750
It's kind of like a team that
collaboratively accomplishes

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.300
the goal.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.134
But yeah, anybody
can get involved.

00:04:07.134 --> 00:04:09.300
We especially like to work
with hobbyist astronomers

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.070
and educational
institutions, because we

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.920
want to kind of inspire a
love of astronomy in the youth

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.090
around the world.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.256
TODD KERPELMAN: That's good.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.180
And how would I get
started if I wanted to?

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.846
JEN TONG: So I encourage
you to go check

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:21.400
out projectpanoptes.org.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.400
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
so you heard it here.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.070
Go to projectpanoptes.org,
and you too

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.390
can name a star after you.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.030
Jen totally promised
that you can do that.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.330
I'm here with Sara Robinson.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.280
Sara, what is this that
we're looking at here?

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.990
SARA ROBINSON: We're looking
at a demo of our Cloud Machine

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.020
Learning APIs,
specifically highlighting

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.022
our Video API, Speech
API, and Translation API.

00:04:40.022 --> 00:04:41.990
So what these let
you do is they let

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.990
you access a pre-trained
machine learning model,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.230
with a single REST API
request, so you don't

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.510
need to know anything about
how machine learning works

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.231
to use them.

00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:50.230
TODD KERPELMAN: Awesome.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.170
And what is this game
that we have set up?

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.836
SARA ROBINSON: So
we're going to see how

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:55.270
we compare to our Video API.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.146
Shall we take a look?

00:04:56.146 --> 00:04:58.395
TODD KERPELMAN: You mean
like me against the computer?

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.630
SARA ROBINSON: You against
our pre-trained model.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.130
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
well, let's see how it goes.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.250
SARA ROBINSON: Are you
up for the challenge?

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.600
TODD KERPELMAN: I think so.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.310
What are we going
to do in this game?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.210
SARA ROBINSON: So
what we're going to do

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.960
is we're going to play a video.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.090
And I'm going to have you
try to annotate the video

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.360
as it's going.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.090
And then, when it's
done, we'll compare

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.030
the annotations you came up
with, with our Video API.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.290
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
I'm feeling confident.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.390
Let's see if I can
beat this computer.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.870
SARA ROBINSON: All right.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.960
TODD KERPELMAN: All
right, here we go.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.290
SARA ROBINSON: So let's
take a look at this video.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.630
And we're going to
play against the APIs.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.760
We're going to play
against the Video API.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.400
So when I hit Play,
type what you see.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.290
[BACKGROUND CROWD SOUNDS]

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.001
TODD KERPELMAN: Keys.

00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.224
Book.

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:39.691
Keys.

00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:44.883
A door, books, plane--
my typing is terrible.

00:05:44.883 --> 00:05:51.280
Woman, room, lost,
suitcase, goat.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.480
She's still lost.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.260
Wait, no, now she
has Google Trips.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.510
SARA ROBINSON: So we can
skip to the end of the video.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.730
TODD KERPELMAN:
But wait-- aw, OK.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.680
SARA ROBINSON: We won't
play the whole thing.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.550
But we saw about
half of the video.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.890
So we can see that
found 13 items.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.740
Video API found 89 items.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.240
But it was a valiant effort.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.370
TODD KERPELMAN: Once
again, beaten by a machine.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.290
SARA ROBINSON: Do you want to
take a look at the API response

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.610
in a little bit more detail?

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.350
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, let's
take a look at what we got here.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.850
SARA ROBINSON: So
this is everything

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.860
that the Video API found.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.800
So we can actually skip
to the points in the video

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.260
where it found these things.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.747
And then, if we want to look at
the JSON response from the API,

00:06:26.747 --> 00:06:27.580
we can do that here.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.950
So we can see all of the
different entities it picked up

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.690
in the video.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.180
And we can also take a look at
what the Speech API transcribed

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.940
from this video.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.430
So this is an
entire transcription

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.630
of the audio from that video
using our Speech-to-Text API.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.790
And we can even use this to skip
to various points in the video.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.989
And then finally, I'll
show our translation API.

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:54.280
So let's say you're a user
