00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:23.410
PROFESSOR: Today, big
announcement.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.650
Wednesday, no lecture.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.880
Instead, Celebration Part 2.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.370
And I'm going to say a
few words about it.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.840
There is the room assignments.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.310
I think they're the
same as last time.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.800
If you miss the exam because
of illness, there will be a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.090
make-up test on November
4th during class.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060
There's no weekly
quiz tomorrow.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.820
I'll be available for office
hours 4:00 to 5:30 this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.350
afternoon over here at 8-205.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.490
So a couple of things.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.820
I'm going to say few
words about the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.100
quiz, the test, rather.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.560
The celebration.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.820
So the coverage is going to go
starting from the time of the

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.170
last celebration up through now,
but I think in view of

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.720
the fact that we started defects
on Friday, and my

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.730
thanks go to Professor
Demkowicz, who jumped in the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.320
breach and lectured in my place
so that I could get

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.180
drawn into some of the
activities associated with the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.740
visit of the President.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.420
You will not have had the time
to go through your recitation

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.150
cycle on this new material.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.482
So I'm not going to put anything
on defects on the

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:34.300
exam, all right?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.000
So we'll go up through the end
of the unit on x-rays right up

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.470
through Bragg's Law,
indexing crystals.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.930
So that starting Friday,
defects.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.550
I'm not going to teach you
Friday, teach you Monday,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.140
examine you Wednesday
and Tuesday.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.670
Tomorrow I expect you're going
to have all sorts of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.830
review-oriented activities
in your recitation.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.700
So I don't want you torn between
trying to master a lot

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.660
of this new material, which is
quite different from what you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.230
had in high school, and at the
same time trying to have a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.940
catch up on capturing all that
material since the second

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.180
test.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.470
So that having been said,
I'm going to remind you.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.460
I'm going to basically say the
same thing I said before the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.380
first celebration, but we
need to be reminded.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.310
So what's the purpose
of the test?

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.040
The purpose of the test is to
give you a status report and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.280
send you a message.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.930
And there's really only two
answers here that we're

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.540
looking for.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.290
You're either going to get a
smiley face or you're going to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.170
get a frowny face.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.090
That's all it's about.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.710
I don't care whether it's
a 78 or a 75, but

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.130
hard 50 is a pass.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.530
And if you're not mastering the
material, I intend to tell

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.810
you so and then invite you in so
that we can figure out how

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.900
to get you through.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.500
Because everybody in this room
has the intellectual apparatus

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.730
to pass this class.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.120
Some of you just are not
managing your time well and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.890
you need to be told that.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.320
So we will tell you that.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.900
With one of these.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.640
That's going to be
the message.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.220
Go to the right room.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.340
Bring five things with you:
Periodic Table, table of

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.600
constants, your age sheet,
calculator, and a pen,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.190
something to write with.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.930
You'll write on the
question paper.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.000
No wireless devices.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.790
Shut them off.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.630
Don't even bring them.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.710
What do you need your
cell phone for?

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.756
Don't need it during a test.

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:31.190
We're going to start at 11:05
promptly and stop at 11:55.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.650
What's the strategy?

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.190
Read the entire paper.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.580
Try every question.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.660
You know this.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.100
You get part marks if
you write something.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.280
If you don't write
anything for the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.910
question, you get a zero.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.990
So try every question.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.420
And start with the easy one.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.520
The easy one for you may not
be the easy one for your

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.690
neighbor, but how do you know
what the easy one is?

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.790
I just put them down as they
came out of my mind.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.790
I didn't put them down in
ascending order of difficulty,

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.570
chronological order,
topical order.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.580
They're just--

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.830
they're there.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.155
Leave tracks, tell us how you
got to the answer, Work

00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:12.250
parametrically.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.500
Don't start plugging in numbers
on the first line,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.170
because if you make a
computational error on the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.540
first line and drag it through
the entire derivation, you'll

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.505
make a mess of things.

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:24.880
You'll have wavelengths, size
of distance here to Chicago,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.900
light moving at ten times
its normal speed

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.760
and stuff like that.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.510
It's no good.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.610
Focus on the question.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.570
Don't just say, oh, it's
something to do with x-rays,

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.110
just give me some stuff that
you memorized about x-rays,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.720
some stuff you wrote down in
your age sheet about x-rays.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.420
If it's not about the question
that we asked,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.120
I'll give you a zero.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.660
I don't care how
much you write.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.490
Write on the topic.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.890
And refer to electronic
structure.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.960
When you don't know what to say,
start talking to me about

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.170
electronic structure.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.820
That's the theme of chemistry.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.660
electronic structure
dictates behavior.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.510
So talk to me about electronic
structure.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.760
Do your own work.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.040
And lastly, it says something
here, oh, good luck.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.650
That's what it says.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.240
Good luck.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.380
So last day, Professor
Demkowicz

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.220
got to the line defects.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.680
He was talking to us about line
defects and how they have

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.220
an impact on behavior.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.780
So I wanted to pick up
the treatment there.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.690
So what's the whole issue
behind line defects?

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.790
Well, what line defects do is
they explain this anomalous

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.496
behavior where the measured
value of yield strength--

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.900
so I'm going to write
sigma y; sigma is

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.350
the symbol for strength.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:58.060
the yield strength as measured
is on the order of only about

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.120
1/10 of the theoretical value.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.010
It's only about 1/10 of the
theoretical value for the

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.280
yield strength.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.200
You might, say, wait a minute.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.020
How do you get that
theoretical value?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.860
You can calculate this.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.100
Not too badly.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.090
If I take a look at a system of
atoms, and this could be a

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.130
metallic crystal, you could
argue that there are metallic

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.360
bonds between all of these
atoms. And if what I wanted to

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.270
do to shear something--

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.610
so this is the yield strength
for shear--

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.620
if I wanted to shear the top
plane of atoms versus the

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.190
bottom plane of atoms, can
you see that to a first

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.170
approximation, the energy
required would be the energy

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.780
to break each one
of these bonds?

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.930
Because I have to break the bond
to release the plane and

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.180
then move it.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.340
So if you make an estimation
on the

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.590
basis of bond strength--

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.990
so you take individual bond
strength times bond density or

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.730
bond concentration.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.620
When I say density, I don't
necessarily mean

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.760
mass per unit volume.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.910
I could mean bonds
per unit area.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.550
You saw your homework
questions.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.410
How many atoms per
unit length?

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.210
And we said what's the
linear density?

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.530
And some people were saying,
but density is

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.460
mass per unit volume.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.370
No, I'm counting atoms
per unit length.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.940
Open your mind, OK?

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.060
So bond strength, what's
bond density?

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.460
That's atoms per unit area.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.380
So we can calculate this
and we're way off.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.090
We're way off by about
a factor of 10.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.820
So it was the dislocation
that allowed us to

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.650
explain why this happens.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.870
And it was the work of two
scientists, one by the name of

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:44.490
Orowan in Hungary and
Taylor in the UK.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.290
Orowan, after World War II,
went to the UK and then

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.755
ultimately came to MIT.

00:07:50.755 --> 00:07:54.550
And he spent most of this later
part of his career here

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.350
in the Mechanical Engineering
Department,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.300
from which he retired.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.880
And actually, he's too modest
to say it, but Professor

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.000
Demkowicz, his PhD was for
Professor Argon, and Professor

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.630
Argon was one of Orowan's
students.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.760
So this is direct lineage.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.180
This is all very clear, so he
was the appropriate person to

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.770
introduce dislocations.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.210
So what did Orowan do?

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.840
Orowan came up with this idea
of an interruption.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.790
And how did he get it?

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.770
It shows how to look
around and, in

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.270
the world, see analogies.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.830
Now, we didn't have the powerful
electron microscopes

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.760
then that we have today.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.900
This was in the 1930s, so people
didn't even agree on an

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.980
atomic view of things.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.610
So people were thinking,
thinking, thinking.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.900
So this is the dislocation.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.540
You can see.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.930
Here, we have three rows of
atoms, now there's two rows of

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.510
atoms. The middle
row stops there.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.750
And I'll show you what the
consequence of that is in

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.040
terms of being able to shear the
crystal of lower values of

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.720
applied stress.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.390
So that's the dislocation.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.260
You can see here.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.820
If you break this bond and then
propagate that through,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.180
you don't have to
shear them all.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.590
You break them one at a time.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.500
So Orowan came home one day in
Budapest, and the cleaning

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.760
woman was moving the runner on a
hallway, the story goes, and

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.120
she was about to move
the runner.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.700
And Orowan came up the stairs
and offered to help her, and

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.440
she told him, get
out of the way.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.320
Academic.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.140
And what she did, instead of
pulling the rug, she did what

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.820
we see in the cartoon here.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.810
She put a little kink in the
rug, snapped her foot and

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.400
propagated the kink and moved
the rug a half a foot down the

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.710
hallway with minimal energy.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.720
Instead of having to pull the
rug with it's coefficient of

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.150
fraction over three, four
meters, all she had to do was

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.970
come up with enough energy
to make the kink and

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.010
then stamp the foot.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.120
This person's really doing
it the hard way.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.750
I don't know.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.070
This guy must have
taken classes in

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.030
chemistry or something.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.290
But see, all you've
got to do--

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.310
once you get that kind
you just push

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.600
and it'll go by itself.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.660
So Orowan said could this be a
metaphor for what's going on

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.350
at the atomic level?

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.070
And that's where it came up
with this idea of the

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.320
dislocation.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.860
So there we have it.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.990
So where do we find
the dislocations?

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.070
Where do we find them?

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.790
So what is it?

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.810
The dislocation--

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.980
I keep talking about
it, what is it?

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.920
The dislocation, this is, if you
like, it's a line defect.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:44.050
It's a line defect formed by
misregistry of atoms. And with

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:51.005
the misregistry, that leads to
a reduction in bond density.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.800
And that broken bond is like the
hole, if you like, in the

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.610
valence band.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.385
It can propagate very easily.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.840
We're going to learn a little
bit later in the lecture where

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.650
we find dislocations and
how they contribute.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.700
But I want you to hold that
in near-term memory.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.070
OK.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.950
So we're going down
the list of the

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.630
different types of defects.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.950
Oh here, I found this off a
coffee table book that's

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.640
indicating--

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.865
I think this is a
crummy analogy.

00:11:34.865 --> 00:11:37.320
It shows this caterpillar
moving by.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.200
Instead of moving all of its
legs, it causes this thing--

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.980
I think this is a bad analogy.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.790
Just look down here.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.370
You see, you breaking this.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.440
And once you break this, you
just keep moving it along.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.030
Propagate the single broken bond
instead of breaking them

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.200
all at once.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.100
I don't think the caterpillar
moves that way, anyway.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.950
It's cute, but it's wrong.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.030
This is a dislocation.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.490
I don't think it has anything
to do with mechanical

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.100
behavior, but it's
a misregistry.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.890
So you can--

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.060
these guys, they write the books
and they come up with

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.590
this stuff and you study
it, and you're

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:13.520
going, I don't get it.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:13.980
You know what?

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.820
You shouldn't get it.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:15.770
Because this is crummy.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.020
It doesn't make any sense.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.690
How does that impact the yield
stress of the corn?

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.980
Someday you could
write a book.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.560
Better one than this.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.580
All right, so now we're
going to go to

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.830
two-dimensional defects.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.170
Let's go to two-dimensional
defects.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.680
So two-dimensional defects,
there's a couple types.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.960
The dislocation is
one dimensional.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.210
Two-dimensional defects.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.030
There's two types.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.250
One is the free surface.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.470
We're going to call the free
surface a defect, and I'll

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.970
explain why in a second.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.630
And then internal surfaces.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.670
Internal--

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.250
I'm going to use surface in
quotation marks-- they're

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.500
interfaces.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.740
And there's different
types of them, OK?

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.710
An interface.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.630
There's an interface
inside the thing.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.400
So what's the physics here?

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.660
Surfaces are high-energy
regions.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.410
Why?

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.020
Because when you're inside
the crystal, you have the

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.250
prescribed number of
nearest neighbors.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.950
Let's say you're in
an FCC crystal.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.350
You're an aluminum atom.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.560
So you're an aluminum atom
and you've got 12 nearest

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.180
neighbors because you're
FCC, except if

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.410
you're at the free surface.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.810
If you're an aluminum atom at
the free surface you don't

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.920
have 12 nearest neighbors.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.770
Because if I look down I've got
aluminum atoms all over.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.130
If I look up, I've
got nothing.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.740
So axiomatically, I've got a
different number of bonds.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.775
Why do we form bonds?

00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:42.240
We form bonds in order
to lower the

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.480
energy of the system.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.850
But axiomatically, the ones at
the top can't form the same

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.530
number of bonds, so they
are not in the

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.820
same low energy state.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.520
So once you get the connection
between lower number of bonds,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.590
higher energy state, then any
place, free surface, internal

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:04.010
surface, is going to be
relatively high energy.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:15.570
Relatively higher energy than
atoms in the matrix.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.080
Matrix.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.060
What do I mean by matrix?

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.900
In the middle of a crystal.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.820
In the matrix, OK?

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:27.200
So that means that it's not
quite as tightly bound, so the

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.550
consequence of this is if
they're high-energy regions,

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.410
so high-energy implies
higher reactivity.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.950
And that can be good
or it can be bad.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:46.870
It can be good if you're trying
to design a catalyst.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.590
And it can be bad in the
case of corrosion.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.170
Where do you think
corrosion occurs?

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.620
Not deep inside the crystal.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.340
It occurs at the surface along
the grain boundary.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.160
So here's a cartoon that
shows different

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.070
regions within the crystal.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.550
And Professor Demkowicz
showed you on Friday--

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.060
and I'll cut to the thing
in a second, the Atomix.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.520
but here we see atoms. So this
is a simple cubic, this is

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.970
simple cubic, this
is simple cubic.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.050
But when they meet they
don't line up.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.700
They don't line up because
this formed from

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.340
solidification from the melt.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.300
So there might have
been a seed here

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.170
and it grows outward.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.480
A seed here and it
grows outward.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.680
A seed here and it
grows outward.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.290
And when they grow outward they
impinge, but they're not

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.300
all growing with the
same orientation.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.350
You already know what
the planes are.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.990
And they could even be the
same plane, but they're

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.810
starting from a different
point.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.240
So there's this misregistry
here.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.490
But it's not a misregistry
like the dislocation.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.460
It's a two dimensional
misregistry.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.810
Actually, let's cut to
the document camera.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.060
Dave, could we do that please?

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.020
OK, so here's Atomix.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:55.820
This was, as explained, an
object of art made by Francois

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.330
Dallegret in Quebec
in the '60s.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.270
So it's kinetic.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.390
It's supposed to be after
the artist, see?

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.040
You know, you, too.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.940
You pick it up on a coffee
table, you put it down, now

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.930
you have become the artist.
You become the artist.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.330
Postmodernism.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.890
After the death of
the artist. See?

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.950
I'm an artist. Look.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.720
I'm an artist. One
of my best works.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.130
So a couple of my professors at
the University of Toronto

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.680
were at a cocktail party one
night and they saw this thing

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.490
on a table.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.380
Must've been a wild party
because they kept looking at

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.110
this thing.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.740
Finally decided to write
a paper about it.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.230
And as Professor Demkowicz said,
I bet Francois Dallegret

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.340
sold more of these to professors
of material science

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.640
than he sold to art
collectors.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.460
So it's 200 ball bearings
strategically placed between

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.110
two plates of plexiglass.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.940
And as he pointed out on
Friday, you can't get

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.210
everything to go away in terms
of dislocations, but now you

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.200
can see misregistry--

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.640
pardon me, vacancies here.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.480
Here's a stacking
fault and so on.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.210
And now here you see
grain boundaries.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.280
There's the free surface.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.630
Here's the vapor phase.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.100
Everything.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:00.980
We're having a lot
of fun, here.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.020
So we can look at it again.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.690
We can change.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.670
We'll try to anneal it.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.100
So how do we anneal it?

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.880
You put it in an oven
and you eat it.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.370
This is the mechanical
equivalent of annealing.

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.930
I'm tapping it, for those
of you in the back.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.180
Now, I'm going to put it down
and you see I have a much more

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.070
refined structure.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.210
So now you can see
a large section

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.070
here of a single crystal.

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.010
Each one of these is
called a grain.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.200
A grain is a zone
that is a single

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.200
crystal with some defects.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.510
You can see the vacancies.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.390
And then look at the grain
boundary here.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.370
See this is a nice crystal,
this is a nice crystal.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.160
So one grain, two grains, and
there's the grain boundary

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.340
where these don't line
up with those.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.510
Because they started from a
different angle so they can't

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.290
impinge and blend.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.460
There's grain boundaries here,
here, here, and there's

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.670
beautiful stuff.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.700
You can see dislocations.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.150
Everything.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.230
And I know he showed you at the
end the Bragg bubble wrap.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.660
And you could see--

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.770
[SOUND EFFECT]

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.200
PROFESSOR: --dislocations
zipping.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.720
When people were trying to
compress the bubble wrap, the

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.830
way the bubble wrap was
compressing the bubbles didn't

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.490
all get flat.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.790
The bubbled glided over one
another, and the dislocations

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.840
relieved the stress.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.090
See what I'm telling you here?

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.390
What I'm telling you here is
something that you don't get

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.380
in a Gen Chem class
anywhere else.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.440
If I told you about the
chemical origins of

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.920
reactivity, you'd go, yeah,
that's chemistry.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.470
But what are we talking
about here?

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.430
We're talking about the
chemical origins

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.450
of mechanical behavior.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.900
Now that's different.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.610
The chemical origins
of mechanical

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.420
behavior: only in 3.091.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.320
And why shouldn't we?

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.300
Because at the end, everything
is chemistry.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.700
Everything is chemistry.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.540
The rest is stamp collecting.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.710
So the grain--

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.060
make sure we know where
the grain is.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.130
The grain is like, I want
to call single crystal.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.820
The grain is like a
single crystal.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.310
And the grains are separated
by grain boundaries.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.350
So by managing grain boundaries,
control of grain

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:09.040
boundaries, or if you like,
management a grain boundaries,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.620
this has an impact on mechanical
properties.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.810
This is called grain boundary
engineering.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.130
How we control mechanical
properties.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.890
Grain boundary engineering.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:28.065
So for example, if we
want high strength--

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.800
and I just told you that the
dislocations will allow the

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.880
atoms to glide.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.760
Can you see that if the
dislocation is present in this

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.320
large grain on the bottom here
and the dislocation, just as

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.470
in the bubble wrap movie, is
zipping across, what happens

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.730
when it gets to the
grain boundary?

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.010
The misregistry of
atoms stops that

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.730
dislocation dead in its tracks.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.720
So if I want high strength, do I
want a large number of grain

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.180
boundaries per unit area?

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.380
Or a small number of grain
boundaries per unit area if my

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.440
goal is to stop the
dislocations?

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.200
I want a high number.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.530
High strength means fine
grain structure.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.110
Fine grained means
small grain size.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.360
Fine grain structure.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.460
You can think of it
as like a river.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.220
You know, you're running,
running, running-- all of a

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:28.010
sudden, you stop because you've
got to ford the river.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.200
On the other hand, if you
want high ductility--

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.370
why would you want ductility?

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.410
For example, you want to make
a beverage container.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.350
How do you make a beverage
container?

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.500
Not by casting.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.910
You take a sheet of aluminum and
you punch it and you cause

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.190
it to deep draw.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.610
That's atoms sliding
over atoms.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.400
So do I want to facilitate that
process or do I want to

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.630
impede the process?

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.210
Well, to facilitate the process,
I want to make it as

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.730
easy as possible for
those atoms to

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.320
glide over one another.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.820
So high ductility means coarse
grain structure.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:12.970
Coarse grain means
large, if you

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.920
like, large grain diameter.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.330
Fine grain structure means
small diameter.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.510
So there we go.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.190
That's the beginning.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.960
And there's a lot more to it,
but I just wanted you to see

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.730
that there is something.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.430
And David, may we cut back
to the slides, please?

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.660
OK, I think the next
one shows.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.480
All right, so this is a--

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.500
oh, we don't want to hear that.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.630
Whoops!

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.050
Well, I've got music embedded
in this one.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.450
This is Philip Glass.

to talk about glasses later.

Koyaanisqatsi.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.480
It's beautiful.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.540
Can you feel the bass?

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.020
There's the subwoofer
right here.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.652
You stand right here.

00:21:53.652 --> 00:21:56.780
It's like a message.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.290
Low frequency, of course.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.260
All right, so here's this.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.430
But this is a piece of copper.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:05.090
Now, this was the advent
of modern materials

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.810
characterization when Sorby, in
the late 1800s, figured out

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.750
that if you polish the piece
of metal supersmooth--

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.500
that's good, huh?

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.330
Maybe we better turn
the volume down.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.230
I can't compete with these.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.340
There's more of them than me.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.900
I can't compete.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.090
That's called the mute button.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.550
[MUSIC ENDS]

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.570
PROFESSOR: So what did he do?

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:28.160
He polished the copper and
then he etched it.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.910
And what happens with
an acid etch?

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.540
It will etch at different rates
because the different

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.830
grains have different
atom densities.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.460
You see, if I take a piece of
metal and I polish it super,

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.470
super bright and I shine a light
on it and look at it in

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.980
a microscope, what am
I going to see?

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.900
I'm going to see my
eyeball, right?

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.910
I'll blind myself.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.930
So the key was to etch.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.330
And then when you etch,
you differentiate

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.120
the different grains.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.970
So that's what you're looking
at-- the grain boundaries.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.740
And this is now the same thing,
only under a field ion

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.280
microscope.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.130
This is a bicrystal
of tungsten.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.290
It's hard to see, but
this is all one.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.150
This looks like a lolly
pattern, doesn't it?

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.620
You can see the symmetry here.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.750
I don't know if you can
see right here.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.690
There's a line, sort
of v-shaped here.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:09.990
And that's the second crystal.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.940
So there's one crystal here,
a second crystal here.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.115
So this two-dimensional defect
is now characterized.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.550
And we'll get to that later.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:20.820
OK.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.760
So now we want to do
three-dimensional defects.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.420
What are the three-dimensional
defects?

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:31.140
Three-dimensional defects
are important.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:37.190
And they have beneficial
and they have harmful

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.580
consequences.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.760
Three-dimensional defects.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.430
The dominant mechanism
here is coalescence.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.580
So three-dimensional defects
formed by coalescence.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.340
And you can coalesce
two things.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:59.982
You can coalesce voids,
or you can coalesce--

00:23:59.982 --> 00:24:04.240
actually, you can coalesce void,
and you can coalesce--

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.520
I'm going to use Democritus
talk here.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.815
You can coalesce void, or
you can coalesce being.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:13.930
What do I mean by that?

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:18.560
Well, void, this could
be a vacancy cluster.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.550
So if you have a large number
of vacancies coalescing,

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.200
you'll actually end up
with a hole, a blow

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.520
hole inside the material.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.580
And as you can imagine,
that has the

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.960
mechanical strength of nothing.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.310
That's bad.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.560
And being?

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.457
This could be impurity
clusters.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.070
And there's two types of
impurities, as we've learned.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.880
There are good impurities, such
as dopants, and there are

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.220
bad impurities such
as contaminants.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.330
And what can they do
to the mechanical

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.550
properties if they are bad?

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.620
So what I like to say is
impurity clusters--

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.410
so we've got, for example,
there are good

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.580
ones that are managed.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.260
The ones that are managed can
be used to our advantage.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.430
So I'm going to say the managed
ones get a smiley

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.770
face, and the ones that
are uncontrolled--

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.440
I'll give you a vivid
example of that at

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.680
the end of the lecture.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.700
Uncontrolled, they get a frowny
face, and they can lead

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.020
to major disasters.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.930
So for example, you're really
talking about clusters that

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.980
exsolve as a separate phase.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.110
So these things exist
as a separate phase.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.160
So they're no longer
dissolved.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:52.000
And these precipitates, some of
these impurity clusters, if

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.050
they're managed, we can call
them precipitates.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.350
i'll give you an example
of precipitates.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.860
Some of you might be going home
at some point in the not

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.230
too distant future, maybe
for Thanksgiving.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.740
And if you're flying on an
airplane, the airplane is made

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.240
of an aluminum alloy.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.550
Aluminum copper.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.560
And one of the precipitates that
you can form is various

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.290
copper-aluminum compounds.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:27.240
And these form precipitates
that the volume of

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:33.680
copper-aluminum 2 is greater
than the volume of the

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.450
constituents.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.700
So if you take a copper atom and
two aluminum atoms in the

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.940
lattice and they react to form
copper-aluminum 2, there's a

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.120
volume increase.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.120
And so that works to give
you constituents.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.720
Isn't that great?

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.560
I left you in suspense there
as to rest of the word.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.480
So what happens?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.460
This works a little bit the way
carbon does in iron, where

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.530
carbon atom is bigger than the
interstitial void space in

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:02.570
iron, and that force fit leads
to a strengthening.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.000
This leads to a strengthening,
oK?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.250
So that's good.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.400
So this is called precipitation
hardening.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.790
I'm just going write
precipitation pptn,

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.300
precipitation hardening.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.060
Very important in metallurgy.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:26.140
Whereas carbon in iron is called
solution hardening.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.680
Because it doesn't exist
as a separate phase.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.310
The carbon atom is sitting on an
interstitial site so it's a

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.760
force fit, but it's still within
the lattice, whereas

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.880
the copper-aluminum actually
exists as a precipitate

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.390
outside the lattice.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.940
So there we go.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.027
In order to give you a little
bit more, I said we're going

00:27:46.027 --> 00:27:49.380
to talk about the
chemical origins

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.860
of mechanical behavior.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.350
And I want to show you
how this all leads to

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.990
strengthening, strengthening
in terms of the yield.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.080
So let's talk about deformation
and the

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.260
relationship to chemistry.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.510
There's two types
of deformation.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.900
And this really accounts for
the importance of metals in

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.640
the history of man.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.150
Why?

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.660
Because they have this
unique property.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.930
Until the modern era, when
we discovered plastics.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.060
But until modern era, metals
are deformable.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.700
They can deform without
breaking.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.740
That's what made them so
desirable as materials of

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.240
construction.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.820
So I'm going to talk
about deformation,

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.750
how we deform them.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:39.950
So really, metallurgy
consists of--

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:44.230
really, there's two major
divisions of metallurgy.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.380
The first part is chemical,
chemical metallurgy, and

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.630
that's called dirt to metal.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.520
That's the conversion.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.670
This is the intensive
chemistry.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.140
And then the second part is
called physical metallurgy,

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.130
which is what I'm going
to talk about next.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.950
Physical, which is
change of shape.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.690
That relies on the ductility.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.520
So deformation.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.290
There's two types
of deformation.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.760
The first one is called
elastic deformation.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.970
And it is reversible.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.055
So it is strain only
under stress.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.820
Or if you like, displacement
only under applied force.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.690
So this is Hooke's Law.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:38.940
Hooke's Law applies.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.520
So let's take a look.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:49.190
I'm going to draw a
little curve here.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.460
You've seen this before.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.120
I'm going to draw one of
these energy curves.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:30:01.230
So this is interatomic
separation, which we might use

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.050
the lower case r.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.210
And this is the potential energy
that's stored between

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.620
two atoms. Remember, when
they're far apart, they want

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.040
to attract.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.420
When they get too close
together, their electronic

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.250
shells repel.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.010
So we've got--

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.260
time for colored chalk--

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.790
we have the attractive
component,

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.350
which looks like this.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.770
And then we have the repulsive
component, which looks

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.090
something like this.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.090
And then we put the two of them
together, and I think we

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:37.060
did this for ions, but there's
an analogous one for other

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.340
materials, and so you add the
two of these, and you

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.550
eventually end up like this,
where this is r naught.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.356
r naught, the optimum
separation.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.310
Here's attraction, this
is repulsion,

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.500
et cetera, et cetera.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.230
So this is e minimum.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.450
We've seen all of that before.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.590
Now what's this have to do
with mechanical behavior?

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.660
Well, I'll take it just
a little bit farther.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.110
And so I'm going to take
the derivative of that

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.700
and look at the force.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.510
All right, so now I'm going
to take the first

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.640
derivative of that.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:18.470
So this is going to be force,
which is equal to de dr. Force

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.150
is the derivative of energy.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.540
And what do I find?

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.570
Well, look.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.270
If I take this derivative,
below r equals r naught.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.490
I've got a negative slope.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.250
Above r equals r naught--

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.270
I have a positive slope.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.290
And at r equals r naught,
zero slope.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.930
So I'm want to put
that down here.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:41.780
So it's zero right at r equals r
naught, and above r equals r

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.470
naught it's positive,
and below r equals

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:47.110
r naught it's negative.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.410
Not to scale.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.510
But one thing is certain.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.330
It is positive above r equals
r naught, negative below r

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.010
equals r naught, and to a first
approximation, I can

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:07.270
linearize about r equals
r naught, Or Emin.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.410
So what's the real shape
of this thing?

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.770
You could use a Taylor
series if you want.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.820
And just take the first-- what's
the first term of a

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.410
Taylor series?

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:14.960
Constant.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.360
Second term, linear.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.780
Third term is squared,
da, da, da, da.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.270
So neglect higher order terms.
You get a straight line.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.960
And what does this mean?

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:29.020
It means that if I try to
disturb the atoms from one

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:33.120
another and move them away
from their rest position,

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.260
there's a force that pulls them
back, and the force is

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.300
proportional to the
displacement.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.990
If I move the atoms farther
apart by a distance r1, I get

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.010
a certain force.

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:45.800
If I move them apart by r2--

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.010
2 times r1--

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.060
I get twice the force.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.960
It's linear.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.200
Now let's go over here.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.020
Now let's draw another
analogy.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:01.880
So here I've got something
that's pegged.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.500
And now I'm going to put a
spring onto this secure wall.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.620
So here's my spring, and
I'm going to hang

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.050
a mass on the spring.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.550
Now I'm going to bring this
into Hooke's Law.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.140
I'm going to show you that what
you know to be Hooke's

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.780
Law is a direct consequence
of this.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.750
The atomic origin.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.970
So what's the force on this?

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.620
There's a force on this, and
that's equal to product of the

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.580
mass times the gravitational
constant.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.590
And if there were no mass,
this spring would be

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.820
compressed and it might
be sitting here.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.710
I will call this x naught.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.660
And now that I put the
spring here I'll

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.835
measures, say, this point.

00:33:37.835 --> 00:33:41.250
And this point here is
now at some value x.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.610
So this is the displacement,
isn't it?

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.140
This is the delta x.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:52.310
So Hooke's Law is simply f
equals k delta x, isn't it?

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.505
If I double the delta x,
requires double the force.

00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:58.370
Well, that's this.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.310
This analogy goes right down.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.910
And if I remove the mass it
springs back, which is what I

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.620
meant when I said
it's reversible.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.170
This is not permanent.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.990
No stress, no strain.

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.330
Strain is the deformation.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.494
No deformation, no force.

00:34:12.494 --> 00:34:16.130
If I put a force, non-zero
force, non-zero deformation.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.900
By the way, Hooke--

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.400
little bit of culture--

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.940
Hooke announced Hooke's
Law in 1676.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.789
Here's how Hooke's Law
was first published.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.020
It's an anagram and
it's in Latin.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:45.000
And it was in a book entitled A
Decimate of the Centesms of

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.070
the Inventions I Intend to
Reveal, which is English for,

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:53.090
This is a Tenth of the Hundreds
of the Inventions I

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:53.650
Intend to Reveal.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.150
He did not suffer from an
overabundance of modesty.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:01.240
Actually, Hooke and
Newton sparred.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.780
They hated each other's guts.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.260
They fought bitterly.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.260
Two giant egos.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.540
Anyway, so here's the thing.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:15.380
So in 1679 he published a book
called De Restitutiva.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.430
On The Spring.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:18.580
Very presumptuous.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.020
On The Spring.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:27.970
And here it is in its unraveled,
ut tensio, sic vis.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.820
As the extension,
so the force.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.670
Nice, huh?

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.120
This is u.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.450
That's why the u, but
it's really v.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.470
Vis.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.240
We get the English word
vim from this.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.550
This is the accusative
form of vis.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.910
The Romans didn't care
between the u and v.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:51.090
In fact, if you go on the steps
of 77 and you come up,

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.330
it says Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, you

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.160
ever notice this?

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.360
Yeah.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.710
I always thought that
that's because the

00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:59.800
Romans, they couldn't--

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.110
no.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.560
And I thought, well, maybe it's
because it's hard to make

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.170
a u, but then it says
Institute of--

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.020
I figure if you can make one of
these, you should be able

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:07.780
to make one of these.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.280
So if you can tell me why they
do it that way, I might be

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.530
able to find another Periodic
Table beach towel.

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.420
So that's another thing.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:18.270
All right.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:22.100
So that's the elastic
deformation.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.770
And now we want to look at the
other type of deformation, and

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.373
that's called plastic
deformation.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:30.320
And that's permanent.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.735
It's a permanent shape change.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.420
So let's get that up here.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.970
Permanent shape change.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.560
And this requires ductility.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.050
Because otherwise you'll
have fracture.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.790
If you take something that has
no ductility and you apply a

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.640
super critical force, you
just crack everything.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.670
So ductility allows
for the atoms to

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.670
glide over one another.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:00.920
So what is the mechanism?

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.435
The mechanism for plastic
deformation?

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.700
Plastic deformation in crystals,
we're talking about

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.080
here, not liquids.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.280
It's called slip.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.230
Atom's slip over one another.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.780
So time for one more cartoon.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.270
So I'm going to say, well,
what happens if I

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.770
start again with this?

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:40.170
I'm going to put a thin wire,
a thin wire of metal.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.020
Make it an FCC metal, let's say
it's copper, and I'm going

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.730
to put a mass here--

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.180
a honking big mass--

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.250
it's going to give me a force,
and the force is great enough

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.820
that it is actually going to
cause the wire to elongate.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.970
That is permanent
shape change.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:56.430
So what's going on?

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.790
Well, let's take this
and blow it up.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.190
When we blow it up, we have
what's on the screen.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:07.260
We have grains of
different size.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.100
And I'm just going to
show atomic planes.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.470
And that's why we have
grains, right?

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.510
Because the atomic planes
don't line up.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.430
There's a misregistry
along here.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.720
So now I want to go down
to the atomic level.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.590
So now I'm going to take
this and blow it up.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:26.970
And what do I see here?

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.010
I see atoms like so.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.920
I'm going to use that
hard-sphere,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.630
close-packed model.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.030
So here's the force.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.970
The force is vertical, agreed?

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.960
We've got the mass and it's
pulling straight down

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.110
according to gravity.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.330
So what's going on at the
atomic dimension?

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:47.210
Because ultimately, this is
what we're working with.

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.830
So what happens?

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.370
One possibility, and don't
laugh-- this was actually

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:52.180
suggested--

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.100
when you cause extension in this
manner, you actually take

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.600
some of these and you
can turn them into

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.070
elongated atoms. No, no.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.710
That's no good.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.610
What in fact happens is slip.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:12.820
So the force-- in fact, let
me be more specific--

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:25.850
the applied force is resolved
at atomic level.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.380
So what happens is that the
atoms slip over one another

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.770
because they can slip along the
planes that have the least

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.400
bonding between them, right?

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.820
The chain is as strong
as its weakest link.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.130
So what will happen here is that
in order to affect the

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:52.380
elongation, these will move
relative to one another along

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.030
this slip plane.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.655
This is resolved at the atomic
level along slip planes.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.140
I'll write that larger
for the people way,

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.510
way up in the back.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.760
I haven't forgotten about you.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.190
And what's the slip plane?

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.620
How do I determine which
is the slip plane?

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.080
The slip plane it's going to be
the plane that's strongest

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.680
because it retains
its integrity.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.180
So which plane will
be the strongest?

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.780
The one with the most bonds.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.730
And which plane has
the most bonds?

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.430
The plane with the highest
number of atoms per unit area.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.480
And that's why we study
this stuff.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.280
Because now we know,
in an FCC crystal,

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.720
which plane will slide.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:46.570
So in FCC, the high-intensity
plane is 1 1 1.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.980
So the 1 1 1 planes do the
sliding one over another.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.420
And they'll zigzag the way you
saw in the bubble wrap movie.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:59.890
They'll zigzag down, across,
across, across, But from a

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.560
distance, it appears as the
thing is elongating.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.590
But at the atomic level, it's
zigzagging along the

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.440
close-packed planes.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.240
Now I'm in a close-packed
plane.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.930
By the way, if I have the
highest density in the plane

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:16.470
of the floor, can you understand
that orthogonal to

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:19.132
the plane on the floor, I must
have the weakest density?

00:41:19.132 --> 00:41:20.880
All right, now I'm
in the plane.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.150
Which direction in the plane?

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.820
Any direction?

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.330
I'm going to push, I'm going
to push some pasta.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.990
I'm going to push uncooked
pasta or cooked pasta?

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:31.740
Do you want to push on a rope?

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.150
Do you want to push
on a broom handle?

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.320
The stiff.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.460
So how do I determine, within
the plane, which direction is

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.230
the stiffest direction?

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.430
The one with the most atoms,
which is the close-packed

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:45.900
direction when I'm
in the plane.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.670
So if I'm in the 1 1 1 plane,
which direction?

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.250
The 0 1 1 direction.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:54.480
So this is direct line of
sight from the original

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.790
crystallography.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.390
So that's how we get the slip.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:03.640
And in BCC the highest density
plane is 0 1 1 and so on.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.830
And the close-packed plane
simply means 1 1 1, because

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:11.140
FCC is the closest-packed
structure, so that's a

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.010
close-packed plane.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.910
Otherwise, they're planes
of highest density.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:15.860
It's a trivial--

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.930
forget the last column--
it's pedantry.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:18.940
Forget it.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.050
I'm sorry I have it up there.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.370
So this is the slip system.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:30.270
So the slip system is
the combination of

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.700
close-packed plane--

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:38.370
or closest-packed plane--
close-packed plane and the

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:41.160
close-packed direction.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.020
They all have close-packed
directions because we've got

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.250
atoms touching.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:49.570
Close-packed direction.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.060
That's how it deforms. And then
if I get a dislocation in

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.435
a close-packed plane, voom!

00:42:53.435 --> 00:42:55.180
Away they go.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.330
1/10 of the applied sheer
stress theoretical.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.770
So if you want to get it down
to a simple phrase, you can

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:11.560
say, what causes slip?

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.680
Atoms slip, dislocations
glide.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.480
But please don't think for
one minute-- listen to me

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.410
carefully-- a lot of students
come away from this and they

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:28.770
say, oh, I know why we
have deformation.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.220
Because of dislocations.

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.680
No, no, no, no.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.600
Atoms will slip no
matter what.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.280
It's just that you're going to
pay a lot more to cause the

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.450
deformation.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:46.760
The dislocations allow you to
have slip at lower cost.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.190
Yeah, this is good.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:53.260
And I think we're probably at
the point where I can show you

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.620
the enormous consequences of
a three-dimensional defect.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.880
Why did the Titanic sink?

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.030
It's a story of
three-dimensional defects and

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:03.550
human greed.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.710
So this Tim Fecke at the
National Institutes of

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.900
Standards and Technology with
an optical microscope and a

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.430
rivet from the Titanic.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.710
And what I'm going to show
you in the rivet is a

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:18.520
three-dimensional defect that
took the boat down.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.620
So this is the microstructure
and what they're doing is

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.950
they're showing you a blow up of
this section of the rivet.

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:28.450
Now, the rivet is
made of steel.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.130
Before I can explain to you
what's going on there, I have

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:31.510
to show you--

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.845
[MUSIC STARTS]

00:44:31.845 --> 00:44:32.900
PROFESSOR: Oh, shut up.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.300
[MUSIC ENDS]

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.950
PROFESSOR: All right, so this
is how they made steel.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:39.470
Imagine this area the front of
10-250 as an open-hearth

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:43.120
furnace, and I'm up to about
my knees in liquid iron.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.880
And on top of the liquid iron
is a slag made of silica,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.590
calcia, and alumina.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.380
It's the stuff when it
solidifies it makes something

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.940
not too different from
window glass.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.800
But we use it for refining to
get some of the impurities out

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.200
of the metal.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.180
And those impurities go up
into the slag phase.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.665
And to keep this thing it
about 1,300 degrees

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:03.380
Centigrade, you've
got burners.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:03.970
Two.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:05.413
One at each end like dragons--

00:45:05.413 --> 00:45:06.400
[SOUND EFFECT]

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.320
PROFESSOR: --blowing flame into
here for about 12 hours.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.510
12 hours.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.480
And that's what it took
to make a heat of

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.060
steel back in 1910.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.690
This was made in Ireland, which
was, at that time, part

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.460
of the United Kingdom.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.690
So on that day that they made
the heat of steel that

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.550
ultimately was shaped into
rivets, evidently somebody

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:32.320
became greedy, and instead of
waiting long enough for the

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.120
slag to phase separate and form
a film on the surface of

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.220
the metals, much like oil and
water don't mix, but you can

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.880
shake them up in your salad
dressing application tool

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.010
device and then pour
it on quickly.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.120
But if you let it sit
they phase separate.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.340
Well, somebody didn't allow
this to phase separate.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.350
They were told, pour
the heat anyways.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:58.680
So now you have globs of what
is the precursor to silicate

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.620
glass in the metal.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.870
And now we take the metal and we
cut it into little billets

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.750
and the billets are extruded
to form rivets.

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.850
And then the rivets look
like this, where

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.460
you have glass stringers.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.570
Three-dimensional defects,
impurity clusters,

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:14.730
uncontrolled.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.960
What are the mechanical
properties of steel?

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.930
Strong.

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:18.770
Ductile.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:19.220
Tough.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.560
What does toughness mean?

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.360
Impactability.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.510
When you say someone is tough,
it means they know how to take

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:29.110
a hit, whereas hardness means it
takes enormous strength to

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:30.440
cause deformation.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.850
They're very different.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:32.380
You know?

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.010
You say someone is tough,
you mean one thing.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.780
You say they're strong,
it's different.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.920
You can be strong and
yet not tough.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.180
You can be strong and brittle,
so you can't take a hit.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.670
I know a lot of people
like that.

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.840
That can't take a hit.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.100
Anyway, so enough about
the people.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.050
So here are the stringers.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:49.020
So what happened?

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.150
What do you think
the mechanical

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:51.260
strength of this is?

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.190
If you have an impact like
so, instead of having the

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:57.300
toughness to absorb the impact,
these things broke.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.450
This is like perforations on
a sheet of postage stamps.

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.890
And so these rivets
were on the hull.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.090
And when the ship hit the
iceberg, what should have

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:09.400
happened is there should have
an a small hole, the water

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.760
would've taken, who knows, a
day or two to fill up, and

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.740
there was plenty of time
to get rescue vessels.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.940
Instead, these rivets were
brittle, thanks to this.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.600
And so they just unzipped.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.930
Just pop, pop, pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop.

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:24.970
Opened up a giant hole and
then took on the water.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:27.040
Now, did nobody check?

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:32.310
Along the way, no inspection
of the steel?

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:33.680
Nobody looked?

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.130
The guys that we're doing the
riveting, they must have known

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.310
the rivets were acting
strange.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:41.490
They must have broken a lot of
them just putting them in.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:42.770
But hey, it's not my job.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:43.480
Not my job.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.170
Not my job.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:48.370
No testing anywhere
along the way.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.840
What's shocking is
not human greed.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.110
That's as old as humanity.

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.860
What's shocking is there
was no checks.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:59.020
So we have a different way to
make vessels like this today.

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.400
But that's the story,
right there.
