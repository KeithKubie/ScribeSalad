my current role is in economics at the

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500
my current role is in economics at the
 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.450
my current role is in economics at the
hind school and I teach an energy in the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460
hind school and I teach an energy in the
 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.270
hind school and I teach an energy in the
is really bringing energy and the

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.280
is really bringing energy and the
 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.609
is really bringing energy and the
environment together and looking at it

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619
environment together and looking at it
 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.060
environment together and looking at it
through a sort of economics lens so that

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070
through a sort of economics lens so that
 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.519
through a sort of economics lens so that
students can understand things like what

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529
students can understand things like what
 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.859
students can understand things like what
are the ramifications of imposing a

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869
are the ramifications of imposing a
 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.560
are the ramifications of imposing a
price ceiling what are some things that

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570
price ceiling what are some things that
 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.210
price ceiling what are some things that
one wants to look at when thinking about

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220
one wants to look at when thinking about
 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.270
one wants to look at when thinking about
the regulatory process and so forth so

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280
the regulatory process and so forth so
 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.670
the regulatory process and so forth so
I'm currently working on two projects

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680
I'm currently working on two projects
 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.420
I'm currently working on two projects
one is looking at pollution and sort of

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430
one is looking at pollution and sort of
 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.450
one is looking at pollution and sort of
the evolution pollution in the US during

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460
the evolution pollution in the US during
 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.700
the evolution pollution in the US during
the mid 20th century when pollution was

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710
the mid 20th century when pollution was
 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.669
the mid 20th century when pollution was
very severe and looking at the mortality

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679
very severe and looking at the mortality
 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.709
very severe and looking at the mortality
impact the other thing that we're

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719
impact the other thing that we're
 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.779
impact the other thing that we're
working on and I'm working with a group

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789
working on and I'm working with a group
 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.329
working on and I'm working with a group
of co-authors is really looking at the

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339
of co-authors is really looking at the
 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.880
of co-authors is really looking at the
u.s. historical experience with respect

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890
u.s. historical experience with respect
 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.650
u.s. historical experience with respect
to climate change in both of those

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660
to climate change in both of those
 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.169
to climate change in both of those
projects the project related to climate

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179
projects the project related to climate
 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:03.790
projects the project related to climate
change and the project related to the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800
change and the project related to the
 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.010
change and the project related to the
use of coal for home heating one of the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020
use of coal for home heating one of the
 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.300
use of coal for home heating one of the
reasons why we want to understand the

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310
reasons why we want to understand the
 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.580
reasons why we want to understand the
American experience is because that

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590
American experience is because that
 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.040
American experience is because that
itself is inherently interesting but

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050
itself is inherently interesting but
 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.160
itself is inherently interesting but
also because both the severe pollution

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170
also because both the severe pollution
 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.350
also because both the severe pollution
from the use of coal for home heating is

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360
from the use of coal for home heating is
 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.330
from the use of coal for home heating is
occurring in the developing world today

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340
occurring in the developing world today
 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.999
occurring in the developing world today
and similarly we expect many developing

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009
and similarly we expect many developing
 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.450
and similarly we expect many developing
countries to experience big increases in

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
countries to experience big increases in
 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.639
countries to experience big increases in
temperature related to climate change

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649
temperature related to climate change
 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.120
temperature related to climate change
and so understanding how was that the US

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
and so understanding how was that the US
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.950
and so understanding how was that the US
was able to sort of moderate the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960
was able to sort of moderate the
 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.510
was able to sort of moderate the
relationship between high heat and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520
relationship between high heat and
 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.560
relationship between high heat and
mortality that is you know mitigated

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570
mortality that is you know mitigated
 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.719
mortality that is you know mitigated
will we hope be helpful in terms of

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729
will we hope be helpful in terms of
 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.039
will we hope be helpful in terms of
thinking about policies that will be

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049
thinking about policies that will be
 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.010
thinking about policies that will be
effective in the developing world I

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020
effective in the developing world I
 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.770
effective in the developing world I
think that our work is primarily of

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780
think that our work is primarily of
 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.899
think that our work is primarily of
interest both sort of to the general

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909
interest both sort of to the general
 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.760
interest both sort of to the general
population who's interested in

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770
population who's interested in
 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.480
population who's interested in
understanding the sort of evolution of

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490
understanding the sort of evolution of
 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.980
understanding the sort of evolution of
energy in the environment in the u.s.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990
energy in the environment in the u.s.
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.830
energy in the environment in the u.s.
context so just from a background

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840
context so just from a background
 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.679
context so just from a background
perspective but also some of the things

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689
perspective but also some of the things
 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.899
perspective but also some of the things
that are happening our might be relevant

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909
that are happening our might be relevant
 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.180
that are happening our might be relevant
for developing countries and that's I

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190
for developing countries and that's I
 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.100
for developing countries and that's I
think where government policy makers are

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
think where government policy makers are
 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.500
think where government policy makers are
also interested people potentially at

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510
also interested people potentially at
 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.790
also interested people potentially at
the World Bank or at the IMF because

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800
the World Bank or at the IMF because
 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.010
the World Bank or at the IMF because
again I think understanding the effects

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020
again I think understanding the effects
 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.380
again I think understanding the effects
of climate change what we did here that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
of climate change what we did here that
 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.790
of climate change what we did here that
allowed us to mitigate it

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800
allowed us to mitigate it
 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.840
allowed us to mitigate it
in the u.s. context and what might be

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850
in the u.s. context and what might be
 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.060
in the u.s. context and what might be
useful avenues for mitigating it in

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070
useful avenues for mitigating it in
 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:40.330
useful avenues for mitigating it in
developing country context

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340
 
 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.400
