00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.940
start sculpting I'll probably be using
some other various pieces of PVC and

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950
some other various pieces of PVC and
 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.750
some other various pieces of PVC and
stuff like that

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760
stuff like that
 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.080
stuff like that
for the go inside here not sure what I'm

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090
for the go inside here not sure what I'm
 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.059
for the go inside here not sure what I'm
gonna use yet although the detailing

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069
gonna use yet although the detailing
 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.289
gonna use yet although the detailing
stuff like that we're actually gonna

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299
stuff like that we're actually gonna
 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.420
stuff like that we're actually gonna
just sculpt directly onto the mask

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430
just sculpt directly onto the mask
 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.430
just sculpt directly onto the mask
everything is pretty much going to be

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440
everything is pretty much going to be
 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.430
everything is pretty much going to be
covered up I'm going to sand all the the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440
covered up I'm going to sand all the the
 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.029
covered up I'm going to sand all the the
chin area and the one in the movie

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039
chin area and the one in the movie
 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.430
chin area and the one in the movie
actually is more vivid it's gonna kind

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
actually is more vivid it's gonna kind
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.790
actually is more vivid it's gonna kind
of like that divot splits so I have to

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800
of like that divot splits so I have to
 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.040
of like that divot splits so I have to
every sculpt a little bit there and then

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050
every sculpt a little bit there and then
 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.450
every sculpt a little bit there and then
the nose will probably have to be kind

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460
the nose will probably have to be kind
 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.779
the nose will probably have to be kind
of ground down or sanded and then it's

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789
of ground down or sanded and then it's
 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.400
of ground down or sanded and then it's
got sort of a rounder into it it doesn't

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410
got sort of a rounder into it it doesn't
 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.340
got sort of a rounder into it it doesn't
have this no and the teeth are gonna

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350
have this no and the teeth are gonna
 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.480
have this no and the teeth are gonna
have to be rescaled it heavily somewhat

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490
have to be rescaled it heavily somewhat
 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.330
have to be rescaled it heavily somewhat
because and the teeth on the mask in the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340
because and the teeth on the mask in the
 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.370
because and the teeth on the mask in the
movie they're sort of divided it means

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380
movie they're sort of divided it means
 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.580
movie they're sort of divided it means
it's there's like up to one big tooth on

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590
it's there's like up to one big tooth on
 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.409
it's there's like up to one big tooth on
either side this one's actually got like

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419
either side this one's actually got like
 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.710
either side this one's actually got like
a tooth in the middle and two fairly big

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720
a tooth in the middle and two fairly big
 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.240
a tooth in the middle and two fairly big
ones on the side but yeah so a lot of

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250
ones on the side but yeah so a lot of
 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.850
ones on the side but yeah so a lot of
work needs to be done to this thing but

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860
work needs to be done to this thing but
 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.840
work needs to be done to this thing but
in the end I think it's a pretty good

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850
in the end I think it's a pretty good
 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.870
in the end I think it's a pretty good
it's a good solid base and you don't

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880
it's a good solid base and you don't
 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.990
it's a good solid base and you don't
have to try it out I am completely

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000
have to try it out I am completely
 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.659
have to try it out I am completely
sculpted from scratch you've got you

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669
sculpted from scratch you've got you
 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.400
sculpted from scratch you've got you
know what fits and it already kind of

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410
know what fits and it already kind of
 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.430

down the chin in the nose and edit some

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090
down the chin in the nose and edit some
 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.180
down the chin in the nose and edit some
epoxy putty to the insider to nose to

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190
epoxy putty to the insider to nose to
 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.909
epoxy putty to the insider to nose to
kind of close it off and here I'm using

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919
kind of close it off and here I'm using
 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.730
kind of close it off and here I'm using
a sharpie to block off all the areas

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740
a sharpie to block off all the areas
 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.640
a sharpie to block off all the areas
where I'm going to add more of the epoxy

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650
where I'm going to add more of the epoxy
 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.879
where I'm going to add more of the epoxy
putty or the plastic well I had to do it

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889
putty or the plastic well I had to do it
 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.120
putty or the plastic well I had to do it
in sections because it does cure

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130
in sections because it does cure
 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.629
in sections because it does cure
relatively quickly it just gives me a

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639
relatively quickly it just gives me a
 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.420
relatively quickly it just gives me a
better idea to know exactly how much I'm

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430
better idea to know exactly how much I'm
 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.909
better idea to know exactly how much I'm
going to need and I can kind of see it

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919
going to need and I can kind of see it
 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.770
going to need and I can kind of see it
ahead of time how it all is going to

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780
ahead of time how it all is going to
 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.540
ahead of time how it all is going to
look there play out

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550
 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.070
so I took a piece of PVC that I'm gonna

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080
so I took a piece of PVC that I'm gonna
 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.049
so I took a piece of PVC that I'm gonna
use for the respirator to make those

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:12.059
use for the respirator to make those
 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:21.469
use for the respirator to make those
circles in the mouth I'm going to round

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479
circles in the mouth I'm going to round
 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.139
circles in the mouth I'm going to round
it out clean up all the edges so that

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:24.149
it out clean up all the edges so that
 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:38.029
it out clean up all the edges so that
the piece of PVC fits really smooth all

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039
the piece of PVC fits really smooth all
 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.920
the piece of PVC fits really smooth all
right and so I'm finally applying the

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930
right and so I'm finally applying the
 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.350
right and so I'm finally applying the
plastic walls and you can see me wet my

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360
plastic walls and you can see me wet my
 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.329
plastic walls and you can see me wet my
hands and that's so that I can get a

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:44.339
hands and that's so that I can get a
 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.450
hands and that's so that I can get a
really clean smooth finish without

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460
really clean smooth finish without
 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.709
really clean smooth finish without
having to go in and sand it afterwards

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719
having to go in and sand it afterwards
 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.749
having to go in and sand it afterwards

having to go back and sanded so now
before it's completely cured it's

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:12.689
before it's completely cured it's
 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.019
before it's completely cured it's
getting hard but it's still hit a little

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029
getting hard but it's still hit a little
 

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:18.189
getting hard but it's still hit a little
bit play in it so I'm using that

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199
bit play in it so I'm using that
 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:23.409
bit play in it so I'm using that
sculpting tool to add some of the little

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:02.820
conservative I guess you could say with
 

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.690
conservative I guess you could say with
the amount that I was applying so that I

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:05.700
the amount that I was applying so that I
 

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.230
the amount that I was applying so that I
wouldn't have to try and take any off or

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220
the fact I kind of wanted it all to just
 

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.880
the fact I kind of wanted it all to just
cure so that I can immediately go right

for the respirator I was I got these PVC

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:41.409
for the respirator I was I got these PVC
 

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:45.180
for the respirator I was I got these PVC
pieces but then I also have these little

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:45.190
pieces but then I also have these little
 

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.870
pieces but then I also have these little

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:37.230
actual elements because it was just
 

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:49.120
