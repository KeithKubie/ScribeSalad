00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.290
Music can really set a mood - a little classical
or jazz might relax your whole body, while

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.430
pop or rock music can get your blood pumping
for a night out on the town. But if music

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.020
can seemingly enhance a mindset, or help you
resist mental fatigue, can it also affect

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.480
athletic performance?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.460
The term 'synchronous music' refers to uptempo
songs with a strong beat that coincide with

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.250
the repetitive movements of a sport. And it's
this type of music that leads to a higher

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.750
work output in athletes, particularly in sports
that involve endurance with rhythmic or repetitive

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.280
movements, such as cross country skiing. This
was put into practice as Haile Gebrselassie

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.719
famously synchronised his running stride to
the rhythmical pop song "Scatman" when breaking

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.839
the 10,000m world record.

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.359
Studies show that music can act as both a
cognitive and physical stimulant, especially

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.499
when the music has a personal meaning to the
individual. For athletes who suffer from pre-competition

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:55.319
anxiety, music can be used to enhance mood,
self-esteem and confidence. Even during competition,

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.739
music can narrow an athlete's attention, diverting
focus away from sensations of fatigue.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.379
In studies of athletes using music, those
who listened to pop songs during training

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.470
or warm ups had higher heart rates, and increased
muscle power compared to those who trained

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.820
without music. Furthermore, because music
can trigger emotion, it was documented to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.630
enhance mental imagery - a technique in which
athletes picture themselves mastering a sport

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.299
before competition. This state of mind is
crucial for all athletes, particularly before

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.560
major events. Funny enough, coaches even withhold
music from athletes sometimes, as a motivational

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.840
tool. Athletes are told they can use music
during training sessions, only once they have

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.789
reached a specific productivity level.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.270
So which music works best? Almost all findings
found that listening to music - period - regardless

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.509
of composition or speed, enhanced performance
compared to no music. However, music with

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.229
an upbeat tempo of greater than 120 bpm, yielded
the greatest improvements.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.149
Science says, make a pump up playlist full
of your favourite upbeat songs of the time,

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.100
and blast the competition away.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100
Don't forget: we have a new video out every day during the Olympics. Can't wait?
