00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.199
What’s in a name?

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:10.160
And can our names really affect our outcomes
in life?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.050
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and have you
ever noticed how we tend to associate certain

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.330
names with personalities?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.650
I’m reminded a 30 Rock quote, where Alec
Baldwin’s character points out "There will

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.699
never be a president Ashton.”

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.730
Which seems probable - but is there any science
behind that?

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.519
And can our names really predict our futures?

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.960
It’s an interesting question - and there
have been a lot of studies over the years,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.610
trying to figure out how our names affect
our lives.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.690
A recent one, published in the journal Personality
and Individual Differences, looked at over

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.970
300 pairs of twins in China, and found that
not only is liking your own name predictive

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.240
of your well-being, it’s also determined
in large part, by your genetic and environmental

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240
background.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.530
Another study, published in 2005, found that
boys who were given girl’s names, were more

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.030
likely to have behavioral problems, and as
a result - generally do poorer in school.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.150
There have also been a bevy of studies examining
the racial aspects of naming.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.119
A 2004 study in The American Economic Review,
found that job applicants with white-sounding

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.439
names, as opposed to characteristically black
names - received 50% more callbacks for interviews

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710
- even if their qualifications were the same.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.580
So often times, it’s more about the stereotypes
of other people, than it is about your actual

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.580
name.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.330
There was another study in 2003 on the topic
of racial naming conventions, which argued

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.780
that even if stereotypes like that do affect
job callbacks - it’s unlikely they would

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.039
make a difference beyond the interview stage,
since our perceptions of people’s names

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.179
don’t matter as much, once we’ve personally
met them.

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.510
Racial stereotypes aside, though - how does
all of this work?

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.340
I mean, it’s our parents who name us, after
all - and history shows that parents tend

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.389
to name their kids after people they like.

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:46.470
But is it really just about preference, or
is there some social status at play?

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.709
According to social psychologist Martin Skinner,
"The real consequence is not in the actual

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.310
name itself, but in the intentions behind
it.”

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.829
He says that "Names usually reflect parental
aspirations, so someone who wants their child

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.210
to be taken seriously will give them a name
that has weight and is not frivolous - whatever

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.210
class they are."

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.869
So in a sense, our names reveal more about
our parents, than they do about us.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.869
Here’s a perfect example.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.780
There was a series of studies done in the
mid 1900s, that found that kids with unusual

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.580
or uncommon first names were more likely to
experience mental illness, and in particular

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.530
- psychosis and neurosis.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.610
Now if we’re operating under the assumption
that those names are a reflection of the psychological

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.550
state of their parents, then it’s likely
that the parents chose those names, as a way

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.560
of unconsciously signaling that their kids
are peculiar and perhaps even deserving of

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
ridicule.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.300
If that is the case, then it’s equally as
likely that those parents sent their kids

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.230
other negative messages over the years - unconscious
or not - that could’ve led to them developing

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.370
a mental illness.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.040
And to look at it from another angle, it’s
also entirely possible that the parents who

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.830
gave their kids unusual names, also experienced
similar illnesses, which were then passed

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.690
down to their kids through their genes.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.040
Whatever the case may be - it’s generally
agreed that the outcome your name has on your

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.860
success levels is pretty negligible.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.580
In the long run, your own personal efforts
can easily outweigh the impact of your name.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.580
What do you guys think?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.970
Do you feel like your name has contributed
to your personality?

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.150
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below, and as always - thank you guys for

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.349
