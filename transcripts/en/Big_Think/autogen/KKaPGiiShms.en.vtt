00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.709
A big question—if anybody’s seen the movie
'Minority Report' where people are arrested

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.419
for crimes before they actually commit them,
just because the data suggests they’re going

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.169
to commit a crime—is: are we entering this
world with so much data available?

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:28.010
And there definitely are clues on the internet
that people are considering committing a crime.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.690
People really do type “how to kill your
girlfriend” on Google or “how to commit

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.699
a murder”.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.089
So what should we do with this information
as a society?

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.640
I think we have to be really, really careful.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.440
There’s an ethical and privacy reason to
be careful; as a society it’s not supposed

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.140
to be illegal to have bad thoughts.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.129
But I think there’s also a data science
reason for this.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.220
One of the things that you do see in this
data is that a lot of people have horrific

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.320
thoughts or make horrific searches without
ever going through with a horrific action.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.610
So it may be that when we have all this data
we think we’re just going to be able to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.940
figure out exactly who is a risk of committing
a crime or doing something bad, but it may

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.940
be that it’s just really, really hard because
a huge percentage of people look really, really

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.220
bad on paper but never go through with the
action.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.390
There is a study of Prosper, a peer-to-peer
lending firm.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.920
So people can apply for loans, and scholars
analyzed what people wrote in their loan application,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.230
and whether they paid back their loan.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.590
And they found that you could predict whether
someone will pay back the loan based on the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.950
words that person used in their loan application.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.280
So if a person uses the phrase “I promise”
they’re much less likely to pay back a loan,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.920
because I guess everybody lies, so “I promise”
is a clue that you’re not going to pay back

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.680
the loan.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.010
And one of the more striking indicators, one
of the single highest indicators you’re

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.670
not going to pay back the loan, is if you
use the word “God” in your loan application.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.080
And this is kind of a little bit eerie and
suggests a potentially dark future.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.610
It means that someone, a lender, would be
“wise” to not give a loan to anybody who

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.610
mentions God.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.889
If someone says, “God bless you” in a
loan application they’re put together in

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.859
a large group of other people who tend, on
average, not to pay back their loans.

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:30.489
So there’s real danger to some of this big
data where a lot of the correlation—everything

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.730
kind of correlates with everything else, and
sometimes for reasons that we don’t understand,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.310
some words people use, or likes they have
on Facebook, predict that they’re going

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.620
to do bad things, even if they’re not really
going to do bad things, and they may be punished

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.870
without even realizing why.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.870
One thing you see in the Google search data
related to religion is the questions people

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.750
have, and they’re usually concentrated in
the Bible Belt.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.040
But people have kind of loaded questions about
God.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.810
So “why does God allow bad things to happen
to good people?” or “why does God allow

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.549
suffering?” or “why does God need so much
praise?”

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.749
These are questions that people might not
raise aloud because they don’t want to share

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:20.700
their doubts with others, but they turn to
Google and ask some really, really loaded

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.829
questions about some of the stories that they
hear related to religion.
