00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:02.470
- [Instructor] So we are
asked to drag the point

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.691
to 12.5 on the number line, so let's see.

00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:10.305
Let's see, this is 12, and 12.5
is halfway between 12 and 13

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:13.690
then say say what is 12.5
rounded to the nearest 10?

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.436
Well, what's cool about
this is you can see

00:00:15.436 --> 00:00:19.704
on the number line that our
tens are in this blue hash.

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.690
So we have 10 and then 20
and we're between 10 and 20

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.038
and which one are we closest to?

00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:26.237
Which is literally the nearest 10?

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:29.045
Well, you can see we are
closer to 10 than we are to 20

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:32.941
so you would say 10, and this
helps us build an intuition

00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:36.050
for what rounding to the
nearest 10 even means

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.018
because you might know a rule like,

00:00:38.018 --> 00:00:40.539
hey look, you go one place
less than the tens place,

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.807
which would be the one's place

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:46.151
and if it's less than five
there you round down to 10.

00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:48.504
If it's five or greater
you round up to 20.

00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:51.629
But you see why over here,
we are just closer to 10.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.827
Let's do another example here.

00:00:54.827 --> 00:00:58.160
So here it says drag the point to 0.136.

00:00:59.428 --> 00:01:03.595
So this is 0.13, this is
0.14, so this is 13 hundredths

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.542
and this is 14 hundredths, now let's see.

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:08.873
There's one, two, there, four,

00:01:08.873 --> 00:01:11.973
five, six, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:11.973 --> 00:01:15.882
So these are, you could think
of it as the ten thousandths

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:18.163
between these two hundredths.

00:01:18.163 --> 00:01:21.165
So we want to go 13 hundredths

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:23.616
and then another six thousandths.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:27.783
So let's see, we go one,
two, three, four, five, six.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.146
Just like that, and then
they say what is this number?

00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:36.313
136 thousandths or 0.136 rounded
to the nearest hundredth.

00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:42.065
Well, we have our hundredths in blue here,

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:43.220
and which one are we closer to?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.156
Well, we're closer to 14 hundredths, 0.14.

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:49.571
And that's consistent with
what we've seen in other cases

00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:51.587
where you look at the thousandths place

00:01:51.587 --> 00:01:53.876
and if it's five or greater you round up.

00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:57.161
In this case, you would
round up to 14 hundredths.

00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:00.654
Let's do a few more examples here.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:04.725
So let's say that, so they're asking us

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:08.392
which point is at 44.197
on the number line?

00:02:09.743 --> 00:02:13.258
So let's see, that's going
to be between 44 and 45,

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:17.425
so it's right over here, 44.197,
so that would be point C.

00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:21.878
And then they say, what is 44.197 rounded

00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:24.774
to the nearest whole number?

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.901
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.486
You could just look at the tenths place

00:02:29.486 --> 00:02:33.301
and say look, that's less than
five so we round down to 44

00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:35.532
or a more intuitive way
of thinking about it

00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:38.395
is like look, point C is
the number we care about.

00:02:38.395 --> 00:02:39.645
That is 44.197.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.562
What's the closest whole number to it?

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:46.046
Is it closer to 44 or is it closer to 45?

00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:48.774
Well, it's clearly closer to 44,

00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:52.372
so that's another reason
why 44 makes a lot of sense.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.455
Let's do another example.

00:02:55.716 --> 00:02:58.966
Let's say that we want to, so they say,

00:03:00.152 --> 00:03:02.828
what is A rounded to
the nearest thousandth?

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:06.142
What is A rounded to
the nearest hundredth?

00:03:06.142 --> 00:03:09.056
So A is right over here,
let's get our bearings.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.851
So 0.7, that's seven hundredths.

00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:15.859
This is eight hundredths right over here.

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.044
And then between them, let's see,

00:03:18.044 --> 00:03:21.013
this looks like it's
zero, so you can view this

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:24.343
as 70 thousandths, 71
thousandths, 72 thousandths,

00:03:24.343 --> 00:03:27.921
73 thousandths, 74 thousandths, and so on.

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:31.930
So this is between 78
thousands and 79 thousandths.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.640
So if we round to the nearest thousandth

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.776
it looks closer, in fact,
it's definitely closer

00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:39.010
to 78 thousandths than
it is to 79 thousandths.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.010
So I would say this is
0.078, or 78 thousandths.

00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:45.907
That's closer, that's
the nearest thousandth.

00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:49.617
What is A rounded to
the nearest hundredth?

00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:52.277
Well, what are the hundredths
that it's in-between?

00:03:52.277 --> 00:03:56.053
It's in-between seven
hundredths and eight hundredths.

00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:57.514
And which one is it closer to?

00:03:57.514 --> 00:04:01.181
Well, it's closer to
eight hundredths, 0.08.

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:04.267
So once again, the whole
point of this video

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:06.017
is to appreciate when people say round

00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:08.943
to the nearest whole
number, to the nearest 10,

00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:10.969
to the nearest thousandth,
to the nearest hundredth,

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.604
you can think of it on a
number line and just say,

00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:16.234
well, what is the closest hundredth to it?

00:04:16.234 --> 00:04:18.412
Or what hundredth is it closest to?

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:21.638
Which thousandth is it
closest to on the number line?
