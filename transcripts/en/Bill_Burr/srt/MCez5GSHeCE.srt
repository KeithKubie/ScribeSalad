1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:01,951
Hey,

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:05,260
what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's
time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:09,600
Monday, April 23rd, 2018 what's going on?

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,230
How are you?
How's it going?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,510
I'm actually recording
this on fucking Wednesday.

6
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:17,640
April 25th case.

7
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,490
You're listening to this in the future
and you wanted to know what was going on

8
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:25,230
with me as far as my health goes. Now
notice I said, as far as my health goes,

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,000
instead of healthwise,

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,900
I learned in vocab improvement
back in high school.

11
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:35,340
There's no such thing as the
wiseguys healthwise weather wise.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,750
You know, that's why I can never
listen to come fly with me. Why the,

13
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:43,980
why is it such a lovely day?
A frank, I know you connected,

14
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:46,950
but that's improper grammar.
All right?

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,740
I'm not attacking you or your heritage
or the fact that you from New Jersey or

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,310
right. You overly sensitive. So and so,
um, I'm just saying that that's, you know,

17
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:59,010
I don't know who wrote that song.
Okay.

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,900
So why don't you Scooby doo the.dot,
dot. Abou over to a fucking dictionary.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,120
And you, you find me
weather-wise, Francis. Um,

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,460
am I really trashing a dead fucking
Frank Sinatra? Sorry, I'm, I'm not, I'm,

21
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:16,650
I'm almost lied and tried to tell you
I'm on cold medication when I don't take

22
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:17,484
cold medication.

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,380
Cold medication is for
fucking millennials.

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,700
All right. And even if you're older and
you take it, you're a millennial at heart,

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,180
he can't deal with the fact that you
got yourself sick. You need to lay down,

26
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,010
get eight hours and let your body
fucking go through it. All right?

27
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,700
The reason why your nose is running
this cause is trying to get the virus. I

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,750
just let it APP. He's fucking
assholes. I swear to God, man.

29
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,410
The amount of people that gave me advice,
you know,

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,010
there's no cure for the common cold, but
everybody thinks they have one. You know,

31
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:58,011
I'd say I'd go try some zinc shot a
whiskey tube I manage manager told me,

32
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,460
he goes, vitamin D, everybody
thinks it's safe. Vitamin D,

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,690
unbelievable. Well, the
greatest managers in the world,

34
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,180
and he also knows the cure for
a cold. I mean, who knew that?

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,450
Which is fucking with you, Dave. Um,

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,310
let's get that higher on
the way. Um, Jesus Christ,

37
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,050
this is just a cold that won't quit.

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,310
This is the cold that's letting me
know that mother nature is regrouping.

39
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,020
You know,
right now we're squeezing her all right.

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,071
Like the way Andre,

41
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:36,930
the giant was squeezed in fucking Hulk
Hogan in that documentary and they lift

42
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,260
in Mother Nature's arm
and then dropping it down.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,780
They lifted up to dropping it down like,
oh my God, the bad guys are gonna win.

44
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,670
And at one point or I'm just gonna stay
there and she's going to start shaking a

45
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:52,140
fucking blonde hair.
I was always my favorite part when,

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,990
how could start coming back and he'd
give him that one big head and then he'd

47
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:59,470
walk around the ring looking up in the
looking up at the rafters to shake his

48
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,880
head. Uh, that was the best. I watched
that documentary like three times.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,940
And when, uh, when, um, I watched that,

50
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,530
that part of the fight with NEA,

51
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,530
we were both laughing our asses
off in a great way, like day,

52
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:19,531
just some of the greatest fucking
performers of all time and professional

53
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,730
wrestlers.
You know,

54
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,310
when I was growing up right through
the rock and all of those guys,

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,950
like their ability, stone cold, all
of them, their ability to work a crowd

56
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,600
is just, it's second to none. You know,

57
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,210
I got a buddy of mine's
still going like, dude. Yeah,

58
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,780
but isn't it like a fake fight? You
know it, but isn't it like a fake fight?

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,680
It's just like I,
how fucking dumb are you?

60
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,140
It's like, yes, it's entertainment.

61
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,310
They think they fucking set at like
30 years ago and some guy cried.

62
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,170
All right.

63
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,830
And the greatest thing they ever did was
say that it was all arranged and all of

64
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,300
that shit for the most part.

65
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,330
So then they could actually talk about
how fucking heart they got when they

66
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:14,620
actually would do in these fake fights.
I had to tell Burnsy though, likeZ ,

67
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,140
if you knew,
okay,

68
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:20,410
we had a fake fight and I said I was
going to pick you up and throw you across

69
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:24,100
the room and you're going to
land on your back, you know,

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,070
that would still hurt even though,
you know,

71
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:31,000
we arranged that I was going to happen.
Right. Physics is still in play there. No,

72
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,501
sorry,

73
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,870
I'm a little hot here with this fucking
Mike's and I was having a problem with

74
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:39,430
my recorder here. Oh God.
Um, so believe it or not,

75
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:44,170
I'm actually on the other side of this
thing. I completely lost my voice by,

76
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,670
uh, by Sunday. And um,

77
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,160
so I started gargling with a little bit
of a apple cider vinegar and some salt

78
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:58,060
in there. That kind of cleared
me up a little bit. Um,

79
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,191
I'll do that shit,

80
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,400
but I'm not going down to the
fucking drug store even though I did.

81
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,550
And I bought all this shit and I just
looked at the ingredients. I'm like,

82
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:08,830
I'm not putting this in my fucking body.
So basically what?

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,080
I kicked the shit out of my fucking liver.

84
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,770
So this medicine can fool my fucking
knows that I don't have a cold.

85
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,040
I apologize to file stuff Ian.

86
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,120
But I gotta do this cause I'm going to
be fucking backed up on podcast cause I

87
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,080
got the Thursday one tomorrow.
I'm liking that.

88
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,880
I love Lucy sketch where they got the
chocolates coming down except it's

89
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:32,740
podcasting and he cries, I don't
have time for this shit. Um,

90
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,560
guess what the fuck I watched yesterday
on the plane coming back actually went

91
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:43,060
up to Boston and I visited
my family big east and I'm

92
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,240
on a two,
by the way,

93
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:50,200
the fucking anger that is
still in Massachusetts.

94
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,580
It's not really what the younger kids,

95
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:55,210
which kind of makes me happy
and a little bit sad. You know,

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,920
some point you do have
to let go of the anger,

97
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:00,020
but I hope I help all the characters
are still, you know, around.

98
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,780
But I was driving through my,
uh,

99
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,390
my old neighborhood and I was this cop
to erect and traffic and a little fucking

100
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,270
three way stop. He tells this guy
to stop and evidently he didn't.

101
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,810
And the cop starts flipping
out and I'm like, fucking two,

102
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:17,640
three cars down the line. So I,
I can't hear what the guy say,

103
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:21,590
but he is fucking flailing his
arms like Earl weaver, right.

104
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,900
He manages the Orioles about
fucking 40 years ago. Sorry. Um,

105
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,680
and I'm laughing my balls off. How
fucking angry is it? The Sky. Right.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,090
And then when he gets the guy to stop
and then the other key waves us to start

107
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,650
going,
like that's not enough for him.

108
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,410
He walks up to the guy's car
and starts screaming at him.

109
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,560
So I'm thinking maybe this is some young
punk with his radio turned up and he's

110
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:49,820
not listened to the cop. I show up. It's
like some old dude with like white hair,

111
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,970
this fucking eight foot
cop screaming at him.

112
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,530
Uh, I don't know how
you do it. I would not,

113
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,690
I would not have handled that.
Well if he came up to my window,

114
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:06,860
there's no way I would've been like relax.
And then I would have been, you know,

115
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,723
in cuffs,

116
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,680
cause she can't tell a guy who's flipping
out and screaming at you to fucking

117
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:13,131
relax.

118
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:17,570
I need to learn my rights for those
moments because I am a control freak and I

119
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,081
forget that.

120
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:22,670
I don't know how to fight in those moments
and I just immediately go to go fuck

121
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:25,250
yourself. And then, and
then the ramification comes

122
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,110
that I am not prepared for.
Um,

123
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,670
I actually got angry for
that guy and started,

124
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,170
drove past the cops saying all this shit
to the cop in my car to myself as if I

125
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:43,430
was that guy talking to that cop of
fucking nuts. Is that or is that normal?

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
Is that something you do?
I just feel like for me,

127
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,803
yeah.

128
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,310
Ah, Jesus Christ. Um,

129
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,210
I haven't been this sick
since I've been at Dan,

130
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,540
which is fucking brutal to get this
sick when you're a dad because then you

131
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,720
can't hug your kid.
Uh,

132
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,180
which is the worst.
I mean,

133
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:10,110
that's what you have a kid
for so he can hug up right in.

134
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:13,010
Lie about what you did when you were
a kid. Right. That's what you do. Wow.

135
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:15,840
I used to make my bed every day.
I did all my homework.

136
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,050
I was never a problem for my parents.
Um,

137
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,230
anyways, I, uh, I had a fucking amazing
weekend, so I got to work for the Ryman.

138
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,390
Once again. That's the third time I've
been there. I did Vince Vaughn's, uh,

139
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Nashville Comedy Festival in
2014 than I did it again in 2016.

140
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,520
I take my life specialty
or walk your way out.

141
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,270
And then I got to do a one show Friday,
one show Saturday,

142
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,340
and they brought me a drum
kit and shit to play on.

143
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,720
And I was so sick I couldn't
play. It felt bad. And, um,

144
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,990
I had a splitting fucking,

145
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,240
but the shows were really
fun and I actually a,

146
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,040
I always hit that Jack's
barbecue next door and then,
uh, I went to the Woolworth,

147
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,070
they're going to Woolworths sales
like, oh, with a fucking lunch counter.

148
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,980
Like where they had like back
in the day during segregation,

149
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,390
whether they just like only white people
can sit here and get a grilled cheese

150
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,070
sale,
which God made everybody in his image.

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,340
Buddy made us culture to his image and
he loves his just a little bit better

152
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,174
because of that.

153
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,180
We get to see that this shiny
counter that RST you on wide wide,

154
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,350
wide fucking guy gotta go around back.
Uh,

155
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,580
so I sat down, I got a
fucking cheeseburger. They're,
you know, taking pictures.

156
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:42,790
Just I, I went into Woolworth's like
a white person going, oh my God,

157
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,840
I remember these things.
You know,

158
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,210
he used to be able to buy fucking his
shirt and then get a cheeseburger.

159
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,560
So I walked in not realizing
the historical, um,

160
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,710
magnitude of what I was walking
into. I was just walking, okay guys,

161
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,520
just sell shirts here now buddy.

162
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,380
We doubt we don't have to.

163
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,240
And I walked right up
to the fucking count.

164
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:05,560
I was taking pictures and shit and
everybody thought I was like some fucking

165
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,730
historian and I wasn't,

166
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I was as excited that had the same
emotional historical context to me is if I

167
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:17,320
walked into a Jordan Marsh,
did they have Jordan Marsh has anymore?

168
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,460
Do you remember all those? Uh,
all those defunct superstores

169
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,730
it's funny,

170
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,000
they were evil when they came out cause
they put out the mom and pop businesses

171
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:31,670
and then eventually when you watch them
get eaten yellow, you, he ended up, uh,

172
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,760
feeling bad for them.

173
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,510
Okay.

174
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,740
Places like mammoth mark,

175
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,820
you remember mammoth mart and a big woolly
mammoth child world got destroyed by

176
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:45,460
fucking toys r us leach mayor.

177
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,820
They lost out to the fucking best buys.

178
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,150
Radio Shack is still a few of them
left over. You know what I mean?

179
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,650
They're like fucking old Nazis is still,

180
00:10:56,651 --> 00:11:00,430
a couple of them are running around
scurrying around South America.

181
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:04,360
You know what I mean? Trying to get a
fucking tant fit in with the regulars.

182
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,020
Right.
Um Hm.

183
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,850
Well some of the other ones
that they used to have,

184
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:13,310
I can't even remember
anyone so long goes filings,

185
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:17,040
Jordan Marsh that Macy's just came a log,

186
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,080
just fucked him all up.
Just fucked him all up.

187
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,570
Bloomingdale's beat the
fuck out of everybody.

188
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,520
And then you had all those like stores
she just heard about. But you know,

189
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,100
like Saks fifth avenue
when I was a little kid, I,

190
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,800
they might've been one in Boston,

191
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:38,970
but I think if you wanted to go to Saks
fifth avenue, had to go to fifth avenue

192
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,140
in New York City and nobody
really fucking knew all of the,

193
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:49,960
all of that, all of that
designer shit that, um,

194
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,110
all the kids were nowadays like,
and I was like mobile, Alabama.

195
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,820
They had like a fucking a Louis Vuitton
store. They never used to have that shit.

196
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,500
Okay.

197
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,720
Do you know what I mean?
They only had three series of the BMW,

198
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,140
the three, the five and the seven
though. They also had the six.

199
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,320
If you couldn't afford one of those,
go fuck yourself.

200
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,700
They didn't make it fucking SUV. I
didn't think. I don't think they did.

201
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,280
They didn't have a one series, a
to series of four series, you know,

202
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,890
just fucking doing anything they can.
That's,

203
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:28,270
I couldn't Miss Mercedes Benz
drop their Co. Not that quality,

204
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:31,030
but they dropped it all the way
down where you could buy the, uh,

205
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,320
was it the one 90? He, the
baby Benz, they used to call it

206
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,390
a sudden you drive around in Mercedes
Benz that cost the same amount of money as

207
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,220
a Monte Carlo,
right?

208
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,510
And you were this Monte Carlo
fucking t top pot dealer Douche.

209
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,800
You know who would it looked
right in his Oldsmobile cutlass.

210
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,360
But instead you'd ride around this one
90 he like, you're fucking sophisticated.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,970
Everybody saw right through
your, you know, second he
got out of the fucking car,

212
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:04,860
right though your personal belongings
fall on the fucking ground. You know,

213
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,830
some scale to weigh your product.

214
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,390
I know what I'm talking about.
But when I was a kid,

215
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,670
all the cool older guys to guys who
like 25 which to me was a man yet a

216
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,460
mustache.
You had your own place.

217
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,460
It chick was living with you and you can
fuck her whenever you wanted. You know,

218
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,980
my id is a 14 year old to
eat Liz with her daycare.

219
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,170
He can fuck her whenever he wants to.
Not Realizing,

220
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,170
not realizing like the fucking
that he was probably looking at me,

221
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,230
envious of me.
Go and look at that fucking orange headed,

222
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,890
hairless faced fucking loser over there.

223
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,400
He's got it all ahead of does
it have any credit card bills?

224
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,240
It doesn't have some broad living with
a bitch moaning and complaining about

225
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:57,241
where he leaves his fucking neon
green fucking sunglasses anyways.

226
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,920
But when I was looking at him,
they were the coolest people ever.

227
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,050
And then there was,
there was the Buick Regal,

228
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,420
no Monte Carlo in the Oldsmobile cutlass
and they were the these two door coops.

229
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,630
And if you've got the fucking
t top, you know, I love it.

230
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:12,470
I love the guy that went
down to the fucking art,

231
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,890
whatever the whatever auto parts store

232
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,800
that the auto zone's eight all up.
If you go down there.

233
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:24,480
And I remember people would get their,
uh, they put curb finders on them,

234
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,250
they'd cut tee tops at them.
They get the glass tinted,

235
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:31,980
the fucking headlights tinted,
all these cheesy shit.

236
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,500
They'd get accustomed license
plate on the front said like Mikey,

237
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,320
you know,

238
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,320
you are the fucking mad if you
actually get a CD player and Emma,

239
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,010
that was a big thing. Like you
gotta like it was an external thing.

240
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,110
I remember this guy I knew he had
a fucking Volkswagen show, Rocco,

241
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,850
which I swear to God, that
was the name of the car. Um,

242
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,420
and he had this fucking
CD player and it was like,

243
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,220
it was like an external hard drives.

244
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:09,221
Like you had to plug this cord in that
bed plugged into the CD that was mounted

245
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,200
on the arm rest between
the two bucket seats.

246
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,180
And if you even hiccuped in the car,
the CD skipped,

247
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,660
but it was still fucking insane.

248
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,010
Then of course she had to have your
radar detector for the fucking state he

249
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:27,740
stowed. And all of that is God. You
know it back debt. If you've got a cold,

250
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:30,890
you put a little Vick's vapor rub on
your fucking chest and that was it.

251
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,870
No wonder they got
Jesus Christ and if could fucking,

252
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,680
they can hold off the HIV virus.
Now you'd think that they could fucking,

253
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:43,010
you know,
do something about the cold.

254
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:46,510
But you always pay a price is always a
price to pay. You know, he's always pet,

255
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:50,250
you know, he's the battered fucking wife
of your organs is your fucking liver.

256
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,370
Your liver always takes it.
You know what I mean?

257
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,090
You fuck up in other areas and
then you take your medicine, right?

258
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,720
Here's scatterbrain loaded take.
You can't get to sleep.

259
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:05,660
So you take some Tylenol pm and who
pays for it? Huh? You fucking liver.

260
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,413
MMM.

261
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,470
How many times are you going to have
your liver have to walk around with his

262
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:17,190
eyes looking down at your fucking
colon, you know, as the other fucking

263
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,660
Oregon's it going. What
happened? I walked into the ribs.

264
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,320
Is he making light of domestic violence?
Yes,

265
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,150
I am. Um, I think that's the
problem with this country.

266
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:38,310
There needs to be more domestic violence.

267
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,330
We actually live in an era that summer
wouldn't even look at that even remotely

268
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:44,590
is fucking absurd.
Um,

269
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,880
and in an era where fucking,
I can't say the word anymore,

270
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,530
people, unlike the, uh, the Internet,

271
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,810
we'll just take that clip and
they try to get you in trouble.

272
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,840
You know what I mean? Everybody's rat
and everybody out. Like, you know,

273
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:04,090
I really looked at that
fucking Conor McGregor thing.

274
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,400
Who was that guy videotaping it for?

275
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,530
And then he fucking puts it up on the
fucking Internet and just get Cisco Guy

276
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,870
and all this fucking trouble. I'm not
saying Conor McGregor was right, but like,

277
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,900
who's this fucking ass? Like if I was
there, I wouldn't videotape that shit.

278
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,920
I would just be like, wow, glad
I wasn't on that bus. Right.

279
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,543
You know?

280
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,180
I mean,
that guy's a reason.

281
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:31,290
Everybody on that bus who's making fucking
a zillion dollars anyways, isn't he?

282
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,990
I can't every once in a while throw a
fucking two wheeler at a god by me. Chip,

283
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,330
you're the fucking champ,
you know?

284
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,803
Okay.

285
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,250
We'll get a little bit of leeway.

286
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:48,000
All it takes is one fucking touche with
his flip phone and all of a sudden he's

287
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,083
down there talking to the,

288
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,173
okay,

289
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,900
uh, I don't know if talking about,
guess what today is everybody? Oh,

290
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:59,730
it's gained seven for the Boston Bruins.
Um,

291
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,010
everybody's freaking out and
all this shit. I'm like, God,

292
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,750
we have three games to one.
It gives a fuck.

293
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,500
How are we going to do is win tonight?
Well, you gotta do is win tonight.

294
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,330
No one fucking remembers so
many series that are three,
two, one, go to game seven.

295
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,650
It happens all the fucking time.

296
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,533
MMM.

297
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,090
I will say though,
as a Bruins fan,

298
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,210
if I see and have to listen
to one more commentator,

299
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:24,190
tell me that it was a stretch pass.

300
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,023
MMM.

301
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,770
You know, and Jesus Christ said,
Anderson has played so great for Toronto.

302
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:35,270
I don't know why he does all that, flop
it around you literally skate by the guy.

303
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,640
Wind knocks him off his fucking feet.
Just shameless, shameless. But, um,

304
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,700
I liked the fucking maple leafs,
you know what I mean?

305
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,870
Despite their timidly cocky fans on
Twitter who said absolutely nothing,

306
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,710
and now all of a sudden, you know, they
like mere cats, you know what I mean?

307
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,820
With a fucking Cobra comes around and they
all sit there lunging at you and shit,

308
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,570
talking all this shit as a backup.
But they're not really going to fight.

309
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,720
They're trying to appear bigger than
they are. Um, I got no beef with Toronto.

310
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,230
You guys went tonight. Congratulations.
I can get past it. I don't give a fuck.

311
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,300
Right. Um, I know that we're a
team of the future and so you guys,

312
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,040
this would probably be the beginning
of a great rivalry. That's who we need.

313
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,780
God knows because the Canadians
are in the fucking shit or

314
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,203
mmm.

315
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,340
I have this fucking guy that like,
I came from her fuck,

316
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,720
I met him soon,

317
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:29,780
like a Gig a long time ago and he drove
us there and somebody got my phone

318
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:32,270
number, this fucking cunt.
Every year during the playoffs.

319
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,530
[inaudible] the bruise do so good.
Good. One of those fucking do shit.

320
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,630
So I finally,
I just finally blocked his number.

321
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,150
[inaudible] I don't get
this. Gets like, I get it.

322
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,920
You fucking drove me to a couple of gigs.

323
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,150
I get to listen to your fucking horse
shit. Every time we're doing bad,

324
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,250
there's so many fucking county
sports fans like that. Um,

325
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,000
and after almost 20 years
of voting a cell phone,

326
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:02,030
I finally learned how to block people.
I love it.

327
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,730
It's fucking love it.

328
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,790
It's just like ill if somebody I used
to work with to this business fucking,

329
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:11,540
I don't know what the fuck his deal was,

330
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:15,440
he fucking started calling
me and emailing me. Yeah.

331
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,600
Block over.
You know what I mean?

332
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,410
It's like you get to assassinate somebody
without having to kill him and deal

333
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:26,690
with the guilt,
you know.

334
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,180
Okay.

335
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,990
I wonder if in the future when we're all
just being watched by robots and every

336
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,350
last thing you do is videotaped.
Um,

337
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,180
so you can't do anything wrong.

338
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:41,960
I wonder if they'll have to switch
the commandments just so they can get

339
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:44,720
somebody in trouble because
nobody can do anything anymore.

340
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,400
So rather than thou shall not kill
the fifth commandment, we'll be,

341
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:51,550
thou shall not block
somebody on your cell phone.

342
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,760
You shall not assassinate them digitally.

343
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
I'm sorry,
did I just,

344
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,760
did I just float out a perfect
premise for the next blade runner?

345
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,520
Um, no I didn't. I did that. However,

346
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,640
there was that movie that came out where
people had to take a test and if you

347
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:15,130
know, when the world was
overpopulated, those fucking cuts,

348
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:17,920
where the hell did you get that idea? It,
God bless him. But you know what I mean?

349
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:21,970
How about a tip of the cap?
Um,

350
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,040
anyways, side people have
just had a fucking, all right,

351
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,270
I've just had a headache for so physical.
I did buy some bare aspirin. I did that.

352
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,450
Uh, Celtics. Everybody
about those Boston Celtics.

353
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:36,520
How about the hot or the Boston Celtics?

354
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,560
And how about those
fucking Milwaukee Bucks?

355
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,240
This is the best state Ben since backward.
Like Sidney Moncrief,

356
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,860
you know that they got that white dude
from fucking the Seattle Sonics with that

357
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:50,380
fuck was his name
Jack Sick?

358
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,070
Um, but I have to be honest with you,
dude, the basketball is so fucking awful.

359
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,160
Then I'm watching,
they're I even playing hoop.

360
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:03,430
It looks like a fucking pickup game and,
and an unbelievably high level.

361
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,210
How many fucking times can you throw
up a three with nobody underneath

362
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,820
is it, let me, I don't understand
that new little semicircle there.

363
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,410
I gotta look read up on it in the paint.

364
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,490
Is it illegal if you don't have the ball
as an offensive player to get under the

365
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:19,324
fucking rib?

366
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,520
Was the last time you saw a center post
up and put his hand in the air and do a

367
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:28,940
couple up and under. She got a little
Kevin Mchale Action Little Sky Hook.

368
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,140
It's all fucking God.

369
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,810
You just run down the court a little
pass and then the guy just takes a three

370
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,010
point.
I didn't go ahead

371
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,560
or somebody does so and one shit to
try to get around. A guy dropped foul.

372
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,110
It's fucking,
it's horrible.

373
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,560
I think a lot of the
entire second quarter,

374
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:51,280
I don't think I saw one pick and roll.
You know,

375
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:55,420
there's a reason that they did that for
fucking close to 80 years. It works.

376
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,020
I don't know why everybody's trying
to do this globe trotter shit.

377
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,710
[inaudible] uh, having said that, I
love where we're going in the future.

378
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:09,760
I just don't like the future of the game.
I guess people got too big.

379
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:12,070
Is that what it was?
Um,

380
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,020
I missed the bang and down
low in the paint, you know?

381
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,010
Yeah.

382
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,030
And then fucking old school yard play
where the guy's leaning against you leave

383
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,160
it and you stepped out behind him. Like
he pulled his chair out, he falls down,

384
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,200
then they'd stand up and
get in each other's grills
there the little fucking ref

385
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,260
came up to the Dick's was trying to
push them apart. I miss all of that.

386
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,090
I missed it man. I miss
the way you smell. Um,

387
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,440
I actually got to be honest with
you, I shut the game off. Okay.

388
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,660
Cause I was so fuck I, cause I fucking
hate NBA hoop. I just hate basketball.

389
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,430
I just hate how no lead is safe.
It's like you're up by 40,

390
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,900
you go with the kitchen and then you
make a sandwich and it's like the other

391
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:01,880
team on a 38 to
follow the three pointer.

392
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,480
This could tie it up. It's
just like, can there ever be,

393
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,400
can you ever just have an easy win?
Um,

394
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,750
I just felt myself getting ready to throw
something at the fucking TV and I got

395
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,450
a kid now so I can't,
so I just shut it off and I was just,

396
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,910
then I just watched the score throughout
the fourth quarter and they want it.

397
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,570
I was like good. Uh, a more of
a hockey guy. Obviously, um,

398
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,830
and having said that, I, you
know, of course I have to,

399
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:33,470
I've got to edit some shift for
emphasis of family tonight. Um,

400
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,520
but I'll get to watch most of the game.
It's only a game seven,

401
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,250
you know, um, I'm very excited for this.

402
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,510
You gotta love of games of it.

403
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,060
Even if your team was up to your one
who gives a fuck gotta love a game.

404
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:50,600
Seven and a, and here's the
deal is if we lose to Toronto,

405
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:53,690
that's my team for the rest of the
playoffs because they haven't won since 67

406
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:54,920
and uh,

407
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,590
I think it's high time that they get and
it'd be cool to see Winnepeg get their

408
00:24:57,591 --> 00:25:01,640
first one. So those are my
two teams. Those are my onesy.

409
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:05,630
Twosy alright. Um, so there you go.

410
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,660
There's your fucking Bruins
as your NBA and Nhl Hay fever.

411
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,400
Fucking talk for the God damn week.
Oh,

412
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:20,300
you know what else I forgot to fucking
mentioned? I started to mention it. Well,

413
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,790
maybe I'll mention it after I,
I do a little law.

414
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,110
I got one read for this week. All right.
Boto Dude, do me on days me undies.

415
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,300
Get in the fucking paint. Do,
do dooby on days beyond ease.

416
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,760
Throw it down to is tanked.

417
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,020
Sped around and fucking dunk it.

418
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,370
Stop throwing up threes if you please.
It's fucking boring.

419
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:48,310
I feel like I'm at the fucking
Ymc a except people can't dunk.

420
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,630
You've heard me talk about me undies
and you know that I'm a big believer

421
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,240
in their product.

422
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,830
They just sent me another bag onto where
these guys got to stop. It's just like,

423
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:04,610
I don't have a bladder
problem. Okay, I get it.

424
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:07,580
You guys make a lot of underwear.
I have some and I like it.

425
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,520
You don't need to send me
some every fucking month.

426
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,620
Treat me like you fucking
underwear whore on the side. Uh,

427
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,260
there perfect balance of comfortable fit.

428
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,940
Every month they have new and exciting
prince and they arrive at your door and

429
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:27,410
have fun. Bag me undies. Uh, uses

430
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,590
Lenzing micro modal. Modal in their
underwear is sustainably sourced.

431
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,460
Naturally soft fiber that starts with
beechwood trees and ends with the most

432
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:39,380
imagined amazing fabric
you've ever experienced.

433
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:44,250
I don't know why that is in the
fucking copy. At least in my copy.

434
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,070
My listeners are not smart.
I'm not smart.

435
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:49,530
When you start saying that your
underwear is made out of trees,

436
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:54,210
we start thinking about getting split
us in our under carriage, you know?

437
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,133
Yeah.

438
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,390
Joe Era about fucking Fitzy can't
have kids be is fucking underwear.

439
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,400
It was being out of beechwood trees.
A fucking took them off too fast.

440
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:07,220
He stabbed both his balls. He's got
nobody. He's got no more Chez left. Well,

441
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,690
it's because it ran down his leg.
Chad, you listen to the fucking story.

442
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,550
The results have been downright
dreamy beyond these adventurers.

443
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,880
Prints and designs are all limited
editions. Yeah. It just, I,

444
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:21,160
I wouldn't even take them out of the
rap. You know, who knows somebody,

445
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,240
somebody might want to collect them.

446
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:27,241

460
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,020
That's me. [inaudible] dot
com slash Berg. All right,

461
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,870
so I've tasted twice.
Let me see.

462
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,820
Liverpool football.

463
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,550
Yeah,

464
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,470
she schedule.
What do they play next?

465
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:28,471
I was on the plane and I actually watch
liberal Liverpool for fucking robot.

466
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,013
Okay.

467
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:30,760
Yeah,

468
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,850
and it was a shock. It was a
blowout. It was an awesome game.

469
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,840
Liverpool went up five to fucking nothing.

470
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,350
Yeah,

471
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,000
Saturday 4:30 AM

472
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,020
I don't I? I just, I just don't
fucking get how this shit works.

473
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,470
They're playing robot.
Isn't that like Rome?

474
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,693
Yeah,

475
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,880
that's the Champions League.
Semifinal

476
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,900
leg two of two.

477
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,180
Yeah.

478
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,480
Aggregate two to five.
Yeah. They won five to two.

479
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,150
So they get to play again on May 2nd.

480
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,980
Is that because they scored five
goals and from promise score to,

481
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,800
what is the coincidence that I just
don't understand it because they were up

482
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,480
five to nothing and then
all of a sudden Rome,

483
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,400
Roman scored a goal and then they scored
another one on a penalty kick and then

484
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:31,100
they was saying in the announcers are
going nuts. I'm like, what day is it?

485
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,250
Fucking two minutes left.
Why?

486
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,780
They flipping out like they're
going to lose this case.

487
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,860
I think there were in some
sort of tournament that
happens at the same time that

488
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,640
the premiership is being played.
Right.

489
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,513
It's weird.

490
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,220
Like that's the Champions League and
I think Liverpool Chelsea, that's

491
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,610
the Premiere Premiere League.
Right? They do it at the same,

492
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:54,260
somebody for the love of God.

493
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,280
Somebody over there in Great Britain
somewhere around the fucking world

494
00:29:58,281 --> 00:30:02,510
explained to me what's going on.
Cause I actually really enjoyed, um,

495
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,760
the fucking game to this guy. Holy Shit.
This Egyptian dude who kind of look,

496
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:11,270
he looks like an Egyptian Judd Apatow.
Most Salah,

497
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,420
this fucking guy put on a goddamn clinic.
First of all,

498
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:21,080
he used to play for Roma. So he scores
a goal. Then he does his big dramatic,

499
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:23,630
I'm not going to celebrate,
you know,

500
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:28,460
which was more annoying that if he just
celebrated because said he scored again.

501
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,230
The first one was like a fight. It
was like a lot of it's like hockey.

502
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,630
What fucking top shelf
corner on the far side,

503
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,120
I believe with his left foot.

504
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:47,830
And then a few minutes later whenever
he comes back down again and he just in

505
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:52,130
that one, that was the first one was a
fucking blast and the next one is nice,

506
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:55,550
soft touch right up and over
the fucking guy. The goalkeeper,

507
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:59,090
I believe for a second goal.
Once again, he starts praying,

508
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:02,150
getting on his knees and fucking kiss
in the ground and doing all this shit.

509
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,090
Like he's not going to have a
threesome after the fucking game.

510
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,180
You know what I mean? Like he's going to
go fucking rescue a cat out of a tree.

511
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,740
So I do take your junk out and shake
it and the other teams face, you know,

512
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:16,470
you want to. And then he
set up, he had two assists,

513
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:20,600
whatever they call the helpers,
uh, two fucking crumpets.

514
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:22,760
I don't know what the fuck they call you.
Guy had like four points.

515
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,570
If he was playing hockey, two goals,
two assists. It was incredible.

516
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:29,360
Then there was this other poor best,
and I think he finally scored a goal.

517
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,170
He had a breakaway fuck that up
that he was in when in hockey,

518
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:36,290
what would be called the slot.
And he just fucking, ms kicked it,

519
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,060
blasted over the fucking net.

520
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,620
I think he spent more time on his
fucking Mohawk than he did on his fucking

521
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,330
learning, on a shoot the ball
into the Goddamn net. But,
uh, there was seven goals.

522
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,410
It was like the kind of fucking soccer
game that a yank could enjoy. But, uh,

523
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:55,190
I was stuck on a plane and we had
a ridiculous headwind. I was like,

524
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:59,120
I'm going to sit here and
watch this fucking thing. And
I totally got into it. Uh,

525
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,530
by the way, Liverpool's
fucking, uh, coach,

526
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,380
his dentists should be fucking disbarred.

527
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,650
He should have his license
fucking revoked. You know,

528
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,450
I'm sure it was the coach's idea,

529
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:17,770
but if you got to fucking go tan and you
don't get your fake teeth whitened to

530
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,770
that level,
Jesus Christ,

531
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:24,280
he looked like the plant in little shop
of horrors except he had glasses on.

532
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,293
MMM.

533
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,630
So anyways, I was really into
it, so I guess they're going to,

534
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,520
why is it so much time between games
though? Oh No. The next one is April 28th.

535
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,950
That's it. I'm going to watch. Fuck
it. I'm going support Liverpool.

536
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,030
I liked the Beatles. Who gives a fuck,
right? Like I got time for this shit.

537
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,520
Uh, there's no way to watch it and not
all of a sudden what I have a fucking beer

538
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:53,210
though, I will tell you that, you
know, and I've been fucking Billy,

539
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,720
no fund Billy, no vice other
than four hits a weed one night,

540
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:57,980
which I immediately regretted.

541
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,120
Cause all it does is make me sleepy and
I'm trying to become one with the world.

542
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:06,980
I don't get munchies. I just fall asleep
like a cat on a fucking window sill.

543
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:11,270
I don't give a fuck where I am.
I'm going to sleep. Yep. Um,

544
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,900
anyways,
let's get over with the questions here.

545
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,210
I still haven't watched that moto GP.

546
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:20,350
I know that mock mock has wanted a,

547
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,800
when there was a big anticipation
than him in a Valentino Rossi.

548
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,470
We're going to be fucking donkey kicking
each other about fucking 200 kilometers.

549
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:34,950
Uh, but he just fucking blew by
everybody by the second turn. Um,

550
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,520
I don't know. I got to watch it though.
I fucking love that sport though. Okay.

551
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,990
Emails for the week. I might have to
do a little short, uh, podcast here.

552
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:47,800
Everybody in the fucking voices bucket
the shit out of me. All right, Belgium.

553
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,141
Hey Bill,

554
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:55,000
would you consider to come back to
Belgium in 2019 please keep us posted.

555
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,490
Uh, absolutely I would. I was only
there for like 24 hours and I loved it.

556
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,670
I was in Antwerp, I believe. Excuse me.

557
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,440
[inaudible]

558
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,990
yeah, gross. Disgusting.
Sorry. It has to be done.

559
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,600
It has to be done.

560
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,710
You're gonna blow it out.

561
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,770
I should have do a kid show sketch
about having a cold, you know,

562
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,200
you just have some up at
that's always fucking sick.

563
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,450
And then the kids can't fucking sale
touched the thing cause it's sick.

564
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:34,030
And then you make them come up
and act all sad cause it's lonely.

565
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,250
And then when the kids come over
because they feel bad for it,

566
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:41,550
he chastised the hell out of him for
giving it to the weak emotion of love.

567
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,530
And you have your set him up for the
real world. Uh, fish start a pack.

568
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,490
You know what? I downloaded one of their
cities. Their harmonies are amazing. Uh,

569
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:53,890
the music,
it doesn't quite grab me.

570
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:59,680
They're incredible fucking musician,
but they just stayed. There's a,

571
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,100
I dunno, do something. I will
keep listening. All right,

572
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,060
you're talking about fucking bed that's
sold out Madison Square Garden like 18

573
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:13,060
nights in a row or something. So
it's, it's gotta be me on some level.

574
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,503
You know what I mean?

575
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,153
Okay.

576
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,480
I look at fish, the way I look at
Beyonce, like it's gotta be me, right?

577
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,530
I have to be the person. That's when
somebody fills up the fucking Rose Ball.

578
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,600
You know what I mean?

579
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,840
The second they say they're going
to be there and you're like, yeah,

580
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:35,040
I don't get it. Then at some
point it's you. It is you, right?

581
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,330
I don't know.
Dare is bright breathes breaths.

582
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,790
I would always sit when I appreciate,

583
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,420
while I appreciated the last fish suggests
fish suggested of starting with rift.

584
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,750
It's a very specific album.

585
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,450
Pretty ballsy of that guy
who started with rift.

586
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,340
It's as if he wants to
make it hard on you. Okay.

587
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,090
I like this guy. I liked the other
guy too. They thought I was smart.

588
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:05,880
I like this guy because he
knows I'm stupid. All right.
Yeah. Make it easy, man.

589
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,340
Give me the answers you should download.

590
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,660
Hoist.

591
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,690
It's funny you say that and as
the last guy suggested alive,

592
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,120
one that'll give you something fun
to work with. Again, I love rifts,

593
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,150
but I also want you to have a fair shot.
Also,

594
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:29,420
story of ghost is funky and

595
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,020
Billy Billy breaths is fun too.
Who Was it? Billy breathes.

596
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm so dumb,
and not to sound cliche,

597
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,790
but have you seen dead and company yet?

598
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,500
It's a really fun show and
definitely worth checking out, man.

599
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,470
Yeah,
those hippy shows,

600
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,200
there's just such a vibe of,
of uh,

601
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,680
insincerity at them that I can't handle
from the crowd where everybody's just

602
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:04,180
trying to like,
I don't know.

603
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,380
You don't like when you see a mom and
she's talking to a kid in public and

604
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:12,520
talking really loudly, some cute
conversation in looking at you smiling.

605
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,930
It's like, will you shut the fuck up
when you bring the volume down? I get it.

606
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:19,720
Kids are cute. It's not my kid. You know,

607
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,370
I don't care that the kid
just counted the five.

608
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,020
No, not busy. You have to sit there.

609
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:34,050
You need to put these young here for
Duquesne and they look at you and smile is

610
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:38,810
they do the play by play of
the kid putting a fucking
marshmallow in its mouth.

611
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,890
I feel like when you go to one of those
hippie things, people are doing that,

612
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:46,880
but they're kind of doing it, you know,
to show like how everybody's, you know,

613
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:50,870
this is like how society should be man.
Um,

614
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,930
ah, in the fucking the body
odor. I don't mean like,

615
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,950
I mean the Cologne that they wear,
whatever the fuck it is. Just the, uh,

616
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,290
the, the, the fucking Douche Gumbo.
That's what I can't answer when I'm there.

617
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,160
It's always fucking heart, you know?
And everybody's wearing a sun dress.

618
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,320
It's just, I don't know. I'm
too much of a curmudgeon. Um,

619
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,570
why I think we bombed Syria. Oh,
code for you. Help me out here.

620
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,580
All bill ball bag.
Uh,

621
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:26,510
I believe we blew their chemical weapon
plants up because they gassed little

622
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:29,540
kids.
Okay.

623
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,290
Just a guess of what I read.

624
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:37,150
I think you overly simplified and
I think some kids also died. Um,

625
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,160
but if we're going to
start doing that body,

626
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,370
if we're going to start bombing people
because they gas people are bond people

627
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,270
and killed little kids. Ah, everybody
who does that is a piece of shit.

628
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:51,130
I don't know how well
we come out in the wash,

629
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,330
their pal chested casts from what I've
read. But you're not allowed to say that.

630
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,040
Cause if you do that means you're an isis.

631
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,170
You're not allowed to criticize anything.
It'd be like,

632
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,460
what the fuck are we doing? Uh, but
I do understand your fear of debt.

633
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,840
Love the cast in your work as
unimportant as it may seem.

634
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:11,350
We couldn't live without laughing piece.
Okay man,

635
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,610
you got your sun dress
on there. Um, yeah. Okay.

636
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:19,300
I understand that Syria, okay. What they
did was horrifically wrong, but you know,

637
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,600
should we have a lot more of our ducks
in a row before we start policing the

638
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:26,720
fucking world is all I'm saying.
You know what I mean?

639
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,720
If we're gonna fucking bomb those
guys cause they guess a little kids,

640
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,100
that sounds good, but
you know, at what point,

641
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,030
where are they going to fucking shoot
some missiles at the people who poisoned

642
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,910
our food supply,
the food supply,

643
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:44,880
that net we're now trying to sell
around the world and people like you not

644
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:48,750
bringing that shit in our country. Do
you know this? Say that about our food,

645
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:51,480
like France and India.
France is like, all right,

646
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:54,840
but you're going to have to say what's
in it. And we're like, no, we're not.

647
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,860
We are dish. No Way. We're going to say
what's in our food. How fucked up is that?

648
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,050
And I got to try to navigate those
waters with my kid, you know,

649
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,930
and there's no explanation to
it. There's no, well, listen man,

650
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,320
if you want to somehow make 300
people not starved to death,

651
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,710
you got to cut some corners,
then I understand it. But
there's, there's nothing,

652
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,490
they're not saying anything. They're
like, shut the fuck up in, uh, any,

653
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,460
um, you know, I dunno,

654
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,330
the key in this world to make it is
you've got to make so much money.

655
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:31,510
You can donate the politicians' campaigns
and then they just fucking leave you

656
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:33,400
alone.
And you can do whatever you want.

657
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,290
Like poisoned the food supply of a
country, which if I'm not mistaken,

658
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,910
is a terrorist act.

659
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,230
When you then become an
evildoer, uh, dude, I'm fat.

660
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,710
This is all shit. You're not allowed to.
If you can say it about anybody else.

661
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:56,180
But if you actually fucking
Kev, constructive criticism
about your own team,

662
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:01,640
you're immediately a conspiracy theorists
or you're a socialist. You know,

663
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,370
I don't understand.
I don't know when the fuck that happened,

664
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:09,280
but it's brilliant PR. So evidently
I'm a communist right now. Oh, Billy.

665
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,400
He's got a red beard.
I mean,

666
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:14,600
it's all right there probably jerks
off to Stalin's fucking head shot every

667
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,400
morning. Now dairy want healthy food
for everyone in this country. Uh,

668
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,570
hey bill, no fun. A Billy, no fund.
Love the podcasts. I'm a fat guy.

669
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,350
Totally agreeing with you.
Fat people blame everyone around them.

670
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,540
But I'm one that knows that I shouldn't
be shoving cheeseburgers down my gullet.

671
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,110
Yeah,
dude,

672
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,640
that's the power fucking
choice right there.

673
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,360
If you stopped blaming everybody
else and all this other shit outside,

674
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:46,350
he has to change is you keep fucking
show in this shit. Like granted,

675
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:50,250
I don't have a psychology degree or
even know anything about nutrition as I

676
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:55,170
trashed what's in our food
supply. Um, you know, you know,

677
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:59,310
Kenny Rogers was the gambler of
the hypocrite. Uh, anyone. Anyway,

678
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:04,311
my question is do you think it's worse
to know that you are ruining your life

679
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:10,010
and eating like a fat fuck or pretending
like it's a thyroid problem or some

680
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:14,460
excuse. Anyways, please
come to the bay area.

681
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,490
I am up doing a whole weekend shows in
May up in San Francisco or reno cause I

682
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,260
miss you on the last one. Uh, all right.

683
00:42:22,261 --> 00:42:26,190
Do you think it's worse to know that
you're ruining your life and eating like a

684
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:29,100
fat fuck or pretending like
it's a thyroid problem?

685
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,970
I think if you pretend like it's a
thyroid problem is a good way to go.

686
00:42:32,971 --> 00:42:35,820
If your apps,
if you had no power in this situation,

687
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,140
like um,
a lot of the shit that I alluded to,

688
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,220
you know like our food supply and
like I'm powerless against that.

689
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:47,760
So it's something I will joke about
and then I quickly don't think about it

690
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:50,970
because I don't know what to do. You know,

691
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:54,480
you go down to a farmer's market and
those kinds of infiltrated down there too,

692
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:57,930
when you start asking the fucking hippie
down there, so this is blah blah blah.

693
00:42:57,931 --> 00:42:58,830
Where did this come from?

694
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,490
And they start getting no fucking
shifty themselves and they then all of a

695
00:43:02,491 --> 00:43:06,780
sudden you feel like you're an invasion
of the body snatchers, you know, so, um,

696
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,330
but I think the fact that
you're addressing that,

697
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:12,720
you're the ones shoving the
cheeseburgers down your gullet. Um,

698
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,510
okay.

699
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:19,340
I have found that, uh, you
know, the longest time I
didn't think food was a drug.

700
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:23,000
I totally believe it now.
And Dean del Ray put me on this,

701
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:28,001
I guess it's a gluten free diet and I'm
on this and I barely have to work out,

702
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,390
you know, and a keynote is
like this fucking amazing.

703
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,920
Like I eat the food that I eat on this
diet afterwards, I don't feel like, ah,

704
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,900
I gotta take a nap. I feel like energized
even though I feel like shit right now.

705
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:47,510
But, um, I dunno. And I
was taking a Multivitamin,

706
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:48,900
somebody shit all over that go,

707
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,310
let's designate I love this and up or that
you need to take this. It's just like,

708
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:56,840
okay. All right. All right. So, uh,

709
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,100
I think it's,
it's

710
00:43:59,400 --> 00:43:59,590
okay.

711
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,990
Well, look, if you're not going to
do anything about being a fat fuck,

712
00:44:01,991 --> 00:44:03,130
it's going to be more painful.

713
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,760
If you're just going to continue to be
a fat fuck or not do anything about it,

714
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,090
then I would lie. That's your thyroid
problem. You know what I mean?

715
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,543
MMM.

716
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,510
You know, that's like if you put
out something artistic and uh,

717
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,290
it doesn't do well and then you blame

718
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,633
okay.

719
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,940
The left or the right
or some shit like that.

720
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:27,300
Like I've seen with some movies and
other shit. You can do that if you want.

721
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,951
It's not going to help you.

722
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:32,951
Next fucking project the project
have you navy training in Australia.

723
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,160
You know Jesus Christ is the last fucking
place I would be in the Goddamn Navy

724
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:41,980
is Australia.
Oh my God.

725
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,100
Yeah.

726
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,340
What do you have to do to become
a fucking navy seal in Australia?

727
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,330
Do you have to stab a great white
shark to death after they cut? Yay.

728
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,040
Probably make you bleed before you get
in the fucking water. Alright. Hey Bill,

729
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,050
just watched
at voice clip.

730
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:04,060
I think that voice clip of you on Youtube
about how you watched the two weeks in

731
00:45:04,061 --> 00:45:07,780
health thing. I was in the
Australian navy and it was similar,

732
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:11,470
but you got shit for not keeping your own.

733
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,570
I don't know what that means.
Preface,

734
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:19,820
this was before the media cared
about all genders. We had big Bertha,

735
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,100
which on the second day of recruit school,

736
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,580
we were kept up until 2:00 AM and we're
only allowed a breakfast bar the night

737
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,450
before they woke us up by smashing trash
cans in each of our dorms right there.

738
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:38,210
I'd be out, I'd be, I'd be like,
dude, fuck this. And I'd walk out, uh,

739
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,710
they'd be like, good you two week.
And I'd be like, you're right.

740
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:45,340
I'm going to a holiday. Yeah. I want
to thank all of you for protecting me.

741
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,050
He may eight hours sleep.
All right.

742
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,250
That we had to run down stairs and
carry the rope called Big Bertha,

743
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,970
which was the equivalent. Oh my
God. Of the old ships anchor lines.

744
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,950
And we ran for about six kilometers,
3.7 miles. What the fuck?

745
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,850
Until we were allowed
to have food after that.

746
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,530
Anyone that couldn't continue,

747
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,040
we were partnered up with and had to
carry them and big Bertha shaming the

748
00:46:11,891 --> 00:46:15,840
people that couldn't continue.
Uh,

749
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,970
I couldn't do that.

750
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,690
I couldn't do that dude where
they up on the rope weeping.

751
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,510
Did they literally get broken
that bad? And we went, well,

752
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:29,360
when we eventually got back to base,

753
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:34,361
we were allowed breakfast and then had
to go on with the eight hour drills and

754
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:37,550
fulfill our duty watches.

755
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:40,430
Yeah.

756
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,540
Wow. Dude, that is some psychological
breakdown right there. Holy Shit.

757
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,760
The most fucked up
thing about all of this.

758
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah.

759
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,660
Hey, wait dude, did you make it
through all of this? Oh my God.

760
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,670
Do you have your 80 or
difficult it is to be me.

761
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,280
Has your girlfriend ever said that to
you when you're thinking about that big

762
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:04,750
birthday March? Uh, was this, okay?

763
00:47:04,751 --> 00:47:09,190
This was in m o two o three and
the Australian Defense Force,

764
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,450
our military, God forbid
we seem aggressive. Oh,

765
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,860
you say defense force had instituted
a policy where females could only be

766
00:47:17,861 --> 00:47:21,370
treated or ordered for
so many hours a day.

767
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:27,090
So handing Avs dash gas helicopter fuel.

768
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,590
So okay,

769
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:34,210
helicopter fuel was only be performed
by men because it caused impotence in

770
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:35,920
women but also men.

771
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,180
But females could hold positions on the

772
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,670
yeah, but they can also make a baby.
They know anybody. We'll fuck himself.

773
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,950
Your Dick and your balls are expendable
at that point. That's simple math.

774
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,570
But females could hold positions
on the the Hilo refuel team,

775
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,340
well that doesn't make sense, but when
it came to actually handling fueled,

776
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:02,410
they get volunteer males to do it after
dealing with shit like being blamed

777
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:07,090
because my ship couldn't get any new
workers from land because the ship was a

778
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:12,091
fucking grinder and being in charge of
people when I haven't even been promoted,

779
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:15,390
I decided to just start drinking so much.

780
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,900
I got kicked off and it
was my best decision ever.

781
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,450
This is like a great movie.

782
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,890
Spent my last year of my contract
at a base in a rich part of Sydney,

783
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:30,690
Australia surfing in the morning and
banging a few of the new female sailors

784
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,080
that all over 21 he puts in parentheses
that had never been to sea by proudest

785
00:48:36,271 --> 00:48:40,740
moment was when I was awarded the
humanitarian aid metal because I build

786
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:45,510
hospitals in Sumatra
after the o five tsunami.

787
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,530
I spent days helping and building and
the people of Sumatra with some of the

788
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:53,490
most thankful and kindest people ever met
who had a fucking great story that is,

789
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:58,680
Oh my God. Can you imagine if you
quit, like how tired you'd have to be,

790
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:02,640
how excrutiatingly tires you have
to be to climb up on that rope.

791
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,560
It'd be carried back 3.7 miles.

792
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,920
I just have to go
mentally with every step.

793
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,350
This humiliation is one
step closer to being over.

794
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:18,290
What do you say when you get off?
Good day, mate. Sorry about that.

795
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,920
I have a fucking,
oh my God.

796
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,630
I can't imagine what people said to you
other way back. Overrated. Underrated.

797
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,480
Alright. Overrated. New
York and Los Angeles.

798
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,260
I've lived in both cities for
over four years each. I love them.

799
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,980
But I've also lived on a creek in
Virginia and a farm in Vermont.

800
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,400
Unless you need to be in one of
those cities, just don't go there.

801
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,930
I that I agree with that wholeheartedly.
You should visit him. Uh, underrated.

802
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:47,660
Wayne's world.
I never heard you talk about this movie.

803
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:52,490
He should definitely rewatch this. Next
time you take a hit man. All right,

804
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:57,140
I'll check it out. I will
definitely check it out. Um,

805
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,130
I had it overrated. Underrated. Okay.
I wait. You know what overrated.

806
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,870
These new fucking elevators

807
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:09,410
where I got to fucking hit like 20 goddamn
buttons to let the elevator know that

808
00:50:09,411 --> 00:50:14,030
I'm going to floor four so it can fucking
compartmentalize all the people there

809
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:17,600
when I'm the only fucking person there,
you know,

810
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,830
and I gotta take my key out and
fucking run it over the scanner.

811
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,660
I like the old school ones. We
just got in. You push the button

812
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,850
for fucking 10 years. I was on the
road. That was, that was the way it was.

813
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:36,440
And I never had that guy from no country
for old men blow out the lock on my

814
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:39,770
door. You know, it was completely fine.

815
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,800
I don't want to tell him I stayed in a
bed and breakfast in fucking Colorado

816
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:47,150
with this dude from Germany.

817
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,130
It was so fucking creepy cause he was
walking the halls at night and I was just

818
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:53,640
sitting there in the hall.
Light would be on,

819
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,110
I was looking at the light and I didn't
have a lock of did I think maybe on a

820
00:50:57,111 --> 00:51:00,920
skeleton cheat and I was just sitting
there. Oh Wow. I just remember my luggage.

821
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:02,570
I this ugly ass green,

822
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:08,560
like made out of cloth bag cloth and
plastic at this guy puked on one to

823
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:16,520
Oh my God, you remember that Jesus
Christ and through a lot of shit people.

824
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,180
All right, let's tell the
chairman would first, so fuck it.

825
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,850
I will tell the pew cord. No,
you got to close with the puke.

826
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,980
I've already told that story
and it's so fucking gross.

827
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,880
I've been puked on twice in my life.
Once on my head,

828
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,123
you know,

829
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,630
everybody in my family had gotten sick
and we had this bathroom was a half a

830
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:43,060
bathroom with no door.
You were around the corner,

831
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,850
no privacy whatsoever. We lived in a
duplex, squirrels got into the walls.

832
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:52,450
I had to scare them out and then
my dad would kill him, you know,

833
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,240
was the 70s, eighties, you know,
Shit like that happen. So, um,

834
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:59,950
there was no place to,
you couldn't,

835
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,980
I couldn't make a Facebook video
and shame my landlord. You know,

836
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,520
where my dad couldn't do that. So he
just stopped. He had to kill the fuckers.

837
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:12,130
Everybody to proven, I was fucking shaking
it. Try to get this thing to come out.

838
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,040
And my dad was on the other side.

839
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:18,730
You have this giant fucking butcher
knife or metal bar or something,

840
00:52:18,731 --> 00:52:23,320
I can't remember.
And that was a metal bar.

841
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,210
That's what it was like a
big piece of or something,

842
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,400
a flush that thing out.

843
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:32,870
And that fucking thing came running
up the broom up the broom handle.

844
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,500
I remember his eyes were wide is shit.
It's tail was straight up in the end.

845
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,940
This little brown Cutie Pie.

846
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:43,150
Fucking ran up my arm and launched
off on my shoulder. I wait.

847
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,880
And then it ran into the half a bathroom

848
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,020
and it was one way in
and only one way out.

849
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:55,550
My Dad was in the way and
he fucking brought that led
dig down right on the back

850
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:58,220
of its fucking deck and just
slowly killed the thing.

851
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,800
And I watched him do it.

852
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,363
MMM.

853
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,430
So anyways,
what time?

854
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:10,170
We were all fucking sick and I was in
there finishing puking in the bathroom

855
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:13,290
with no door.
My brother came running in,

856
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,453
I just ran.

857
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:21,620
And rather than puking in the fucking
sink that was readily available. You know,

858
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:22,281
we were young,

859
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:27,281
so it was just like you puke in the
toilet and my head obstructing the toilet

860
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:31,050
and it was like how low
pressure goes to high pressure.

861
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,660
It takes the most direct route,
which is right through the air foil.

862
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:37,680
And that's how you get lift when you fly.
He used those same principles,

863
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:42,090
would puke it into the toilet.
And my head was the airfoil.

864
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:46,200
Whenever we fucking puked up my head.
And I just freaked out.

865
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:49,590
And I was punching him as hard as I could
in the stomach as he was continuing to

866
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:51,990
Puke.
But parents came in,

867
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,910
they were laughing their ass off at bay
and the kitchen sink was there and she

868
00:53:56,911 --> 00:54:00,660
just fucking Doug my head in there and
fucking washed and it was so gross,

869
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:04,020
so gross.
So then the second time I got puked on,

870
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,920
I was trying to save money and I was
taking a bus from Manhattan to Laguardia

871
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,740
Airport.
We always sent my turmoil.

872
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,710
I take the subway up to Harlem and
then took the bus over the bridge.

873
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,440
And this dude just got up,

874
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,640
look at all great and he
fucking projectile vomited
and he hit the sweet old

875
00:54:28,691 --> 00:54:31,720
lady in front of me on a chest

876
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,340
and it was like the Kennedy
assassination were to spray,

877
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:40,450
just went back except it didn't go to the
left and went to the right where I was

878
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:44,350
sitting and it got on my foot,

879
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:48,670
my sock and my lower pants
and all over my luggage.

880
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,090
And then he just stumbled off the bus

881
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,940
and I was like, you motherfucker. And
I wanted to beat the shit out of him,

882
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:02,570
but I was broken and I needed the
money and I had to go to my gig.

883
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:08,050
I just glared at him as all I could
do and then I had to go in there,

884
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,710
got off the bus,

885
00:55:09,711 --> 00:55:13,160
and now people look at me like I'm an
animal because I smelt like fucking puke.

886
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:14,863
And I

887
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,180
went into the bathroom
like beyond Tourette's,

888
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:25,220
took the sock off shoe off fucking,

889
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:29,030
but I only had one pair of footwear
so I threw out the size disgusting.

890
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,460
Had to wash off my fucking
pant leg the best I could.

891
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:40,130
My sneaker was so good, fucking wet.
I had one sock on, one sock off,

892
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:45,530
walking into a squishy wet fucking
sneaker and my fucking green cloth bag.

893
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,850
I wiped off all of the Pew,

894
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:54,810
but it was like stayed and they had like
the little fucking paper towel balls

895
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:57,510
audit.
It was so fucking gross.

896
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,610
It was so fucking gross.

897
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:05,800
And I then had to get on like a fucking
flight to like Minnesota just sitting

898
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:09,460
there smelling of stomach acid

899
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:15,540
and I got off the plane.
Yeah.

900
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:20,541
I immediately went to a mall and I
bought some sweatpants and the cheapest

901
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:23,920
fucking sneakers and socks and I
just fucking threw the shit out.

902
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:29,490
And I bought a bag. But I didn't have
time to do that before, which the boat.

903
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:34,180
Oh my God. It was a fucking terrible trip.
Oh the fuck. A terrible trip. That was,

904
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,520
um,
but you know,

905
00:56:37,521 --> 00:56:42,070
it's not as bad as what fucking happened
on southwest could've been worse. Yeah.

906
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,890
That poor fucking woman,
Jesus Christ. See,

907
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,910
that's the second time
I've heard of somebody gets
sucked out like that can read

908
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,710
that fucking story that, uh, it fucking
mechanic puts a new windshield on,

909
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:56,840
get on the plane and uh, uh, lady
used the wrong fucking screws.

910
00:56:56,841 --> 00:56:59,450
They weren't long enough and they
fucking flying like, you know,

911
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,070
they're cruising altitude,

912
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:05,270
so they got to be going for 500 miles
an hour in the fucking windshield.

913
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:10,280
Flew off and the captain got sucked out,

914
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:15,281
but his legs got stuck on the yoke and
he was outside the fucking plane and they

915
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:21,140
were trying to hold on to them and
the door to the cockpit got blown in.

916
00:57:21,141 --> 00:57:24,550
And the guy couldn't slow down cause
it was on the controls. They sub out,

917
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,380
the stewardess has helped out.
You know when the air pressure

918
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,810
I guess leveled off where they
could move and not get sucked out.

919
00:57:31,811 --> 00:57:33,150
And they were trying to
pull them in and they could,

920
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,310
one of the students could see the guy
outside the window looking at him and is,

921
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,330
he wasn't blinking and she goes, I
think he's dead. We should let him go.

922
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,750
Fortunately they didn't.
They ended up landing.

923
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,800
It turned out the guy was in shock.
Um,

924
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,840
it's fucking nuts.

925
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,520
Just sitting there like catatonic.

926
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:02,230
He got frostbite in one of his eyes.
It was just,

927
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:07,000
and this is what kills me is the fucking
maniac was flying again in a couple of

928
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,510
weeks. I think he still
flies. I can't imagine.

929
00:58:11,511 --> 00:58:12,251
You know what the thing is,

930
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:15,500
is what they really should have in the
back of the plate is you should also have

931
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:17,180
those shoulder artists
as you should have that

932
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,600
you know when it goes across your
lap and then over your shoulder.

933
00:58:21,601 --> 00:58:24,350
So then if you sit next to the
fucking window, God forbid,

934
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,320
if the fucking thing blows out,
you still find,

935
00:58:27,321 --> 00:58:29,300
but that would be prohibitively expensive.

936
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:35,090
So I guess what I'm saying is
get the ILC. Alright, everybody,

937
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,680
um, gold Bruins and, uh,

938
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,273
goes Celtics.

939
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:43,930
Okay.

940
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:44,970
I had a,
I don't know.

941
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:48,570
I'm going to go fucking take a hot shower
and try to clear my Goddamn sinuses.

942
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,480
Uh, I want to do another podcast tomorrow.
I'll be all caught up. All right.

943
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,590
Go Fuck Yourself. She can't sit. I'll
check it on your tomorrow. Oh Geez.
