00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.080
It's starting to look like we
actually got some work done, right?

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.220
I told you all the Gulp
work would pay off.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.039
In fact, I have a final piece that would
make a lot more sense now that we have

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.100
our first task written down.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.900
Gulp comes with a killer
feature called watch.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.726
Think of it as an automatic trigger
that waits for something to change.

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:22.620
Previously I needed to notify James
every time I wanted him to do some task.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.770
Now I can rely on the watcher
doing it automatically.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.960
Consider what you currently have to do.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.200
If you make any changes to
your sas file right you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.020
need to switch to the terminal,
re enter gob styles, execute it,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.300
switch to the browser and reload.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.670
A proper watcher let's you never
switch to terminal again.
