00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.090
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well,
good evening, everyone.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.800
Welcome to The Library of Congress.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.100
I'm John Cole.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.470
I'm the Director of The
Library's Center for the Book,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.060
which means I have the lucky job of
promoting books, reading, literacy

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.750
and libraries on behalf of
The Library of Congress.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.710
And tonight we have a special
treat, not only a special speaker,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.950
Lisa Scottoline, but also
a number of guests who are

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.170
with us from other countries.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.330 position:56%
They're visiting today and part of a
program at The Library of Congress.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.510
Today we've announced our
new 2015 Literacy Awards,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.990
which means the Library is honoring
organizations from around the world

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.200
that have made achievements
towards erasing illiteracy.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.560
It's an important five-year
program funded by David Rubenstein,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.980
one of the Library's benefactors,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.400
and it really recognizes
not only three major groups

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.750
that get cash prizes for
the work they've done,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.620
but also best practices.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.040
These are the people who are
with us today are the honorees

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.550
and there were 14 organizations
honored by The Library

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.540
of Congress Literacy
Awards this year and 12

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.950
of them are represented today at
the Library, several from overseas,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.530
to talk about their
best practices projects.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.720
And this is a booklet which covers
and tells you the whole story

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.480
and I hope you'll take one
with you when you leave.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.170
It talks about the awards,
it talks about the winners,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.670
and each of our best
practice winners

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.670
who is here tonight knows very
well from this afternoon's program,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.230
where they all presented
information about their projects,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.380
that they each have a page and
which describes their project,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.070
and we encourage them to use that
page and to use the recognition

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.440
by The Library of Congress
to help further literacy,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.630
their literacy efforts in their
countries, but also to be part

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.550
of this larger effort
to eradicate illiteracy

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.080
by re-stimulating interest
in literacy

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.230
and literacy promotion
throughout our society.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.210
Now a number of these people, Lisa,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.490
I'm sorry to say may not know your
books, but we also have friends

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.080
and fans of Lisa's who have come
to hear her introduce her new book

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.160
and we have managed to
combine these two efforts

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.810 position:56%
because of Lisa's own support of The
Library of Congress and her interest

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.490
in our activities and in
particular something I'm grateful

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.170
for is her support for the Center
for the Book and its activities.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.220
The Center was created in
1977 by Daniel Boorstin

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.110
when he was Librarian of
Congress and he wanted The Library

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.420
of Congress to reach out to society
to promote books and reading.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.240
This was before literacy was really
even a hot word and we, of course,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.310
became the natural place in the
Library for the Literacy Awards,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.950
just as we were the focal point
for the National Book Festival

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.730
when it was created in 2001
by First Lady Laura Busch,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.400
who when her husband was elected
President of the United States,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.040 position:56%
she was the First Lady of Texas and
had created the Texas Book Festival.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.810 position:56%
And she quickly said that it was her
goal when she came to Washington was

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.880
to create a National Book
Festival and that, by golly,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.380
she was going to invite The Library
of Congress to be the partner.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.880
And she said that immediately
and I'm so grateful she said it

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.760
because eventually, of
course, not eventually,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.170
the following spring we had the
first National Book Festival.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.340 position:56%
And her staff combined with Dr.
Boorstin's staff, including the kind

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.440
of headed by me at the
time with the assignment

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.710
of getting the National
Book Festival started.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.480
We did not have our first planning
meeting until April in 2001

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.960
and the first Book Festival
was held in The Library

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.820
of Congress buildings, plus

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.790
on the East Capitol grounds,
on September the 8th.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.150 position:56%
So we had about three months to plan
and we ended up, to our amazement

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.150
and delight, having 30,000 people
who flooded the Jefferson building

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.180
and this building and we knew there
never again should be one inside.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.020
But this was accentuated
three days later with 9-11

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.980
and I thought there would never
be another National Book Festival.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.580
But Mrs. Bush insisted and
by then it was Dr. Billington

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.270
who was Librarian of Congress
immediately got in touch

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.080
and it turned out that
Mrs. Bush said, yes,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.590
of all things it's
even more important

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.720
to have a National Book
Festival in a time like this.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.060
And it really is through
the National Book Festival

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.760 position:56%
and the activities of the Center for
the Book actually that I met Lisa.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.070
She probably won't remember
when I think we first met,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.250
which was in Florida when you were
doing a talk for the Florida Center

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.030
for the Book for Jean
Trevy [Assumed Spelling].

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.660
You do remember?

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.340
And I was visiting with my
wife and we were, of course,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.540
as the honcho of the huge Center
for the Book back in Washington,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.820
with Florida being our first
Center, it was important that I go

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.410
to some events, especially
since it was in Ft.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.470
Lauderdale.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:22.170
And we met Lisa and had dinner with
her and went to her presentation

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.370
and just about that time the
National Book Festival was getting

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:33.170
started and Lisa became really -
we invited her to the Book Festival

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.610
and she first came, and I actually
looked this up as a Librarian,

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.640
2007 was your first
National Book Festival.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.550
But the thing about Lisa that I
recall always was, first of all,

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.620
she's a lawyer and she
chose to write mysteries.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.620
My wife Nancy was a mystery,
still is a mystery buff,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.810
and so a lot of these worlds came
together for me and, of course,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.280
I pretended like I knew
lots of mystery writers.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:11.170
Well, I did know one for sure
and she became a mystery writer

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.710
with her writing career
beginning with her first novel,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.870
Everywhere Mary Went,
which was published

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.680
in 1994 before we had
a Book Festival.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.210
It became a bestseller and was
nominated for the Edgar Award,

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.140
which is the most prestigious
award given in crime fiction.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:36.170
Her second novel, Final Appeal,
received the 1995 Edgar Award.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.170
Today she has written
more than 25 books,

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.190
many of which have appeared
on bestseller lists.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.040
And just to take the last bit of
the blurb, which is important,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.980
today more than 30 million
copies of her books are in print

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:56.160
and are published in more than
35 countries in 25 languages.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.930
Today, Lisa, we had a
real international meeting

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.070
as you can imagine with reports
from these various countries

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:08.550 position:56%
about literacy and reading in their
countries and your books are in many

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.560
of their countries, probably
all of their countries.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.900
But she is a special friend of
the Library and our Book Festival.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:22.170
As I said, her first appearance was
2007 and for one of her mysteries.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:27.160 position:56%
You were also at the 2009, but what
I really remember was the first time

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.800
you came with your daughter.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.890
And so this was a new pattern that
emerged with the 2012 Book Festival

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.370
when she, when Lisa
came and spoke twice

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.910
and this was a first
for the Book Festival.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.430
Once as a mystery writer, in those
days we called it the Fiction

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.360
and Mystery Pavilion, and
the book was Come Home.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:56.630
A second time in that same Festival
2012 with Francesca, her daughter,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.970
in our newly created
Contemporary Life,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.280
which was a wonderful Pavilion, for
their joint book of funny stories

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.340
and true confessions, which
was titled Best Friends,

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.800 position:56%
Occasional Enemies, The Lighter Side
of Life as a Mother and Daughter.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.820
Well, mother and daughter made
another joint appearance this year

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.990
at the National Book Festival.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.580
Lisa going it alone in mysteries,
thrillers and science fiction.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.170
We keep changing the Pavilions

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.520
because our Book Festival keeps
expanding and we're trying

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.570
to get more genres, but there's
always, whatever Pavilion Lisa is

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.340
in always has the word
mystery in it.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.990
And that book was Every Fifteen
Minutes and, again, with Francesca

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.630
in contemporary life, and this
time was for their latest together,

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:51.850
which was titled Does This
Beach Make Me Look Fat?

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.280
So you can see you have a skilled
writer, a diverse writer in front

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.670
of you, and tonight she
will be signing copies

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.400
of her brand-new book, which
was just published today,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.230
and it is called?

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.940
&gt;&gt; Lisa Scottoline: Corrupted.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.260
&gt;&gt; John Cole: All right.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.390
So we're lucky Lisa is with us,

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.200
we're lucky to have our Best
Practices winners with us.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.960
We've had a wonderful afternoon,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.990
an inspiring afternoon
I think for many of us.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.980
And we know that Lisa will give
us another form of inspiration,

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.510 position:56%
and may I introduce Lisa Scottoline.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.340
&gt;&gt; Lisa Scottoline: John, John -

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.440
how much do we love John
Cole, then we love John Cole?

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.820
My God, let's hear it?

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.120
[applause] This man is amazing.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.590 position:56%
And Robert Newlyn [Assumed Spelling]
and everybody who worked so hard.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.500
I am so honored to be here.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.830
Thank you so much.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.710
Congratulations to
all of the winners

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.090
and to all the Best
Practices finalists.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.390
I am in awe.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.860
I am distinctly unworthy.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.890
I am your comic relief tonight.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:08.790 position:56%
I can tell you I feel as if, though,
maybe I have something to offer you

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.570
because I think I always begin
because you are all doing stuff

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.850
that is so important and so in
my mind macro really that I want

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.930
to take you to the
micro a little bit.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:25.150 position:56%
Because I think if I get this
speech right I should be able to end

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.140
up in a place where you understand
at a very granular level,

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.280
as everybody says these days,
how very important you are.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.740
And I think an author might
be the person to tech you that

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.450
or just remind you of that.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.310
because I come to you not only as
an author, but more importantly

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:48.380
as a person who loves books and
grew up in a house with none, none.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.710
We had lots of hugs
in South Philadelphia,

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.100
lots of meatballs, but one book.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.630
What do you think that book was?

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.930
&gt;&gt; Bible.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.230
&gt;&gt; Lisa Scottoline: The
Bible, aren't you sweet.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.850
No, no, I said its South
Philly where we keep it real,

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.890
and the book was TV Guide.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.930
Nobody read in my house,
nobody read.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.320
So when I started reading my
mother said, please stop reading,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.680
you'll ruin your eyes,
what are you doing?

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.980
It was that kind of a vibe.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.570
They loved me a lot, but it was a
school librarian who took me aside

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.010
and said, go tell your father
to take you to a library.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:30.350
And then he took me to the library
where he sat in the car like a dog

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.460
because there was no
TV in the library then.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.330
Now there's TV in the library maybe
this Scottoline had a fighting

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.870
chance, but then he was there.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.050
And so I was in the library
and I was that kid wandering

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:46.510
in the library, probably not unlike
a lot of the kids you're helping,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.190
though the setting is different.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.500
I'm talking about Winfield,
Pennsylvania,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.210
somewhere outside of Philadelphia.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.430
To me, the setting
matters not at all.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.430
Because somewhere there's a kid
wandering in some library going, a,

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.940
I'm intimidated but, b,
I'm also a little in love.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.610
It's kind of like Bradley Cooper
now that I just thought of it,

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.630
intimidated and also in love.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.930
How to reconcile?

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.230
We don't know.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.990 position:56%
But here I was in the library going,

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.940
how do I pick a book, I
don't know what to do?

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.540
And in those days, you know,
the cards went with the books.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.730
People wrote with something
called a pencil, you may remember.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.030
Do you own one?

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.000
No. But I remember look at that
nice handwriting, she looks nice,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.560
maybe I'll get this book.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.900
But what really helped me
choose books was on the spine,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.410
a lot of the books,
they had a person

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.430
in profile with a really big nose.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.390
The Scottolines have
really big noses.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.720
My mother says we get more
oxygen than anyone in the room.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.010
And she's right, like if I
breathe in you could die,

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.100
like it could be it
was nice knowing you.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.670
But here I was and I'm looking
at that guy with that nose

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:59.020 position:56%
and I'm going, you know, I'm feeling
him, like he's a little Uncle Rocky.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.570 position:56%
So I read all those books and then
at some point I find out that he's -

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.260
his name is Sherlock Holmes,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.320
and that's why I'm a
mystery writer today.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.620
It was very glamorous.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.360
I really wanted to class
it up for you guys,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.240
but obviously I had
to tell the truth.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.450
But the important point
about that, though,

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.650
is that is where I found somebody
that actually led me on a path

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:24.660
that would take me here, amazingly
enough, which was Nancy Drew.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.560
Can we talk about the
girl detective?

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.110
Because we need to talk
about the girl detective.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.420 position:56%
And I will tell you as an author
that anybody who is worth your time,

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.510
writing anything, is going to try
to choose telling details, right?

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:42.440
Now if you think about what Nancy
Drew had, she had a best girlfriend

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.360
because we all have
girlfriends, yay.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.780
She had a boyfriend because
she's not a middle-aged woman,

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.660
just saying.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.280
Real, let's be real.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.320
Is my bitterness showing?

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.840
Good, fine, excellent.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.370
She had a father, kind
of benign presence.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.760
I think of him like Jimmy Stewart.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.910
Does anyone know who that is?

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.970
Good, then we can keep
talking, excellent.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.070
And she lacked a mother.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.070
Remarkable, please note
To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.100 position:56%
There's a reason this happens, when
there's not a mother in the picture,

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.680
like my mother would
have her in a convent.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.500
But the child can go
on adventures and be

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.060
on her own when there's no mother.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.340
Nancy Drew, the telling detail on
Nancy Drew if I may suggest to you

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.030
if you think about what you
remember about Nancy Drew,

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.450
isn't it the blue roadster,
remember the car?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.070
There's a reason for that.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.600
Go back in American
history to the 1950s,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.170
see the USA in your Chevrolet.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.030
Go back to Bruce Springsteen,

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:44.170
even that is a dated
reference, which is horrifying.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.470
Like what?

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.770
But think of Thunder Road, right?

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.900
These four wheels will
take you anywhere.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.540
There's something about
a car that we think

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.560
of as quintessentially American,
and Nancy Drew within a car.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.440
And the most important
thing about Nancy Drew

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.940
in that very telling detail
of a roadster is what?

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.050
She's in the driver's seat.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.200
She is nobody's passenger.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.030
She is an American girl
having adventures on her own.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.330
What's she doing?

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.700
Frankly, I'm just here to
tell you it doesn't matter

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.640
because all the plots
are - well, she's - well,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.800
I'll tell you what the plot
is, she's missing something

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.930
and she has to find it, okay?

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.190
Everything is missing in
the town in which she lives.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.730
The clocks are missing.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.190
The pencils are missing.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.600
There's a missing staircase,
which I think is remarkable

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.520
because I might misplace my phone
but I know where my staircases are,

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.510
like I'm all over the staircases.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.730
But none of that matters,
I can tell you

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.170
as a writer that's just
the top line of the plot.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.870
You won't remember
a Nancy Drew plot,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.120
what you remember is the
girl and the roadster.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.300 position:56%
And so here I am falling in love in
the library, going I want to be her,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.020
I want to drive like her.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.510
And then I grow up and I have a
lifelong love of reading thanks

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:58.310
to librarians because though
I was so deeply loved at home,

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.550
I can't say that I was
honestly understood.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.900
The place where they
understood me was

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.070
where the books were,
with the librarians.

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.050
And they gave me something
called the library card

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.820
in a time when I wanted mail.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.700
I wanted a wallet filled
with identification.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.480
I had nothing, but I
had a library card.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.500
It was orange and stiff and it
had a little metal plate, right?

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.570
My card number was 3839.

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:27.500
Why do I remember that and I don't
remember where my cell phone is?

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.740
I would go home and ink it, this
is how geeky I was, I would ink it

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.610 position:56%
like this and like put it on things.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.700
Why? Why, because I
was pathetic, that too,

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:45.080
but because there's an emotional
- the librarians the library made

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.360
for me an emotional
connection with the book,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.800
that you remember what you
are emotionally connected.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.890
That's why I remember
the things in my life

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.720
that really matter and so do you.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.840
Because that library card
was more than a library card,

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.070
it was a passport,
it's a you belong.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.970
Here's a club and we love you.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.310
We don't think it's crazy
you want to read your eyes

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.760
out of your head, we
think it's cool.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.760
And that's what libraries do for
everybody and that's why I get

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.330
to sort of stand before you today.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.880
Not only did they give me a
lifetime, lifetime love of reading

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.290
and a career besides, but
I feel like the best part

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.270
of my career is sort
of my secret message.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.060
Now I don't say this often,
but you brought it out in me

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.260
so it's all your fault,
but when I started

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.050
to become a writer I thought what
can I contribute, what can I do?

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.380
And I had been a lawyer,
I loved being a lawyer.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.750
I only became a writer
after my first divorce.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.150
Are you impressed yet?

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.520
You really should have had like Amy
Tan [Assumed Spelling] or somebody

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.050
who can stay married, but me?

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.750
I was like, ah, what am I
going to do now, you know?

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.970
I'm a lawyer, I'm getting divorced,
like my child is very young.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.680
Like I hesitate to say this,
but I'm going to say this,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.660
my child was basically crowning

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.880
at the time the divorce
was coming through.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.420
I have to - it's such a good
verb, you can't really -

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.810
come on, it's a great verb.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.110
That's where we were.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.170
So I was like, oh, my God,
what am I going to do next?

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.440
Well, you loved me in Teacher and,
by the way, you're still reading

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.510
and all the stuff you read and not
only in mystery, but I must say

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.160
in crime fiction generally and in
popular fiction generally you had

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.270
to look very, very
hard for the heroines.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.070
There were very few women
main characters and especially

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.710
in crime fiction because that's
all about the testosterone

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.780
and weapons offenses, you
know, and there's alcohol

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.080
and there's all this stuff.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.380
And none of this stuff
I really related

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.310
to because I still
missed Nancy Drew.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.450
And I said where is that plucky
American girl who is going

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.000
to find the missing whatever?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.550
I said I guess you've
got to write that.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.400
And part of me thought, you know,
look, I was a female lawyer.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:58.040 position:56%
Like, wow, you have a law degree and
ovaries, think of it, it happens.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.720
So you had heard a lot about
Perry Mason, where's Della Street?

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.490
We were still pouring coffee
and so I said this must change.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.530
And there I embarked upon my
main goal, which was to stay home

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.280
with my daughter, I must tell you.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.480
And said what I can
contribute maybe is something

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.500
about women main characters
who may start out as lawyers,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.740
but the cool thing about
it especially at that time

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.520
in the 1990s was that women -
part of what is amazingly charming

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.810
about us is that we don't
necessarily define ourselves

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.110
by our job.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.000
If you think for a
moment about Perry Mason,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.290
he's a guy in a courtroom,
he's a lawyer.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.590
If you watched Perry Mason

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.960
or read Perry Mason you never
saw him outside of the courtroom.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.590
You don't even know if he had
- well, he had a girlfriend

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.980
because he kind of had
Della Street whom he led

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.300
on unconscionably,
but he had no life.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.420
He wasn't - there was a
cardboard characterization there

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.980
that women don't have
and didn't think of.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.130 position:56%
Because when I started writing I
was like, well, I'm a single mother.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.410
I'm kind of like I was a
lawyer, but now I'm this.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.610
What am I, what am I, what?

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.860
And that leads you to the
question of you're going write

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.950
about what is a woman and
you're going to tell it true.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:12.140
Because as I always, my
touchstone is always a great quote

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.070
by Francis Ford Coppola,
the Director -

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:19.880
he said nothing my movies every
happened, but all of it is true.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.290
Everything you write has to be
emotionally true or literally true

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.210
for it to connect, which
I'll come back to later.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.220
In any event, I start writing,
writing, writing, writing.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.260 position:56%
I don't want you to think this is a
great fairytale because I was broke,

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.480
broke, broke, broke and
I got rejection letters

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.440
from a New York agent that said
things like we don't have time

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.750
to take any more clients and
if we did we wouldn't take you.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:46.370
I see that guy every year at Book
Expo, where I was the keynote.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:49.760 position:56%
[applause] I know, revenge is sweet.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.330
And I still see him, he's
calling me, he says, Lisa.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.710
I don't hear you, I
don't, I don't hear you.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.300
Yes, because my mother taught
me to keep hate alive and I do,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.310
so I'm that petty really.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.990
And so basically I embark upon this
writing life, which is wonderful

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.790
and hard to get into publication.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.750
I'm living on credit cards, to
fast-forward through the story.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.350
My daughter doesn't know that
we're broke, but we can do -

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.850
because we live on credit cards
and we pay like $10 a month,

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.880
they increase your
credit limit every time,

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.990
like they think you're a crack
addict and they're fine with that.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:30.850
At 21%, exactly, right,
21% you could get money

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.930
from the mob cheaper, and
don't ask me how I know that.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:38.410
so here I am, writing by day,
getting rejected by night,

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.450
nursing a child, happy as a clam

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.260
because I think I'm doing
something really important

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.440
which is raising this amazing
daughter and also trying

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.600 position:56%
to tell stories about women
because I wanted to see us in print.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.250 position:56%
Fast-forward to when it finally gets
published, not for a living wage.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.850
My daughter who had lived on credit
cards all her first six years had

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.050
to actually start to live
within her means, which sucked.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.980
That's a literary term,
if you're not familiar.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.590
Try to keep up with this, okay?

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.360
Permit me one cute kid
story, because we lived

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.910
on credit cards we would
go once a month to Chili's,

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.310
you know what Chili's is, right?

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.560
So she knew Chili's, like we would
go in Chili's and here's the menu

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.620
and eat this and she liked the
brownie sundae, it was a thing.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.820
Well, she had never
been in a McDonald's

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.880
because it was the Dark Ages and
McDonald's did not take credit.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.650
Can you imagine how
horrifying that would be?

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.890
Okay, so that meant she was not
going there because I did not have,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.070
as we say in South Philly, scratch.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.840
So we're driving, she would
want to go to McDonald's.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.140
No, we can't.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.380
Fast-forward to when
I finally sell a book

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.850
and we're going to McDonald's.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:50.430
She is delighted, her eyes - she's
never seen a place like this,

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.380
it's like a child from
the Ukraine has been taken

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.200
and glistening surfaces,
it's remarkable.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.910
And I say to her, but it's
not exactly like Chili's,

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.700
it's a little different,
you have to stand in a line.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.000
At this point she's seven,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.900
that's how long it took
me to get published.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.010
And she looks up at the menu.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.310
I said the menu is up there.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.850
And she looks at it and she says,
but where are the appetizers?

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.180
Every head turns, this little
brat - I go she's broke,

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.480
she just doesn't know it.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.770
And that's sort of the
stuff of it, you know?

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.650
It's you can't - it's
not a sob story.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.450
To me, I want to be the person
who is Exhibit A and says to you

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.240
and this is the kind of stuff I
say at the National Book Festival

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.530
because I want not only
the kids, but the adults

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:37.560 position:56%
to hear how a book gets made and
where it happens and why it matters.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.510
And so I am lucky enough now
to write three books a year.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:45.430
I write the Rosato Series, which
stars an all-woman law firm.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.170
I still get the question,
is there such a thing

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.920
as an all-woman law firm?

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.760
Well, yes, there is because
I will answer that question

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.070
and I'll never - I might think
things, but I'll never say it

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.960
because part of what
I'm doing, you know,

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.630
no one wants to read a textbook
and no one wants to read a lecture.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.300
My job is to entertain them
and have it dawn on them slowly

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:13.170
that these women are in control,
they're driving the roadster,

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.560
they're nobody's passengers.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.800
And, by the way, the world didn't
end, it kind of worked out nice,

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.730
and the curtains are a
hell of a lot better.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:25.100
I mean that's probably
sexist, but my point is this -

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:30.080
not to get ahead - Rosato
is about those women.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.980
It's a series and it's about women
over time, and since I've been

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.880
at this so incredibly long I
am actually examining power

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.120
relationships and personal
relationships between women

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.020
over time and I'm talking
in real time,

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.660
like 20 years I've been
writing about these women.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.070 position:56%
So you're going to try to understand
how is the world different

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.560
when women run it?

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.180
Because that's what
happens in those books.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.100
There are so many that I've
written a whole series of them,

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.980
and then there was a little
more insecure partner.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.770
Let's think, she has fake blonde
hair and she's about five-two,

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:07.450
she's Italian-American, she
grew up in South Philly.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.330
Oh, wait, it's supposed
to be fiction.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.880
That would be Mary DiNunzio, who
is sort of like my alter ego.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.800
And she was the insecure one
who actually became a partner,

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.520
so I had to reboot the series
as Rosato and DiNunzio.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.480
I started it at Accused.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.170 position:56%
The next one last year was Betrayed.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.470
This one is Corrupted.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.880
You see the pattern
because you're smart people.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.710
ABC, because Sue Grafton
is done with the alphabet

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:38.970
and there is no copyright
on that, and ain't it great?

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.540
In April I wrote books
which we call standalones,

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.890
they tend to examine
what is a mother?

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.640
This is all the secret
stuff I'm doing, right?

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.380
This is the stuff that matters,
not the stuff like this.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.870
So here's, for example,
a quick story.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.600
A lot of the books are
about what is motherhood,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.040
how is step-motherhood
different because I've been that?

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.360
How is an adopted mother different?

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.070
Here's the story about that
and here's where it came from.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.380
I was picking up my daughter who
grew up, actually stopped nursing

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.410
which was the beginning
of the end in my opinion,

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.660
but in any event goes
to college in Boston.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.960
I have to pick her up.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.410
Have you picked your
kid up at school?

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:19.160
Like you have to get all their
stuff in the car and take it home.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.550
And I'm still single
so it's me and her,

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.410
like our Thanksgiving
is two people, whatever.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.710 position:56%
And we get all the stuff in the car.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.200
She's got shoes, books,
DVDs, she's got earrings.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.680
The parents of sons, they
have like baseball caps

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.440
and a basketball, but
I have everything.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.740
I've packed the car.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.620
On top of the car a mattress, a box
spring, a red rug which she insists

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.490
on keeping from her
dorm room, $37 rug.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:46.790
I said let's toss it.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.260
She's like, no, I really
want to keep it.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.090
I deny her nothing.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.560
We strap this thing with
a bungee cord, right?

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.860
It's a nightmare.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.730
We drive home from
Boston to Philadelphia.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.480
In Connecticut the worst
rainstorm ever in the history

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.520
of rainstorms happened,
and the red rug -

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.340
those of you who do laundry will
know exactly what happens next -

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.780
because the red rug, I'm
driving the blood mobile.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.490
I had a white car and red
is leeching all over my car,

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.980
it looks like Stephen King.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.660
I don't know what color plasma
is, but I'm pretty sure it was

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:21.000 position:56%
in my windshield like a thin
red-yellow gruel, kind of revolting.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.720
People on I-95 are
pointing and laughing,

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.840
who are these completely
crazy broads, honestly?

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.390
And we're laughing.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:33.320
And at that moment I think to
myself this is so wonderful

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.250
because we basically were
laughing the next three states.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:42.040
And I go I'm not going to have
this very much, many more years,

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.380
because she's growing up
and she's going to graduate.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.050
And, you know, there's a joke that
says that what is the difference

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.910
between an Italian
mother and a Rottweiler,

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.490
and they say eventually
the Rottweiler lets go.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.160 position:56%
I don't think it's about Italianess,
I think it's about all good moms

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.660
and it's about all good dads.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.380
You can't let them go.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.970
And we got all - we had
this great talk in the car

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.270
and I remember picking her up.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.670
You've had probably good talks
with your kids in the car, right?

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.050
There's something about
the car, right?

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.530
It's a little therapy on wheels
where they can't get out.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.310
Like I always say it's
like wonderful,

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.910
and she always says it's a cage
match, so there's a difference.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.970
In any event, I get home and
I had this moment where all

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:24.040
of my emotions well up, which is
a lot of emotion as you can see.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.710
And I think to myself I'm
going to have to let her go

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.010
and this is going to be hard.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.870
And then the next thought I had
was you're supposed to be a lawyer,

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.630
Scottoline, you framed
the question wrong.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.930
She is not yours to let go,
you don't own her, poof,

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.400
your analysis is all wrong.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.460
And as soon as I thought about
that I felt better in my heart,

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.820
I felt lighter, I was
like I can do this now

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.620
because I'm not letting her go.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.770
And I said that's a novel,
that novel was Look Again.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.100
That's what really
happened in Look Again,

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.690
that's the emotional
truth of Look Again.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.360
But the top line plot, the
stupid missing staircase,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:07.760
I shouldn't say stupid about my own
books, but you're working with me -

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.690
the top line plot is a woman.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.380
Oh, let me get this
straight, it doesn't matter.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.010
Fake blonde from the
Pennsylvania suburbs.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.760
I'm the only person
I ever write about.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.750
We understand that now.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:21.940
She comes home one day and she gets
a card in the mail from missing

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.600
and abducted children, and she
looks at the picture in the middle.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.360
It looks exactly like her
three-year-old son who was adopted.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.620
Because in doing my research I
learn that it's practically true

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.650
in every jurisdiction in this
country that you can put up a baby

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:40.570
for adoption without producing
evidence or proof that it is yours.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.930 position:56%
You can't get out of Nordstrom's
writing a check unless you show them

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.320
your mortgage papers, but
you can say this is my baby

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.380
and they're fine with that.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:54.130
So you know what's going to happen
on the first page of Look Again

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:58.190
because readers are smart,
and they say, well, listen,

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.410
this woman is going to
learn right then or suspect

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:05.330
that there's something wrong with
her adoption, unbenounced to her.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.390
And she's going to start to think
to herself if I do the research

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.230
to find the truth I
may lose my child,

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.610
but if I keep this
secret I keep my child.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:19.690
The question in Look Again is
who owns the child and it came

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:26.370
from the emotional truth
of the crappy $37 red rug.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.520
Now what is all this?

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.080
And we write the humorous
ones in the summer,

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.690
which are about literal
truths and, frankly,

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.210
they're about the literal
truths of a woman's life.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:41.760
So I write in all things as
a representative of capacity.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.110
I got the idea for writing those
because I loved Erma Bombeck.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.330 position:56%
And I thought where is Erma Bombeck?

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.780
Where are the women's
voices that are listened to,

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.420 position:56%
that are about just domestic issues?

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.950
Why just, why just, why
do we give that second,

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.660
why is that such short shrift?

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.620
And it was bothering me, but
I didn't think I could try

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.950 position:56%
to write those things because I felt
like I had a kind of a funny family.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.330
Like I said, like we're like
there's no husband, it's me

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.640
and a daughter, it's kind of weird.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.630
And so I felt distinctly
inept, unworthy.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.480
This is my favorite
emotion generally, insecure.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.030
So I'm at a library
fundraiser at Laguna Niguel.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.320
Laguna Niguel is a very
fancy place in California,

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.160
and I sort of said something
like I'm divorced twice,

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.650
which is not something I used to
lead with, now I'm a little older,

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:38.360
everything loosens up as you
hit 60 or whatever, we all live.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.690
I'm in Laguna Niguel, I hear people
going, oh, I'm divorced four times.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.170
No, I'm divorced five times.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.360
Like I need to move
to Laguna Niguel.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.700
But what was interesting is I heard
these women start talking instantly

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.000
about what?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.300
Dogs, their dogs.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.450
And the woman who was divorced
four times had four dogs,

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.420
and the woman who was
divorced five times had five.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.160 position:56%
And I'm like, well, I have five dogs

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.210
and two divorces, so
I'm clearly behind.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.040
I've got room, awesome.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.850
But when I listened to them I
thought you can write that now.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.560
Whoa, got very Italian on you.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.980
Brian, I almost killed myself.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.820 position:56%
You can write this because the truth
is not everybody has that family.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.510
You're lucky if you have that
nice nuclear thing we all grow

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.810
up with, but you know what?

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.150
There's a lot of people
who are divorced.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.880
Sadly, there's a lot of
people who are widowed.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.220 position:56%
And there's all kinds of families
and we're all smarter than that now.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.640
And so I said what I really think
is happening with these women

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.750
and these dogs is that women
are making themselves happy,

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.520
that maybe there isn't a guy
around loving you or another woman

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.150 position:56%
around loving you, but you can give
love and your heart is full of love.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.140
And it doesn't know the
difference, like if it were

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.280
that smart it would be your brain.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.250
That's what I figured
out myself, right?

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:56.300
So I wrote a book called Why
My Third Husband Will Be A Dog,

00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:01.820
which is about the real life of
me and my daughter and my mother.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:07.170
But I think it is really
more importantly about you.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:12.310
My secret mission is for you
to get the credit you deserve.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:16.510
And if I said that on the cover
they wouldn't buy the book,

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:21.360
I'd tell them it's an entertaining
story and it kind of is.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.330
So they get the secret message that
women can do really cool things

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.330
and they can do funny things

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.530
and they can live their
lives however they want to,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:34.410
and they can drive the roadster
wherever they damn please all

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:35.710
by themselves.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.940 position:56%
Because I do believe if you're lucky
enough to have somebody with you

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.360
in your passenger seat or even
driving you around, you know,

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.470
you're still on this road
of life a little bit alone.

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.710
In the end you've got to
stand up for yourself.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.800
And so that's what I'm
secretly writing about.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.260
Now to finish I have
sort of made a big point

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.830
about this truth, writers
always do that.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.940
I don't think they
explain why that matters,

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.710
and that's where you come in.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.590
The reason it matters
if it's true is

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:09.830
because that's the
only way it connects.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.280
I always think to myself when
I'm writing the funny books,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.440
if it doesn't make me cringe
it won't make you laugh.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.270
So I wrote about, for example,
finding my first gray hair

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.250
on my chin and realizing I
was turning into an Amish man.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:27.400
I don't really want to tell you
that, but I have to tell you

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.430
that because then you know
what I'm talking about.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.320 position:56%
Like I was in the hotel room
mirror, I looked, I plucked for you,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.850
is what I'm trying to say and
that shows how much I love you.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.580
And so we do that for you.

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.030
And so you want to write
about a woman getting older

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.520
on her terms, whatever they are.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.200
I don't have all the
answers, obviously,

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.660
I'm trying to figure it out.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.050
But it's true and if
it's true it connects

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.020
and that is why the arts matter

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.930
and that is why specifically
books matter.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:36:00.080
Because when you look at our
society that is so atomized, truly,

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.660
we're like we're everywhere.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.960
And we used to have office coolers,

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.700
when I was a lawyer
we all went there,

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.100
we all talked to our secretaries,

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.360
we all had our little
place that we convened.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.010
Not everybody has that anymore.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.940
We're dit, dit, dit, yes?

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.520
And we telecommute
and we're skyping.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.730
But at the time, at the same time
that we are farther apart than ever

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:24.040
or alone together, as I saw on the
train today, everybody like this.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.510
The thing that is growing
is book clubs, book clubs,

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:31.100
and you have to understand
that that's the reason.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.340
The reason is because
people want to be together,

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.110
they want to share their
thing, they want to open up.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.220
So when I open up emotionally,

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.370
I'm going to tell you
something really true,

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.470
what it's like to know
you're getting older,

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.360
what it's like to lose your mother.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.520
What it's like to lose your kid,

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.910
what it's like when your kid
gets beat up in New York City

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.590
and you want to kill somebody
but you're not sure who.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:58.630 position:56%
Or the good things, when you get a
date, it actually kind of works out,

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.390
at least until the third
time, whatever it is.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:06.170
All the stuff of it, all the
lawyers stand up and forget a case,

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.040
figure out what it
is to be a mother,

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.400
what it is to be a stepmother.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.320
How are those things different?

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.390
All of those things,
if I can just open up

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:18.180
and tell it true it will connect
with you, that's what books do

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.300
and that's why books matter.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.700
So that when I - and I know the
proof of it is because when I go

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.320
to any book club meeting, because
they'll invite me sometimes,

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.880
and I'll go because there's
wine - hi, I'm the author.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.370
And this is what happens, the
first five minutes are always, oh,

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.880
in the Rosato Law Firm this and
that, and they ask me questions.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.080
I try to remember the book, I
read the book a year ago - no,

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.630
I just make it up, I
never remember anything.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.460
But the next - oh, that's not
really true, but it's hard for me

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.170
to remember - the next 15
minutes are all about this.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:51.710
They start talking about
themselves, their grandkids,

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.040
their kids, their new kitchen reno.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.040
And then what will
happen is the same thing,

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.640
which is that some woman
will invariably look up,

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.110
because women apologize constantly,

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.750
and a woman is going
to apologize to me.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.020
And she's going to say,
I'm sorry, we're supposed

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.550
to be talking about your book.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:13.530
And I say the same thing,
which is absolutely true,

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.830
and sometimes they even get choked

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:18.300
up when I say it -
I say, but you are.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.690
When you talk about what
part of a book you love

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:26.160 position:56%
or what part you hate you're talking
about yourself and your own truth.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.230
When you talk about what authors
you love and what authors you hate

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.570
or why you love a book,
why does it -

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.160
these book clubs have been together
for 10, 20 years and women are

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.460
in book clubs, more than one.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.760 position:56%
Who here is in a book club, anybody?

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.280
Of course, right?

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.320
How many of 10-year standing?

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.620
More than one.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.000
I'm writing Rosato for you because
you are seeing those relationships,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.870
as I see with my best friends.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:56.360 position:56%
Those relationships change over time
and you are sharing that intimacy

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:01.570
over time, and I don't think
it happens without a book.

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:06.050
That's why the truth matters
and that's why the arts matter,

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.500
and that's why it's so wonderful
that John does everything he does

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.010
for the Center of the Book
and all of the 50 states

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.690
and why I remember meeting him.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.060 position:56%
And why he said, will you come here?

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.390
And I was like, yes.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.940
Why it's amazing and great
that Laura Bush started it,

why it's amazing and great that the
Obama's continued it and support it,

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.120
why the National Book
Festival makes the statement.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.520
Look, we can all talk about
kids' literacy and lots of,

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.880
the such good work that many of
you are doing with kids' literacy,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.530
but I don't want to forget about
adults because I feel like we have,

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.970
all of us, and particularly women.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.410
You know, we're always doing
so much for everybody else.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.240
We always have the, I always think

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.850
of the timeline in
the back of our head.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.060
Gee, what my kid right now, for
example, is finishing her dinner

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.570
and then I'm going to
call her at 10 o'clock.

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:54.540
And if you have more than one kid,
and how you did that I don't know,

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.840
props to you, you know
all of their schedules,

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.930
or you know your mother's
schedule or you know when it's time

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.070
for somebody to take their
medicine and you know

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.880
that that's every four hours.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.180
You know it.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.830
Women carry so much
of this that I want -

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:10.500
I love that the National
Book Festival says to adults,

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.550
take time to read, books matter.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:18.500 position:56%
At the national level and a national
statement we are saying not only

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.270
for kids, but for adults, too.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.780
Because I know and I read
constantly, thanks to libraries,

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.340
that if I spend an hour
reading on the internet,

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.610
and believe me I waste time.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:35.250
Paris Hilton, Gawker, Twitter,
I'm on Facebook, and so I tweeted

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.660
about this, hey, come see me.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.980
I love that, but if you
read for an hour online

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.540
and then you read an hour a novel
you will feel the difference

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.950
in your soul, right?

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:54.590
Because books nurture you, books
heal you, books glue you one

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:59.240
to the other, that's what
matters and that's why you matter

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.150
because you are bringing literacy.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.040
I cannot believe it, when John
was showing me this brochure,

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.990
which is gorgeous by the
way, that you are doing

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.860
that world-wide for people.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:14.690
I don't know how you
bring about peace and love

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.630
and justice any other way.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.290
Books teach empathy,
that's the whole message

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.640
of To Kill A Mockingbird.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.500
If you walk in somebody else's
shoes that's how you really

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.800
understand them.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.790
And anytime you read a book
you are exercising empathy

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.740
because you're in, as Aunt
Beattie [Assumed Spelling] says,

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:35.580
a unified consciousness of
another soul for 400 pages.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.630
And if they're going to write
it true and write it honest,

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.280
really open up the heart,
you're going to feel their soul

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.510
and I'm going to feel yours.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.690
You, I do that on the micro level
because I get to write them,

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.410
but you are doing something
so amazing and so valuable.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.560
And, believe it or not though,
I might not look like the kids

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:55.540
in your countries - I am the kids
in your countries, I was that kid.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.500
I'm a kid from South Philly and
I never would have had a chance

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:03.520
but for what you do for literacy,
for libraries, for all of us.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.000
For the arts, for justice,
for peace and for love.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.160
That's true, I think that's true.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.510
Anyway, thank you.

I love all the thriller
people because I love -

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.830
I think these are stories
about crime and punishment

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.950
and I don't think they're -
you know, I just love them.

So I love like Beldotchy [Assumed

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.050
I also read a lot of nonfiction
because I'm writing memoir,

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.590
and so Dana Sadris [Assumed

to do what I've said
that I'm trying to do.

started writing 24 years ago.

&gt;&gt; Lisa Scottoline: Well,
it's about lawyers, isn't it?

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:32.030
[laughter] I mean long story short,
it is actually because I was very -

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:35.880
I did not know anything about
juvenile justice and I started

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.970
to think more and more
about justice issues.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.500 position:56%
And there was particularly a scandal
that happened in Pennsylvania,

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:46.200
which long story short was called
Kids For Cash, where what happened

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.050
and this is exactly how
it happened 13 years ago.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.280
If you were a child and Luzerne
County, Pennsylvania and you got

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.910 position:56%
into a fight in a cafeteria you
were adjudicated - what did you say?

00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:01.300
Yes, you were an adjudicated
delinquent, you went right

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.830
to prison, without counsel.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:07.120
There was a waiver form that was
created, you were railroaded.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:12.480
It turns out that that was
actually because no one knew it

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.430
that there was a real life
judicial corruption scheme

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.900
where that these two state
court judges were in cahoots

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:24.460
with the builder of the prison
and said if you basically -

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.590
they had a part ownership, so
it was a secret deal that went

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.950
on which was you send us the
kids, give us a quota of kids,

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:32.500
and we'll send you money back.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.120
Those judges were ultimately
convicted of theft

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.680
of honest services and income
tax evasion, are serving 17

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.290
and 28 years, respectively.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:46.930 position:56%
But I said to myself because I can't
write that, I never do that rip

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.180
from the headline stuff, I was much
more interested in in what happens

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:54.700
to the 7,000 kids who that
happened to and what was it

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.000
like to be Bennie Rosato?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.780
And the amazing story behind this,
by the way, was a woman founder

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.750
of the Juvenile Law Center, Marcia
Levitt, who broke this whole case.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:07.520
Because what Bennie does comes to
it much, much later, when Bennie -

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.730
if you go back in time, Bennie is
representing a kid who basically

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.260
in the cafeteria gets
sent to prison.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.970
She can't figure out
how this happened.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:15.270
She tries to undo it.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.610
It is plainly unconstitutional,

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.840
but she keeps losing
and doesn't know why.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.570
And so it's the case
that haunts her.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.230
You might have as a lawyer
the case that haunts you.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.050
I have the case that haunts me.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.240
It just bugs me, still,
25 years ago.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.460
I should have said this,
I should have said that.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.760
I do that all the time.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.450
I'll do it tonight in
the hotel room, oh,

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.210
when I said that I
shouldn't have said crowning,

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:35.510
that was really weird.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:40.500
[laughter] So what happens
with Bennie, in short,

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.980
that of course what I wanted
to explore is what happens

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.370
to these kids who basically have
their entire lives derailed,

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.310
spent three and four years
in juvenile incarceration,

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.380
which is no joke incarceration,

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.570
at the time when their
adolescent brains were forming.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:57.670
So I had to research on that,
and how were they ruined

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:59.380
and how can they be made whole.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.240 position:56%
A Philadelphia law firm about a year
ago tried to get them reparations.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.980
They got them about $5,000 apiece.

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.870
Is your child's health and welfare

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.430
and very soul worth
more than $5,000?

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.450
Of course, but it's
the best they could do.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:14.380
So I said here's Bennie,
that kid is of, course,

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.350
going to grow up to become
an offender of some type.

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:18.710
He's accused of murder.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:22.420
Bennie finds herself in the
position of defending him.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.720
It's her second chance.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.340
The book is a little
bit on second chances.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.230
And, by the way, she's in love,
she fell in love 13 years ago.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.740
The guy comes back, you know,
he's the one who got away.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.380
And, yes, I wrote a sex
scene for you from memory.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.200
[laughter] I know, I
know, so you get the idea.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.550
It's sort of the case
of her life and the man

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:48.130
of her dreams all at once.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:50.610

because I donate a lot
of books to prisons.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.620
If I talk in schools, and I try
to for the reason that Chris

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:55.920
and I were talking about, I want
them to go, you know, I was you

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.400
and you can write a book, honey.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.350
Like that's how - and I'll
tell you how it gets made.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.940
The first person they always
have is it going to be a movie?

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.630
Happily my last one is going to be.

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:07.930
I'm like, yay.

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:11.200
But I guess what I'm trying to
say is because it's a movie -

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.890
this sounds horrible - but I think
that that gave kids credibility.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:18.630
I have a lot of moms who will say
to me how do I get my kid to read?

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:22.340
Show them a Harry Potter movie and
then tell them it came from a book.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.190
And what sort of happens
is, and they get lost -

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.440
then the kids find the books.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.240
If you've got to do it that way,
because I do think there's -

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.690
we all know about bullying and
peer group pressure and you can't -

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:39.140
you know, it's hard to say it's
okay to geek out, but I do that.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.160
And for awhile I was giving
- I had a bunch of books,

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.340
I had a bunch of buttons, actually
I was given one by Ron Charles

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.640
of the Washington Post,
a Book Editor,

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.010
who is the greatest guy ever,
and he gave me his button.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:52.180
It said, I like big
books and I cannot lie.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.230
And so I bought a bunch of them
and then when I went to his school

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.790
and gave that out, and
the kids are like, yeah.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:01.840
So how do you tell them reading
is not only fundamental but cool?

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.270
It's like just keep trying,
that's how I look at it,

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:07.170 position:56%
but I do think children's literature
has been so much lately, YA,

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:11.510
young adult, too movie that
you almost have a better shot,

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:13.180
almost have a shot.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.610
Because we give a lot of
credibility to movies.

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:18.870
Someday we'll give the
same credibility to books

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:23.040
or at least we do in this room.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.510
Hearing no other questions, thank
you so very much for all you do.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:31.320
[ Applause ]

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.810
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you,
Lisa, that was great.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.620
&gt;&gt; Lisa Scottoline: Thank you.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.580
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I didn't know what
was coming, but it was wonderful.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:42.540
We now have a book signing of
Corrupted, which is for sale

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.380
as of today, published today, and
make sure that she dates that book

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:51.440
and you remember that you were
here on the publication date.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.850
But I also want to say thank you so
much to everyone who came tonight

00:50:56.850 --> 00:51:00.420
and thanks especially to
our Best Practices people.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.060
It's really for the Board
members who are still here,

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.400
and there are some, it's
really been a wonderful day

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.150
and we've topped it off
with some entertainment,

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.830
but something quite serious if you
think about it and experience it.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.100
So I think we've come full circle.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.400
Thank you.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.520
We will go to the book signing
if you like, and we will be back

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.500
in touch with the Best
Practices people.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.880
Jill is here.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.210
And we've been at you
all day moving you around

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.200
and getting you to sign things.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:35.810
But we promise to be back and to
have a continuing relationship

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:38.810
through the Center for the Book
and our partnership program.

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:41.110
So in many ways it's a beginning,

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:44.200
but it's been a terrific
day and I thank you all.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.660
And I will still be here
to talk with some of you.

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:50.790
We haven't had a chance to
chat, but thanks for everything.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:54.960
And we hope that we see
some of you soon back

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.690
at The Library of Congress.

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:57.990
So I will say goodnight.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:03.730
And, Jill, let me publicly
thank Jill also for the support.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:06.030
Let's give Jill a hand.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.260
She really - we've
been very flexible.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.790
One of our Board members said
you had to turn on a dime.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.850
We had a quick change in our
arrangements, but it's all worked

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.900 position:56%
out beautifully thanks to everybody.

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.610
And, Jill, thanks again.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.230
See you all outside.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:24.630
Thank you.
