AMY SCOTT: My name is
Amy Scott and my company

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.360
is Treasured Limited.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.370
It's basically an
online memory box.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.165
It's somewhere to
store your memories,

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.540
in different boxes for different
people within your life.

00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:23.370
One of the things we didn't
think of when we first designed

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.930
the product was the speed-- how
long it would take over Wi-Fi,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.490
or anything, to get back all
of your photos within a box.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.380
Even with phone pictures with
two megabytes per picture,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.290
it was taking too long to bring
back a box full of photos.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.710
So what we've actually
done, in the end,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.430
is to take two or three
copies of each image

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.330
at different resolutions,
so that if you're using it

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.350
on your phone or the
computer, we just bring back

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.070
that fairly low
resolution picture,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.570
but it still looks
great on the screen.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.800
But in the database, we still
have the full size image,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.730
so that we can use it later
for printing or as a backup,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.740
if you're using Treasured
as a backup service.

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.470
I first came up with
the idea for Treasured

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.840
definitely with
children in mind.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.640
When my daughter
was two years old,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.830
and I realized I hadn't
started that memory

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.310
book that every mom is
expected to do with all

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.490
their first tooth and
first words, et cetera.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.190
But yeah, it's
really surprised me

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.390
how my parents used
Treasured for themselves,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.310
in their retirement, to document
all the things they are now

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.590
able to get up to, as well as
documenting their life to now,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.770
so that they can show the
grandchildren grandma when she

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.890
was younger, and
their wedding photos,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.020
and all of their memories
from their lifetime.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.692
So yes, it have surprised
me, actually, that.

00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:51.400
And the weddings.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.550
That surprised me, too.
