00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.440
talking about a 900 million people who
live there in around that country and

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:35.450
live there in around that country and
 

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.650
live there in around that country and
there are 33 countries in Africa 14 in

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:38.660
there are 33 countries in Africa 14 in
 

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.510
there are 33 countries in Africa 14 in
Asia and one in the Western Hemisphere

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:40.520
Asia and one in the Western Hemisphere
 

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.290
Asia and one in the Western Hemisphere
that is Haiti so you see the this

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:44.300
that is Haiti so you see the this
 

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.750
that is Haiti so you see the this
level of human development low level of

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:46.760
level of human development low level of
 

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.710
level of human development low level of
increments so to say poverty trap and

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720
increments so to say poverty trap and
 

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.260
increments so to say poverty trap and
the high level of vulnerability - all of

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:53.270
the high level of vulnerability - all of
 

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.630
the high level of vulnerability - all of
us together so our challenge therefore

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:55.640
us together so our challenge therefore
 

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.060
us together so our challenge therefore
was to have a conference not only have a

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.070
was to have a conference not only have a
 

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.560
was to have a conference not only have a
conference but to come out with a

00:16:59.560 --> 00:16:59.570
conference but to come out with a
 

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.740
conference but to come out with a
strategy that will take into account in

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:02.750
strategy that will take into account in
 

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.990
strategy that will take into account in
a comprehensive manner the development

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000
a comprehensive manner the development
 

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.120
a comprehensive manner the development
challenges of LD she's so Istanbul

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.130
challenges of LD she's so Istanbul
 

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.680
challenges of LD she's so Istanbul
conference from that perspective was

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:08.690
conference from that perspective was
 

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.810
conference from that perspective was
very important the reason was that

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:10.820
very important the reason was that
 

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.520
very important the reason was that
although we live in a very globalized

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:12.530
although we live in a very globalized
 

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.150
although we live in a very globalized
world the fate of 900 million people is

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160
world the fate of 900 million people is
 

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.100
world the fate of 900 million people is
something which we have to take very

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:18.110
something which we have to take very
 

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.050
something which we have to take very
seriously if we are talking about a

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:20.060
seriously if we are talking about a
 

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.480
seriously if we are talking about a
global peace if we are talking about you

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:22.490
global peace if we are talking about you
 

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.610
global peace if we are talking about you
know the issue of poverty at the global

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:24.620
know the issue of poverty at the global
 

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.100
know the issue of poverty at the global
level from moral and ethical perspective

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.110
level from moral and ethical perspective
 

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.460
level from moral and ethical perspective
so it is important from the ethical

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:30.470
so it is important from the ethical
 

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.110
so it is important from the ethical
perspective and more possible equally

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120
perspective and more possible equally
 

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.060
perspective and more possible equally
important is that it is important for

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.070
important is that it is important for
 

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.970
important is that it is important for
international peace and security as well

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:36.980
international peace and security as well
 

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.380
international peace and security as well
as a self-interest if we are talking

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:38.390
as a self-interest if we are talking
 

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.910
as a self-interest if we are talking
about economic growth around the world I

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:39.920
about economic growth around the world I
 

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.160
about economic growth around the world I
think that must include about a billion

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.170
think that must include about a billion
 

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.600
think that must include about a billion
people that we are talking about and

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:43.610
people that we are talking about and
 

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.940
people that we are talking about and
therefore I think what we were also

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:45.950
therefore I think what we were also
 

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.920
therefore I think what we were also
saying is that globalization has

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:47.930
saying is that globalization has
 

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.740
saying is that globalization has
provided us with both opportunity but as

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:50.750
provided us with both opportunity but as
 

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.800
provided us with both opportunity but as
well a challenges therefore

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:52.810
well a challenges therefore
 

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.550
well a challenges therefore
marginalization of a such a large number

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:54.560
marginalization of a such a large number
 

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.780
marginalization of a such a large number
of people in a kind of a trap in which

00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:58.790
of people in a kind of a trap in which
 

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.480
of people in a kind of a trap in which
they are in requires of course the

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:01.490
they are in requires of course the
 

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.210
they are in requires of course the
support and the proactive approach from

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:04.220
support and the proactive approach from
 

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.710
support and the proactive approach from
the countries themselves because first

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720
the countries themselves because first
 

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.570
the countries themselves because first
of all it is the country themselves we

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:07.580
of all it is the country themselves we
 

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.550
of all it is the country themselves we
have to make an effort but equally

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:09.560
have to make an effort but equally
 

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.320
have to make an effort but equally
important in today's globalized world is

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:11.330
important in today's globalized world is
 

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.120
important in today's globalized world is
that that has to have very strong

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:13.130
that that has to have very strong
 

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.940
that that has to have very strong
international support for them and when

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:15.950
international support for them and when
 

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.430
international support for them and when
we say international support yes Oda is

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440
we say international support yes Oda is
 

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.200
we say international support yes Oda is
important if you look at the overall

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.210
important if you look at the overall
 

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.870
important if you look at the overall
structural challenges of the LDCs if

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880
structural challenges of the LDCs if
 

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.160
structural challenges of the LDCs if
there is no resources

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.170
there is no resources
 

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.750
there is no resources
there will be no investment if there is

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760
there will be no investment if there is
 

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.610
there will be no investment if there is
no investment that is not going to be a

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:27.620
no investment that is not going to be a
 

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.010
no investment that is not going to be a
growth therefore we are saying that OD

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:30.020
growth therefore we are saying that OD
 

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.230
growth therefore we are saying that OD
is very important but equally important

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240
is very important but equally important
 

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.420
is very important but equally important
we say is that trade and investment are

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:34.430
we say is that trade and investment are
 

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.860
we say is that trade and investment are
really critical now these are the

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:35.870
really critical now these are the
 

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.320
really critical now these are the
driving factors these days and all they

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:38.330
driving factors these days and all they
 

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.230
driving factors these days and all they
have to do it is that they should have a

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240
have to do it is that they should have a
 

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.780
have to do it is that they should have a
coherence that whatever we're trying to

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:43.790
coherence that whatever we're trying to
 

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.240
coherence that whatever we're trying to
do with Oda should not be undermined by

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.250
do with Oda should not be undermined by
 

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.510
do with Oda should not be undermined by
whatever we're trying to do at the

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520
whatever we're trying to do at the
 

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.250
whatever we're trying to do at the
International Trading regime equally in

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:51.260
International Trading regime equally in
 

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.470
International Trading regime equally in
fact whatever we're trying to do within

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480
fact whatever we're trying to do within
 

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.690
fact whatever we're trying to do within
these areas should not be undermined by

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:55.700
these areas should not be undermined by
 

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.700
these areas should not be undermined by
international investment

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:56.710
international investment
 

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.950
international investment
as well that's why all these three

00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960
as well that's why all these three
 

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.529
as well that's why all these three
things are four things including science

00:19:01.529 --> 00:19:01.539
things are four things including science
 

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:05.130
things are four things including science
and technology must help us enhance our

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:05.140
and technology must help us enhance our
 

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.990
and technology must help us enhance our
capacity to do more I think this is

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000
capacity to do more I think this is
 

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.210
capacity to do more I think this is
precisely what we have agreed in this

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:09.220
precisely what we have agreed in this
 

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.649
precisely what we have agreed in this
tumbler conference of course the details

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:10.659
tumbler conference of course the details
 

00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:12.690
tumbler conference of course the details
are there good governance is important

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:12.700
are there good governance is important
 

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.970
are there good governance is important
finance it is important rule of law is

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:14.980
finance it is important rule of law is
 

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.130
finance it is important rule of law is
important and our own winners ship and

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:17.140
important and our own winners ship and
 

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.240
important and our own winners ship and
leadership of the entire development

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.250
leadership of the entire development
 

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.250
leadership of the entire development
process are all really very very

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:20.260
process are all really very very
 

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.649
process are all really very very
important but what we really therefore

00:19:22.649 --> 00:19:22.659
important but what we really therefore
 

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:24.750
important but what we really therefore
try to see there in Istanbul was that

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760
try to see there in Istanbul was that
 

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.760
try to see there in Istanbul was that
there has to be a mutual compact and

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:26.770
there has to be a mutual compact and
 

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.250
there has to be a mutual compact and
this mutual compact has to be based on

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:29.260
this mutual compact has to be based on
 

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.130
this mutual compact has to be based on
international solidarity and partnership

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:32.140
international solidarity and partnership
 

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.889
international solidarity and partnership
and we are today therefore we really

00:19:34.889 --> 00:19:34.899
and we are today therefore we really
 

00:19:34.899 --> 00:19:38.130
and we are today therefore we really
like to hear that how the structural

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:38.140
like to hear that how the structural
 

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.310
like to hear that how the structural
change in our countries can really bring

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320
change in our countries can really bring
 

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.409
change in our countries can really bring
about change in the lives of the people

00:19:43.409 --> 00:19:43.419
about change in the lives of the people
 

00:19:43.419 --> 00:19:46.740
about change in the lives of the people
on a sustainable basis I think equity is

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:46.750
on a sustainable basis I think equity is
 

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.990
on a sustainable basis I think equity is
very important sustainability of our

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000
very important sustainability of our
 

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.909
very important sustainability of our
growth is very important but

00:19:50.909 --> 00:19:50.919
growth is very important but
 

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:53.580
growth is very important but
comprehensiveness of that is very

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:53.590
comprehensiveness of that is very
 

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.620
comprehensiveness of that is very
important in the sense that whatever we

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:55.630
important in the sense that whatever we
 

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.590
important in the sense that whatever we
make progress will be will be will be

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.600
make progress will be will be will be
 

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.320
make progress will be will be will be
sustained in the long run and I think in

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.330
sustained in the long run and I think in
 

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.740
sustained in the long run and I think in
today's world this is not only desirable

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:04.750
today's world this is not only desirable
 

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.070
today's world this is not only desirable
I think this is necessary and this is

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080
I think this is necessary and this is
 

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.960
I think this is necessary and this is
possible as well given the resources

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:09.970

as a result some economists think that

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220
as a result some economists think that
 

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.430
as a result some economists think that
the 1980s 1990s were the lost a case for
