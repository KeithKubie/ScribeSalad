00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.750
At one point or another you might have asked yourself am I an extrovert or an introvert?

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.810
It's not always an easy question for some.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.220
Some feel it all depends on the context or how they're feeling that day.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.700
If you're one of those people, odds are you're an ambivert,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.409
which is somewhere in between being an extrovert and an introvert.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.730
Here are the eleven signs you're an ambivert.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.510
Number one: In general, you enjoy meeting new people, but in the company of familiar faces.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.700
Ambiverts enjoy meeting new people, but like doing so with people they already know in situations,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.300
like classmates, meeting a new student, meeting a new coworker at work, or meeting someone through a friend.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.139
Number two: When people address you during conversations or one of your interests come up,

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.119
you're happy to join in, but you also don't mind being in the background, listening to other stories.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.720
Ambiverts tend to be passive in conversation, but will join in when addressed or a subject they like comes up.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.979
Number three: You enjoy spending time with friends, but it can be exhausting if it's a long day.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.789
Extroverts tend to feed off the energy of spending time with others, while introverts can find it exhausting pretty quickly.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.199
Ambiverts can find it exhausting as well, but not as quickly as introverts.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.859
Number four: Being assertive and clear about what you want can be a challenge,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
but if you put your mind to it, you can do it.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.350
Being assertive can be daunting for both ambiverts and introverts,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.070
but with enough willpower, ambiverts can do it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.359
Number five: You can be the life of the party for a certain amount of time and really enjoy yourself,

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.969
but when you reach a point your energy drops,

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.900
and you kind of really want to go home.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.359
Which leads us to number six:

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.600
When you reach that point of energy drop, you find yourself quietly observing what's happening around you,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.340
and becoming more of an observer of the party.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.300
Number seven: Both the things that show you're probably in introvert articles as well as things, that show you're probably an extrovert are relatable to you.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.870
If you find yourself reading the articles and relating to bits and pieces from both, you're probably an ambivert.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.610
Number eight: You find yourself needing days to be alone and recharge,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.809
but too many days like this leaves you craving social contact and feeling down.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.900
Like introverts, ambiverts need downtime from socializing,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.500
but like extroverts, too much downtime and they start craving interaction with others.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.029
Number nine: You tend to balance out the energy with your company.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.929
For instance: if you're with someone who is chatty, you tend to be quiet.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.690
And if you're with someone who's quiet, you tend to be chatty.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.449
Number ten: Well, you might not be the most extroverted person in the room, you do notice social cues some others tend to miss.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.969
You might not be participating in everything; you could still read social cues from the others around you.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.709
Number eleven: in certain situations, you like the attention,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.300
but in general, you don't like the spotlight.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.890
In live theatre terms, you like to be in the audience most of the time,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.529
but there are some times you would like to be the lead onstage.

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.900
So spread the 11 signs you're an ambivert.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.980
