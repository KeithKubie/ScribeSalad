1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,290
Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad.
I'm Robert Krulwich. Our topic today is,

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,220
goodness, goodness, selflessness.
So we've done the math. I,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,170
the math leaves me a little on the codes.
Why did your, why? So you know what,

4
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,410
forget the math. Forget it. Let's, yeah,

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,190
let's go to the people who do the deeds.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,160
People who do amazingly brave
and heroic things. Yeah,

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,110
no math required and maybe find out,

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,070
I don't know what makes them
different than the rest of us. Yeah.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,270
That question. Lettuce,

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,340
Robert Koski to a guy
named Walter Rick Koski.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,090
I'm the executive director and secretary
of the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,290
Cool. Well thanks for doing this.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,740
Can you just give us a little
background on the hero fund?

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,300
What is the Carnegie Hero Fund?

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,470
Carnegie Hero Fund is a private operating
foundation that was established by

16
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:54,471
Andrew Carnegie in 1904 and what we do
is recognize civilian heroism throughout

17
00:00:55,741 --> 00:01:00,300
the United States and Canada by giving
an award called the Carnegie Medal.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,290
And the accompanying the Carnegie
Medal is a financial grant. How much?

19
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,860
A lot of, currently the
amount is $5,000 wow.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,450
And how do you guys choose your heroes?

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,460
We judged the heroic acts
against a list of requirements.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,850
So then you have to have some
kind of definition of hero,

23
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:22,620
which includes some and excludes
others. Yes, perfect. Basic definition,

24
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:27,621
which is a civilian one
meaning no military who
voluntarily to leaves a point of

25
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:34,221
safety to risk his own life or her own
life or to an extraordinary degree.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,180
Five to save or to attempt to save
the life of another human. Six.

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,330
How about seven y, can you hear? Can
you read that one more time? Okay.

28
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,000
I wasn't reading that
just came from memory.

29
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,000
So like what is it that happens in a
person's mind at that pivotal moment when

30
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,710
they decide to voluntarily,

31
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:53,700
voluntarily leave a point of safety
and risk their life to an extraordinary

32
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,180
degree to save the life of another
human? That's what we wanted to know.

33
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,730
Should we just jump in? Okay.

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,090
So the first one we have on our
list is a Laura Shrek. Okay.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,840
That's file number seven three five
four six and the award number is 8,005

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,490
I am Laura shrike. I'm
from Matt Toon, Illinois,

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,670
and I currently live in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

38
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,170
Oh Wow. Laura spoke with our
producer Tim Howard. Okay,

39
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,790
so we're going back a little bit here.

40
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,050
Yeah, 15 years. Yeah.

41
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,560
Back in the, uh, mid nineties, 1995
to 21 year old college students

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,620
and I was driving through the country and
I saw a woman getting mauled by a bull

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,030
and a pasture.

44
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,230
So she stopped to see what was going on,

45
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,840
jumped out and started yelling
at her to see what I could do.

46
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,530
The woman was on the ground and the bull
was 50 pound Jersey bull tossing her in

47
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:51,120
the air and back on the ground.
Wow. She was clearly struggling.

48
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,940
And where were you? I was right
on the other side of the fence,

49
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,950
but the fence was electric.

50
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,040
So here's the moment

51
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,050
that we find fascinating. At this point,

52
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:06,790
Laura can either go forward
through thousands of volts
of electricity toward an

53
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,270
angry bull that will
likely mall her too, or

54
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,270
she can stay safe.

55
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,103
[inaudible]

56
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,500
I went ahead and just climbed through
the fence and I don't remember ever

57
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,360
feeling the electricity.

58
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,140
She says by the time she got through
crazily enough and neighbor had shown up

59
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,800
and threw her a piece of pipe maybe
about two feet long or she approached the

60
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:36,370
woman who is still conscious the
whole time she's yelling at me,

61
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,250
hit the ball in the face as
hard as you can and don't stop.

62
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,200
So Miss Shriek went up to the bowl and uh,

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,870
repeatedly refers two
foot length of tubing.

64
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,480
I think it distracted the bull enough
where she was able to get out from under

65
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:55,170
him.

66
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,760
And as soon as we were outside the fence
looking back into the pastorate and the

67
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,510
bull was literally right
there at the fence,

68
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,350
[inaudible] ground a few
times and snorted. He was
not happy. He was not happy.

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,453
Yeah.

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,860
To our question,

71
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,860
when you were there at that fence and
you had the choice either stay put or to

72
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:21,270
go through it, what was going through
your mind? W was there a calculation?

73
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,190
No, I can't really say that. I mean,

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,120
you didn't weigh your options
or anything like that?

75
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,340
I did not know. It was
just, here's the problem,

76
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,540
here's what I need to do. And
something needed to happen.

77
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,493
Huh?

78
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,480
So there was no choice moment?

79
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,960
Not that I recall. No.

80
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,520
If nobody came to this woman's
rescue, she would die. Unfortunately.

81
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,160
This is the usual explanation, says
Walter lobular. No explanation.

82
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,690
Like I couldn't stand there
and not do anything. I would,

83
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,350
I was compelled to act.

84
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,800
I didn't really take the time to
think about what else could happen.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,120
No, I can't say I ever really thought
about my own life at that time. I mean,

86
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,250
I think we just jumped ahead
because we thought we'd try again.

87
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:07,940
That's the voice of the next Carnegie
Hero that Walter told us about.

88
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,920
Yeah. William David Pennell,
Ames William Panel. Wow.

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Who is the 8362nd person to
receive the Carnegie Medal?

90
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,300
I'm pretty sure Lynn Levy tracked him
down. Bill, can you hear me? Yeah,

91
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:19,850
I can hear you.

92
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,110
William. David Pennell was 37 years
old at the time I faced heroic act.

93
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,260
Was It 1999? Yes. I was, uh,
early in the morning. It was like

94
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,960
3:19 AM in a small town near
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

95
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:35,630
Monongahela, Pennsylvania.
We was in bed sleeping.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,560
My wife had a lot fash I actually
didn't hear it in a dog my one dog was

97
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:44,320
carrying on. So right
away I run down there.

98
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,810
Mr Pennell went outside his house. There
was a very bad automobile accident,

99
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,310
a car crashed head on until utility pole.

100
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,320
She was like rippling up the windshield
off from under the hood and he responded

101
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,370
to the scene wearing only no shoes

102
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,900
or shirt or nothing on their chest
and bare foot. So here we are,

103
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,080
bill standing in front
of this ball of fire.

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,730
There are three drunk teenagers inside
that car though he doesn't know it can

105
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,200
either a do nothing

106
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,240
for B. Go in through the driver's door.

107
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,960
Big Fella sloped out the doors.

108
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,880
So I reached in and grabbed the
hold of them around the chest,

109
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,700
pull them from the driver's
seat out to the ground main.

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,440
Their car was just like blazer
and my neighbor was there.

111
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:35,880
She was hollering. There's more of them
in there. So I run back to the vehicle.

112
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,820
We found that the front seat passenger
who was trapped in the wreckage and I

113
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,590
finally got him loose and pulled him out.

114
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:44,540
Apparently Mr Pennell was aware
that a third person was in the car.

115
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,610
A third young man. Uh, Mr Pennell
entered the car third time.

116
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,190
By then there was tires blown.

117
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:55,660
I flames had grown to about three feet
above the car's roof. The interior,

118
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,290
like the headline are at the car and
stuff was dripping like plastic Donald my

119
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,080
back. Huh. I mean, I'm in
there screaming, you know,

120
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:03,460
somebody give me a hand in here,

121
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,550
but nobody, nobody would help. And uh,

122
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,330
I reached in and grabbed the hold of the
kid who was in the back by the scruff

123
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,550
of the neck and pulled him out. All right,

124
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:21,150
so when you are coming out of your
house and you're looking at that car,

125
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:25,890
what was going through your
head? Just turn to try to help?

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,630
I mean, I, I did what any
normal person would do. I mean,

127
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,720
you know, I just kept saying, this is
somebody who's kids. You know what I mean?

128
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,470
It's a time my daughter was like 16
and I'm saying to myself, you know,

129
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,090
if something, God forbid,

130
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,420
whatever happened to her that I would
hope someone would be there to help.

131
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,320
Do you ever talk to your neighbors and
ask them why they didn't come in there?

132
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,230
Uh, you know what, that's funny you
brought that up because no, I've never,

133
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,060
never brought it up. Never brought it
up. How come? I don't know. I guess,

134
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,950
uh, maybe I probably wouldn't
like their answer. I don't know.

135
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,320
I don't know why.

136
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:07,600
I've never asked him about what do you
think is the difference between you and

137
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:12,420
those other people who just sort of
stood by? Uh, I couldn't answer that.

138
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,040
I couldn't answer that.

139
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,190
So our bowl girl, she didn't know.
This guy didn't really know either.

140
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,810
Somebody must be able to tell us something
about what they were thinking at that

141
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:27,470
moment that allowed them, that gave
them the courage to do what they did.

142
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,040
I can't give you a definite answer as
to what propels people to do this. No,

143
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,390
but we took one more shot with Walter
and he told us about a case that of all

144
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:39,710
the cases he's heard, this is the
one that puzzles him the most.

145
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:41,870
It's the case of Wesley James Autry,

146
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,440
a construction worker from a New York
50 year old man who did jump into the a

147
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,540
track that in a subway
station to remove a fellow,

148
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,740
a young man who had fallen onto the track.

149
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,210
The gentleman was a six
foot 180 pounds. He was,

150
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:04,950
he was an ERT and yet Mr Autry persisted
despite the fact that a train was

151
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:09,270
coming. There would come a point and
let's, at least in my estimation,

152
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:10,530
where you would have to say,

153
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,880
I have to get out of here because I'm
going to be killed on, I'm not suicidal,

154
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,340
but Mr Autry didn't think that way.
He and I part in this in this manner.

155
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,880
What he did was he lay atop the victim
between the rails while the train passed

156
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:29,760
over them in the farthest
reaches of my imagination.

157
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,540
I can see myself jumping onto a
subway track to attempt the rescue.

158
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,510
What I can't see myself
doing is lying at top,

159
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,400
the victim while the train passes over me

160
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,210
making this story even more nuts.

161
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,820
When we finally met up with Wesley Autrey
on the platform where this incident

162
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:55,050
happened under 35th and Broadway, he
explained to us that his daughters

163
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,100
then when they was okay and uh, how
old lady daughters at that time,

164
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,300
my daughter was four and six and this,

165
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,910
this them there should this
picture, oh my God, super cute dog.

166
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,250
Then one behind me is Shuki
and this the baby Sashi.

167
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,990
So when they're standing there and
this guy starts convulsing and then

168
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:19,250
eventually falls off the platform onto
the tracks, right as a train is coming,

169
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,020
his choice is pretty stark. In order
to save this complete stranger,

170
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,100
he's got to leave his daughters
behind potentially without a dad.

171
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,083
I'm looking at him

172
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,650
second and going into another seizure
or some strange reason a boys out of

173
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:36,170
nowhere is that, don't worry about your
own, to worry about your daughters.

174
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,810
You can do this. So we jumped yes.

175
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,290
Runs to the guy. Is he conscious? No. No.

176
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,770
Tries to grab the guy's hand and he start
my grabbed his hand will slip apart in

177
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:52,560
a, he slipped. I look up, the train is
getting close. I grabbed his hand again.

178
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,700
We'll slip apart, just rained
the skulls up 50 feet, 20 feet,

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,870
10 feet, and then it's right there
and all he can do is grab the guy,

180
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:04,350
get him in a bear hug and flatten
his body against the guy as much

181
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,333
does he

182
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,760
the first train car? Just greys.

183
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:16,761
My cas train car went right over it
when the train came [inaudible] so stop

184
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,300
quoting five cars passed over us. I
looked him in the eyes. Excuse me,

185
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,840
and you seem to have a seizure
or something. I don't know you,

186
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:24,740
you don't know me.

187
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,330
So I just kept talking to him until
he came through and he was like, well,

188
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,970
where are we? I'm like, we on a different
train. He said, well, who are you?

189
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,850
I said, I came down to save
your life. So he kept asking me,

190
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:38,860
are we dead or we in heaven? I gave him
a slight pinch on his arm. He's like,

191
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,240
oh, just I see you. You
are very much alive.

192
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,030
Have you, did you ever ask yourself at
this point like what am I doing here?

193
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,120
He asked it. What am I doing
here? What about you, your mind?

194
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,230
I can hear the two ladies.

195
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,790
We had my daughter standing
the man between their legs.

196
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,210
I can hear my daughter screaming. So
when that training come to a stop,

197
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,910
I yelled up from underneath the train.
Excuse me, I'm the father. We're okay.

198
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,630
I just want to let my daughters know that
that I'm okay because I know that they

199
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:11,110
are worried about me. Everybody started
clapping. Can I ask you a question?

200
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:15,790
So the point at which you said
you heard a voice. Yes. That said,

201
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:20,680
I can do this. I can do this.
What's what's what is amazing to me?

202
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,370
Is it you left your daughters
right here after a guy.

203
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:28,540
You don't know he was a stranger,
total stranger. But you know what?

204
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,600
The mission wasn't con
completed. I was chose for that.

205
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,980
You felt chose like you were teaching.
I felt like I would have chosen

206
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,880
live for a religious person
though I would wonder why me?

207
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,520
Well, you know what, uh,

208
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,910
maybe 20 years ago I was supposed to be
at a certain point and then he explained

209
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:54,130
to us exactly why he had jumped.
He was the one guy who could,

210
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,440
he said right before his
feet left the platform,

211
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:01,441
this one specific moment from his
life flashed this thing that happened.

212
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,950
You know, I had a gun pool
to my temple, but you know,

213
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,500
it was a misfire. So you know, a gun
was put to your head and missing.

214
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,720
So you are almost dead for a
second. Those dead, you know.

215
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,000
So you think you might've
been spirit for a parent?

216
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,330
I was spare for reason after that. Yeah.

217
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,780
[inaudible] he says when the gun
went click and he didn't die,

218
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,210
he always wondered why had God spared
him that moment until he was on the

219
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:30,170
platform and he saw the guy
fall off. He says, then he knew,

220
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,570
this is why I can do this. I
can do this. I can do this.

221
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,780
That voice when that board said
that you're going to be okay.

222
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,190
I knew everything was gonna work out

223
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,060
you. You know what I think at
the end of the day, what's that?

224
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,930
I don't think that there's an answer to
the question we asked. I don't really,

225
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,800
hero question. Why were you a hero? I
don't think that any three of these here.

226
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,500
I mean the last one had
the longest explanation.

227
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,900
He had been selected for some purpose,

228
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,010
but does he know why he
was not a clue. Okay.

229
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,760
Number three gives me something. What
does he give you? Okay, so the first two,

230
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,680
right? They have no idea. None.

231
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,670
So this is just something in
them that made them act began.

232
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,630
Number three is talking
about circumstances like the
world prepared him for that

233
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:24,480
moment. Serendipity. So it makes me think,

234
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,720
well what if a circumstances
are just right?

235
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,600
Maybe any of us could do that
again, I'll get a middle man. He,

236
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,540
he used to say to me all the time, he
says, how did you manage to do that up?

237
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,140
Or how did you manage
to pull him kids out?

238
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,430
I don't know if I could've done
that. I said, well, you know what?

239
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,940
I'll say you wouldn't do this or you
wouldn't do that to you're put in that

240
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:44,310
situation. In fact, when we asked Walter,

241
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,030
how many nominations do you get a
year? Are they hard to find? No,

242
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:52,070
they are not hard at all to find a, we
are fortunate to be living in a society

243
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,780
regardless of what you hear elsewhere.

244
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,370
We are fortunate to be living in a society
where people do look out for others,

245
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,330
even strangers.

246
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,140
He told us they've even had to up their
guidelines to make it harder to win

247
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,580
simply because of the vast number for
ROIC deeds that happen in day to day life.

248
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,410
All

249
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,411
right.

250
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:18,411
This is Walter Red Koski support for
NPR comes from NPR stations and the bill
