about it we look at things a different
 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.850
about it we look at things a different
way and the recent studies on

way and the recent studies on
 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.070
way and the recent studies on
epigenetics will show that you know

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080
epigenetics will show that you know
 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.530
epigenetics will show that you know
things you can change the way things

I think you know Bruce Lipton's doing a
 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.730
I think you know Bruce Lipton's doing a
lot of good research in that and that's

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740
lot of good research in that and that's
 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.580
lot of good research in that and that's
a really exciting field but you know

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590
a really exciting field but you know
 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.740
a really exciting field but you know
just because you have a certain lens of

reevaluation of the value of self
 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.890
reevaluation of the value of self
because the value of self is very

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900
because the value of self is very

fuck do I know why I don't know nothing

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250
fuck do I know why I don't know nothing
 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.400
fuck do I know why I don't know nothing
about and he was like he goes okay I can

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410
about and he was like he goes okay I can
 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.320
about and he was like he goes okay I can
respect that I go yeah I mean what did I

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330
respect that I go yeah I mean what did I
 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.750

do the research am i I don't know I

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760
do the research am i I don't know I
 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.460

think it's a good idea I think the idea

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470
think it's a good idea I think the idea
 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.240
think it's a good idea I think the idea
is sound because I think the chimps

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250
is sound because I think the chimps
 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.400

obviously they think and mushrooms make

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410
obviously they think and mushrooms make
 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.710
obviously they think and mushrooms make
me think in a completely unique way and

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720
me think in a completely unique way and
 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.690
me think in a completely unique way and
I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700
I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms
 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.220
I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms
you'll probably affect the way Thanks I
