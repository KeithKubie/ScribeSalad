so we look at sort of the platforms and

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570
so we look at sort of the platforms and
 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.810
so we look at sort of the platforms and
protocols that allow you to collect rich

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820
protocols that allow you to collect rich
 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.690
protocols that allow you to collect rich
sensor information so for example we

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700
sensor information so for example we
 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.240
sensor information so for example we
want to put devices in a room tell you

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250
want to put devices in a room tell you
 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.230
