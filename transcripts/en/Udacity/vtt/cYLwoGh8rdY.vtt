00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.836
Do you remember what you were wearing the day you got your driver's license? Do

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:08.610
you remember the first place you drove to or who was in the car with you? Do

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.810
you remember the price of gas or was it a warm day, a cold day, sunny, rainy?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.536
All of these things that you can remember are about the day you got your

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:22.818
driver's license constitute what we call episodic memory. Now, episodic memory

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:27.340
is memory for autobiograhical events. Here, we're looking at information

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.036
remember that is both temporal as well as contextual. Meaning when and where

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:37.561
the even occurred. Another type of memory that was related to but different

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:42.618
from episodic memories are semantic memories. Semantic are memories about

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:47.517
general fact or general knowledge. So, for example, an episodic memory might be

00:00:47.517 --> 00:00:51.309
remembering your sixteenth birthday party. The people who were there and your

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.368
favorite song that was playing on the radio. Semantic memories can be things

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:58.997
such as general knowledge, like things you've learned in school. Such as E

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:02.776
equals MC squared. But we're also going to talk about a different type of

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:06.000
memory and that's declarative memory. And we're going to go back to Lauren for

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.720
that.
