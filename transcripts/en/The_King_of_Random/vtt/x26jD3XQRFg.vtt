00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.600
Can you make a
rope with paper towels?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.640
Well, Chillgamer.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.680
I don't know if you can,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.120
but we've got some paper towels.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.340
So we're going to try a few things,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.700
and maybe even use it to pull a car.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.940

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.460
[Music]

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.700
Paper towels on their own
are not incredibly strong.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.619
That's not what they're made for.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.650
Sure, some of them
might have really nice weaves

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.560
so that they hold up better
as you're washing and cleaning stuff.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.640
But for the most part,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.020
I know they're made
to be a kind of strong

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.710
but it's just thin fibrous paper.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.280
It comes apart pretty easily.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.000
Not exactly what you think of
when you want a nice strong rope.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.680
Even if we twist it into
a more rope-like shape,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.300
it still pulls apart really fast and easily.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.420
So the question we have to answer is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.280
how do we turn this weak material
into something stronger?

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.000
Of course, we can just twist up
a piece of paper towel and say,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.579
"Look, I made rope,
and it's sort of stronger now."

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.220
But in my opinion,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.480
if it's not strong enough
to resist a slight tug,

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.699
then it doesn't really count as rope.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.100
It's just twist up paper towel.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.720
Rope actually has to have some strength
and be able to pull or lift something.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.140
That's my goal is to see
if we can make a rope

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.200
strong enough to do some
significant pulling and lifting.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.140
Most of the time
when you're making rope,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.480
you take thin little fibers,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.359
twist them together in the strings,

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.200
and then you twist those
strings together

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.200
into bigger, thicker strings,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.640
and at some point it stops
being string and starts being rope.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.970
I'm not entirely sure
where that point is,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.260
but we need to find it
with our paper towels.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.600
Obviously, we need to have
a way to roll up the paper towel

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.510
so that the perforations aren't
lining up in a straight line,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.780
or they're just gonna tear apart.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.540
So, I'm wondering if we could
roll it at a 45 degree angle,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.840
that way, the pre-cut lines
will sort of get wrapped evenly

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.220
spaced out around the whole roll.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.740
But we should be able
to have it keep getting longer.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.480
[Music]

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.700
We definitely lost some length
by rolling it at an angle,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.420
but, that's still just tore
right at the perforation.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.640
So, maybe this solution
won't work so well after all,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.460
or maybe, what we need to do
is twist the paper towel more,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.140
so that all of the perforation
is bound tightly into non-perforated areas.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.530
And I know I'm saying the word
perforation a lot but it comes up.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.340
All right, let's try asking our friend,
Mr. bench vice to hold this again.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.820
See what happens
if we just twist this a lot.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.280
[Music]

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.900
That didn't tear

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.540
at the cut mark.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.100
That just tore along
the paper towel itself.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.800
I still tore but because
it tore in the middle of the sheet

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.330
rather than along the
predestined tearing spot,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.000
it means we've eliminated that
weakness of the perforation.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.780
So now, we're just dealing
with the strength

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.460
of the material that we're using.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.180
I think I have a plan
for what will try now.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.280
Here's the basic idea.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.440
We'll roll out a fair
amount of our paper towel.

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.250
And then at a 45 degree angle,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.180
we'll roll it up
the same way we did before.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.700
We'll twist that roll
into a tight little cord.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700
We'll make three of
the same type of twisted chords,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.580
and then we'll try
twisting them all together.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.730
It will be very similar to how
we've made ropes in other videos,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.230
but it will have
to all be done by hand

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.940
because we don't have
a rope making machine

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.740
that will work
well with paper towel.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.200
[Music]

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.600
Seems like it's a fair amount.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.280
Let's try 15 sheets.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.780
All right.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.240
Now, I have to try and roll this up,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.160
and keep it a nice tight little twist,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.420
and stay at the right 45 degree
angle for all 15 feet of it.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.900
We'll see how I do.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:51.700
[Music]

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.400
Here we go.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.709
That is one big old
paper towel snake.

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.840
We are at just over nine
and half feet long.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.400
Now we've got it rolled up,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.460
let's see what we can
do about twisting it,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.360
so it's nice and tight.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:19.140
[Music]

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.320
Now, after twisting it,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.520
we've lost almost two feet,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.540
and we're down to
seven and half feet of length.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.700
Now, just gonna put some weight
on both ends of this thing to just hold it,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.500
so it doesn't untwist while
I twist up two more just like it.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.720
We now have three cords made
of tightly wound and twisted paper towel,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.200
and to turn these into a rope,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.380
we now need to twist them into each other.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.740
So, we'll gather them all together,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.000
and then while making sure
to keep the cords nice and tightly twisted,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.340
we'll wrap them around each other.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:05:08.360
[Music]

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.330
I now have rope made out of paper towel.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.060
Of course that doesn't
answer the question

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.640
of whether or not it's good for anything.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.220
I've twisted paper towels into
something that looks like a rope,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.130
and I'm sure it can pull some amount.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.860
It definitely has more strength
than a sheet of paper towel.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.980
The question is, how strong is it?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.940
First quick test,

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.980
let's see if I can just
pull it apart right here.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.520
[Music]

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.740
I mean I'm not the
strongest guy in the world but,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.640
I cannot pull that apart.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.880
So, I would say that's at
least strong enough to call rope.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.640
But it doesn't really
show how strong it is.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.280
So, I have an idea for a test we can do,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.560
that I think will really show
if this is useful as a rope.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.440
We've got our paper
towel rope and a car

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.300
that we're going to try
and pull with our rope.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.280
We've also got a big old truck
to do all the pulling for us.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:14.760
[Music]

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.060
I'm not gonna pretend that this is the
very best way to attach a rope to a hitch,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.540
but because I don't know too much
about the strength of this paper towel,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.300
I'm gonna use this because
it's a very round looping knot,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.870
so, it shouldn't have as many bind
points that might cause weak spots

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.880
in our paper towel rope.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.100
Okay, I think at this point we uh,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.400
have to give it a try.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.740
Let's see if we can
put the car in neutral,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.640
and get the truck going
and slowly start out,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.580
and get it just enough to pull this car.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:07:03.580
[Music]

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.920
Yeah. Just real slow.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.360
It's pullin' it!

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.740
Paper towel, pulling a car.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:29.700
[Music]

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.280
There's no one in there to hit the brakes.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.720
[Music]

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.800
Oh, it tore.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.700
Oh, it tore.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.620
&gt;&gt; It broke?

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.280
All right, after our first success,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.540
we tried pulling it again,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.500
and our rope didn't start out tight.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.480
As a result, when it finally caught up,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.060
it was a little too abrupt that did manage
to pull through the rope.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.700
So while it can pull a car,

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.240
I would not say that we should start
using it to replace webbing or other

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.980
materials that's designed
for this kind of pull strength.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.840
After successfully pulling the car,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.300
and then less successfully pulling the car,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.560
I do have one more thing
I want to test with this rope,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.940
and that's to see if it
can hold a person up.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.580
I'm gonna use me as a person,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.310
and I'm just going to throw the rope
over the top of this swing set,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.340
and see if I can lift myself up by it.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.940
I'm gonna hope that it wasn't
weakened by pulling the car.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.040
All right. Here it goes.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.640
Whooo!

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.240
I'm gonna call that a success!

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.980
[Music]

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.600
So yes!

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.500
This rope is definitely strong enough

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.940
to hold at least a person my size.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.780
Obviously, people come
in all sorts of shapes and sizes,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.180
but this can hold a person.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.940
That is a pretty good rope in my opinion.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.480
Well, since this is made of paper towel,

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.300
I feel like I at least have to see
what happens if I get it wet.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.900
[Music]

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.640
It's definitely a lot heavier.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.140
Ohh!

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.640
Yep!

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.940
And completely lost
all its structural integrity.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.320
That was able to hold my
weight before, and now,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.139
it just tears right apart.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.060
See if I twist it and
squeeze all the water out,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.820
[Music]

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.680
it seems pretty strong.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.500
Maybe not.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.840
So, rope made of paper towel,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.820
definitely stronger when dry.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.760
Chillgamer190,

That box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.460
you should be watching next,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.600
and if you hit this bomb in the middle,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.019
you'll be subscribed to our channel.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.520
That way you'll never miss a video.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.500
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.640
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.480
Talk to you then!
