00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.250
You are listening to radiolab radio from W. N y.

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:08.910
S. T. E. N. P. R.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.430
Okay. Let us begin. Hello. Hello. And with it,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.940
an unusual encounter which comes from this lady. I'm Susan Schaller.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.720
And where do you want me to start her story? You start off, actually,

6
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:26.580
it starts kind of abruptly. I was indeed riding a bicycle to high school

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.750
and a catering truck hit me

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.920
and I was put in the hospital with a concussion.

9
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:42.921
I was 17 years old and the concussion was bad enough that it slowed my brain

10
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:47.700
enough that I couldn't read. And so naturally I couldn't go to school,

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.820
which sucked for her at 17 I was very much a nerd and I was bored out of my

12
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:57.330
mind. So Imagine Susan sitting there in the hospital one day,

13
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.110
one of her friends,

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.320
friend of mine who is just a little older and had graduated the semester before

15
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:05.470
me, suggested going to the nearby university and uh,

16
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.320
crashing classes. So basically would you go if your brain was working slowly,

17
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:13.110
why wouldn't you go swimming? I couldn't read,

18
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.400
but I could listen and I could hear and I, and the person was saying that, oh,

19
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:18.690
it's a lot better than high school.

20
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.150
And so one day she was at this college just kinda wandering down a random

21
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.540
hallway and I opened the first door on the left.

22
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.140
That was the accident that changed my whole life,

23
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.460
just picking that door at the front of the room. It was this older guy,

24
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:40.200
he was thin, he was bald and he was tracing shapes in the air with his hands.

25
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.490
It was as if there were pictures being painted in the air and then they

26
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:48.400
immediately disappeared. Then another picture appeared.

27
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.040
<v 1>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.210
<v 0>I was mesmerized.</v>

29
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.540
<v 1>Wow.</v>

30
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.540
<v 0>The professor was signing this class was actually one of the first classes to</v>

31
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:04.160
teach sign at a regular hearing university ever. I had,

32
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.190
I had also walked into history but didn't know it. Fast forward five years,

33
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.370
Susan now is fluent in sign. She moves to Los Angeles.

34
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.330
It's the late 1970s and I was snatched and put into interpreter training

35
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:17.100
programs because at that time there were very,

36
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:22.101
very few interpreters and I found myself in a classroom in a community college

37
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:26.400
and something called a reading skills class. So she walks into the class,

38
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.210
she's kids all over the classroom making big excited gestures.

39
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.550
One to the other end at the door.

40
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.180
I saw this man holding himself kind of off by himself making his own straight

41
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:41.910
jacket. She went over to the instructor and she pointed at the guy who, who,

42
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.790
who's that guy over there at me, instructor said,

43
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:48.210
well he was born deaf. His uncle,

44
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.130
he has this kind of insistent uncle who, who brings him here every day.

45
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.660
We don't know exactly what to do with him though.

46
00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.130
And what did this guy look like? He was a beautiful, um, well,

47
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.130
now I know, I don't know if I would have had that in my head at the time,

48
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:06.940
but a beautiful looking Mayan, you know, high cheekbones and black hair,

49
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:11.020
black eyes and something about his eyes. He was caught heritage.

50
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.310
He was studying mouth and I, I walked up to him and said, hello,

51
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:16.270
my name is Susan

52
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.680
<v 2>and this is where things start to get a little weird.</v>

53
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.340
He looks at her and instead of signing his name,

54
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.560
<v 0>whatever it was, he brings up his hands and signs right back to her. Hello,</v>

55
00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:28.570
my name is Susan [inaudible].

56
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.763
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

57
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.310
<v 2>Susan, like Shakespeare. There's no, I'm Susan. And he responds, no,</v>

58
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.080
I'm Susan. Everything you said

59
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.790
<v 0>you tried to say exactly. I call it visual Echolalia, polio,</v>

60
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.090
polio, polio, polio. And I remember thinking,

61
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.330
why is he doing this? I mean, Susan, did he,

62
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.500
did he look like he had some kind of disability or can you [inaudible] um,

63
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.600
he was intelligent.

64
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.420
I wouldn't have been able to answer if you had asked me how can you see

65
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:02.410
intelligence, but you can actually see intelligence in people's eyes.

66
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.330
He was just missing something to copy me meant that he didn't really know what I

67
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:11.650
was doing and that's when it occurred. This man doesn't have language

68
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.963
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

69
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.220
<v 4>at wait, how old was this guy? He was 27 years old. And in all that time,</v>

70
00:04:19.221 --> 00:04:21.660
no one had taught him sign language or anything. Well,

71
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.870
he didn't know he was deaf. He was born deaf.

72
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:28.190
He didn't know there was sound really 27 years, no idea that there was sound.

73
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.310
He could see the mouth moving because he people responding.

74
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.540
He thought we figured all this stuff out visually and he thought,

75
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.130
I must be stupid. So here's the question for our hour.

76
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.690
This is radio lab. I'm Chad, I'm Rod. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich words,

77
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.980
<v 2>do words do for them? Are they necessary? Can you live without them?</v>

78
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.640
Can you think without them? Can you dream without them?

79
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.560
Can you hold them up? Can you swim back to the story?

80
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.010
So this man that Susan that we don't actually know his real name,

81
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.130
but when she wrote about him in her book, a man without words,

82
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.120
she called him Ildefonso. They are sitting in the classroom,

83
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.400
she's right there with him. And of course she's wondering

84
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.600
<v 0>what have you been doing for 27 years? So she thinks, well,</v>

85
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:19.710
let me see if I can teach them some just basic sign language in interest in case

86
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:24.240
she takes out a book and makes the sign book, but the sign for book,

87
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.070
it looks like opening up a book.

88
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.240
So he thought I was ordering him to open a book and so he grabbed the book and

89
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:32.520
he opens because he thought I was asking him to do something.

90
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.640
It was very difficult if I gave him the sign for standing up,

91
00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:38.490
he thought I wanted him to stand up and so I couldn't,

92
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.920
I couldn't have a conversation with them then.

93
00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:44.820
It was the most frustrating thing I've ever done in my life. Wait a second.

94
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:49.710
How long did this go on for? Well, a weeks. It was weeks. Wow.

95
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.880
Oftentimes when we said goodbye or just left me, couldn't really say goodbye.

96
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.030
I really believe that we wouldn't see each other again.

97
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.100
And I was oftentimes very surprised when he would be sitting there at the table.

98
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.040
And I think sometimes he looked surprised that I showed up.

99
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.660
But after a couple of weeks of him constantly miming copying me,

100
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.410
she had an idea perhaps. So it's just possible that if, uh,

101
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.240
if I died tomorrow, I would have had only one really,

102
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:18.490
really good thought in my life. And this was it.

103
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.860
I thought I'm going to ignore him.

104
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.550
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

105
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.530
<v 0>I taught an invisible student,</v>

106
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.680
I stopped talking to him and I stopped having eye contact and I set up an empty

107
00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:35.700
chair and then she said she would hold up to this empty chair. A picture of it.

108
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.290
Yeah. Kat.

109
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.730
And I was trying to explain to this invisible student that this creature,

110
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:41.301
a cat,

111
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.050
so I'd be miming a cat and petting a cat and then I signed the sign for cat.

112
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.640
Then she would hop to the other seat,

113
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.900
the invisible student's seat and pretend to get it. Oh,

114
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.840
I know with my facial expression. Oh, I get it. So you're playing all the parts.

115
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.870
You're both the teacher and the invisible student. That's right.

116
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.290
That's doing all these crazy things. And he just watched me.

117
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.870
He stopped copying her, which was good.

118
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.680
But I do this over and over and over for days and days and days.

119
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.450
And she says he just didn't get it. He was, he looked bored a lot of times.

120
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.970
But one day in the middle of one of these endless pretend student exercises,

121
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.990
something happened. How did the corner of her eye,

122
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.680
she sees him shift his body and he looked.

123
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.810
It's interesting how his body was upright and he looks like something was about

124
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:31.620
to happen. He looked

125
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.890
<v 5>to round the room.</v>

126
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.390
This is a 27 year old man and looks around the room as if he had just landed

127
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:39.640
from Mars. And it was the first time he ever saw anything.

128
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.440
Something was about to tap. His eyes grew wider, she says,

129
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.630
and then wider. And then he slaps his hands on the table.

130
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.320
<v 0>Oh, everything has a name. [inaudible]</v>

131
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.913
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

132
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.880
<v 0>and then looks at me in this demanding way.</v>

133
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.630
And I signed table and he points to the door and I signed door and he points to

134
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:16.250
the clock and he points to me and I signed Susan and then

135
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.423
<v 7>he started crying.</v>

136
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.450
<v 0>He just collapsed and he started crying.</v>

137
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:30.460
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

138
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.410
<v 5>what is it that happens in human beings?</v>

139
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.780
When we get symbols and we start trading symbols

140
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.090
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

141
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.380
<v 5>it changes our thinking.</v>

142
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.700
It changes our ideas of Oh is no longer the thing,

143
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.930
a table that we eat on,

144
00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:45.810
but there's something about the symbol table that makes the table look

145
00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:46.644
different.

146
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.460
Ildefonso was in love. He was in love.

147
00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:55.200
It's like everything has a name.

148
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.030
For the first couple of weeks he had this,

149
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.600
this list of names that kept growing and growing paper.

150
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.690
Eagle clock, green eye.

151
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.720
[inaudible] kept copying words for him and hat car. No,

152
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.810
gave him the sign for door. Door door, right? D O r

153
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.670
start praying to see that. Can each try Barre this paper.

154
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:27.483
Yeah.

155
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.400
Jay was fair treasure and you would pull it out every day and you would lie in

156
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:35.220
carefully unfolded tiger and you would add to it.

157
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.490
[inaudible] Jay thinking me, add to it.

158
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.170
Land walk down. Name add to it.

159
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.830
Cows, the Blue Wall octopus.

160
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.993
Sorry.

161
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.890
What is it that happens in human beings when we get symbols, symbols.

162
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.930
You know, once you have begun to put words onto things,

163
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.400
you can look at a thing,

164
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.480
<v 8>say this symbolic sound table and the person opposite you knows that you're</v>

165
00:10:15.351 --> 00:10:16.184
talking about.

166
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.640
But she seems to be saying something deeper though that like when you get the

167
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:22.040
word for table, uh, suddenly the table,

168
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:24.110
like this table right here looks different.

169
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.480
Like it's somehow the word changes the world in some fundamental way.

170
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.090
Now, I don't know if that's true about the table thing,

171
00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:36.050
but consider what happens when you put words together. Okay.

172
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:36.884
When you link them up.

173
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.950
<v 9>Good. Okay. So I want to tell you about this experiment. Fantastic.</v>

174
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.850
That I learned about from a fellow I talked to sometimes Charles and Charles

175
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.420
Phony, who I'm a psychologist at Durham University in the UK. Fernie, Ho.

176
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.770
And note when I first read about this experiment in Charles's book called a

177
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.370
thousand days at wonder,

178
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.390
it blew my mind out of my nose and onto the book and a little messy.

179
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.010
I never wanted to be with you in the library.

180
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.900
It takes a little journey to get to the mind blowing part, but I'm luckily,

181
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.470
and I'll let Charles explain it. The whole thing happens in a room. Yeah.

182
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:10.110
You're put into this room which is colored completely white.

183
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.660
The walls are white savings. Why the floors? So it's all white, all white,

184
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:16.843
everything is white.

185
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.210
And you can tell where you are to the extent that some of the walls are longer

186
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:24.060
than others. So when you're, we in a rectangle is what you're describing. Yeah.

187
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.880
It's a rectangular room. Are you with me so far? I'm with you so far.

188
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.260
<v 8>Okay. Just to give you a sense of the baseline conditions here.</v>

189
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.620
Imagine you were a rat in this room. Okay.

190
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.530
<v 9>And somebody comes along and heights and object in one corner of the room. What?</v>

191
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.330
It can be anything. I mean for rats,

192
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.740
would you use food like a biscuit or something? Yeah, yeah.

193
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.540
Hide a biscuit and one of the four corners in one corner you see it. Okay.

194
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.000
But before you can get to it, they pick you up by your tail,

195
00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:50.810
spin you around a bunch of times. Let me see. You don't know where you are.

196
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.520
You don't know which direction you're facing it.

197
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.110
And then they say right now go find the biscuit. So if you do this with a rat,

198
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.850
what will happen is it'll say, all right,

199
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:02.200
let me go find the biscuit and it will go to one corner, which looks right.

200
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.570
But of course the room also looks like that.

201
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:10.030
If you turn around through 180 degrees in face,

202
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.570
exactly the opposite direction cause it's a rectangle.

203
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:18.100
So they get it right about 50% of the time because corners of rectangles or two

204
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:22.180
of them are identical. Yeah. All right. So, uh,

205
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.060
who should we get on with this? Because I'm well aware of rectangles.

206
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.210
I just needed to get that out of the way. Cause the cool part is coming up.

207
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.340
So what the experimenters did next is they took one of the four white walls

208
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.340
and he turned to blue.

209
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.090
<v 2>So imagine this scenario. You're in this room.</v>

210
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.900
We've got these four white walls are rather three walls. One of them is blue,

211
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:47.020
right? Well now you're not confused anymore. You can,

212
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.510
you can relate everything to the blue wall. You can be like, oh,

213
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:53.920
the corner with the biscuit whistle left of the blue wall or right of the Blue

214
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.360
Wall. Get to the left. You now have the blue wall as a navigational clue. Yes,

215
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.690
<v 9>that makes sense. You know, we would all be able to do that.</v>

216
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.000
That's not going to be difficult for us. All right,

217
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.410
we got to the good fight yet. Yeah, it's coming. It's coming.

218
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:07.480
Turns out though the rats,

219
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.900
he says they're still scoring 50 50 what is this?

220
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:14.920
If they can't take any notice of the blue wall, even with the Blue Wall,

221
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.560
they're only finding the biscuit 50% of the time. Wait a second.

222
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.180
Can I see color? Yeah. Rants can do color. They do it pretty well. Okay.

223
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:23.980
They also do left, right? Just fine.

224
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:27.700
But what they can't do is connect those two bits of information together.

225
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.080
In other words, they can only, well they can do left that they can do,

226
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:35.740
they can do blue, good blue, but it's, they're both separate.

227
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.650
They can't do left of blue.

228
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.440
These different kinds of knowledge can't talk to each other.

229
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.760
How does anyone know that? I mean,

230
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:46.960
who would rats have been interviewed for this survey? What? David,

231
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:49.000
they infer this based on studying the rats.

232
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.510
So the rat doesn't have what doesn't have the neurons, doesn't have the,

233
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.700
why doesn't, he doesn't have the rat can't do it. That's just,

234
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:57.190
that's all you need to know. And I'm gonna make it weird and right now,

235
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.070
neither can some humans.

236
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.100
I spent the first 10 or 15 years of my scientific life studying creatures who

237
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:07.870
don't talk yet.

238
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.430
<v 2>That's Elizabeth Spelke is, she's a psychologist at Harvard.</v>

239
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:18.440
Quite famous for her work with um, hi once you can hear babies.

240
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.510
And I was interested in, uh,

241
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.600
their abilities in relation to billions of other animals, you know,

242
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.230
if we're going to go to the monkey room. So she began the baby development lab,

243
00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:30.590
which is filled with toys and on any given day,

244
00:14:30.591 --> 00:14:34.250
five or six really tiny kids, six months,

245
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.390
toddlers, two. How old are you? Three and a half. Big Time.

246
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.960
So at a certain point, Elizabeth Spelke,

247
00:14:44.961 --> 00:14:49.190
he decided to build a version of the white room in this lab cause she wondered

248
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.100
if rats have so trouble connecting

249
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.630
<v 11>the idea of left to blue. What about surely maybe humans,</v>

250
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.660
a self-respecting 18 month old human child will succeed in putting them

251
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:03.890
together. But no,

252
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.080
what we find is that children behave just like the rats. Just like the rat.

253
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.520
Just like the rats. Just like the retro almost. Yeah. Just like the rats.

254
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.090
Well we don't test them with food. We don't test them with digging.

255
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:20.540
So in superficial ways, superficial features of the studies are different.

256
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.040
But she says kids like the rats cannot connect to the idea of left to the idea

257
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.830
of blue. They just can't do it. And they can't do it at Warren,

258
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.140
they can't do it. It can't do it at three, four, five.

259
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.590
And we find that those children start performing like adults around six years of

260
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:39.440
age. No, I'm interested. Good.

261
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:44.180
Something happens at the ripe old age of six. It is shockingly late, right?

262
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:44.720
Yeah.

263
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.960
Well something happens at the age of six that suddenly allows the kid to connect

264
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:52.580
concepts like left concepts like blue. And the question is what? What happens?

265
00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:56.630
Several people have suggested that one candidate for his processors doing this

266
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.123
is language

267
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.010
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

268
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.120
<v 11>What do you mean it's a language? Kids are talking certainly at three, four,</v>

269
00:16:04.121 --> 00:16:08.920
five and six. They're talking like, I'm like, uh, the too much, but they're not.

270
00:16:08.921 --> 00:16:12.670
What they haven't yet started to use is spatial language and particularly the

271
00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:16.270
kinds of spatial language that adults would use in this situation to describe

272
00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:18.640
what they're doing. And somewhere around the age of six,

273
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:23.641
they start to use phrases like over the blue wall and those aren't just words

274
00:16:23.681 --> 00:16:27.730
that come out of the child's mouth. Liz thinks that inside the child's brain,

275
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.840
what that phrase does is link these concepts together, clink,

276
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.333
and at that moment,

277
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:36.550
<v 1>hello,</v>

278
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.740
<v 11>the child leaves the rats behind</v>

279
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.930
you should that is that she doesn't think that kids have that. What?

280
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:45.730
Let me put it to you a different way. Okay.

281
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:48.910
This is my best understanding of what she thinks that her basic idea is that a

282
00:16:48.911 --> 00:16:51.160
child's brain begins is a series of

283
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.740
<v 12>islands and on one island we over here in the rain,</v>

284
00:16:55.741 --> 00:16:59.330
you've got say color. Can you call that the blue island blue, blue, blue, blue,

285
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:00.250
blue, blue, blue, blue.

286
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.390
That's the part of you that perceives the color blue way.

287
00:17:03.391 --> 00:17:04.410
On the other side of the brain,

288
00:17:04.411 --> 00:17:08.580
you've got the part of you that perceived spatial stuff like left, left, left,

289
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.680
[inaudible] objects like wall. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

290
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.050
These things are there from the beginning, but they're separate.

291
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.000
Then you get the words left,

292
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:23.330
Blue Wall and then the child for the first time comes upon the phrase left of

293
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.270
the blue, and in that moment all the islands

294
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.290
come together. It is literally the phrase itself,

295
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:37.810
she says that creates that internal connection.

296
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.300
Everybody's always talked about how languages,

297
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.330
this incredible tool for communication that allows us to exchange information

298
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:50.100
with other people so much more richly and effectively other animals can.

299
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.040
<v 13>But language also seems to me to serve as a mechanism of communication between</v>

300
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.790
different systems within a single mind. There you go.

301
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.430
<v 9>Wouldn't it be just as possible?</v>

302
00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:08.440
Just listen to me here that the kid's brain is developing some new connections

303
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.130
and what follows then follows from the changes in the rain.

304
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:16.840
So the words are like an after, after, after, after fact after effect. Yeah.

305
00:18:16.841 --> 00:18:19.090
Well that's a good, that's um, no, no.

306
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.850
And the experimenters actually accounted for that.

307
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.420
What the experiment is did next is that they saw, okay,

308
00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:30.130
if language is adding this extra element, let's try and knock it out.

309
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.030
How would you do that?

310
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.360
Would you like shoot something into their brain that kills the language part or

311
00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:34.770
something?

312
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.530
And it's a much simpler way of doing it in a much more humane thing that you can

313
00:18:38.531 --> 00:18:38.740
do.

314
00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.790
What we did is put adults in the room and then she says she gave them an iPod.

315
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.850
They've got headphones on playing through those headphones and someone talking.

316
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.450
Yep.

317
00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.480
And their job while they're in the room is to just repeat what the person is

318
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:49.810
saying.

319
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.800
Continuously listening to speech and repeating it the whole time they were in

320
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.970
there.

321
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.670
Actually a really hard thing to do if you'd have to try and shadowing somebody

322
00:18:57.671 --> 00:19:01.420
speaking. I mean, if you join, can we try it? You go and I'll,

323
00:19:01.421 --> 00:19:03.070
and I'll shadow you. Okay.

324
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.740
[inaudible] start speaking and start speaking now let's say

325
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.860
[inaudible] in my head. That's really hard actually. I saw it. Yeah.

326
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.760
And what that does is it knocks out your capacity to use language for yourself.

327
00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.210
Basically battering the words out of the uh, adults head.

328
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.610
Why are they doing this? Again, I really want to see,

329
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.460
like if you blast the words out of somebody's head, what would happen?

330
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.050
Can they find the biscuit?

331
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.560
Will they be able to form that simple thought left of the Blue Wall?

332
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.650
Or will they be like the rats who can't?

333
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.310
And and we actually got very dramatic results.

334
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.810
They went right back to B, not the rats. Wow.

335
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.400
<v 7>Yeah. [inaudible]</v>

336
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:48.611
<v 2>Charles,</v>

337
00:19:48.611 --> 00:19:52.570
what I'm wondering is if language allows you to construct a thought that is so

338
00:19:52.571 --> 00:19:56.920
basic as the biscuit is left of the blue wall,

339
00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:02.370
what is thought without language when I didn't think it's very much at all?

340
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:04.980
<v 9>What do you mean?</v>

341
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.830
I'm going to put it in a different way and this involves making quite a

342
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:11.580
controversial statement. I don't think very young children. Do you think

343
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.800
like think period? Was there a period at the end of that sentence?

344
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.710
I don't think they think in the way that I want to call thinking,

345
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.300
which is a bit of a cheat, but let me see what I mean by thinking. Okay.

346
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:26.460
If you reflect on your own experience,

347
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:29.880
if you think about what's going on inside your head as you're just walking to

348
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:32.490
work or sitting on a subway train,

349
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.350
much of what's going on in your head at that point is actually verbal.

350
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.540
I'm going to suggest that the central thread of all that is actually language

351
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.190
languages, a stream of inner speech.

352
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.040
That's what most of us think of as

353
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.950
<v 14>well. On the other hand,</v>

354
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.930
what I'm most aware of when I'm reflecting is this stuff that I can't put into

355
00:20:55.931 --> 00:21:00.280
words. I think that he's exaggerating the role of of language here.

356
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.710
<v 2>Yes. This all really hinges on how you would define thinking.</v>

357
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.563
Yes,

358
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.860
and this would say take a musician like I'll give you my example of Bill Evans.

359
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.660
Here is a form of thought

360
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.040
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

361
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.430
<v 2>It carries you through</v>

362
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.350
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

363
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:23.820
<v 2>definite sequence of phrases, feelings,</v>

364
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.890
<v 7>emotions, changes,</v>

365
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.970
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

366
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.020
<v 14>and there are no words,</v>

367
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:38.230
but there's something that we get access to when we gain a full natural language

368
00:21:38.421 --> 00:21:42.200
that we can use, not only to communicate with other people, but with ourselves.

369
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.230
<v 2>We have to Shapiro's test, test, test, test, test.</v>

370
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.650
This language is fundamentally a competent tutorial system.

371
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.180
As we hit up the steps here, what is this? This is that,

372
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.340
and we're going to Columbia University. See,

373
00:21:58.341 --> 00:22:00.260
we'd gotten interested in the last thing that they spoke.

374
00:22:00.261 --> 00:22:03.920
He said about language being a cognitive aerial thing system, right?

375
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.620
And that led us to Columbia. Here's the deal. Seven minutes later,

376
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.270
which is you have words now. You have words in combination now.

377
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:16.300
Now you can play with the combination and that is you're here just us three

378
00:22:16.431 --> 00:22:19.160
then, right? It's just a straight good opens up

379
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.800
<v 15>a kind of an infinity head to foot now as he total gills,</v>

380
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.560
hardly trip with blood are fathers, mothers, daughters,

381
00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:29.380
sons baked in and pasted with the parching streets,

382
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.340
the lended Tyrannus and damn the light to their viral murders.

383
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.190
This is Shakespeare.

384
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.800
When I sat in middle school and they gave a Shakespeare roasted and wrath in

385
00:22:36.801 --> 00:22:39.880
fire and this or size it with coagulate goals,

386
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.400
I was completely confused and I felt stupid. I said,

387
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:45.730
can you just introduce yourself? James Shapiro, I'm a,

388
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.110
he is a Shakespeare scholar obviously at Columbia University where I've taught

389
00:22:50.111 --> 00:22:55.111
for 25 years and one reason he says that Shakespeare can be confusing is that

390
00:22:55.391 --> 00:22:58.300
often Shakespeare behave not so much like a writer,

391
00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:03.040
but more like a like a chemist combining elements.

392
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.700
He's taking words and he's shoving them together,

393
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.100
smashing them together if you will,

394
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.860
and combining sometimes these word experiments, they didn't go so well. Yes,

395
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:20.110
the princes or Gellis. Oculus has no,

396
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.780
it goes to me. What does it mean you got me? I mean, I should know. I told him,

397
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.660
look what he did just by adding a little prefix and

398
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.030
there's so many words that we're now familiar with, unnerving. You know,

399
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:38.350
we all know what that means, but nobody had heard unnerving, unaware,

400
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.990
uncomfortable. He made up uncomfortable.

401
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.650
He was the first to use that word on a stage, right?

402
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:50.340
An earthly on hand and dress on educated ungoverned meeting Galeana published

403
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.730
something that's near and dear to me. Public, unsolicited.

404
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:59.750
Unswayed unclog on a piece, unchanging. Unreal.

405
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.310
He made up unreal.

406
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.730
He's the first to use it in print or on stage with an audience.

407
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.050
That time if understood what the unprefixed meant. No,

408
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.640
I think it takes you a split second

409
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.770
to kind of put that on on the real,

410
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.210
but then suddenly you've got this new concept that there's something real but

411
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.730
Nah, he's taking words that ordinarily are not stuck together.

412
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.720
Things like madcap, ladybird shoving them together,

413
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.200
eye drops to achieve a kind of atomic power.

414
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.070
I saw ball. He did eyeball. Yes.

415
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.500
It's hard to understand how someone could think of that bed.

416
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.050
It seems like it's always been there. If you asked me what his greatest gift is,

417
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.220
he's putting them together into phrases that have stuck in our heads,

418
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:55.320
so truth will out, truth will out. What's done is done.

419
00:24:55.470 --> 00:25:00.450
I could go on and on. You want to try to go on and on crack of doom.

420
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.890
My favorite dead as a doornail, a dish fit for the gods.

421
00:25:04.891 --> 00:25:06.180
Dog will have his day.

422
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.810
Faint-Hearted fool's paradise forever and a day for going.

423
00:25:09.811 --> 00:25:14.340
Conclusion game is a full game is up Greek to me in a pickle.

424
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.270
In my heart of hearts, in my mind, I heal with kindness.

425
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.490
Believe it or not. Knock, knock. Who's there? Oh,

426
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.650
that's you. Stuff into stitches. Love is blind. What the dickheads.

427
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.180
All's well that ends well.

428
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.410
Something wicked this way comes

429
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.780
and a sorry sight. Wow,

430
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.810
that's a champion. That's fantastic.

431
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:51.550
How did he create phrases that stick in the mind that make it seem as if they

432
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.870
always existed? Yeah. You're taking out a book.

433
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.260
Thinking of a passage here that is maybe the biggest book I've ever seen.

434
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:06.800
It was at least 3000 pages. Shakespeare doesn't write a lot about process,

435
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:12.130
but there are one or two places where he does in a poem called Lucrece in which

436
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:15.890
a woman is a rake,

437
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.750
Lucrece is rape and she has to write a letter to her husband explaining what

438
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:25.751
happened to her and she's struggling to define the words in which to do this and

439
00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:31.841
finally she picks up the pen and it shows she prepares to write first hovering

440
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.580
over the paper with a quill conceit and grief and eager combat fight.

441
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.630
What width sits down his bladder straight with will this two curious good.

442
00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:46.620
This plant l much oppressive people at a door. It's wrong. Her inventions,

443
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:49.080
which shall go before, are we that couplet again,

444
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.360
much like oppressive people at a door from wrong, her inventions,

445
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.770
which shall go before.

446
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.190
If you want to extrapolate from this something that Shakespeare might have

447
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:03.750
himself experienced. You have a situation with all these ideas up pressing.

448
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.920
It's like a [inaudible]

449
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.770
<v 2>one of them. Who's getting through that doorway first?</v>

450
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.760
It's a little bit maybe like that experience you might have in a nightmare New

451
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.760
York club where you've got like thousands of people in a tiny space and

452
00:27:19.981 --> 00:27:22.980
everyone's trying to push their way out and I'm like, Chad, let me do the door,

453
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:24.690
get out of my way. And it's just like this [inaudible]

454
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:30.710
<v 15>of images of sound concedes thoughts, ideas, and, and,</v>

455
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.500
and they are providing the pressure that's needed

456
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.030
<v 2>to do use words.</v>

457
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.850
You know what just makes sense to me, this interpretation now,

458
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.900
not just for Shakespeare, we'd be for anybody.

459
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.840
Certainly the guy we met at the beginning. Ildefonso who'd,

460
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.900
who just learned where it's for the first time. Yeah.

461
00:27:58.901 --> 00:28:00.550
I mean as you move through the world,

462
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.740
if you're sensitive at all and you're observant,

463
00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.850
you're going to get filled up with all of these things which you have to express

464
00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:09.430
but can't until you get those words,

465
00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.890
then boom,

466
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.440
<v 7>the door opens. [inaudible]</v>

467

476
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.820
<v 2>Hey, this is jad from Radiolab. We're having a, uh,</v>

477
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.110
we're celebrating a little milestone over here at radio lab.

478
00:28:54.111 --> 00:28:56.870
We have been doing this, we making stories for the podcast,

479
00:28:56.871 --> 00:29:01.871
for the radio for 15 years at is 15 years of stories about like,

480
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.160
um, I don't know. The science of morality, the metamorphosis of butterflies,

481
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.580
the legal foundation for the war on terror. All these different stories.

482
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.230
I've been doing it for 15 years.

483
00:29:12.231 --> 00:29:16.910
So check out our latest episode out of the archives and all of our episodes are

484
00:29:16.911 --> 00:29:18.740
available wherever you get your podcasts.

485
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.760
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab is our

486
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.170
words, power of words. So once words into your head,

487
00:29:32.171 --> 00:29:36.070
once they tickle in there and we just explained how that happens sort of then

488
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.890
the, I know they're always there, like, but what if they're not?

489
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.930
What would happen if that who

490
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.290
<v 14>that throng that is in your head.</v>

491
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.053
<v 17>Yeah.</v>

492
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.460
<v 18>What if all of that stuff, whatever's in your head suddenly went</v>

493
00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:00.470
<v 14>get yanked right out of your head. Hmm. What would be left? Hello.</v>

494
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.380
This got us thinking about a very famous time.

495
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.350
One of the Ted Conferences,

496
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.150
I got the study of the brain talk given by an euro anonymous named Jill bolty.

497
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.950
Is it bolty or [inaudible]? Bowtie Taylor. Yeah.

498
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:18.170
And all you really need to know is that one morning in December of 1996 Dr.

499
00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.070
Taylor woke up and she had,

500
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:20.070
<v 18>she had a headache.</v>

501
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:25.070
I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain,

502
00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:28.680
caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream.

503
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:34.250
And it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to

504
00:30:34.861 --> 00:30:37.920
ever experience any kind of of pain. So I thought, okay,

505
00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:39.660
I'll just start my normal routine.

506
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.630
So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider,

507
00:30:42.631 --> 00:30:47.631
which is a full body full exercise machine and I'm jamming away on this thing

508
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:54.110
and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar.

509
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.190
And I thought, Whoa, I'm a weird looking thing.

510
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.110
So I get off the machine and I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step

511
00:31:04.111 --> 00:31:08.880
into the shower and now I lost my balance and I'm propped up against the wall

512
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.870
and I'm asking myself, what is wrong with me? What is going on?

513
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.290
And in that moment, my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.

514
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.360
<v 14>In fact, a blood vessel in the left hemisphere of Jill's brain had</v>

515
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.830
[inaudible] and that part of your brain was starting to shut down and it was the

516
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:28.990
shutdown that really caught our attention.

517
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.580
<v 18>In that moment, my brain chatter went totally silent,</v>

518
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.310
just like someone took a remote control and push the mute button.

519
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.710
So here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to my,

520
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.720
my job, it was gone and I felt lighter in my body.

521
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.480
And then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,

522
00:31:56.481 --> 00:32:00.800
hey, I'm having a stroke and we gotta get some help. And I'm going, Oh,

523
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:04.910
I've got a problem, I've got a problem. So I take, okay, okay I got a problem.

524
00:32:04.911 --> 00:32:08.720
But then I immediately drifted right back out.

525
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.890
And I affectionately refer to this space as la La land. But it was,

526
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.330
I'm just watching my

527
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:21.560
<v 14>brain become more and more, uh, um, incapable of functioning.</v>

528
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:25.760
That is Jill Bolte Taylor herself. Hi Robert. We actually got her into a studio.

529
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.900
Hello. Jad Hello.

530
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.500
Cause we wanted to ask you some questions about that moment when her inner

531
00:32:30.501 --> 00:32:33.050
voices went away.

532
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.610
So let's talk about brain chatter for a moment in the story that we've told so

533
00:32:37.611 --> 00:32:42.250
far, you're still yourself questions. How did that stop it?

534
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.900
<v 18>On the morning of the stroke,</v>

535
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.070
I was doing this wafting dance between the right hemisphere and the left

536
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.230
hemisphere. So language would come back on.

537
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.950
But once I got to the emergency room and I passed out,

538
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:59.600
when I woke later that afternoon, I had absolutely no language.

539
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.830
<v 14>Did you know your name? No. Did you know your address? No.</v>

540
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.530
Did you know about your summer from 1983 no.

541
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.090
You know like my mom is so and so. Any of them? None of it.

542
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.830
I didn't know any of that. Just imagine she's lying in her bed.

543
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.850
Her head is shaved, wrapped in bandages. She's had hours of brain surgeries,

544
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:22.850
got tubes coming out of her mouth, however knows she's lost her career.

545
00:33:22.851 --> 00:33:26.870
She's lost her language. I lost all my memories and yet she says,

546
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.110
sitting there in that suddenly wordless space

547
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:36.140
<v 18>found a peace inside of myself that I had not known before.</v>

548
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.360
I had pure silence inside of my mind. Pure silence.

549
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:45.020
Pure silence here. Silence. What you know,

550
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:47.150
not that little voice that that you know.

551
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:50.270
You wake up in the morning and the first thing your brain says is, Oh man,

552
00:33:50.271 --> 00:33:54.470
the sun is shining. Well, imagine that you don't hear that little voice saying,

553
00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:59.420
man, the sun is shining and you just experience the sun in the shining.

554
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.750
<v 14>Does. Is this the absence of reflection of any kind?</v>

555
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.790
Is it just central intake and period? Yeah.

556
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.990
<v 18>Is exactly what it was. It was. It was all of the present moment.</v>

557
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.180
<v 14>Did you have thoughts? I had joy.</v>

558
00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.020
I had a son. I just had children. I had,

559
00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:22.300
I had this magnificent

560
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:27.390
<v 18>experience of I'm this collection of these beautiful cells.</v>

561
00:34:29.021 --> 00:34:31.540
I'm organic. I'm this, this origin

562
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.260
<v 14>Kanick entity. You have a deadhead period by any chance.</v>

563
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:40.060
You know why I missed that by a few years. But I get a lot of that.

564
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.590
And the other thing that she told us is that lying in that bed without words,

565
00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.810
she says she felt connected to things,

566
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.900
to everything in a way that she never had before.

567
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:50.843
<v 18>Oh yeah.</v>

568
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:55.680
I lost all definition of myself in relationship to everything in the external

569
00:34:55.681 --> 00:34:56.514
world.

570
00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.530
<v 14>You mean like you couldn't figure out where you ended [inaudible] how much of</v>

571
00:35:01.531 --> 00:35:05.550
that was was about language? A little part.

572
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.740
A lot. I mean,

573
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:13.310
<v 18>well, I would say it was huge languages and ongoing information processing.</v>

574
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.340
It's the constant reminder I am, this is my name,

575
00:35:17.341 --> 00:35:21.450
this is all the data related to me. These are the my likes and my dislikes.

576
00:35:21.451 --> 00:35:25.260
These are my beliefs. I am an individual. I am a single, I'm a solid.

577
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.800
I'm separate from you. This Rudy is,

578
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.120
this may sound to play pin all this on language.

579
00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.490
<v 14>We have run into this idea before a couple of seasons ago. Uh,</v>

580
00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.013
Paul Brock's remember him. Yeah, sure.

581
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.500
Neuro-Psychologist you will trust me about myself. I just,

582
00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:41.130
you told me that there is a theory out there which he believes actually that all

583
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:44.760
a person is in the end, like all the personhood of a person,

584
00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:46.770
the I or the you of a person.

585
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.160
All that is in the end is a story.

586
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.050
A story you tell yourself.

587
00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.310
We normally think over when we think about ourselves is really a story.

588
00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.040
It's the story of what's happened to that body over time.

589
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:03.240
<v 18>I did not have that portion of my language centers that tells a story.</v>

590
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:04.200
Here is little Jill,

591
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.860
Jill Bolte Taylor climbing the Harvard ladder through language loves deception,

592
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.670
cutting up thing. That language was gone.

593
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.550
I got to essentially become an infant

594
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.720
<v 14>again. I mean this is the problem here.</v>

595
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:27.260
What do you mean when you drop out of the ins of yourself or the story of

596
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:31.290
yourself, then you are left. She says at peace.

597
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.480
I could argue that that's just stranded.

598
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:37.830
That's stranded in the sunshine with the win in the now.

599
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.970
But I mean it's not like she stayed there. That's true.

600
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.370
Let me a dog in terror if she had, and as she started to recover,

601
00:36:44.371 --> 00:36:46.020
she ran into something kind of interesting,

602
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.440
which sounded to me sorta like what maybe the rats and the babies go through in

603
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:52.374
the white room.

604
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:56.190
She would have these disparate thoughts and then go back and stall out.

605
00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.840
Like she couldn't bring them together.

606
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.830
<v 18>Yeah. When, when people would speak to me, I would,</v>

607
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.060
I remembered in pictures. So, um, if somebody would ask me,

608
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:09.420
who's the president of the United States of America?

609
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.610
This is a huge question.

610
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.560
So for the next several hours I'd be pondering president, president,

611
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.430
president wants the president,

612
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.760
and then I would get a picture in my mind of a president as a leader of a

613
00:37:25.761 --> 00:37:30.050
specific guy. It's, it was actually, it still flashes into my mind. It's,

614
00:37:30.051 --> 00:37:35.030
it's a picture of a, of a silhouette of a male presidential profile.

615
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.220
Like maybe the idea of a president basically.

616
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.270
So that was our president and then I had to figure out a United States then. So

617
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.560
eventually I come up with this map in my mind,

618
00:37:45.561 --> 00:37:47.780
this picture of the United States and then the line drawings.

619
00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.220
Now she's got this map,

620
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.440
she's got this silhouette of a guy and she said after hours,

621
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.380
president United States, president United States, and was like, oh my God,

622
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:59.570
she's still couldn't somehow bring together,

623
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:04.340
I didn't have the road that I had to travel in order to come up with.

624
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.830
Um, I think it was Clinton at the time. Yeah, it was Clinton at the time. No,

625
00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:11.450
as Jill starts to get better,

626
00:38:11.451 --> 00:38:16.280
this was after eight years of hard work and recovery and the words start to

627
00:38:16.281 --> 00:38:17.660
trickle back. And when they did,

628
00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:22.661
she says that silence that she loved so much got pushed out.

629
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.840
That was one of the sacrifices for me. That was one of the sacrifices.

630
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:33.590
<v 14>Wow. Oh Wow. We're doing a, we're doing a language show here at,</v>

631
00:38:33.591 --> 00:38:37.540
you're the Auntie Queen. Our language. So you're like saying mu needs it.

632
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.770
<v 18>No, no, no, no, no.</v>

633
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.780
But what I am saying is that in order for us to communicate with language,

634
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.240
we pull ourselves away from a different kind of experience.

635
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.330
I do believe that there are times when you need to let your,

636
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.550
your brain chat or be quiet.

637
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.880
<v 14>But is it fair to say this is a please agree or disagree with this?</v>

638
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:04.050
I think that words and language and grammar are necessary but not half as good

639
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:12.360
as wind in my hair as smelling my nose and that old right brain sensual

640
00:39:13.241 --> 00:39:14.080
immediacy.

641
00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.740
<v 18>Yeah. You know, if, um, if I had to choose,</v>

642
00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.690
which is essentially what you're saying, if I had to choose, um,

643
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.590
that would be really, really, really tough decision.

<v 11>I'm Jad Abumrad, Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,</v>

655
00:40:17.721 --> 00:40:21.280
our topic today where its power of words of language. Okay,

656
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:25.370
so Nicaragua 1970s that's where our next story starts. You with me?

657
00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.930
So imagine you're a kid that's deaf in Nicaragua at this time. Born deaf,

658
00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.610
are born deaf, born deaf.

659
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.910
You've always been deaf and you're the only one in your family that's deaf.

660
00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.240
So you're in this situation where everybody's talking, their mounts are moving,

661
00:40:38.241 --> 00:40:41.570
you can't hear it and you don't know sign language cause no one's taught you.

662
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.970
There was no deaf school in Nicaragua. There's nothing,

663
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.060
no deaf education of any kind. So if you were this kid,

664
00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.860
all you've really got are a couple of gestures, really crew gestures.

665
00:40:51.861 --> 00:40:55.550
You've worked out to talk to your family and friends. But beyond that,

666
00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:01.430
your cutoff, like Ildefonso the guy we met at the beginning of this show,

667
00:41:01.431 --> 00:41:04.670
except in Nicaragua in the 70s there were hundreds,

668
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.270
maybe thousands of these elder fans. Those really? Yeah,

669
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:15.010
but then everything changes in the late seventies hopes of who was the wife of

670
00:41:15.291 --> 00:41:18.860
the then dictator established a new school for special education.

671
00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.280
I think she had someone in her family who had a disability, not deafness,

672
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.030
but the school would include deaf people and that says psychology professor and

673
00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.710
Sing Hos was the first cause now instead of deaf kids scattered about,

674
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.863
they were together.

675
00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:34.010
<v 5>No,</v>

676
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.970
<v 11>in the same room, there were 50 deaf kids in that first center in class,</v>

677
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.100
preschool to sixth grade. The late seventies

678
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:41.690
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

679
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.470
<v 11>mean for most of them.</v>

680
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.160
This was the first time they'd ever met another deaf person before the world was

681
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:49.040
going on around them and everyone was all talking and they were cut off from

682
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:53.990
that and suddenly for the first time they were all there and they were what was

683
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:57.380
happening and they were what there was to talk about,

684
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.090
but they didn't have a way of talking.

685
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.410
These are 50 different kids who'd never learned a language and had 50 different

686
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:07.770
sets of like rudimentary gestures that they used to. Wow.

687
00:42:07.771 --> 00:42:08.950
That must have been, yeah,

688
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.700
like 50 people with 50 different ways to try and ask for breakfast or say they

689
00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:15.950
want to go outside. I mean nothing was shared.

690
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:18.380
It's not like the teachers were using sign in the classroom.

691
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.260
Everything in the classroom was Spanish, which none of them knew,

692
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:22.610
copying it into their notebooks.

693
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.280
A lot of it was going right over their heads who at the beginning things were

694
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:26.780
completely confusing,

695
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:30.530
but they're riding on the bus for an hour every day and they're playing out of

696
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:34.790
recess for an hour every day and they're getting together at the park and no one

697
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:38.600
knows how it happened. Like maybe one of the kids who was very charismatic,

698
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.430
he invented a sign for safe ball,

699
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.960
then told it to another kid who was very socially active and that second kid

700
00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:47.820
then spread the sign. However, it worked over time,

701
00:42:47.821 --> 00:42:52.821
the signs that these 50 kids used started to converge into a common system.

702
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.310
And when you step back from it all, what that means,

703
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.350
they created a language

704
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:04.470
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

705
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:08.550
<v 11>they, it's, they didn't just take it from somewhere else.</v>

706
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.350
They couldn't take it from somewhere else.

707
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.200
They created their own. But how unusual is that?

708
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.930
Like this has happened with languages all over the world,

709
00:43:18.931 --> 00:43:20.640
but not while people were watching.

710
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.520
And so you're saying this is the first time we've been able to watch a language

711
00:43:23.521 --> 00:43:24.710
being born? Yeah.

712
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.153
<v 3>Wow.</v>

713
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.900
<v 11>And for the last 20 years, that is what Anne has been doing.</v>

714
00:43:28.901 --> 00:43:31.060
She's been going to Nicaragua to that school

715
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.960
<v 3>and watching [inaudible].</v>

716
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.210
<v 11>So, um, oh, you want to describe that?</v>

717
00:43:37.211 --> 00:43:41.260
So I may have gotten recording of this, but when you arrive at the school,

718
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.940
but the buses come around,

719
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.530
the kids are all screaming and leaning out the windows and siding to each other

720
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:53.110
and the kids pile out and they line up in rows on the basketball court that's in

721
00:43:53.111 --> 00:43:57.640
the center of the school yard. And they all sing the national him

722
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:05.600
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

723
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.210
<v 11>and the deaf kids all sign the national him.</v>

724
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.910
They all have one hand over their heart and sign with the other hand while the

725
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:18.200
the hearing kids sing it and visited the school for the first time in 1990 about

726
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.830
10 years after it was formed.

727
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.540
She'd been working at the time with a linguist named Judy Kegel studying basic

728
00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.800
linguist type stuff. Right.

729
00:44:25.801 --> 00:44:29.280
Trying to figure out how the verbs work and whether they have agreement with

730
00:44:29.281 --> 00:44:33.600
their grammatical objects and along the way her and a collaborator jetty Pires

731
00:44:33.601 --> 00:44:38.601
stumbled into something really surprising about the power of certain words

732
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:45.000
though to set it up. When she got there the first time and to Nicaragua,

733
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.380
those original 50 kids who'd invented this thing had grown up already and there

734
00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:52.860
were these younger generations of kids coming in behind them,

735
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.110
growing up with the language, using it,

736
00:44:55.111 --> 00:45:00.111
inventing new signs and at a certain point she got curious to just compare the

737
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.400
original signers, the older kids to the younger kids. Yeah.

738
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.530
In terms of how they sign.

739
00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:10.810
So we show everyone this one minute cartoon about this guy who's trying to fly.

740
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.560
He sees a bird flying and he puts all these feathers on his body and clubs up to

741
00:45:16.561 --> 00:45:20.690
the top of a mountain, flaps his arm and jumps out

742
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:23.900
<v 7>and fresh is on the ground.</v>

743
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:28.800
<v 11>So she showed deaf kids of different generations, this cartoon,</v>

744
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:32.190
and asked them pretty simply to describe what they saw.

745
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.940
Just describe it and sign described the whole story, the differences.

746
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.350
We're striking first of all. So I'll just show you an example of each.

747
00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:41.820
Your own vaping a movie here.

748
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.470
<v 20>So this is a first cohort signer talking about.</v>

749
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.660
She got her laptop and showed me some video.

750
00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:51.690
First of this woman air her forties with dark hair and a colorful t-shirt.

751
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:55.780
She was one of the original signers. And when you see older signers like her,

752
00:45:56.410 --> 00:46:00.550
describe this guy who's trying to fly. It's really spastic.

753
00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.390
It's almost like they become the cartoon and she's flapping her hands

754
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.430
essentially. So moving all around,

755
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.540
<v 11>a lot of full body movements.</v>

756
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.150
She's talking about someone who's moving in a crazy way.

757
00:46:11.151 --> 00:46:12.860
She's going to be moving in a crazy way.

758
00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.620
And then she showed me a young kid who was about eight the backwards cat

759
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:18.803
Sylvester,

760
00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.030
and now he talks about the manner when he described the man jumping and then

761
00:46:23.031 --> 00:46:24.920
falling. It was all in the wrist.

762
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:28.940
All the movement is now in the hand and it's a very stylish,

763
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:31.730
you know, they're trimming these signs down.

764
00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.720
But more to the point there was one thing she noticed that was really

765
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.120
unexpected, had nothing to do with movement,

766
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.570
<v 20>couldn't help noticing that they, that people,</v>

767
00:46:41.571 --> 00:46:45.530
different people in the community talked about different things in this story.

768
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:51.080
<v 11>The older signers tended to describe all the events in this story and only the</v>

769
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:54.420
events and the younger kids,

770
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.800
they would talk about the guy's feelings that this guy was trying to fly,

771
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:02.820
wanted to fly, but failed the kid. She says,

772
00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:06.930
just seem to be better at thinking about thinking,

773
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.160
thinking like other people's thinking. So Anne and Jenny decided,

774
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.910
let's take all the different generations of deaf kids, 40 year olds,

775
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.430
30 year olds, 20 year olds, 10 year olds.

776
00:47:17.431 --> 00:47:20.010
Let me test them on how well they can think about thinking.

777
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:24.150
So what they did was they showed everybody a comic strip different from before.

778
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.770
This one was about two brothers.

779
00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:29.890
There was a big brother who was playing with the train and then little brother

780
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.590
is like wanting to play with the training and the big brothers playing with the

781
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:33.070
train.

782
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:36.550
And then the big brother puts it under the bed and goes into the kitchen to eat

783
00:47:36.551 --> 00:47:39.450
a sandwich mean maybe before he goes. He looks at the little brother and says,

784
00:47:39.451 --> 00:47:43.650
Hey, don't touch my train, don't touch it. And then little brother,

785
00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.150
while the big brothers out of the room takes the train out and hides it in the

786
00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.630
toy box. And then the big brother comes back and the question is,

787
00:47:51.631 --> 00:47:54.670
where's the big brother going to go to find this train?

788
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:59.350
Is he going to look under the bed or is he going to look in the toy box? Wow.

789
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:02.320
He's gonna look under the bed. Yup. Because as far as he knows,

790
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:04.690
that's where he left it. Yeah. He didn't see it moves.

791
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.220
And if you ask kids over the age of five,

792
00:48:06.221 --> 00:48:08.860
most of them would say he's going to look under the bed because that's where he

793
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:12.220
left it and he doesn't know that it's been moved to the toy box.

794
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.790
But here's the thing. When she asked the older signers, they would say,

795
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.050
oh look in the toy box. Really they would pick the wrong one. These are Pete,

796
00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:24.310
35 year olds. 35 year olds would get this wrong. They would fail this task.

797
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:26.590
Yeah, seven out of eight she says,

798
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:32.110
and then all of the younger signers that we worked with past at this point,

799
00:48:32.111 --> 00:48:35.350
she's just confused like why would this be,

800
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.310
why can't the older people pass the simple test, you know,

801
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.040
that involves thinking about someone else's thinking, what's going on here.

802
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.550
And then in a career tour you might have something to do with certain words

803
00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:47.590
because the older signers,

804
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.570
they don't really have that many words for the concept of thinking.

805
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:56.890
I mean they have mainly just one side pointing at your forehead. Yeah.

806
00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.320
Basically you just point at your forehead with your index finger.

807
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.330
By the time you get to the younger kids,

808
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.360
they've got tons of words for thinking things like,

809
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.690
I know something and I know that you don't know it. I know something.

810
00:49:07.691 --> 00:49:12.460
And I know you do know it. They've got assigned for understand, believe,

811
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:13.690
remember,

812
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.310
forget how many roughly where they're 10 or 12 wow.

813
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:22.660
So from 30 years we go from just a couple to from like knowing and not knowing.

814
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.500
Right? 12 and somehow that makes all the difference.

815
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:29.530
She says the more of these think words you've got,

816
00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:34.930
the more you can think. Am I right to say that you're tiptoeing toward that,

817
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.720
but you maybe you don't want to go there all the way. I'm trying to think that,

818
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:42.190
I guess I don't think it's so simple that you could just go in and say, Hey,

819
00:49:42.191 --> 00:49:45.730
I'm going to teach you 10 signs today and now suddenly you're gonna have better

820
00:49:45.731 --> 00:49:47.170
cognitive capacity.

821
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:52.230
But you are saying though that the verb think [inaudible] is somehow implicated

822
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.720
in my ability to think about your thinking. Right?

823
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:00.320
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

824
00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.850
<v 12>thinking about thinking,</v>

825
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.140
understanding how other people understand.

826
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:11.040
That's something that having language makes you better at.

827
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.570
There are certain words she says that don't just give you a name for something.

828
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.840
Somehow they give you access to a concept that would otherwise be really hard to

829
00:50:22.291 --> 00:50:24.780
get or even talk about.

830
00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:28.810
It's really hard to talk about thoughts without the word thoughts

831
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:34.970
are what is time without the word time. It's a really freaking hard concept.

832
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.340
These words are like bridges.

833
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:43.540
Somehow they get you to some new mental place that otherwise you'd be cut off

834
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:47.360
from. But that's sad though. I mean these young kids have something that,

835
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:51.500
that people who actually invented the language double, but

836
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.180
<v 11>you went back two years later,</v>

837
00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:00.760
tested the same people and then suddenly some of them were performing a lot

838
00:51:00.761 --> 00:51:03.820
better than they had the two years before on the same kinds of tasks.

839
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.400
Do you mean the older signers? Yeah,

840
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.860
they were passing suddenly some of them were passing. Yeah.

841
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.910
What happened? What happened in the past two years? Yeah.

842
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:18.360
Those younger kids grew up and started hanging out at the deficits association.

843
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.940
Wait, what? So what had happened in the meeting.

844
00:51:21.941 --> 00:51:23.560
So here's the strange twist of the whole thing.

845
00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:27.100
The Deaf Association is this place where the older signers would hang out. Yeah.

846
00:51:27.101 --> 00:51:30.340
It's a social club. So they played chess, do whatever. Well,

847
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.310
it has certain point. These youngsters start showing up, you know,

848
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.150
cause they've graduated and they want to hang out at the deficits association

849
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:40.060
too. But they bring with them all of their new mental verbs.

850
00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.690
You know all these words for thinking. They start using it with the older kids.

851
00:51:43.691 --> 00:51:48.580
The older kids pick it up. Suddenly these older kids are now passing the test.

852
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:53.590
So there was learning that took place in adulthood that actually gives them new

853
00:51:53.831 --> 00:51:58.270
insight into other people's thinking and motivation and now they can pass these

854
00:51:58.271 --> 00:52:02.800
tasks. That super. That's the story. It's really cool.

855
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.353
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

856
00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:18.240
<v 11>and [inaudible] is an associate professor of psychology at Barnard College in</v>

857
00:52:18.241 --> 00:52:22.990
New York. The thing, of course you want it, you wonder,

858
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.490
it is a, once you've gotten these, this new facility in you,

859
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.500
there's a lot of literature about this.

860
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:32.190
My fear lady is about this [inaudible] about this. Yeah.

861
00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:37.191
It's about a woman who learns a proper English and she can no longer be a flower

862
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:39.640
girl and come in and garden. She's not really, yeah,

863
00:52:39.641 --> 00:52:41.410
I guess it is kind of like this. You want like,

864
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:44.740
remember that our program began with the story of Ildefonso, right?

865
00:52:44.741 --> 00:52:45.574
Which we heard from

866
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.410
Susan Scholler Ildefonso who is the guy who for 27 years had no language at all.

867
00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.550
So you kind of wonder,

868
00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:56.400
I can tell you that like what happened to Ildefonso once he got language, right.

869
00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:59.860
And after that first breakthrough where elephants will realize things have named

870
00:52:59.861 --> 00:53:03.370
Susan ended up leaving for a few years. It was a,

871
00:53:03.371 --> 00:53:06.520
about four years, I think, four or five.

872
00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:10.390
Then she decided to write a book about him. And so I, um,

873
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:14.770
I went and found him again and he had language and I could ask him all kinds of

874
00:53:14.771 --> 00:53:15.430
questions.

875
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:18.490
Were you able then to sit down with him and ask him about his life and to really

876
00:53:18.491 --> 00:53:22.670
get the sort of his biography somewhat, somewhat one, um,

877
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:26.010
area that everyone wants to know his, what

878
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.240
<v 0>was it like to be languaged list? You know what was going on in his head? Yeah.</v>

879
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:32.190
And I asked, when I asked, when I asked,

880
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:37.040
and he starts telling me that was the dark time in his life, learning languages.

881
00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.310
It's like the lights went on.

882
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:42.360
And I tell him what we know about language when we want to know what it's like

883
00:53:42.361 --> 00:53:44.670
not to have language and he doesn't want to talk about it.

884
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.091
<v 14>But there was a day,</v>

885
00:53:46.091 --> 00:53:49.870
she says when she was writing the book and she met Ildefonso in a restaurant and

886
00:53:49.871 --> 00:53:52.960
there he was sitting with his brother, Mario, who she never met before.

887
00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:58.260
And she quickly learned that Mario also was deaf and that language lists Billy.

888
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:01.450
So I was shocked and because I was so amazed going,

889
00:54:01.451 --> 00:54:06.200
I can't believe you have a language that's brother. That's when I'm,

890
00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:11.110
when elder finds the son, well let, let me introduce you to some of my friends.

891
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:15.760
So they get in a car and they drive for awhile. We stop at this apartment.

892
00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:17.940
We were walking to this small little room

893
00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.760
<v 0>and there were these six Mexican men doing this mine routine.</v>

894
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:27.620
Wait. All of these guys were like Ildefonso used to be, they had no language.

895
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.130
We we're all born deaf and they didn't know that they were deaf and what were

896
00:54:31.131 --> 00:54:34.250
they doing? One man would stand up and he was starting miming.

897
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:36.470
He would just start acting out a bull fight.

898
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:43.670
So He'd be the bull and he'd be charging and then you'd be the matador and then

899
00:54:43.671 --> 00:54:48.050
he'd be somebody in the crowd watching. And then he would add a detail.

900
00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.670
For example, a house

901
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.790
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

902
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:55.180
<v 0>and they'd swap. So then another guy would get up to take over the story.</v>

903
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:59.290
Then they'd start miming, maybe Mac the matador, describe the hat.

904
00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.900
But now the second storyteller would add a new detail,

905
00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:06.150
like another person with a pair of glasses or something.

906
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:10.220
<v 14>So each one would stand up, take the bull,</v>

907
00:55:10.221 --> 00:55:13.760
fight the same bull fight to a different point and add a detail.

908
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.470
<v 0>Exactly, exactly. Oh my God. In other words,</v>

909
00:55:16.471 --> 00:55:19.230
I would take him maybe 45 minutes to say,

910
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:24.330
do you remember the time when we were out the bullfight and this woman did such

911
00:55:24.331 --> 00:55:26.790
and such? It was like drawing a picture.

912
00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:30.530
<v 14>Well, let me ask you a a pull it all together. Question.</v>

913
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.480
I was about to think that what a language is is a great connector.

914
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:38.000
But this last story makes me wonder,

915
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:43.300
these are five men really sharing and connecting on details.

916
00:55:44.451 --> 00:55:48.710
So is the difference that language makes just efficiency or does it effect your

917
00:55:48.711 --> 00:55:53.360
heart or your whole body of I can't tell. I'm not sure anymore.

918
00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.900
Well, I'll, I'll give you Ildefonso the answer, which

919
00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.260
<v 0>when I saw him, um, a couple of years later after this incident,</v>

920
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:05.190
I asked him about his friends and he said he couldn't talk to them anymore.

921
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:09.630
He wasn't willing to go through that tedious effort of all the miming anymore.

922
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.480
But the interesting thing that he said was,

923
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:14.520
he can't even think that way anymore.

924
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:19.020
He said he can't think the way he used to think.

925
00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:22.880
And when I pushed him to ask about what it was like to be languaged lists,

926
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:24.250
the closest

927
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:28.000
<v 5>he ever came to any kind of an answer was exactly that. I don't know.</v>

928
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:28.900
I don't remember.

929
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.730
I think differently now.

930
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:45.763
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

931
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:51.320
<v 8>Susan Sharla is author of the book a Man without words.</v>
