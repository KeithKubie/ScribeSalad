In addition to the lessons, this course features a collection of assignments

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.860
meant to give you an opportunity to explore material not directly covered in

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.580
the lessons. These topics include architectural styles, design patterns, and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
middleware. There are also two exercises, one on OCL and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.630
one on state charts, intended to allow you to try these technologies for

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.680
yourself. Finally, there's an opportunity to see how design is done in fields

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.580
other than software in order to better appreciate how universal design is.
