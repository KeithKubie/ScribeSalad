00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.470
At PRECISELY 8:53 pm Pacific Standard Time
on July 4, 2016, Happy Independence Day, NASA

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.690
piloted the Juno spacecraft into Jupiter’s
orbit after traveling 1.7 billion miles over

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.500
the last 5 years!

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.920
And boy are it’s arms tired.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.149
Hi there, Jules here for DNews and we have
an awesome update for you: There is now a

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.230
spacecraft orbiting Jupiter!

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.999
Juno was launched from Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station by an Atlas 5 rocket on August

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:38.379
5, 2011 and sent on its way to answer one
very basic question: How did Jupiter form?

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.359
This question holds a LOT of promise and its
answer could even help explain the finer details

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.690
about how the Earth came to be and how life
took hold.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.719
But more on that later.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.909
So, we wanted to get Juno to Jupiter, but
at the time of launch, no rocket ship had

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.999
nearly enough force to send anything 365 million
miles, which is the shortest possible distance

00:00:57.999 --> 00:00:59.739
between Earth and Jupiter.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.750
To solve this problem, instead of using a
super powerful rocket that we didn’t have,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.540
mission scientists at NASA used… well, the
Earth.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.800
2 years after it was launched, Juno came BACK
to Earth on an elongated orbit around the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800
sun.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.500
When it came within reach of our planet again,
the spacecraft used Earth’s gravity to carry

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.119
out a “gravitational slingshot” maneuver.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.869
Yea, the Earth literally slingshotted Juno
toward Jupiter, and gave it a speed boost

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.850
of more than 8,800 miles per hour.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.430
And it has been picking up speed.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.390
Over the last few weeks Juno’s has hit 165,000
mph relative to Earth, making it the single

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.280
fastest human-made object ever.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.300
But to be fair, that’s kind of cheating,
because all that speed is thanks to Jupiter’s

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.610
overwhelming gravitational pull, which is
about 2 and a half times Earth's’ gravity.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.390
But with great speed comes great responsibility.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.369
Going that fast is nice right up until you
have to slow down.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.049
At that speed, Juno would’ve completely
missed Jupiter and that would’ve been a

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.590
huge bummer.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.729
So to get it down to orbital speed, there
needed to be a super powerful rocket burn

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.610
to slow the spacecraft down.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.480
Fortunately, the orbital burn went perfectly
and Juno is now in its new, highly radioactive

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.480
home.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.920
Emphasis on highly radioactive.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.130
Jupiter’s orbit is one of the harshest place
a spacecraft can be in the entire solar system.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.800
On Earth, we’re exposed to roughly 1/3rd
of a rad of radiation.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.280
Over the course of Juno’s primary mission
of 20 months, the craft will be exposed to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.510
20 MILLION rad -- and while that probably
won’t turn Juno into a member of the Fantastic

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.330
Four, it does create a serious hazard for
the sensitive onboard electronics.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.520
To be honest, there are a lot of unknowns,
and a lot of things that can go very very

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.520
wrong.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.350
No mission has ever come this close to study
the gas giant, the 1997 Galileo spacecraft

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.220
was the first to orbit Jupiter, but Juno will
get to monitor it even closer, coming within

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.160
3,100 miles of the planet’s cloud tops during
its 14-day orbit.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.170
But even tho it’s already there, Juno’s
mission will officially start in October 2016

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.350
when it will give Jupiter a full diagnostic
to figure out what’s going on beneath those

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.010
toxic space clouds.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.810
It will study Jupiter’s magnetic and gravitational
fields to understand how the gas giant generates

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.690
its hugely powerful magnetosphere and understand
what the planet’s core is made of, because

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.370
we pretty much have no idea.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.380
Juno will also set out to examine the distribution
of water in the atmosphere in the hope of

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.360
perhaps, piecing together the role water may
have played in the formation of Jupiter.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.350
And this is the core of Juno’s exploration:
to reveal how Jupiter and, by extension, other

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.560
planets like Earth, formed.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.390
By studying Jupiter’s atmosphere we can
gain more clues about how life could’ve

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.110
flourished early in the solar system’s history.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.860
Juno could give us an unprecedented look at
the past, and might finally solve some of

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.150
universe’s greatest mysteries.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.460
Juno isn't the only recent space news.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.370
We also found gravitational waves...AGAIN!

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:10.230
