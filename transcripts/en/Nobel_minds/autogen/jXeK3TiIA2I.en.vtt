00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000
think that he was likely to be the
 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.759

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269
school children in a way that people
 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.390
school children in a way that people

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890
being in New York is that he's a
 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.590
