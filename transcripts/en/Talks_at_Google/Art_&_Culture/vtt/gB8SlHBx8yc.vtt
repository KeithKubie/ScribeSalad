[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:08.210
CHRISTIAN AWE: My
name is Christian Awe.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.370
SHINGO FRANCIS: And
I am Shingo Francis.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.430
CHRISTIAN AWE: And we have this
beautiful show at the Sezon

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.800
Museum, and we
brought some images.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.880
It's great located, and the show
is called "Layers of Nature--

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.645
Beyond the Line".

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.630
It's at the Sezon
Museum of Modern Art,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.430
and it really brings
people together.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.310
I am an abstract painter.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.270
Born and raised in
Berlin, Germany.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.360
Just arrived this morning a
few hours ago straight here.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.964
Gladly I made it
before the typhoon.

00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:47.570
Here are a few
images of my work.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.640
It's very colorful and
energetic and dynamic.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.137
I paint in different layers.

00:00:55.137 --> 00:00:56.720
And the beautiful
thing about the show

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.136
is that it brings
people together.

00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:01.790
In this case, it's my
work in combination

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.710
with the work of Sam
Francis, Shingo's father.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.810
And the beauty of it
is that one is painted

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.390
in 1958, the other one in 2017.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.230
So there's a big resemblance.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.020
And here you can see
one of Shingo's works.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.040
Maybe you want to say
something about it.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.940
SHINGO FRANCIS: OK, so
there's the three of us

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.380
here in this one picture,
Christian on the left.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.690
On the right is my father.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.909
It's Sam Francis.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.450
Just a little brief
thing about him--

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840
he's an abstract expressionist.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.660
He was in Paris
in the '50s, kind

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.570
of part of what they called
the Informel School in Paris

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.730
with artists like Tapies.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.260
And in Japan, I don't know if
some people know Hisao Domoto?

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.440
So he was part of that group.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.600
And then at the same time
since he was American

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.590
and he had connections
in New York,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.490
he was also friendly with
the abstract expressionists

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.889
in New York in the '50s.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:16.070
And that's how he kind of got
his name as a, quote, unquote,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.230
abstract expressionist.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.180
So this is one of his
works in the '60s.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.370
And then this
round thing you see

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.430
here is a large drawing that's
suspended from the ceiling.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.600
And it's a type of drawing
where you could walk into it.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.270
So it's an installation as
well, so you're enveloped

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.510
by this painting, drawing.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.980
And there's a line,
as you can see,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.230
at the middle of the
drawing, and that line

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.230
has reference to--

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.370
it could be like the horizon
and about perception,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.780
about how things from a distance
look very thin and far away,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.930
and then as you get closer
it starts to expand.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.750
And then the circle
represents time.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.900
So we're kind of in
this cyclical time frame

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.750
where we live 24 hours a
day, seven days a week,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.960
30 days a month, and then
years, and then seasons.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.562
So we're basically
kind of in this cycle.

00:03:24.562 --> 00:03:25.770
That's how we live our lives.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.402
So that's what that references.

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:28.860
CHRISTIAN AWE: And
it's quite huge.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.200
It's 90 meters.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.580
And the whole show is pretty
much based on works on paper

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:44.510
and about bringing, basically,
people together and having

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.890
kind of a show or face
off with one another.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.320
And here's a beautiful
example of how you

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.592
reacted to your father's work.

00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:54.800
SHINGO FRANCIS: Yeah, part
of the concept of the show

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.200
was also for Christian
and myself to do--

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.590
since my father's historical
and that's in their collection

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.400
and we're two living
semi young now--

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.605
we used to say young artist.

00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:11.970
Now we saw we're
midcareer artists--

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.589
and so to have a response to
a painting in the collection.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.370
So I chose this large painting.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.930
Mine is on the left side and
my father's on the right side.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.260
And the one on the
right is from 1978.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.350
It's a period of his work
that's a great painting.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.260
And for me as I
was growing up, I

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.720
watched him paint these
very large paintings.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.840
And he had a very
large studio, and he

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.350
would paint these on the floor.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.720
So it was just very interesting
for me to work with a painting

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.150
when I was growing
up and watching--

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.310
I don't know if I exactly saw
this particular painting be

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.220
painted, but he was doing
those kind of works.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.950
And also he could really paint
in large scale and small scale.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.890
And I think like
Christian too, he

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.990
could paint really
large and really small,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.110
but it's not so easy to
do to go between scales.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.400
And so I wanted to challenge
myself and do something

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.110
that was a large scale.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.950
And also this space
really provided

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.840
for doing such a project.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.840
CHRISTIAN AWE: Here you
can see some other work.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.300
On the right side your
father's work from,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.680
what is that, the '60s or '70s?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.550
SHINGO FRANCIS: Oh no,
that's from the '80s.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.160
So that's like '82, '83.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.990
And so this is a very
overall painting of his,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.940
and then this middle
red one is mine.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.800
And I'll talk about
that series later.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.420
CHRISTIAN AWE: So we were asked
to do something site specific,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:55.100
and the first idea was that
I create a wall painting.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.380
And the museum
asked me to do so.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.240
I said, great, when can I come?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.090
And they said, well, three
days prior to the opening.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.070
I said, wow, I can't do that.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.390
I need much more time.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.920
They said, OK, then one week.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.700
I said, I can't do that.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.940
So I had to come
up with a concept,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.970
and basically I painted on
[INAUDIBLE] on pieces of paper

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:24.440
that are like 10 meters long
and in total 12 meter wide,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.770
like kind of an abstract
waterfall because the Sezon

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.660
Museum is based on the seasons,
the four seasons, and all

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.900
about nature.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:44.530
So here you can see me working
at the museum installing it,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.060
bringing it all there.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.130
It's always a big challenge
to think of something

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.170
and go to a foreign
country and think,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.520
is this going to work out?

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.380
How does it going to work out?

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.790
How can I actually do this?

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.110
This is how it turned out.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.210
It was a pretty nice
process because the museum

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.045
is one of the most
important ones in Japan

00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:13.710
and has this great collection
of artists like Rothko and--

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.750
SHINGO FRANCIS:
Pollock and Kandinsky.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.000
CHRISTIAN AWE: --and everyone.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.725
And so everything is
very well preserved,

00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:20.600
and then comes this
young artist from Germany

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.454
and starts ripping stuff apart.

00:07:22.454 --> 00:07:24.370
And they're like, oh my
god, what is he doing?

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.480
Is he destroying things?

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.870
So here you can see that
I actually really ripped

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.980
things and then took some
stones from the water

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.520
and put it underneath and
then made it in layers

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.995
as if it would actually be
like an abstract waterfall.

00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:45.670
And the piece is called
"Seazon", like sea and zone.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.837
And it's a resemblance
of that nature.

00:07:47.837 --> 00:07:49.670
SHINGO FRANCIS: And
then nearby also there's

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:56.000
a waterfall called [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.160
It's a thousand
waterfalls or something.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.341
And you got a picture
of that and seeing

00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:02.840
that there was a
wonderful waterfall

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.750
right near the museum,
and it's the same water

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.060
that runs through
the museum grounds.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.790
CHRISTIAN AWE: Yeah,
it's always about where's

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.967
inspiration coming from?

00:08:11.967 --> 00:08:13.550
And here you can see
a little bit what

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.440
is actually in the collection.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.932
A Calder on the right,
Rothko in the middle, and--

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:20.140
SHINGO FRANCIS: Jasper Jones.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.310
CHRISTIAN AWE:
--Jasper Jones, yeah.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.630
Great collection--
Pollock, Rothko.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.120
Definitely worth to check out.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.610
But my mission is
not only to paint.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.650
It's also to act in space.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.460
So this is a painting I made
in 2012 across from the Stasi

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.940
headquarters, so the former
secret service of East Germany.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.210
And this painting is,
for me, about freedom.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.300
Blue is the color
of freedom and hope.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.490
And red in the
middle, yeah, energy.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.040
And it's actually
also on that street

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.050
where, in 1945, the Russian
army drove into Berlin

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.890
and fought Nazi Germany.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.590
And in that building still
a lot of the former workers

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:14.690
for the East German secret
service still work there,

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.570
and it was quite an
interesting project.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.420
And so I started.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.420
We had a lot of problem
of right-wing extremism

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.710
after the fall of the Berlin
Wall in that area, as I said.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.580
I noticed that everyone who
got engaged in art and culture

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.950
opened up their mind and
became a better human being.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.800
So I thought, well, how about
creating an outdoor museum

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.560
and painting pictures
in my district

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.260
and then all over the world
but actually also like

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.720
engaging the public in it?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.465
So I did not only
paint these pictures.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.080
First of all, the process
is quite interesting.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.170
This one is 500 square meters.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:03.520
So it was like as big as a
tennis court, 33 meters high.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.900
And then you can
see with a sketch.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.970
So I was painting it
right on that wall,

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:15.010
walking up and down 20 times
a day, 660 meters every day.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.800
So over a period of 12
weeks I climbed four times

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.770
Mount Everest, which
in that process,

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.190
forget about going to the
fitness center and the gym.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.120
Come and paint.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.980
I lost nine kilos
painting that painting.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.679
So here in that
black and white which

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:37.220
just looks like an
abstract painting,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.110
if you look closely down
on that left bottom,

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.185
that's me actually standing
in the scaffolding.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.360
Here you have that in color.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.734
They get like an image about
size, what that actually means.

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.650
SHINGO FRANCIS: You
didn't use any projectors?

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.483
CHRISTIAN AWE: No, I
didn't use a projector.

00:10:55.483 --> 00:10:59.230
First I though, how can
I actually draw this?

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.322
So I just made it freehand,
but you completely lose--

00:11:04.322 --> 00:11:06.280
you have no idea where
in the painting you are,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.490
what is happening 5,
10, 20 meters above you.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.530
So I looked at art
history and checked

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.180
out how did Michelangelo
paint the Sistine Chapel?

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.730
And he was also there
painting it in Rome.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.100
And the first draft he
made was also wrong,

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.100
and he had to demolish it.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.360
And he used a technique
where he first painted in

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.220
on a piece of paper and
punched it with a nail

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.840
the certain spots like where's
the head, where's the elbow,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.660
and then hold it up
against the ceiling

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:43.300
and use little pigments to
powder through these holes.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.980
And when he took the
paper away, then a lot

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.680
of transformation
points were there.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.480
So I did the same
process with a team,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.950
and we had the fun of counting.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.390
And it was 36,000
transformation points.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.010
So I love doing
these big projects,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.090
but what I love more is
engaging with the public.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.120
And over the 12 weeks I
had an open studio outside

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.270
on the street, and I invited
the public every Friday

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.550
for four hours to come
and paint with me.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.620
And I didn't know what
to expect back then,

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:22.180
but over the 12 weeks I had over
1,200 people joining workshops.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.100
So there it was
clear for me, wow,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.090
there is a real demand for
people that want to create,

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.500
that want to understand
what's going on.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.350
So that was kind
of a start for me

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.410
to do this more professionally.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.371
So then I started working
with different artists

00:12:38.371 --> 00:12:39.370
from all over the world.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.420
Here, a group from
Singapore, Social Creatives,

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.840
I invited painting
works together.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.320
And then I went elsewhere.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.520
Here did an artist in residence
in Princeton University

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.970
and had the surrounding
suburbs that are actually

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.260
pretty much run down.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.150
Princeton is very well off.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.350
The university is great.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.160
But what is happening around
it is like Trenton, Newark, New

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.890
Jersey, kind of rough.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.020
So I organized the bus
shuttle and invited

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.400
the kids who have never been
exposed to art and actually

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.910
education much and created
a program for them to come,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.010
first, to paint on
shoes and T-shirts

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.510
that they got for free
so they all would come.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.660
But then through that
you can teach them a lot.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.210
First you sneak in a little
bit Keith Haring and Basquiat

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.640
and then taught them
some other stuff.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.640
And that developed into
a very great project

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.880
where now this is still
ongoing and creating.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.090
Then I extended this.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:47.590
We have a big refugee crisis
in Europe, Africa, the Middle

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.140
East, and started to
bring people together

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.340
through art and culture.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.350
I say, let's paint together.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.790
There should be a
base of communication,

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.800
and what could be better than
cooking, doing sports, doing

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.240
music, or painting together?

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.240
So this is a group of young
refugees with German students

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.620
coming together.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.860
Here's some other
projects I picked.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.270
This is a series
of works in Germany

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.950
at a cultural center in Berlin.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:19.670
That was new.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.626
Actually nobody did come
because nobody knew.

00:14:21.626 --> 00:14:23.500
The building kind of
looked like a little bit

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.180
like a shopping center.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.790
And just after the paintings
were actually there,

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.840
people started coming.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.930
And it's a very lovely
space also for music.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.610
That is in Russia.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.300
We created a project
in Perm, which

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.680
is the most Eastern European
city in the Ural Mountains.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:49.120
And they're very well educated,
a lot of good-educated people.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.830
But they had a problem that
especially the young woman

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.470
went away to Moscow, St.
Petersburg, or abroad.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.710
And the government didn't
know what was happening.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.240
So I had been engaged in a
lot of community projects,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.340
and they brought me in
and they said, well,

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.224
you have to change something.

00:15:10.224 --> 00:15:11.890
You have to bring
culture into the city.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:17.720
It was an old weapon-industry
city, but culture was missing.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.720
So I said, let's
create outdoor murals

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.180
of international artists,
of local artists,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.090
and let's change
the whole situation.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:32.750
And what happened was that
we created over 600 bus stops

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.930
and really changed the
outlook of the city.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.730
And the background
you can see it's

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.606
kind of just cold and
not really inviting.

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:42.980
But then all of
a sudden the city

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:49.010
changed and was a big cultural
approach, and a lot of people

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.846
came in from all over.

00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:53.720
The best opera in the
world at the moment you

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.710
can find in Perm.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.110
Even "The New York
Times" wrote about it.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.510
It's a big hub.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.180
And now they have a
festival called The White

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.340
Knights of Perm, and
over a million people

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.020
participate every summer.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.560
That's a project I
made in Miami where

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.410
we changed the whole
neighborhood, Wynwood,

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.010
that was really rundown,
really like a ghetto--

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.740
just drugs, prostitution,
homelessness.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.080
Nobody at night
dared to go there.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.900
Even in the day it
was hard to go there.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.700
So with a collector friend
of mine, Tony Goldman,

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:33.380
we changed the neighborhood and
brought art into the streets.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.460
And the concept was he was
owning a bunch of warehouses,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.860
and we created the
biggest outdoor museum.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.200
And right now there's,
I would say, probably

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:50.120
over 400 paintings outside
for people to go somewhere.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.290
We created jobs.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.260
And there was a park, and in
the park a lot of paintings.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.810
And there's a
restaurant, actually

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.240
one of the best
restaurants that I created,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.280
and Shepard Fairey made the bar.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.339
So people could come and
actually go, and a lot of jobs

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.750
were created out of nowhere.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.810
You have now this cultural
hub, and that really

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.408
changed the neighborhood
and created a lot of jobs.

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:17.400
Here you have a project
just from the start,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.440
me painting a big piece.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.640
Actually somebody was owning
a big building in Berlin

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.619
and he wanted to have
an outdoor mural.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.530
But he wanted to
sell the building,

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.490
so he wanted to take the
piece along with him.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.300
And this is a little
bit the process.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.040
This is 12 by 30 meters.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.560
So I paint in different layers.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.030
That was over the
winter time, and then I

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.820
had to install it
at the building.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.560
And this piece is
called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.950
And [NON-ENGLISH] means,
in different West African

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.170
languages, a very warm welcome.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.710
I painted it 2014-15, just at
the beginning of the refugee

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.930
crisis, and just
wanted to send out

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.680
the message that,
yeah, people are

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.350
welcome from the cultural side.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.060
And I used this
to create prints.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.570
And with these
prints I just started

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.870
to build a school in West
Africa in Burkina Faso.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:23.850
And here's some images
from over there.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.880
The problem they had was that
the next school was over seven

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.820
kilometers away, very hot.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.340
You have been feeling it
lately how hot it can get,

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.640
but they are very often
around 40 and above.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.570
So walking seven kilometers
is just often not an option,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.800
especially as one of the
poorest countries in the world,

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.110
they have a high child-mortality
rate, around 10% still,

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.637
and a lot of young
women are not educated

00:18:51.637 --> 00:18:53.220
because they have
to go to the fields,

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.720
help out with the family.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.650
So I said, let's
change something.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.340
And of the proceeds
of this painting,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.260
I started with a group
of friends and my partner

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.570
to build a school.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.610
And the whole community helped.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.270
They were very anxious
to create something.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:21.270
And we did this, and the school
started in the last year.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.630
And it was planned
for 120 students,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.440
was so successful that we
now have over 300 students.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.650
And before they had about
a school rate of children

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.750
around 40% to 60%.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:39.360
Now 98% go to the
school, and we are very

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.040
looking forward to also
get to that 2% to go there.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.560
SHINGO FRANCIS: What was your
connection with Burkina Faso?

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.950
How did you get connected
to this community?

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.580
CHRISTIAN AWE: Well, let
me show you a little video.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.360
I've always been doing
projects all over the world,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.290
and my partner comes
from Burkina Faso.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:08.710
And here are some
images of the city.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.990
Then there's the school.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.450
Very lovely to see that
wherever you go in the country,

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:18.120
just before school people
start doing their homework.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:33.120
And we did the first
art lesson as well.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.700
There was never any art at
school, which was lovely.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.710
And we brought them 50 cameras.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.610
No one of them has
a smartphone yet.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.390
Nobody has a
picture of them yet.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:52.530
So we got them disposable
camera that we develop for them.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:57.040
Here you see what the
school looks like.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.810
It's very lovely to see
how people have the urge

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:05.900
also there to create and
to be educated and really

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:11.910
want this to happen and
to give them a chance.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:16.770
And it's so lovely to see
that through art and education

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.820
you can do something like this.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.810
Eri, as a little thank
you for the talk today,

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:27.710
I actually brought you
one of these drawings

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.125
that the students made.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.780
The initial plan was actually
not only to build a school.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.030
We wanted to build a hospital.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.470
But I said I don't know.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.970
What does medicine
mean in Africa?

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:54.110
How can I, as an artist from
Berlin, do a project like that?

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.030
Then I said, OK, a
school, I have been there.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.550
I know how that goes.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.940
And so I said OK.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.130
Now the school was
built successful.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.740
Now I'm actually thinking
of creating this hospital.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.830
And we started, we
built the first part.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.230
And this happens to
project like this.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.470
This is another painting I made
right next to the Holocaust

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.260
monument in Berlin.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.810
In the background you see
the Sony Center in Berlin.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.790
Actually on the right
there you have the image

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:30.770
which is supposed to be the
Mount Fuji of the Sony Center.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.950
And there you can
see me painting

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.650
looking like Spider-Man.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.970
And the piece
itself also consists

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:45.590
of blue, blue, the color of
the water of the Mediterranean,

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.870
of freedom.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:53.420
From the left comes like a kind
of a red-orange rising Phoenix.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:23:00.070
From the right side green, the
color of hope, and they meet.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.610
There happens an encounter.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.260
And these white
splashes are actually

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.850
the abstract escape
routes from Africa

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.600
and the Middle East into Europe.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.070
And with that I also
made a printing edition.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:16.880
That printed edition goes 100%
in building that hospital.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.410
Here, more projects I'm just
working on with Porsche.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.810
This is a draft which
I want to create right

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.010
after I come back from Japan.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.240
It's a new big Porsche
center in Hamburg.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.350
And there I'm going to
paint that on stickers

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.470
and actually then want to create
my first sculptures out of it.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.490
And all of this also
for the proceeds

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:44.340
of continuing giving back.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:49.040
I think this is very important
to use the knowledge,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.590
and that is what
I want to send out

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.750
is a message to give
back to community,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.250
inspire others, inspire you.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.965
I think Google is a
very great company.

00:23:59.965 --> 00:24:02.990
It has achieved
a lot, but I also

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.380
do feel that there is a big
creative crisis in the Silicon

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.860
Valley.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.920
I think there is a lot of
good stuff been created,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:16.340
but what has actually been done
to end hunger, to end poverty,

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.790
to end the water crisis?

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.150
I think there can be
done so much more,

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.500
and I hope you will contribute
to make the world a better

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.317
place.

00:24:25.317 --> 00:24:29.904
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:29.904 --> 00:24:32.320
SHINGO FRANCIS: My presentation
is more just about my work

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:40.694
and about where I
draw my work from.

00:24:40.694 --> 00:24:42.360
This is a painting
that I've been doing,

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.820
and it's a painting
that reflects.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.890
And what I've been
interested in lately is,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.590
well, in looking
at art and looking

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.220
at images, a lot of times we're
really looking at our screens.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:04.030
And whether it's through
websites on our computers

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.700
or looking at
Instagram, Facebook,

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:12.880
what have you on our
mobile phones and iPads

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:19.150
and what have you, at least in
the art world, a lot of times,

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.430
and also people I
know, we're looking

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:25.540
at images now distributed
through the screens

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.370
and through digital
media and everything.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.090
And I find myself
and I find others

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:35.320
talking about how we
look at art and that

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.450
through looking at
art through the screen

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.730
that we feel like
we saw the art.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.430
Like, oh, I saw this painting
or I saw this sculpture.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.000
And in a sense it's
replacing our experience

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.070
with actually seeing
the real object

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:53.990
because artworks are objects
that exist in space and time.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.840
And so I thought
about like, well,

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.990
what would be a painting
that is either really

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.690
difficult to photograph
or perhaps impossible

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.430
to photograph?

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.930
And of course you could
photograph anything,

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.950
but I wanted to make
a painting that was

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.030
really elusive in that sense.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.960
And so this painting
is painted purely

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:23.770
with a type of paint that comes
from mimicking a beetle's skin.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.680
And in Japan it's
the type of beetle

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:33.770
that they've been using to
make [JAPANESE] for kimonos

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.150
for a long time.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:39.880
So from one direction
it's one color,

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.400
and from another direction it
turns into a different color.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.640
So it's what they
call dichromatic.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.950
So they have these
dichromatic paints now,

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.580
and I've been using them
for my own paintings.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.490
But since I started
thinking about how can I

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:00.220
make an object that's really
elusive to photograph,

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:04.280
I just started purely painting
with this pigment, this paint.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.130
And so this painting
on the top part here,

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:13.450
it's kind of washed out, but
it's blue and it's green.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.000
So that's one color
when it's reflective.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.490
It's the primary color, what
I call the primary color.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.510
When it's reflecting
it's blue and green,

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.120
and then when it's
not reflecting

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.380
it's the contrast in
color which is yellow

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.810
and like violet or magenta
or pink or what have you.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.690
So it's the opposite color.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.630
So basically these
colors just change

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:39.040
depending on how the light
is reflected off the painting

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.140
and how the light
sits on the painting.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.270
So you really
can't experience it

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:48.070
just by taking a picture of
it because the picture is only

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:53.670
going to reflect the way
the light was at that time.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.880
CHRISTIAN AWE: I think
it's quite beautiful

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.620
that in this day and age
so many things are just--

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:11.860
you can reproduce them, but a
lot of values are disappearing.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.300
Everything is mass produced.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.330
But I think art you
have to see in person,

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.130
and it gives you something--

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:22.005
it gives you an experience, and
your paintings of this series

00:28:22.005 --> 00:28:26.650
is definitely something that
has a certain aura you can just

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.660
experience being there.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:34.450
And I think that is why art
will always stay valid and get

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.315
even more and more important.

00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:37.690
SHINGO FRANCIS:
Yeah, and I think

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:42.110
it's this thing about
virtual and real.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.050
Well, this kind
of painting forces

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:53.040
you to see the object
in person, basically.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.100
So yeah, our experiences are
getting very much tangled up

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.430
in-- and I kind of
brought this one first

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:04.650
because this is a tech
company and a lot of things

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:06.450
happen online.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.925
That is the platform.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.500
Yet at the same
time it's, I think,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.860
kind of negotiating
and navigating

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.390
what we experience in
space and time as opposed

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:28.950
to what we experience
online or what have you.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.610
And I think this is we're
in the new kind of era

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:38.370
of whether-- even with
commerce and what have you.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:44.730
So just my background, I
grew up both here in Japan

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.590
and also in the United States.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.750
And as a young child,
since my parents

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.880
were separated when
I was really young,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.390
I spent my life in both places.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:01.350
And kind of like my segue
into art was really poetry.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.470
And specifically this
is William Blake,

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:09.030
and he's an 18th-century
poet in England.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.410
And he combines
words and imagery.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:19.190
So he always has these
drawings that accompany--

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.830
or they can be illustrations
that accompany his poems.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:32.710
And so I was as a young, I
don't know, teenager or so,

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.590
I related to
reading these poems,

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.530
and I could understand
what it's saying

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.900
in relation to my own life.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:47.300
And that gave me the impetus
to say, oh, I can do this,

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.740
or I can relate to this and
I want to tell my own story.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.070
So I started by writing poetry.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.860
And I was painting,
but it really

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.030
wasn't something that I--

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.820
it was more something since
my father was a painter,

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.900
I got to get lessons
as a young child.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.500
And so that came in from
a different direction,

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.590
but really where I really
kind of attached myself to

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.720
at the beginning was poetry.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.370
And this is another example of
William Blake's illustrations

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:29.170
or drawings where this is
the souls getting sucked up

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:34.360
from hell, I think, and they're
going to purgatory or something

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.150
like that.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.470
So he's kind of
biblical, but I thought

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.300
they were really interesting.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.290
And I spent time in
Florence to learn

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:48.280
how to paint in the more
traditional, classical way,

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:55.870
and spent time there copying
various old master paintings.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.330
And then when I was in
Florence at the time--

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:05.980
this is Joan Mitchell.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:09.910
So I was able to meet with--

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.520
she was an abstract
expressionist painter as well,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.160
and she had a big
influence on me,

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.210
something like what
Christian says about life.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:27.030
And I bring her up because she
was really emphatic in saying

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.500
paint what you feel.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:35.890
Paint what it is that's inside
of you and bring it to life.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.240
And her paintings
are very expressive.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:46.810
They are emotional, I
think, very emotional.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:51.550
But I think it's a way to
express your emotional life.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:57.430
And I think there's also a real
freedom in painting this way

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:01.540
and making your own marks
and your own gestures.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.160
This is my kind of
early work where

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:13.140
I was painting these kind of
very semi gestural paintings.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.760
And then eventually I
started to kind of morph

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:25.230
into different things, and I
got interested in coming back

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:29.480
to Japan and Zen Buddhism.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.110
And that is something
I got interested in,

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.530
like what is Japanese culture?

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:43.020
What is kind of the soul
of Japan to say in a way?

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.600
And Zen being something that
ultimately came from China,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.360
but in Japan it
kind of very much

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:56.520
became a kind of
refined form of Buddhism

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.560
that has a lot to
do about space.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.380
So I spent time at a
Buddhist monastery,

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:10.275
and really it forced
me to kind of look

00:34:10.275 --> 00:34:14.024
into spending time
with your own self

00:34:14.024 --> 00:34:19.800
and sitting with your
emotions, your thoughts,

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.540
and learning how to create
your own space within.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.590
That's pretty abstract.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.820
That's kind of an
abstract way of--

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:33.230
it's hard to explain
in that sense.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:38.420
But I felt that, as far
as Japanese culture,

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.340
that it's a big part
of Japanese culture

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:46.060
is to understand
how space is used.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.909
And I think that's
really reflected

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:53.620
for now in contemporary
architecture and design

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.250
as well.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:03.840
And someone who kind of crossed
between the two cultures

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.680
that I was really influenced
by as well was Isamu Noguchi?

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.480
Anybody know of Isamu Noguchi?

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.930
So he was someone that spent a
lot of time in both cultures,

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:28.120
in the US and Japan, and learned
a very unique style of working

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.440
with a Japanese tradition
and the European tradition.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.960
And this is his
place in Shikoku.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.620
It's right outside of Takamatsu.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.790
And he had a working studio.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:47.420
And so if you ever get
a chance to go there,

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.770
I would recommend
going to this Noguchi

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.600
Foundation in Takamatsu.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.370
And it's just his
way, his sensibility

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:06.440
of bringing the Eastern and
Western aesthetics together.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.370
And then this is a
really interesting book,

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:13.140
"In Praise of
Shadows", by Tanizaki,

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:19.170
his philosophy about
space, light, shadow,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:25.380
and just kind of the simplicity
and the way light and shadow

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.520
evokes emotions
and sets the scene.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.520
So I'm just kind of running
through these things

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.936
since we don't
have too much time.

00:36:33.936 --> 00:36:41.190
And then on the other
hand this is James Turrell

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.500
and one of his sky windows.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.010
So growing up also
in California,

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.180
I was very attracted to the
space and light movement.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.770
And it's funny, he came to
Japan and got very influenced

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.760
by Japan and brought
that back to California,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.470
and then he
influenced California.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.220
So there's this kind
of real dialogue

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:06.690
going between Japan and the
West Coast of the United States.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.500
And this book, "The Art
of Light and Space",

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.660
really explains the
whole philosophy

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.150
behind the
light-and-space artists.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.430
And this is Robert Irwin.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:28.720
So it's this idea of
just taking perception

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.790
and how our perception
is altered really

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.750
affects the way we see
things and experience things.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.140
And this is an
artist Larry Bell.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.600
He made these glass
cubes, and they

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.340
have a certain coating on it.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:55.510
And this also, it's
really another object

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.100
you have to see in person where
it really changes depending

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.590
on how you're looking at it.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.140
This is an early work of mine.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:09.570
So again, looking at
how perception works,

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.610
there's a very faint
line at the bottom,

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.630
and I think it's really hard
to see it with this screen.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.460
Right here there's like
a very, very vague,

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.900
really hard-to-perceive line.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.730
One thing I think
is being confronted

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:34.230
with basically a
nonrepresentational image

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.030
of flatness or it
could be space,

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:42.150
but you're confronted
with, in essence, nothing.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:49.590
And it's also in reference to
for a long time paintings been

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:54.060
about making illusionistic space
like landscapes or the figure

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:58.200
or what have you, and
then modernism really

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:04.420
flattened out the plane,
meaning it brought everything

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.030
to the front.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.690
So this has reference
to that, kind

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.620
of really either flattening
out space or, in Japan,

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.090
looking at [JAPANESE]
or [JAPANESE],, the void,

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.570
and confronting the void.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:26.890
And that's kind of
a theme I've been

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:33.050
very interested in with
my work, and I'm just

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:37.700
really interested in
what people experience

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:47.210
when they're confronted with
very little, essentially.

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:53.480
So this is a show of what the
works look like an exhibition

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.044
setting.

00:39:54.044 --> 00:39:55.460
CHRISTIAN AWE:
Which was also very

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.990
nice to see at Sezon Museum
because we're actually

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:01.390
quite contrary.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:07.700
You're like calm in
some of your works

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.600
about emptiness,
nothingness, very reduced,

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.300
and I'm more about energy.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.279
And your father actually kind
of hold us together and--

00:40:17.279 --> 00:40:19.570
SHINGO FRANCIS: Well yeah,
that's the interesting part.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:21.575
CHRISTIAN AWE: --built
a beautiful bridge.

00:40:21.575 --> 00:40:22.450
SHINGO FRANCIS: Yeah.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.970
My father uses a lot
of white in his work,

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.700
but then there's a lot
of gestures and action

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.120
going on between the lines.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.380
Whereas Christian is
very alive and colorful

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.860
and a lot going on.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:55.130
So slowly these works
have certain compositions

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.830
that come into them, but
essentially most of the work

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:04.990
is you're looking at this very
either flat or deep space,

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.850
depending on how you look at it.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.485
And these are some
prints I've been doing.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:23.360
And this is as you go along.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.460
And then there's some color
that starts to come in.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.850
So more recently
I've been doing ones

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:34.740
where you're still getting
a majority of a very

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.570
flat and static space with
some gestures happening

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.620
at the top and the bottom.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:52.260
So that's really one of
my very interesting places

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.330
where I'm really interested
in is what people experience.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.170
What is it when you're
confronted with basically

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:02.580
nothing, but is it nothing?

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:07.440
Is there something
to project onto it?

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.510
How are you going
to respond to it?

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:10.990
What is your response?

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:16.500
And that is an inflation
shot of the works.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.240
And then there's
the body of work

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.375
that has to do with this
band, like you saw earlier.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.710
So this is one of the
large installations

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.250
like the one at Sezon.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.720
They could be enveloped.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:40.830
So these bands starting to be
about the band in the center

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:46.260
being a certain space,
and then on the outside

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.100
is another space.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:51.250
So for me it was more about
the internal and the external,

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:57.810
so the inside being broken into
another space that has more

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.680
to do with, on a
psychological level,

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.310
on the internal life
of an individual,

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:06.810
like what it is
that you're thinking

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.680
and what you're feeling,
and then our environment.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.330
What is happening
outside of ourselves?

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:18.130
What is going on in
our surroundings?

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:21.330
What events are happening-- so
things that may be happening

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:23.820
to us and how they affect us.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:28.240
And of course there's a
clear line between the two,

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.560
yet at the same time
I think they very much

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.790
affect each other.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.250
There's an affect that
happens between what

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.590
it is that we're
thinking and feeling

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:41.130
that gets projected outward and
then also things that happen

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:45.000
outside of our lives around
us and our environment

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.040
that affect our internal lives.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:53.457
So it's this play between the
internal and the external.

00:43:53.457 --> 00:43:54.540
I'll just keep it at that.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:58.736
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:00.860
CHRISTIAN AWE: Are there
any comments or questions?

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.710
AUDIENCE: Question?

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:02.501
CHRISTIAN AWE: Yes?

00:44:02.501 --> 00:44:04.705
AUDIENCE: How do you know
your artwork is complete

00:44:04.705 --> 00:44:05.830
and stop painting?

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.876
I am from engineering,
and as an engineer

00:44:08.876 --> 00:44:11.410
there is a concept
of overengineering.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:14.560
And we have priorities
and deadlines.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.130
All those force
me to stop working

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:23.500
on some file or software,
to [INAUDIBLE] I mean.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.444
This is good enough, so
move on to the next one.

00:44:26.444 --> 00:44:29.170
How do artists
decide when to stop?

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.160
CHRISTIAN AWE:
It's very difficult

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.630
for different artists.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.700
Friends of mine
used to say whenever

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:39.110
the transporter is coming,
the artwork is finished.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.450
For me personally,
it is a feeling.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:42.290
I know exactly.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.160
There are two approaches.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.100
One is that I completely just
create and experiment and just

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.320
go with the flow,
and then I know

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.840
how much I have to do until
something is finished.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.349
It just feels right.

00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:58.640
And when a painting is finished
for me, it is finished.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.112
But there are other artists
that always go back and say,

00:45:01.112 --> 00:45:02.070
I have to do something.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.080
I have to do something.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.020
There's a German
painter that is not

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.480
allowed to visit
a lot of museums

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.270
because his works are
in it and he can't stop.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:14.480
He goes to the works that
already belong to the museum

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.724
and has his brushes there.

00:45:15.724 --> 00:45:16.640
SHINGO FRANCIS: Oh no.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.210
Oh my God.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.390
CHRISTIAN AWE: He
goes there and says,

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:18.980
oh man, I have to
correct a little bit here

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.938
and a little bit there.

00:45:19.938 --> 00:45:21.230
It's very hard sometimes.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:30.800
SHINGO FRANCIS: Well, I've
learned to stop before--

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.330
it's easy for me to overpaint
something, to overly do it.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:40.070
And with painting it's kind
of hard because once you go,

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.230
you can't really
take it off, right?

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:45.710
And you can maybe go over
it with white or whatever

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:46.210
and try to--

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.085
CHRISTIAN AWE: It would
be great to have like

00:45:48.085 --> 00:45:49.530
a Photoshop go back button.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.570
SHINGO FRANCIS: Yeah, you could
go back in time or something.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:56.930
So I've learned over the
years that although maybe I

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.460
should keep going,
but I say, well,

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.410
I'll wait and wait until
tomorrow and look at it again.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:05.570
So it's kind of like
refreshing yourself

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:07.580
because it's easy to overdo it.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.670
That's my experience.

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:13.670
It's easy to say, oh man, I
liked it when it wasn't so--

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.320
because my work,
as you could see,

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.210
it's kind of like a
less-is-more kind of thing.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.350
And then you have a sense.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.810
It's like, OK.

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:25.720
Same with Christian.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:31.310
It's more of a kind of a feeling
that if I do too much of it,

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:36.130
it's going to just
lose what it has now.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.880
CHRISTIAN AWE: There
was another question?

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.463
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:38.463 --> 00:46:39.260
Thank you.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.100
I have a question
for both of you guys.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.130
So the first one will
be for Shingo-san.

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:46.032
And I'd love to
ask about, so when

00:46:46.032 --> 00:46:47.995
you talked about
the Sezon Museum,

00:46:47.995 --> 00:46:50.896
you say you painted after
your father's painting.

00:46:50.896 --> 00:46:54.501
And I wanted to ask if you
think about your identity

00:46:54.501 --> 00:46:58.670
and that's a reason why you
do it or why did you do that?

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.738
And then also for
Awe-san, I would

00:47:00.738 --> 00:47:03.203
like to ask about
when you started

00:47:03.203 --> 00:47:05.350
doing community art,
[INAUDIBLE] specific art,

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.780
did you always count
the idea of doing

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.710
that since before or all of
a sudden you kind of decided?

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.442
You were like, oh,
I want to do that?

00:47:12.442 --> 00:47:13.390
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.390
SHINGO FRANCIS: So
for the painting

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:17.100
I did in response
to my father, that

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.070
was a concept that
came from the museum.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:24.590
They asked us to choose a
painting from the collection.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:28.860
And as being a son of-- when
you're in the same line of work

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:34.020
as one of your parents,
it's like you go through--

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.750
and so in my 20s I really
went through this whole thing

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.390
like, oh God, I have to deal--

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:41.340
people always comparing
you and this and that.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.350
It used to bother me a lot.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:45.075
I thought about
changing my last name.

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:52.260
I went through this mini crisis,
like oh my God, am I ever

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.580
going to--

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.150
it's this whole
Oedipus kind of thing.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.890
Do I have to kill my
father or something?

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:01.290
Do I have to become more
famous than him or something?

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:02.623
You go through this whole thing.

00:48:02.623 --> 00:48:07.950
And so I've had an
experience where

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:13.900
I've kind of gone beyond
that and found how I work

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.460
and what kind of
approach I have.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:22.320
So when I got that
recommendation it was like,

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.690
oh yeah, I know
what I want to do.

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:30.505
So it was pretty natural,
whereas 15 years ago I

00:48:30.505 --> 00:48:32.130
think I would have
had a total identity

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:36.260
crisis, like oh my God.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:41.970
It would have been either
a competition in my mind

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:46.050
or I would have probably
refused, would have been

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:48.690
one or the other.

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:51.540
So it was a good
experience this time.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.960
CHRISTIAN AWE: For your question
about community project,

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.880
committee art, for
me being raised

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.080
in East Germany in a
socialistic system,

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:05.820
it was always very normal for
me to engage to do something

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.370
with others, for others.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:13.350
It was never really
only for my own pleasure

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.810
or for my own gain or wealth.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:20.310
So it was very normal, and
I feel especially whoever

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.410
can should give something back.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:28.050
And as an artist, we have
a voice, so why not use it?

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:36.800
And just treat people as
you want to be treated.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.580
Do something.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.230
Stand for something.

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:44.130
And I feel it's very
interesting also

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:48.870
how I feel that, for
example, Japan is opening up.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:51.870
Also with the
Olympics coming 2020,

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:54.330
how you portrayed
yourself at the soccer

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:56.940
championship cleaning up
the stadium afterwards,

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.740
leaving nice notes.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.230
This is something,
leading by example--

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:06.000
such a high-technology world
over here but then still

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.400
so Zen Buddhism and all
about nature and giving back.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.400
And in a way, I think
leading by example

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:20.009
and inspiring others
is what we have to do.

00:50:20.009 --> 00:50:22.050
And I actually really
liked how you said Awe-san.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.520
It was the first
time I heard that.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.080
SHINGO FRANCIS: Awe-san.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.726
We have to call you that now.

00:50:26.726 --> 00:50:28.025
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:29.775
And thank you so
much for sharing.

00:50:29.775 --> 00:50:31.980
It was truly, truly inspiring.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.260
And my question is,
especially in Japan,

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:39.880
we see different
forms and frameworks

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.260
of presenting and
sharing art emerging.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.361
For example, now there
is an ongoing digital art

00:50:46.361 --> 00:50:49.980
exhibition by teamLab,
or you go to Naoshima

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.450
and you experience art
pieces, installations

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:57.400
amidst the nature that let
them shine in a new light.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.970
So I was wondering
in your perception,

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:03.250
what is the next
phase in of actually

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:04.730
sharing the art with others?

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:08.160
What's coming?

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.620
CHRISTIAN AWE: I think it's
very important to break down

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.210
the barriers of art.

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:16.020
A lot of people would never
go to a museum or a gallery

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:20.800
or ask about buying
something if they feel

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.690
forced to engage in something.

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:28.170
I think it should be
much more normal to be

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.460
taught at in school.

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.230
That doesn't happen
everywhere in the world.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:35.700
It's all about mathematics,
physics, and so on,

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:40.500
but I actually feel
that these soft values,

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:46.680
you can learn best in writing
poems, engaging in sport,

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.810
in music.

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.930
What can we do in the
digitalized worlds

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:59.150
where very soon machines can
do much more things better

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.990
at a much faster space?

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:06.450
What is the value of us humans?

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:07.950
That is what we
have to filter out

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:10.170
and that is what
we have to learn

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:12.060
and being taught in school.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.835
And that is really the priority.

00:52:17.559 --> 00:52:18.850
SHINGO FRANCIS: What can I add?

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:23.820
Well, these different platforms
like teamLab doing their thing,

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:29.340
I mean, I think it's great
to have various ways to reach

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.650
people, various mediums to
reach people to experience art.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.440
And teamLab making their
work that's catered

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.330
to that platform.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:44.250
And there's a lot
of art now being

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:49.580
generated through digital
mediums and what have you.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:55.890
And I mean film when it first
came into being, moving images

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:58.410
with a completely new art form.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:00.750
And I think there's
always going to be

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:10.490
new art forms being created,
and it's how you experience it.

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.690
But I think it's important.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:17.460
There's barriers, this idea
about like art being exclusive

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:24.720
or art being for, oh, I have
to have an understanding of it,

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.975
that these notions kind
of get broken down.

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.490
And the definition of art
gets kind of tricky too.

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:37.680
Well, what is art
and what is not art?

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:43.470
But having the ability to
have access for museums--

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:46.710
well, the institutions
really need to step up,

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:52.950
and some have-- step
up and make it more

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:56.340
inviting so people
can understand

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.340
what it is that they're looking
at, what they're experiencing.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:01.890
So text is important
in that part.

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:07.440
And in education, it's
true, art gets cut.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.454
It's the first funding that gets
cut, and usually in education.

00:54:11.454 --> 00:54:13.620
CHRISTIAN AWE: Since we are
running out of time now,

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.540
let me maybe end up with this.

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:20.760
I believe that art is one of
the most important profession

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:25.680
in a society, whether
it's free or dictatorian.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:29.580
I feel like that every
big company and even

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:36.030
the politicians should have art
advisors and philosophers being

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:42.480
to re-evaluate what the culture
is-- where are we heading--

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.290
because artists are
among the most free,

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:51.649
and we are not
really like bound.

00:54:51.649 --> 00:54:53.190
We don't have to
think a certain way.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.210
We are free thinkers and
therefore leading a way

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.510
into the future.

00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:59.970
And that's why I
can just encourage

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:05.020
companies and politicians to
have advisors in that way,

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.687
into a better future.

00:55:06.687 --> 00:55:08.520
SHINGO FRANCIS: Well,
and the Greeks, right?

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:14.300
Poets and philosophers
were advising the council.

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:15.800
Well, thank you Eri.

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:19.150
[APPLAUSE]
