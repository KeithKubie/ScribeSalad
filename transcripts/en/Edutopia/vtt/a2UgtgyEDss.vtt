00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:09.466
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I think this
data helps demonstrate.

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:13.356
This student organized it from
greatest to least before he graphed it.

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:13.876
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That is interesting.

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:16.466
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This one is counting
by sixes, twelves, fives.

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.666
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Because our
teachers look at student work,

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.826
they really see what
students are thinking

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:25.566
and how they're expressing their
understand from the classroom,

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:27.416
and they're better able to guide

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:30.796
and facilitate a deeper
level of student learning.

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:33.976
&gt;&gt;Taryn: So it's two ways of them being
able to think about creating this graph.

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:46.996
&gt;&gt;Jeff: At Two Rivers, we really care
about our whole community as learners.

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:48.376
&gt;&gt;Taryn: So what did we do so far?

00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:51.886
&gt;&gt;Jeff: That includes not just
our students, but also our staff.

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:54.386
&gt;&gt;Jessica: The reason we
look at student work is

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.866
to help teachers become better teachers.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.996
Student work is the expression
of what kids are learning,

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:00.436
and so if you're thinking about,

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.906
how am I doing as a teacher,
there's your evidence.

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:05.316
&gt;&gt;Taryn: So when you guys get with
your partner, you're going to work

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.056
to create a, what type of graph?

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:07.916
&gt;&gt;Students: Bar graph.

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.166
&gt;&gt;Taryn: Bar graph.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:14.896
&gt;&gt;We just started doing bar graphs with
them last week, so it's relatively new.

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:17.866
&gt;&gt;Make sure your name is on it, please.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:21.626
&gt;&gt;The process of looking at
the work will really help me

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:25.376
as I'm planning the rest of
this sequence of lessons.

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:27.676
&gt;&gt;Jessica: One of the
most powerful things

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:30.236
that we do is the looking
at student work protocol.

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:33.786
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Taryn today brought
a set of student work.

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:37.706
The group of teachers and
I took a look at that work,

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:42.146
to give her some insights into,
what do her kids really understand

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:44.606
around this technical
skill of creating a graph?

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:47.516
&gt;&gt;Taryn: So the task that they had was,

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:49.966
Miss Cynthia is ordering
new shirts for next year.

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:54.816
&gt;&gt;The protocol starts where I
give a very short introduction

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:55.756
to what the work is.

00:01:56.336 --> 00:01:58.766
&gt;&gt;How can Miss Cynthia create
a graph to represent the data

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:01.046
about the different colored
shirts she ordered?

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:05.026
And what you'll see is, the chart
with the different colored shirts,

00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:06.926
and there's different numbers.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.436
So it was different shading.

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:12.646
&gt;&gt;The team looks at the work,
and they look at it silently,

00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:15.296
just thinking about how they
would respond to the task,

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.266
and then looking at how students did.

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:25.316
After that, there is about five
minutes where the presenter is silent

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:28.096
and you're just talking
about things you notice

00:02:28.186 --> 00:02:30.326
and things you wonder about the task.

00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:32.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I notice that there's
three different sets of numbers.

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:35.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I noticed that in one of
the sets, it's only two digit numbers.

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:38.276
I wonder which students
got which sets of numbers.

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:43.256
&gt;&gt;Jeff: After about five minutes,
we shift the protocol to comments,

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:47.326
where there is analysis, and we
can start to put our own judgments

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:49.866
into what we are seeing with the data.

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:53.446
&gt;&gt;I feel like what the
kids needed to grapple

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:58.086
with in this problem
was really around scale.

00:02:58.396 --> 00:02:59.946
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look at how
different they look,

00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:02.056
based on what the scale
that the chose was.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:06.526
&gt;&gt;Carolina: I feel like there's
this profound vulnerability

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:10.936
in being silent while your team
looks at the work that you're doing.

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:14.376
It removes you from the conversation,
so that you can really focus

00:03:14.376 --> 00:03:16.306
on what people are saying,
because you're listening.

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:19.936
&gt;&gt;Taryn: Following that,
there is a discussion.

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:23.126
&gt;&gt;I think what was happy for me
to hear was you guys noticed.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:26.946
What we wanted them to grapple
with was the scale on this one.

00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:29.366
&gt;&gt;That's the part where we
really talk about, okay, well,

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:31.506
what are the next steps
that students need?

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:33.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Thinking about this story,

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.906
if we look at Matthew's
and then someone else.

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:39.326
&gt;&gt;Taryn: It all of a sudden looks
like way more shirts were ordered.

00:03:39.326 --> 00:03:39.996
&gt;&gt;Jeff: It does.

00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:42.086
&gt;&gt;Carolina: I think you're
designing a graph

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:45.346
to tell a story of something, you know.

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:47.206
Scale matters, right?

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:52.016
&gt;&gt;Taryn: I feel like I get concrete
feedback and concrete steps to take.

00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:53.806
&gt;&gt;I like the idea that you guys said.

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:57.206
What is the story, like what do
we want people to think about it?

00:03:57.436 --> 00:04:00.766
&gt;&gt;So I really like the idea
of graphing telling a story.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:03.196
&gt;&gt;What else could that
graph be telling me?

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:04.996
&gt;&gt;So I think that's going
to be our focus.

00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:08.626
&gt;&gt;Has anyone ever thought
about stories in math before?

00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:10.836
I don't know if you're
going to believe me,

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:14.736
but the bar graphs you
create tell a story.

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:17.506
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Getting feedback
is daunting at first,

00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:20.226
but after people experience
it, they relish it.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:22.606
&gt;&gt;Student: This is how
much people like yellow.

00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:25.386
This is how much people like green.

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:27.506
&gt;&gt;Taryn: The same way students
get ideas from each other,

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:29.726
I get a lot of ideas from my colleagues.

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.856
I absolutely love it and I need it.
