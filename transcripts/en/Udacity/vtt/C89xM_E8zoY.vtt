00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.380
Before you go into the room with
your user, you'll want to figure out

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.040
exactly how you want to record
data from your interaction.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.720
Generally speaking,
you have three options.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.970
You can take notes directly,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.560
which is the easiest to get users to
agree to, and does a really good job of

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.240
allowing you to pull out the things that
sound important to you in the moment.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.502
Writing notes also means that you
don't need to take time later on to

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:23.173
sift through the feedback again.

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:26.935
You can also ask for permission to
record the audio of the conversation.

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:29.953
In the next video, we'll introduce
you to the concept of talk aloud,

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:31.488
which will be key to user research,

00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:35.450
and also allow you to get great feedback
through the voice of your user.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.450
This is great because it allows you to
focus on the testing as its going on and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.440
sift through the data later.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.170
Additionally, you will often catch
really useful snippets of things you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.350
did right.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.500
Nothing convinces investors quite so
much as hearing a user be verbally

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.970
excited about your app design
as they're interacting with it.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.270
Nothing, that is, except for

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.550
seeing that user be excited
about interacting with the app.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.180
If you have the resources and
are able to get permission,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.690
it can be really useful to record video
of both the prototype as the user's

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.880
interacting with it, and the user's face
as their interacting with the prototype.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.750
This footage takes awhile
to sift through, and so,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.230
is mainly appropriate for
higher fidelity prototypes later on.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.870
But can be really useful in
presentations to investors.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.270
I would suggest that for the sake of the
first prototype, you just take notes.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.850
It's always vital to have a record but
for

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.490
the moment we're wanting to get
feedback as fast as possible.
