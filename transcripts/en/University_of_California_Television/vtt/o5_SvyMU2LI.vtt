- [Sriram] Thanks so much for the
invitation, it's a great pleasure to be

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.290
here. Today I'm going to be talking about
the legacy of archaic admixture in present

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.330
day humans. And so, to set the stage here,
based on genetic analysis of present day

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.710
populations we've built up a fairly good
broad outline of the history of modern

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.180
humans. For example, we know that modern
humans evolved in Africa and about 100,000

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.870
years ago there was a dispersal outside of
Africa to the rest of the world. We also

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.890
know, based on archeological evidence,
that during this dispersal modern humans

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.510
overlapped with another archaic human
population, the Neandertal. And so, this

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.360
begs the question whether these two
populations that overlapped potentially

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.320
met and interbred. So several studies
tried to answer this hypothesis, but in

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.080
the last five years there have been some
major breakthroughs that allow us to get

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.550
whole modern, whole genomes, from ancient
human populations. In particular, we have

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.590
genomes from the Neandertals and their
sister group, the Denisovans. We'll hear a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.340
little more about the technical challenges
that enabled the breakthrough in the later

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.710
talks. But, what I'd like to focus on
today is the fact that once we have these

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.060
ancient whole genome sequences, we can
pretty much definitively answer the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.460
question of whether there was
interbreeding between these two groups.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.630
And so, a number of studies have shown
that there was indeed interbreeding, or

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.550
gene flow. For example, we now know that
non-African populations trace about 2% of

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.750
their genetic ancestry back to the
Neandertals. We also know that there was

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.120
Denisovan gene flow into some present day
human populations. For example,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.720
populations from Island Oceania have about
3% to 6% of their genetic ancestry tracing

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.240
back to the Denisovans. This is over and
above the 2% that they inherit from the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.290
Neandertals. So, the big picture is all
non-Africans today carry a small amount of

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.690
archaic ancestry. At first blush this
might seem like a small contribution, but

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.790
when we examine this further, one thing
that we need to keep in mind is the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.700
Denisovans and the Neandertals were highly
diverged from modern human populations at

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.550
the time of admixture. We think they were
separated by at least a couple of hundreds

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.570
of thousands of years. And as a result,
these populations accumulated novel

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.030
mutations that were never seen in the
modern human population. These novel

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.660
mutations entered modern humans through
the admixture process. We estimate that

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.630
about 10% of the SNPs at the time of
admixture, in non-Africans, could have

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.020
been of Neandertal origin. So, a
hypothesis is that these archaic

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.300
admixtures were having a potentially large
impact on human biology. So as one

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.680
concrete example of the potential impact
of archaic admixture: we were involved in

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.950
a genome wide association study, a study
that aims to determine genetic variance

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.260
associated with Type 2 diabetes in
Mexican-Americans. In this study, we

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:22.730
determined a novel radiant found in this
gene called SLC16A11. We found that this

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.560
gene had a unique geographic distribution.
When we looked at the variant in this gene

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.530
that confers increased risk for Type 2
diabetes, we found that the

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.740
risk-increasing variant is found at
appreciable frequency in the Americas, is

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.120
essentially absent in Africa and is
present at low frequency everywhere else.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.080
What we found is that this risk-increasing
variant at this gene matches the genomic

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.040
sequence found in one of the Neandertal
genomes that had been sequenced. So, what

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.860
we determined was this was a variant that
had introgressed into modern human

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.900
populations from Neandertals. Now, a
number of other studies have looked at

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.610
specific genetic positions, genetic loci,
and have documented substantial

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.230
contributions of archaic ancestries at
these loci. Here is a not very

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.690
representative list. But, what we wanted
to do is go beyond single loci analysis

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.860
and ask, "What does the distribution of
Neandertal ancestry look if we were to

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.640
look across the genome?" So we wanted to
go from single loci to a genome wide

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.360
assessment. To do this, we need to build a
map of archaic local ancestry. So, what do

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.040
we mean by that? Basically, what we want
to do is to go along an individual

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.830
person's genome and label the positions
where they carry archaic ancestry. Here is

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.520
a cartoon that depicts what's going on and
why we need to do this. We have a modern

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.720
human genome admixing with an archaic
human genome. If you look at the

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.460
descendants of this interbreeding because
of the way the genome is transmitted in

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.700
every generation, it gets broken down by a
process called recombination. And as a

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.600
result, if you look at the descendant of
this interbreeding event, this

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.980
descendant's genome is going to have this
mosaic pattern where some portions of the

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.660
genome trace their ancestry to the modern
human and others trace their ancestry to

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.180
the archaic human population. What we'd
like to be able to do is look at a present

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.360
day individual's genome and figure out
which are the portions that are red and

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.050
which are the portions that are blue. To
be able to do this, we came up with a

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:37.310
statistical model and what this model
allows us to do is to infer these

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.050
locations of archaic ancestry.
Specifically, we're going to look at a

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.090
target genome, this could be any genome
that we're interested in, and we compare

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.270
this target genome to the genome of the
Neandertal, the Denisovan, as well as to a

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:56.440
reference panel of African individuals.
We're looking at Africans because this is

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.320
a population that we assume has little
archaic ancestry. It's a reasonable

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.910
assumption but not entirely true, but we
work with that. Our goal is to look at

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.840
this target genome and for every position,
which we call a SNP here, along this

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.240
target genome, we like to label the
ancestry, or more precisely the local

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.780
ancestry, of this individual. We like to
be able to say that this SNP of the target

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.460
individual is Neandertal in ancestry
whereas this other SNP is modern human in

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.990
ancestry. I'm going to give you a little
bit of introduction of what goes under the

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.850
layers of this statistical model that
allows us to make these inferences. The

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.300
basic idea is we're going to be looking at
patterns of genetic variation that are

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.000
informative of archaic ancestry. Here's an
example where we're going to be looking at

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.140
features of genetic variation that are
informative of Neandertal ancestry. Here,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.390
we are looking at a single position in the
genome where we're comparing the target

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.700
genome to the Neandertal, the Denisovan,
and the Africans. What we see here is a

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:03.420
genealogy, or a tree, that relates these
genomes at this position. What we see at

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.090
this position is that there's a mutation
that clusters the target and the

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.680
Neandertal genome to the exclusion of all
the other genomes. When we see this

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.540
pattern, we're likely to think that this
is a position that has come into the

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.950
target genome from Neandertal admixture.
On the other hand, here's another position

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.070
where there is a mutation that clusters
the target with the Denisovan and the

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.290
Africans to the exclusion of the
Neandertals. When we see this, we conclude

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.930
the opposite that this is a position that
is unlikely to carry Neandertal ancestry.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.910
These kinds of features go into the
statistical model which figures out what

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.100
is an optimal way of combining these
features to get the best possible

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:47.370
predictions. Similarly, we can also do a
statistical model that allows us to

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.730
predict Denisovan ancestries. We applied
an initial version of this statistical

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:58.340
model to a data set that comes from what
is called the 1,000 Genomes Project. This

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.070
already gave us some very interesting
insights. But a limitation of that data

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:07.860
set was that this data set had a small
sampling of populations from outside of

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:13.660
Africa. A second limitation was that it
lacked any individuals who carried

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.650
Denisovan ancestry so, we can make no
inferences about the Denisovan

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:22.780
contributions to modern human populations.
Instead, we applied this data set, this

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:27.830
method, to a new data set. This is a rich
genomic data set that's called a Simons

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:33.280
Genome Diversity Project. It has genome
sequences from over 100 non-African

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:40.630
populations and, most importantly, we have
in this data set 20 genomes from Oceania,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.970
from individuals who have substantial
Denisovan ancestries. We applied our

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.520
method to this data set and the first
thing we'd like to be able to conclude is

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.580
that the method is giving us accurate
inferences about archaic ancestries. One

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.520
way to do this is to make sure that the
inferences are consistent with everything

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.490
we know about human history. The way we do
this is we take the inferences that come

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:07.530
out of the statistical model, we average
it across an individual's genome and

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.320
compute what proportion of an individual's
genome is archaic in ancestry. In this

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.430
particular case, we're asking what
proportion of an individual's genome is

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:22.050
Neandertal in ancestry. What we have here
is a circle for every population and the

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.830
color is telling us whether you have low
levels of Neandertal ancestry to high

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.390
levels of Neandertal ancestry. The first
thing we observed is in general,

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.690
non-Africans carry substantially more
Neandertal ancestry compared to south

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.870
African hunter-gatherers which are not
included here, but this is what we expect

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.330
based on our previous demographic models
which tell us that there was Neandertal

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.380
admixture into non-Africans after they
split from Africans. We also observe that

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.820
when you look at Eastern non-African
populations, they carry more Neandertal

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.050
ancestry compared to west Eurasians which
has also been a previous observation

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.480
consistent with the literature. Now, we
can do the analogous thing with Denisovan

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.580
ancestry and what we see here is that
Oceanian populations have substantially

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:12.440
more Denisovan ancestry compared to
Mainland Eurasian populations. Further,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.430
amongst the Mainland Eurasians, there
seems to be more Denisovan ancestry in

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:21.260
East Asians compared to West Eurasians.
Again, all of these are consistent with

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.130
previous results. Now, when we look at the
data further, there was one element of

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:31.180
surprise and a novel result. The novel
result is that several populations in

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.820
South and East Asia tend to have an excess
of Denisovan ancestry that had not been

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.320
observed before. These are populations
like the Sherpa, which is a population

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.290
from Nepal, the Tibetans, and Bengali, a
population from East India. It turns out

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.320
that this is a trace amount of Denisovan
ancestry that they carry. We estimate that

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.670
it's about 5 parts in 1,000, which is why
you need these sensitive statistical

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.580
methods to see these Denisovan
contributions. Now, one question we were

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.040
interested in is: "Can this excess of
Denisovan ancestry in South Asian

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.230
populations be explained by a mixture
between Eastern non-Africans who have more

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:15.750
Denisovan ancestry with West Eurasians who
have less Denisovan ancestry?" To see

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.370
this, we plotted the Denisovan ancestry as
a function of what proportion of your

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:26.440
genome is related to non-West Eurasians.
What we see is generally as you get closer

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.590
to the non-West Eurasians, you have more
Denisovan ancestry, but when you look at

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.630
South Asian populations, you have
systematically more that can be explained

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.890
by this model. What this is telling us is
one of several things: a model that is

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.800
consistent with this observation, though
not the only model, is that there were

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.270
actually three Denisovan introgression
events in the history of modern human

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:52.680
populations: one, in the history of the
Papuans or the Oceanians; the second, in

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.570
the history of the East Asians; and the
third, in the history of South Asian

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:02.250
populations. Now, we decide to zoom in and
instead of looking at how archaic ancestry

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:07.610
changes across individuals, we'd like to
look at how archaic ancestry changes as we

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.860
move along the genomes. Here, as we move
along the circle, we're moving along the

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:18.430
genome looking at different chromosomes.
The outermost circle is telling us what is

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.510
the Denisovan ancestry proportion in the
Oceanians and each of the inner circles

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.500
are telling us what is the Neandertal
ancestry proportion in different

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.900
continental populations. The key
observation is the colors along these

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.890
circles tell us which are positions in the
genome where there is detectable

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:40.730
proportions of archaic ancestry. The key
takeaway from this figure is the archaic

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.940
ancestry doesn't seem to be randomly
scattered along an individual's genome.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.800
There are certain hotspots where there is
an elevated proportion of archaic

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.880
ancestry, so we call them "peaks," and
then there are certain other positions in

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.830
the genome where nobody seems to be
carrying archaic ancestry, which we term

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.800
"deserts." This was another surprise and
we'd like to figure out what is going on

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.970
in these peaks and deserts of archaic
ancestry. So, we looked at one of the most

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.740
extreme examples of a peak. This is a
locus that overlaps a gene called

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:19.490
basonuclin 2 and in the 1,000 Genomes
European population, we find that about

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.780
60% of individuals, European individuals,
today carry the Neandertal variant of the

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.150
allele. This needs to be contrasted with
the 2% who would have carried it 50,000

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:33.710
years ago. Essentially, the Neandertal
variant has increased from 2% to 60% over

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:39.280
the last 50,000 years. This is not an
isolated example and we find of the order

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.970
of 200 loci with elevated Neandertal
ancestries in the different non-African

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.100
populations and about 50 loci with
elevated Denisovan ancestry in the

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.570
Oceanian populations. These are all
potential candidates what we call "archaic

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.400
adaptive introgression." Putting it
simply, these are places in the genome

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.120
where the archaic allele conferred an
adaptive benefit in the modern human

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.710
population which is why it rose up in
frequencies. So, we'd like to understand

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.840
what might be driving this increase in
frequencies at these positions. That turns

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.950
out to be a really challenging problem.
One way we try to address that is by

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:22.980
looking at sets of genes that are known to
be associated with certain functions or

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:29.250
certain biological processes. And we
asked, "Are these sets of genes harboring

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:35.060
an excess of archaic ancestry much more
than we'd expect?" We find several sets of

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.090
genes that show an elevated proportion of
archaic ancestry much more than we'd

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:44.150
expect. For example, genes that are
involved in keratin filament formation so,

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.230
keratin is a protein that is found in hair
and skin, are enriched for Neandertal

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.810
ancestry across all the non-African
populations. Similarly, we find that genes

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:57.530
involved in Trace-amine receptors, these
are genes that are involved, are

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:02.020
important, for olfaction, tend to have
elevated proportions of Denisovan

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:06.210
ancestry. This, again, allows us to narrow
down what the selection pressures might

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:11.530
be, but still, we are quite some ways away
from figuring out what the exact sequence

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.670
of processes were that drove these archaic
variants to high frequencies. Next, we

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:23.190
turn our attention to deserts. These are
large regions, tens of millions of bases

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:29.640
long, where we cannot detect either
Neandertal or Denisovan ancestry. Even

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.070
more impressively, there are four such
regions in the genome that are deserts for

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:39.520
both Neandertal and Denisovan ancestry.
Here is one example: this is a desert on

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.340
chromosome seven, and it contains a number
of genes within this region, but one gene

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.100
that caught our eye because of the prior
work associated with it, is a gene called

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.660
FOXP2. This is a gene that's shown to be
important for speech and language. So, a

00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.330
possibility here is that these deserts of
archaic ancestry are places in the genome

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.560
that are resistant to archaic
introgression and a reason for that is

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.300
that these are places that are important
for the modern human phenotype. The

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.150
challenge, again, is that these are large
regions of the genome and trying to

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:17.400
localize what might the changes be that
make them resistant to introgression is

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.550
actually quite challenging. We decided to
look at this in a slightly more

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:28.330
quantitative manner. The way we did this
is we chopped up the genome according to a

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.940
measure of the selective strength in that
region of the genome and we asked how does

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.930
the archaic ancestry change in different
portions of the genome. The x-axis, as we

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.440
go from right to left, is going in
directions of stronger selective

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.030
constraint. What we find is the archaic
ancestry, whether we're looking at

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.660
Neandertals or the Denisovans, decreases
as we move towards the strongly

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.980
selectively constrained of the genome.
This is consistent with the observation

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.710
that there has been purifying selection to
the more archaic alleles and there are

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.340
several models that have been proposed:
one of these is that these archaic alleles

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.340
are deleterious and they've been purged
from the human population; another one

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:12.210
that we've also proposed is one of hybrid
sterility where these populations have

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.390
diverged and have accumulated genetic
incompatibilities that are not tolerated

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.820
on each other's genetic background. I'm
just going to conclude very quickly. I've

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.410
talked about statistical models for
inferring maps of archaic ancestry and so

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.160
by combining these sensitive statistical
models with the rich ancient and modern

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:34.050
genomic data sets, we can make some very
fine scale inferences. The kinds of

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:38.530
inferences lead us to conclude that there
is a lot of complexity in the demographic

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:43.450
histories of these populations; we'll
learn more about it in later talks. When

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:49.190
we look at the variation along the genome,
clearly this is affected by selection but

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:53.340
there's also demography at play here. A
major challenge for us is to separate out

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.140
demography and selection and different
kinds of selection from each other. With

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.850
that, I'd like to acknowledge my
colleagues at Harvard, colleagues at the

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.010
the Max Planck, and the members of the
Neandertal Genome Analysis Consortium for

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.582
comments and criticism at different stages
of the work. Thanks.
