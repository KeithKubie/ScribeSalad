PAUL SAXMAN: Hi, I'm Paul
Saxman, and I'm a Senior

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.490
Developer Advocate at Google.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.670
In this tutorial, I'll be giving
you an overview of the

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.730
Google TV platform from a
developer's perspective.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.350
Specifically, I'll cover why you
should consider developing

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.945
apps for connected TVs.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:22.280
I'll talk about the main
features of Google TV that

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.430
developers should be
interested in.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.100
And I'll tell you how to
get started building

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.500
apps for the platform.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.730
It's a really great time for
developers to start building

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.430
apps for TVs, because it's
an emerging market.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.800
There's less competition and
more room for creative ideas.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.820
And there's still time for
developers to establish

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.570
themselves in the
smart TV space.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.050
There are few statistics that
capture where the connected TV

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.880
market is going, which should
give you a sense of why you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.250
should consider developing
apps for TVs.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.680
The first statistic, that I
think is relevant, is that, in

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.500
the US, households have
an average of 2.5

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
people and 2.93 TV sets.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.650
And the average number of TV
sets per household continues

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.720
to increase.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.690
Whereas the average number
of people has

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.970
remained relatively constant.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.620
What's interesting about this
statistic is that there are,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.170
on average, more TVs than
people in US homes.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.180
This also likely means that
people own more TVs than other

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.040
types of connected devices.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.710
This is especially true for
personal devices, such as

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.820
laptops, smartphones,
and tablets.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.730
Another interesting statistic
about TVs is that, in the US,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.840
2.92 million people own TVs and
watch an average of five

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.110
hours of television per day.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.450
Many people multicast
while watching TV.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.440
So this can be shared time.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.460
However, at five hours average
per day, television viewing is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.310
likely the top leisure
activity in the US.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.560
But what about connected TVs?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.780
By the end of 2015, it's
projected that more than 500

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.530
million connected TVs
will have shipped.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.930
And in 2015, alone, nearly half
of the flat panel TVs

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.490
sold will have some form of
internet connectivity.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.890
And this 500 million cumulative
number does not

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.810
include TVs that are sold
without internet connectivity,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.150
but that are connected to the
internet through a set-top

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.630
box, game console, media
PC, or the like.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.740
The cumulative number of
smartphones sold reached

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.500
around 500 million at
the end of 2011.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.800
But it's definitely worth noting
that smartphones have

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.360
been on the market for a number
of years, whereas the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.410
connected TV market
is relatively new.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.820
So why develop apps for TVs?

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.170
Well, a lot of people have
and watch televisions.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.560
People watch television a lot.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.340
And TVs are getting
smarter and better

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.250
connected every day.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.160
Also, people love television.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.130
And they want to interact with
it and it's content in more

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.040
rich and meaningful ways.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.240
We created Google TV
with this in mind.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.300
And we made it an open apps
platform, so that the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.340
developers can use their
intelligence and creativity to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.310
connect with users, when they're
in their homes and

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.330
looking to relax and
be entertained.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.870
Google TV brings two open apps
platforms, Android and the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.120
web, to the largest screen
and the best sound

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.140
system in most homes.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.060
This is Android adapted for
the TV space, however.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.350
So the platform includes support
for additional AV

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.450
codecs and formats, protocols,
and APIs that are

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.620
relevant for TVs.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.520
Since Google TV is Android,
it's open for Android

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.860
developers to bring apps
to the living room.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.740
In addition, Google TV includes
Google Chrome, so

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.560
developers that love HTML5
can bring their

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.300
apps to TVs as well.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.830
Google TV is an open apps
platform, not a device.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.790
However, there are devices
available or that are soon to

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.560
be released that
run Google TV.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.370
On the left is Vizio stream
player and the Sony media

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.730
player, both of which can
be used to add Google TV

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.220
experience to HDTVs.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.360
On the right is the LG G2 series
TV, which is a TV that

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.860
includes the Google
TV platform.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.620
The Google TV homescreen, which
is the primary user

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.410
interface for the platform, has
been redesigned to be more

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.490
simple and intuitive and to take
advantage of several key

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.540
Android features.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.520
The face in the background is
live TV, which the user can

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.730
bring to the foreground
quickly.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.510
This area of the
homescreen also

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.040
supports Android app widgets.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.640
Along the bottom of the home
screen is a customizable quick

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.930
launch bar.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.290
Here, users have access to
status bar notifications sent

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.839
from apps, an all apps section,
the Google Play

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.340
Store, and Global
Quick Search.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.320
Google TV has integrated Global
Quick Search, which

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.480
brings search results from a
number of sources to the user.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.970
In this example, you can see
search results from the Google

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.020
TV programming guide, live
TV, and the web.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.800
There are also search results
from apps here as well.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.510
Any app that includes a Global
Search provider can publish

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.830
results to the user initiated
Global Searches on Google TV.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.380
Google TV includes the
Google Play Store.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.510
If you have an app that is
currently published in the

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.290
Google Play Store, it may
already be available for

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.680
Google TV users to install.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.580
For the Google Play Store on
Google TV, we feature apps

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.050
that look and work
great on TVs.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.400
To look great, apps should be
designed for the 10 foot or

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.770
three meter user experience.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.330
This means that text in UI's
controls should be readable

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.860
from three meters away and
that users interact with

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.680
Google TV using handheld
remote controls.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.170
Remote controls for the current
generation of devices

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.270
the support Google TV have a
number of similar features,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.670
including full keyboards,
directional pads, pointing

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.550
devices, such as touchpads or
gyroscopic pointers, a search

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.240
key to access Global Quick
Search, media control keys,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.390
and the Android buttons,
Back, Home, and Menu.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.170
The directional pad or d-pad is
a very important feature of

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.350
the remote controls
for Google TV.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.310
Most users prefer to use the
d-pad for navigation, so

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.290
developers should ensure
that their Google TV

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.740
apps support it.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.020
Thankfully, the Android platform
includes support for

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.970
d-pad navigation with standard
interactive views.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.700
Developers may need to add
d-pad support to customer

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.040
views, however.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.660
To do so, they need to ensure
that their customer views are

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.480
focusable and that they
show navigation focus.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.230
Google TV can also be controlled
with one or more

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.310
virtual input devices.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.300
This is the Google TV remote
control app for Android, which

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.710
is available in the
Google Play store.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.780
A version of this app is also
available for iOS devices.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.310
These apps turn user's
smartphones and tablets into

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.500
Google TV universal remote
controls, allowing them to

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.360
interact with their TVs in
new and unique ways.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.450
For example, these apps allow
users to search for content on

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.490
Google TV using voice input.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.050
The technology behind these
virtual controllers is open

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.920
for developers to use, to build
their own second screen

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.880
apps for Google TV.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.260
Imagine using your smartphone or
tablet as a game controller

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.800
or giving multiple TV viewers
a shared experience on a TV,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.760
but allowing them to interact
individually with the TV using

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.360
apps on their own handheld
devices.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.750
The idea of using multiple
screens in the living room is

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.180
relatively new.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.440
But it's quickly gaining
popularity.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.970
So now it's also a great time to
start building apps for the

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.630
second screen as well.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.940
Now onto some lower level
technical details

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.920
about Google TV.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.160
This is a table of the Android
screen sizes, densities, and

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.060
physical resolutions.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.980
There's a lot of information
in this table.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.960
But what's most important
are the two cells

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.130
highlighted in orange.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.610
These are the Google TV screens,
which correspond to

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.880
720 and 1080 HDTV resolutions.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.950
Google TV supports two pixel
densities, XHDPI and TVDPI,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.960
which is pretty close to HDPI.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.570
I To support both HD
resolutions, you generally

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.400
only need to include XHDPI
resources with your

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.700
application.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.320
The platform will scale the
resources for TVDPI.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.310
If you do the math, you'll
notice that the density

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.050
independent pixel resolutions,
for both screen sizes, works

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.280
out to 960 by 540.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.690
Google TV is a large screen,
independent of the resolution.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.810
It's not extra large, like Xoom
tablet, because TVs are

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.600
viewed from much further away.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.980
It's all a matter
of perspective.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.630
Google TV includes a content
provider, for retrieving a

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.690
list of TV channels that the
user has available, and

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.110
supports an Intent for changing

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.240
channels for the user.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.980
If you want to use this content
provider, you must

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.700
include the READ CHANNELS
permission

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.170
in your apps manifest.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.280
This content provider has the
names, numbers, and call signs

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.750
for the channels, as
well as the URI for

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.880
channel changing Intent.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.950
Google TV also includes two
second screen services that

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.110
can be accessed on the
user's home network.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.530
The first is for pairing
personal devices with Google

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.880
TV, so that the devices
can securely send

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.740
information to the TV.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.620
The second is the Anymote
Protocol, which allows devices

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.300
to send key events, mouse
events, such as movement and

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.740
clicking, basic stream data, and
URIs for starting Intents.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.900
Whichever app is in the
foreground will receive the

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.570
key and mouse events.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.190
So you can use the Anymote
Protocol to build companion

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.980
apps for phones or tablets
that interact

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.920
with Google TV apps.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.200
These protocols form the
foundation of the Google TV

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.970
multi screen experience.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.970
Java and C++ libraries that
implement these protocols are

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.340
available online, open source,
so the developers don't need

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.620
to start from scratch when
building second screen apps

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.260
that integrate with Google TV.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.600
The Google TV remote app for
Android, that I mentioned

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.150
earlier, uses these protocols
and is available,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.740
open source, as well.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.620
Due to the 16x9 aspect ratios
of HD televisions, a

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.290
horizontal, left to right layout
works better on Google

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.100
TV than the vertical, top to
bottom layout, that is

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.890
commonly used for phones
and tablet apps.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.350
To help developers implement
a horizontal layout, we've

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.760
released a left navigation
bar Android library.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.220
This library includes a class
that extends the Android

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.230
Action Bar Class, so that you
can use it exactly like you

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.030
would the Action Bar.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.720
The only difference is that it
draws a cell vertically on the

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.990
left hand side of the display,
instead of at the top.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.720
Google TV includes an Android
location provider, but

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.210
location works a little bit
differently on Google TV than

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.820
it does on Android phones
and tablets.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.390
To access the location provider
on Google TV, you

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.940
must include the coarse location
permission in your

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.290
manifest, which is for non
precise coordinates.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.130
And to retrieve a user's
location, you need to use the

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.510
static location provider.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.310
The location that you get from
the Location Manager is only

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.770
accurate to the postal
code level.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.290
Users are asked to enter their
postal codes, when configuring

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.480
Google TV for the first time,
and they can reenter the

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.450
information, at any time, using
the system settings.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.400
You should, therefore, only use
the postal code portion of

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.920
the address associated with the
coordinates returned from

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.090
the location provider.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.780
To start developing apps for
Google TV, you'll need to

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.370
install the Android SDK Tools.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.100
And if you'll be using the
Eclipse IDE for development,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.790
which is recommended,
you'll need the

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.050
ADT plug-in for Eclipse.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.610
Once you have the SDK Tools
installed, you can run the

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.650
Android SDK Manager and install
the Android 3.1 SDK

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.250
package for developing
Google TV apps.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.990
Documentation for installing
and using the development

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.330
tools can be found on the
Android developer website at

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.210
developer.android.com/sdk.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.060
For testing your app, the
Android SDK Tools includes a

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.580
hardware accelerated emulator,
that you can use in

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.380
conjunction with the Google TV
add-on that is part of the

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.530
Android 3.1 SDK package.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.220
It can also help to use a
real device for testing

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.350
apps for Google TV.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.330
An Android tablet, in landscape
mode, with a USB or

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.070
Bluetooth keyboard attached,
will allow you to test your

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.260
layouts in d-pad navigation.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.940
However, you should definitely
consider getting a Google TV

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.450
device for development.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.330
It could definitely make the
difference between building a

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
good app and a great app.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.280
And finally, the Google TVs
developer site is the best

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.020
place to go to get started
with building

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.730
apps for Google TV.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.810
Be sure to visit the site at
developers.google.com/tv

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.200
before you dive into coding.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.230
This site includes
documentation, design

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.240
guidelines, community resources,
and sample code

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.440
that should definitely help
you build your app.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.230
And that's everything
for this tutorial.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.810
If you have any questions,
please feel free to reach out

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.120
