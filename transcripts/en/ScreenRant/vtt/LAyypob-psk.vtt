10 Disney Stars Who Are Not As Innocent As
They Seemed

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.340
Disney has an incredible history of recognizing
talent at a young age and putting those young

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.340
stars front and center in their shows and
movies.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.750
Many of these child stars fade off in to obscurity
and many of them have a hard time ever shaking

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.900
off their early Disney roles.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.000
For this video we are taking a look at the
Disney stars who grew up to be far less innocent

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.260
than we once thought with our list of 10 Disney
Stars Who Are Not As Innocent As They Seemed.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:43.750
Zac Efron
Zac Efron’s career was jumpstarted by the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.760
major success of the Disney Channel original
movie, High School Musical.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.280
In the musical movie (and its two sequels),
Efron plays Troy Bolton, the leading man who

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.930
can sing, dance and play basketball.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.570
With his success in the movies and his boyish
good looks, girls of all ages were falling

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.020
madly in love with him.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.250
Fast-forward a decade and while Zac may still
have the killer looks, he has traded in his

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.860
adorable Disney star appeal for a more crude
masculine look.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.250
It only makes sense that Efron would start
choosing racier roles as he got older and

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.130
we are sure that his fans weren’t complaining
when they got to see a lot of his ripped body

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.210
in Neighbors and Dirty Grandpa.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.439
Look out for Efron in 2017’s Baywatch movie
where he will be yet again playing the role

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.280
of eye candy.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.939
Shia Labouef
At this point, we aren’t even sure what

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.870
to refer to Shia Labouef as any more.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.990
The guy has been the subject of some pretty
weird Internet videos, some freestyle rap

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.380
battles, some box offices hits and some really
bizarre art films.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.170
It’s pretty crazy to see where Shia is today
when you take a look back at his humble beginnings

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.330
as the star of the Disney Channel show, Even
Steven’s.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.790
Shia was such a fun and energetic young actor
and as soon as he finished up on the Disney

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.720
show he started landing roles in movies like
Disturbia and The Transformers franchise.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.490
Since then, he has sort of gone off the rails
having made some very strange public appearances

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.460
and some very racy movies like 2014’s Nymphomaniac.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.129
It’s hard to tell if Labouef is in trouble
or just having a good time doing whatever

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.660
he wants, but we hope all the best for him
either way.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.340
Miley Cyrus
There was a time when Miley Cyrus was legitimately

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.100
the biggest Disney channel star on the planet.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.330
Her show, Hannah Montana was a massive hit
and also did a great job of transitioning

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.629
the young actress into a full-fledged career
as a singer.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.989
Once her show ended, Miley decided to shake
the Hannah Montana persona and work as Miley

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.519
Cyrus full time.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.730
The singer started making more mature music
and produced more sexually explicit music

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.140
videos and these days she is no stranger to
flaunting her body in the nude.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.900
Miley may be considered crazy by some but
the truth is, she is very confident as the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.650
self assured woman that she is and we are
happy for all her success.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.160
Demi Lovato
Just like Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato got her

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.150
start very young as a nerdy looking kid on
Barney and Friends.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.610
Lovato then got her big break as the star
of the Disney Channel movie, Camp Rock.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.319
Her success in this movie, along with her
relationship with Joe Jonas helped to skyrocket

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.810
her career as a performer and she eventually
decided to pursue a career in singing full

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.810
time.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.010
While Demi has definitely found a lot of musical
success in the last few years, things weren’t

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.010
always so easy.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.200
Lovato has spoken publically about her struggles
with an eating disorder and she has also spent

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.260
time in rehab for drug use.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.390
The good news is that she has used these experiences
to fuel her recent success, but she is definitely

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.900
not the innocent little Disney star she once
was.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.110
Nick Jonas
Before the days of Justin Bieber and One Direction,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.110
The Jonas Brothers were the boy band that
had teenage girls all over the world falling

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.110
in love with them.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.980
While all three brothers starred in their
Disney channel show, it became more and more

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.620
clear that Nick was going to branch off and
be a star on his own.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.270
After seemingly disappearing for a few years,
Nick Jonas has returned to the spotlight with

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.689
a very different image.

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.060
The 24 year old star is now making some pretty
sensual music and he is not shy to strip down

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.620
for a racy photo shoot every once and a while.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.420
Nick Jonas has definitely successfully shaken
off his innocent Disney child star image and

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.330
it looks like he has a bright future ahead
of him.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.759
Britney Spears
Wait, what Disney show was Britney Spears

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.759
on?

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.229
If you answered The Suite Life Of Zach and
Cody, you clearly need to brush up on your

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.360
Disney knowledge.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.669
The world famous pop star was never on a Disney
show but she was a member of the infamous

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.639
Disney Mickey Mouse Club alongside Ryan Gosling,
Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.591
Although Spears has probably achieved the
most success out of anyone on this list, she

00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:42.220
has also probably hit the lowest lows.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.740
Take your pick, from public melt downs, to
leaked sex tapes to multiple messy public

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.610
divorces, Britney Spears has been through
it all.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.120
The craziest part of it all, however, is that
Spears has made it through all of this and

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.850
has continued making music and achieving worldwide
success.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.160
Vanessa Hudgens
After seeing Vanessa Hudgens play Gabriella

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.610
Montez, the female lead opposite Zac Efron
in the High School Musical movies, it seemed

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.240
like she was destined for glory.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.530
Hudgens was a classic Disney triple threat
with the ability to act, sing and dance but

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.650
somehow she seemed to get left behind while
all of the other stars around her rose up.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.870
We’re not sure why this is, but it definitely
didn’t help her cause when a number of nude

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.000
photos of her were leaked online.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.690
We feel bad saying it, but it definitely tarnished
her image and then her choice to star in the

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.690
famously racy flic, Spring Breakers, seemingly
sealed her fate.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.430
Hudgens is only 28 and she has landed herself
a lead role on the new show, Powerless, so

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.400
we will keep our fingers crossed that she
can finally figure it all out.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.190
Anne Hathaway
When you’re thinking of young Disney stars,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.400
Anne Hathaway probably isn’t the person
that comes to mind first.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.740
However, Hathaway actually got her start in
2001 when she starred in the Disney-made movie,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.320
The Princess Diaries.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.639
This movie was a big hit and Hathaway was
instantly pegged as a safe and innocent young

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.639
starlet.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.550
It took a while for Hathaway to shake this
‘nice girl’ persona and to start showcasing

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.570
her deeper talents.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.889
In 2010, she let to world know she was no
longer the young innocent girl by baring it

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.979
all and performing some pretty wild sex scenes
with Jake Gyllenhaal in Love and Other Drugs.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.669
It seems like this decision worked as Hathaway
was able to take home an Academy Award a few

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.330
years later for person gritty performance
in Les Miserables.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.770
Lindsay Lohan
When it comes to stories of child stars crashing

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.229
and burning, Lindsay Lohan is at the top of
almost every list.

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.449
Lohan got her start earlier than most as she
was already working as a model at the age

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:40.449
of three.

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.270
When she was in her early teens she was the
star of two major Disney movies; The Parents

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.050
Trap and Freaky Friday.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.310
Lohan was fantastic in these roles and for
a while there it looked like she was on route

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.699
to becoming a huge success story.

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.699
Unfortunately, in 2007 her career flew off
the rails when she started racking up multiple

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.530
arrests and check-ins to rehabilitation centers.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.690
Lohan’s offences range from driving under
the influence, to drug use and possession

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.610
to not being able to comply with her parole
orders.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.460
Lindsay Lohan’s story is a real shame, but
the good news is she is only 30 years old

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.949
so there is still hope that she can find some
redemption.

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.319
Selena Gomez
Selena Gomez’ career got off to a really

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:24.440
early start when she (alongside Demi Lovato)
was one of the kids on Barney and Friends.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.220
Gomez then moved on to bigger and better things
with her leading role in the hit Disney channel

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.250
show, Wizards of Waverly Place.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.259
Selena was great on the show and it was clear
from a very young age that she was going to

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:36.330
be a star.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.660
Since leaving the Disney channel life behind,
Gomez has really started to focus on her music

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.450
career and has been pumping out hits for years
now.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.550
Gomez also surprised fans with a shockingly
racy performance in 2012’s Spring Breakers,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.610
a movie known mostly for tainting our memories
of a few Disney stars.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.979
Sprinkle in some racy photo-shoots, a very
public relationship with Justin Bieber and

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:01.200
you get one Disney star that is not as innocent
as she used to be!

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.199
So there you have it, there is our list of
10 Disney Stars who are not as innocent as

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:06.270
they used to be.
