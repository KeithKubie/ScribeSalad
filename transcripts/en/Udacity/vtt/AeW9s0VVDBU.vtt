00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There is a solution. The solution is to fake it or more precisely to add fake data.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So what I'll ask you to do is to take the original data for the coin,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and add two fake data pointsâ€”one heads and one tails.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So if my data was a single observation of heads, give me first the maximum likelihood estimate.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And in the second box, give me an estimator that has one fake data point.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And on this fake data, apply its maximum likelihood.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So this is the one without fake data. This is the one with the fake data.
