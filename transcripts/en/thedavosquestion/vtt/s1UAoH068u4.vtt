Arthur: I'm Arthur Yap, I'm the Secretary
of Agriculture of the Philippines, and in

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:09.610
2009 I hope that the environment doesn't lose
out.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.700
As secretary of agriculture, if the environment
is not healthy, if there is soil degradation,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.860
if there is no water, if there are no water
sheds then that is the end of agriculture.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.110
And in my country in the Philippines, that's
35% of the labor force, and that's 20% of

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.680
the GDP of my country.
So in 2009 I hope that instead of fear, there

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:41.130
will be a mechanism to prod a lot of the polluters
to pay up, and for countries like ours with

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.440
a large farm sector to be prodded to do good,
to be rewarded for doing good.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.110
In Davos as in Madrid, I was called in for
new innovative schemes and instruments that

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.530
can help fund these efforts.
Because the third world countries, countries

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.739
such as the Philippines, it is our people
who are the most vulnerable, who get hit the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.179
most by any impact on the econ -- on the environment
impacts us immediately.

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:14.399
It is our people who are the most vulnerable
and need help the most.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.359
But we must be prodded; we must be [inaudible]
for doing the right thing.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.389
We have the technologies to move into organic
agriculture.

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:26.420
We have the technology to move into better
quality seeds, seeds that don't require as

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.380
much water.
We would like to put back our water sheds

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.979
and our water resources as well.
So I think the challenge is, how do we get

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.969
the world and the private sector cooperating
together and [inaudible] the private sector

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:49.599
and communities to undertake these projects.
So I hope 2009 will not see the year of agricultural

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:55.950
and environmental investments going down.
We must restore a sense of hope, a sense of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.289
courage.
Because despite the recession, and it's impacts

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.840
 -- I know we are all afraid.
But we have to think of the medium and the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.119
long term.
Just because there is a financial recession

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.159
does not mean that problems about the environment
or problems about [inaudible] are going to

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.040
go away.
So we must find a way to collaborate, and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.230
we must find a way to create together as a
family, as a member of the family of nations.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.739
Thank you very much.
