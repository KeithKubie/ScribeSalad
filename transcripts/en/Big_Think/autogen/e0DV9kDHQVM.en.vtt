those things are just now beginning to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
those things are just now beginning to
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.510
those things are just now beginning to
take root and and materialize in schools

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
take root and and materialize in schools
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.670
take root and and materialize in schools
and I think you know some places are

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
and I think you know some places are
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.859
and I think you know some places are
further ahead I think what's exciting is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
further ahead I think what's exciting is
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.270

in three or four years we're going to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
in three or four years we're going to
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.609
in three or four years we're going to
look back and be amazed at how much that

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
look back and be amazed at how much that
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.190
look back and be amazed at how much that
has exploded and how much teachers have

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
has exploded and how much teachers have
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.230
has exploded and how much teachers have
actually driven and students that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
actually driven and students that
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.959
actually driven and students that
conversation but it's also true that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969
conversation but it's also true that
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.459
conversation but it's also true that
there's big challenges right

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
there's big challenges right
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.160
there's big challenges right
connectivity is a big challenge actually

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
connectivity is a big challenge actually
 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.260
connectivity is a big challenge actually
having the tool the hardware tools the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
having the tool the hardware tools the
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.520

platforms to work for

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
platforms to work for
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.400
platforms to work for
remains a big challenge and in education

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
remains a big challenge and in education
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.680
remains a big challenge and in education
you know not a lot of innovators and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
you know not a lot of innovators and
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.750
you know not a lot of innovators and
entrepreneurs I'm going to step in and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
entrepreneurs I'm going to step in and
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.940
entrepreneurs I'm going to step in and
develop those things because we had 50

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
develop those things because we had 50
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.530
develop those things because we had 50
different states with 50 different

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540
different states with 50 different
 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.600
different states with 50 different
standards and different procurement

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
standards and different procurement
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.670
standards and different procurement
systems and it just made it hard and I

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
systems and it just made it hard and I
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.110
systems and it just made it hard and I
think there are things happening now

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
think there are things happening now
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.030
think there are things happening now
like the Common Core State Standards

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
like the Common Core State Standards
 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.699
like the Common Core State Standards
like this demand on the part of both

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709
like this demand on the part of both
 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.070
like this demand on the part of both
teachers and students for content

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
teachers and students for content
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.930
teachers and students for content
delivered in more creative ways to them

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
delivered in more creative ways to them
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.449
delivered in more creative ways to them
for both of their learning that you're

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
for both of their learning that you're
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.100
for both of their learning that you're
starting to see that change because

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
starting to see that change because
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.280
starting to see that change because
demand is starting to meet up with you

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
demand is starting to meet up with you
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.009
demand is starting to meet up with you
know sort of those people who'd like to

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019
know sort of those people who'd like to
 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.949
know sort of those people who'd like to
really tackle that in in ways that we

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959
really tackle that in in ways that we
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.440
really tackle that in in ways that we
have an experienced before what we see

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
have an experienced before what we see
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.880
have an experienced before what we see
happening across the country that we

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890
happening across the country that we
 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.040
happening across the country that we
think is actually more of the wave and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
think is actually more of the wave and
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.490
think is actually more of the wave and
more powerful is this blended learning

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
more powerful is this blended learning
 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.160
more powerful is this blended learning
environment in which kids and teachers

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
environment in which kids and teachers
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.370
environment in which kids and teachers
together use technology enabled tools

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380
together use technology enabled tools
 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.100
together use technology enabled tools
that make the learning more real-time

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110
that make the learning more real-time
 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.520
that make the learning more real-time
more powerful give them access to things

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
more powerful give them access to things
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.140
more powerful give them access to things
they wouldn't have had access to before

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
they wouldn't have had access to before
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.810
they wouldn't have had access to before
and so we really believe that's the wave

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820
and so we really believe that's the wave
 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.479
and so we really believe that's the wave
of the future so I think we want to keep

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489
of the future so I think we want to keep
 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.970
of the future so I think we want to keep
thinking about the fact that kids really

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
thinking about the fact that kids really
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.620
thinking about the fact that kids really
need that opportunity to collaborate

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630
need that opportunity to collaborate
 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.360
need that opportunity to collaborate
with their peers and they're still going

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
with their peers and they're still going
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.640
with their peers and they're still going
to need the facilitation and guidance of

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
to need the facilitation and guidance of
 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.710
to need the facilitation and guidance of
great teachers and so how do you make

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
great teachers and so how do you make
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.840
great teachers and so how do you make
all those things come together in a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850
all those things come together in a
 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.180
all those things come together in a
really magical powerful way

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190
really magical powerful way
 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.250
really magical powerful way
you
