Many forms ask for addresses,
E-commerce in particular.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.090
Incidentally addresses are often
incredibly annoying parts of the form

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.700
because they require so
many input fields.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.810
There are street address, postal codes,
territories, countries, region, etc.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.390
But luckily, addresses can be pretty
easily generated from a mobile device.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.130
Essentially all mobile devices have
location services through gps or wi-fi.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.930
By accessing geo location,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.390
you can often auto fill addresses
to within a fairly close range.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.480
Users might need to adjust a bit but

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.840
manipulating one input is
obviously better than eight.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.880
For example Uber,
in this example, you could see

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.520
how we got the location of the users
with this simple JavaScript code.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.170
Another way to do it will be to
allow users the auto fill option.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.590
Here you could see that with
only few clicks I have been

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.280
able to retrieve a location
that was previously saved.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.830
When you search for a car, the app uses
your location to guess your address.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.780
And when you sign up they ask for
permission to use your location.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.720

services on the web, Android, and
