00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.110
The number one reason I think why
startups fail is disagreements occur

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.440
among cofounders.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.730
So you really want to find someone that
you want to work with for the long haul.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.500
Clearly you want someone you get along,
with that compliments you, but

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.600
I've seen a few things that
sometimes get overlooked.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.300
One is the risk profile,
what does that mean?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.729
It means if you're an entrepreneur and

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:26.709
your runway to go out there
without funding is 9 to 12 months.

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:30.690
You want to find a cofounder that
shares that same long longevity

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.877
without funding.

00:00:31.877 --> 00:00:35.568
Because if your cofounder only has
three months to go without funding,

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.660
that will create a sticky
situation down the road.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.240
So yes, look for those traits of getting
along, and wanting to work well, but

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.690
look at the risk profile as well.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.070
Look at how long you and
your cofounders can go, and

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.760
be aligned with that before
you start the journey.
