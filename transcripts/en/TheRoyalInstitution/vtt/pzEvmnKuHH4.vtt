00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.340
And I want to get almost to the end of
my lecture by introducing you to some

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
things called talking balloons. 
I don't know whether you've seen them before or

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.920
heard about them. This is a perfectly
ordinary balloon but attached to it is a

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.560
little piece of plastic and on the
surface of the plastic are some grooves

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.420
and if I run my fingers along them, those
grooves will make the balloon vibrate.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.580
The grooves have been chosen so that
they will make the balloon actually speak.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.559
It will actually say a little
phrase and so I'm going to make it say a

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.840
phrase which I don't think you'll
understand. Well, we'll see.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.060
[sounds like incomprehensible speech]

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.080
You could hear it say something couldn't you? 
Could you tell what it said?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.440
Very difficult isn't it?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.400
Ok well now what I'm going to 
do is I'm going to program you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.780
I'm going to tell you what it said and I think if I now do

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.600
it again you will in fact understand
what it said. What it said was "You're the greatest".

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.660
Now you see you're programmed and if
I came back and did this any time in the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.540
next 10 days you would understand it. 
And so you're a different audience from the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.960
one that came in! I hope you don't mind.
Here's another one let's see if you can

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.200
understand this one.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.140
I did that a little too fast I'll do it again.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480
Did you understand that one?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.360
Yes, it said "happy birthday". We'll do it again
and you will all hear it I think this time.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.760
Well, that really demonstrates a very
important principle in the human mind.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.260
It illustrates the point that we are all
the time being programmed.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.200
Every minute of our lives we are being programmed by the sounds around us. This is how babies

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.760
learn to speak, they're surrounded by
people talking, long before they can ever

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.230
talk themselves and so long before
they're producing the sound they're

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.489
being programmed and this is why a baby
will tend to talk with the same accent

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.600
as the people around it. You could have a
baby who was born in one particular

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.820
culture but immediately surrounded by
people of another and it will tend to

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.800
talk like the people surrounding it.
