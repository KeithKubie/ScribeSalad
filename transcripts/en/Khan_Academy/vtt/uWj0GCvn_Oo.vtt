00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.719
- [Instructor] Imagine that one day

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:03.639
you are standing in your backyard

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.791
when all of a sudden you
saw an alien ship land

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:11.473
and the alien ship had
incredible technology

00:00:11.473 --> 00:00:15.393
and you saw aliens walking out of the ship

00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:18.202
bearing strange animals,

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:21.154
maybe scary looking weapons

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.637
and speaking a very strange language.

00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:24.552
What would you do?

00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:28.190
Would you try to be kind to the aliens,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.440
hope that maybe you could befriend them?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.744
Would you fear them

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:36.039
and perhaps immediately try
to make war against them?

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.546
Would you hope that perhaps
War of the Worlds style

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:41.849
that they would die of the common cold

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:44.423
or would you fear that
maybe they had some kind

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:47.086
of common cold that you might die of?

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:50.254
These are the choices that
were faced by Native Americans

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:54.721
when they encountered the
Spanish at the end of the 1400s.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.145
Columbus arrived in the New World in 1492

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.960
and when he got back in 1493

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.067
the secret was out that
there were great riches

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:06.056
to be had in the New World,

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:09.231
so much so that as early as 1494

00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.731
Spain and Portugal were trying to decide

00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.182
how they would divide the riches

00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:16.581
of the Old World and the New between them,

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.476
so in the years after
Columbus' first voyage

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:22.809
many Spanish conquistadors or conquerors

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.179
began exploring throughout the Americas

00:01:28.032 --> 00:01:30.596
and it's not necessary for you to memorize

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:32.045
any of these names

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:34.038
but I want you to get a sense

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:38.246
that in the 50 years or so after Columbus,

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:41.955
European explorers began
checking out everything

00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:46.156
in the Caribbean, North
America and South America

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.643
and their motivations, like Columbus'

00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:51.476
were the three Gs of colonization,

00:01:52.873 --> 00:01:55.040
gold, that is to get rich,

00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.026
glory, that is to bring
glory to one's self

00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:01.485
for one's nation

00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:04.272
and a little bit of God,

00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:06.686
that is to bring Catholicism

00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:09.816
to native peoples living in the Americas.

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:12.898
Now, as you can see from
the many individuals here,

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:16.247
Spanish colonization was
a very complex process

00:02:16.247 --> 00:02:18.757
taking place in many different regions

00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:20.852
but in this video I wanna focus in

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:23.020
on just a few aspects,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.151
the conquest of Mexico by Cortes,

00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:29.718
a society that came out of this blend

00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:32.260
of Spanish and Native American culture

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.158
and a little bit about the resistance

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:37.525
to colonization that
we'll see in New Mexico

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:39.397
with the Pueblo Revolt.

00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:42.907
Now, like Columbus, Spanish
explorers originally

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:46.822
were looking for a passage
to Asia through the Americas

00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:50.036
but quickly learned that
there was quite a lot

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.812
of riches to be found in
the Americas themselves

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:55.024
and one place that came to the attention

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:58.125
of the conquistadors was Tenochtitlan

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:02.062
which was the capital of the Aztec Empire.

00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:06.033
Now, the Aztecs were not
well loved in Mexico.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:08.700
They ruled over a vast territory

00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:11.878
with many smaller tribes

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:14.345
they required to give them tribute

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:17.015
and even human captives for sacrifice,

00:03:17.015 --> 00:03:19.182
so in 1519, Hernan Cortes,

00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.051
a Spanish conquistador landed

00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:26.551
with a group of about 600 men in Vera Cruz

00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.762
and with the help of some translators

00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:32.345
he worked his way across Mexico

00:03:33.201 --> 00:03:37.368
learning of the general
dislike of the Aztec Empire

00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:41.407
so that when he finally came upon the city

00:03:41.407 --> 00:03:45.574
of Tenochtitlan he had about
20,000 Native Americans

00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:48.885
who were ready to make war

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:50.898
on this city along with him.

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:54.407
Now, it's hard to
imagine what Tenochtitlan

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:56.876
would have looked like to the Spanish.

00:03:56.876 --> 00:04:00.905
It's estimated that it had about 200,000

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:02.738
to 300,000 inhabitants

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.586
which made it one of the
larger cities in the world.

00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:10.724
There was nothing quite
so large as this city

00:04:10.724 --> 00:04:12.373
in all of Europe.

00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:16.167
It sat in the middle of a
lake with hanging gardens

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.830
and an aqueduct and
had incredible pyramids

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.724
that were many stories tall

00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:24.683
and at first, Moctezuma the Second

00:04:24.683 --> 00:04:27.315
who was emperor of the Aztec Empire

00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:31.738
treated the approaching
Spaniards with great kindness

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.892
and generosity showering them with gifts.

00:04:34.892 --> 00:04:36.675
After all, the Spanish had things

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:39.330
that Moctezuma had never seen before

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.080
like horses and gigantic war dogs

00:04:44.773 --> 00:04:47.294
which they used to rip apart their enemies

00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:51.668
and cannons which even though
they only had a few of them

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:53.360
and they didn't work very well

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.763
were very frightening

00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:55.715
when they were fired,

00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:58.941
much like I think a ray gun
would be frightening to us now.

00:04:58.941 --> 00:05:02.004
Now, it didn't take very
long for the relationship

00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:05.128
between the Spanish and
the Aztecs to crumble

00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:09.274
and aided by their many
native American allies

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:13.441
and also by the spread of
deadly disease like smallpox

00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:18.410
which decimated the Native
American population,

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.077
by 1521 Tenochtitlan had fallen,

00:05:22.318 --> 00:05:23.954
in fact, was in ruins.

00:05:23.954 --> 00:05:25.503
Moctezuma had died

00:05:25.503 --> 00:05:29.924
and the Spanish began building
on the ruins of Tenochtitlan,

00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:33.558
Mexico City but much to the horror

00:05:33.558 --> 00:05:36.051
of the many Native American tribes

00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:38.385
that had allied with the Spanish,

00:05:38.385 --> 00:05:39.620
the Spanish would turn out

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.964
to be much crueler imperial masters

00:05:42.964 --> 00:05:44.325
than the Aztecs had been

00:05:44.325 --> 00:05:47.284
and the smallpox that
had ravaged the Aztecs,

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:50.564
ravaged the rest of the Native
American population as well

00:05:50.564 --> 00:05:52.112
as they lacked the immunity

00:05:52.112 --> 00:05:54.487
to European disease.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:57.607
Although much of the conquest

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.574
of the Spanish Empire in the New World

00:06:00.574 --> 00:06:03.830
was done by conquistadors, adventurers,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.824
the Spanish Crown was
eager to place some control

00:06:07.824 --> 00:06:09.499
over this new territory

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:13.353
and one way that they did was
through the Encomiendas System

00:06:13.353 --> 00:06:17.103
and the Encomiendas
System was a labor system

00:06:17.968 --> 00:06:21.331
that in a way was kind of a combination

00:06:21.331 --> 00:06:24.414
of feudalism from Europe and slavery.

00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:29.975
So, the idea was that the Spanish Crown

00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:33.642
would grant land holders
called encomenderos

00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:40.866
the right to the labor
of Native Americans,

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:42.866
perhaps a village or two

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.983
and anything that those
Native Americans produced

00:06:47.983 --> 00:06:49.573
through their slave labor,

00:06:49.573 --> 00:06:54.486
so gold if they mined it
or agricultural products

00:06:54.486 --> 00:06:57.486
if they were working on a plantation

00:06:58.364 --> 00:07:01.775
and in theory what the Native
Americans would get for this

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:03.858
would be Christianization

00:07:06.003 --> 00:07:08.947
which to the Catholic Spanish Crown

00:07:08.947 --> 00:07:12.348
was an important goal to convert

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:15.681
all of the world's people to Catholicism

00:07:16.643 --> 00:07:18.560
and also the protection

00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:24.777
of these Spanish feudal
lords or encomenderos.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:27.151
In practice the Encomiendas System

00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:30.678
was really just another
way of saying slavery

00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:34.268
and between the harsh
treatment of the Spanish lords

00:07:34.268 --> 00:07:38.221
and disease, the native
population of this region

00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:40.388
went from about 20 million

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.646
when the Spanish arrived
to only about two million

00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:50.512
by 1600, so that not
very long after conquest,

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.465
the Spanish began to
bring enslaved Africans

00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:55.038
to labor in the New World

00:07:55.038 --> 00:07:57.413
as the Native American
population had shrunk

00:07:57.413 --> 00:08:00.128
to a fraction of its former size.

00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:02.495
So, for the native people of Mexico

00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:05.584
the arrival of the Spanish
was about the worst outcome

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:08.461
of an alien invasion
that you could imagine.

00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:12.726
Now, native people did resist
the Spanish in many ways.

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:15.141
Some ways were more subtle

00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:18.787
like outwardly adopting Christianity

00:08:18.787 --> 00:08:22.954
while maintaining their
ancestral beliefs inwardly.

00:08:24.027 --> 00:08:27.527
The combination of Native American beliefs

00:08:29.653 --> 00:08:33.171
and Christianity together
is called syncretism

00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:37.139
or the blending of two
religious traditions

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:41.405
but sometimes the Spanish
pushed native people too far

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:44.699
as in the case of the
Pueblo Revolt in 1680

00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:46.880
when after a few generations

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.245
of being forced to shed all
of their religious beliefs

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:52.694
in favor of Christianity

00:08:52.694 --> 00:08:56.861
or face severe punishment,
the pueblo people rose up

00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.660
against the Spanish led
by a man named Pope,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.835
so that sometimes the
Pueblo Revolt is also called

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:09.419
Pope's Rebellion and they
killed Spanish priests,

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:13.233
burned churches, replaced them with kivas,

00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:14.941
their own place of worship

00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:16.509
and drove the Spanish out

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:18.968
so that in the next 50 years

00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:22.517
it took the Spanish to reestablish control

00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:24.555
of this region, the Spanish took

00:09:24.555 --> 00:09:28.604
a much more accommodating
approach to pueblo society.

00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:31.424
The last aspect of
Spanish colonial society

00:09:31.424 --> 00:09:34.983
that I wanna point out is
the racial caste system

00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:37.616
that developed in the New World.

00:09:37.616 --> 00:09:42.045
Because the conquistadors
were on dangerous adventures,

00:09:42.045 --> 00:09:45.604
very few Spanish women came
with them in the New World

00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:48.440
and so, Spanish men had relationships

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.688
with both native women and African women

00:09:51.688 --> 00:09:54.815
and Native Americans and
Africans had relationships

00:09:54.815 --> 00:09:58.085
such that there was
really an unprecedented

00:09:58.085 --> 00:10:02.002
mixing of peoples and
cultures in the New World

00:10:03.825 --> 00:10:07.992
and to account for this
incredibly diverse society

00:10:09.424 --> 00:10:12.385
the Spanish developed a caste system

00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:15.552
that very carefully ranked individuals

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:20.145
by how much Spanish blood they had

00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:24.164
so that people with pure Spanish blood,

00:10:24.164 --> 00:10:27.664
criollos were at the top of the hierarchy,

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:32.505
and people who had both
Native American heritage

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:37.377
and European heritage were
called mestizo at the time

00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:40.749
whereas people with European
heritage and African heritage

00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:42.852
were called mulatto at the time

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:46.859
and so, as you moved up or down this scale

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:49.107
you had more legal rights

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.430
than the groups below you

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.930
and this is what is
known as a casta painting

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.027
which very carefully categorized

00:10:59.027 --> 00:11:03.482
where every person fell
on this hierarchy of race,

00:11:03.482 --> 00:11:06.539
so we see in the Spanish caste system

00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:10.441
the beginnings of assigning legal status

00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.153
to individuals based on their race

00:11:13.153 --> 00:11:14.463
but I think it's also important

00:11:14.463 --> 00:11:17.363
to note here that the casta system

00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:20.873
made a place for many
different types of people

00:11:20.873 --> 00:11:23.458
in society and that
will be important later

00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:26.992
when we contrast it with
how English settlers

00:11:26.992 --> 00:11:28.548
treated Native Americans.

00:11:28.548 --> 00:11:30.978
The Spanish sought to Christianize

00:11:30.978 --> 00:11:34.946
and incorporate and enslave native people,

00:11:34.946 --> 00:11:39.038
whereas the English sought
to completely eradicate them

00:11:39.038 --> 00:11:40.078
from the landscape.
