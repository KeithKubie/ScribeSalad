MIHAI IONESCU: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.960
My name is Mihai Ionescu.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.030
PENG YING: And I'm Peng Ying.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.430
MIHAI IONESCU: And welcome to
another session of Google

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.560
Payments Live.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.860
This is our first office hour
since Google I/O, and we had

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.610
some very exciting announcements
at Google I/O.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.050
We'll do a recap of those, and
of course we'll go over

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.650
questions posted on our
moderator page.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.800
So, Peng, what happened on
Google I/O, and what kind of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.430
announcements do
you have there?

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.770
PENG YING: Cool.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.180
We made some huge announcements
at I/O. A few

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.030
things that we announced were
the Save to Wallet API which

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.550
allows you to save offers
your Wallet.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
And we announced a few
updates and new

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.970
features of In-App Payments.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.750
So I'll cover a few during our
session today, and then Mihai

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.020
is going to cover
a few as well.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.670
The new features and
functionality are, we launched

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.680
subscriptions.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.510
In addition to that,
we announced

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.150
a new pricing structure.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.800
So why don't you tell them what
the pricing structure is.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.530
MIHAI IONESCU: Sure.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.230
So we got a lot of feedback from
developers and merchants.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.080
They were really happy with our
5% pricing structure, one

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.600
of the most aggressive
in the industry.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.250
But we also heard that for
larger payments, they would

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.210
like to have a more flexible
structure that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.480
reflects larger amounts.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.250
So we're very happy to announce
that at Google I/O,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.480
we introduced a pricing
structure based on a 1.9% rate

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.150
plus a fixed amount and
a 5% rate depending

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.130
on the payment amount.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.170
So this will adjust
automatically to give

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.080
developers the most
favorable rate.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.400
PENG YING: Yeah, it's great.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.030
I mean it's great for a lot of
developers who are actually

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.280
choosing larger order values.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.830
So something like, for example,
one of the partners

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.120
who was presenting with us,
Kabam, they had an average

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.930
order size of something
like $45.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.560
And 5% isn't that great, but
1.9% and $0.30 is amazing.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.310
So I think if you go out and
you talk to credit card

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.225
processors, I think the lowest
fee that they typically give

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:31.450
out is somewhere around
1.9% and $0.30.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.900
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, so you
can't get better than that.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.090
And you'll notice that the
threshold where we switch from

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.030
5% to the 1.9% rate is around
$9 or so for US dollars.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.120
It will be different in other
currencies, so check which one

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.840
is best for you.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.060
PENG YING: Not to mention that
Google Wallet for digital

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.540
goods is a super easy
API to implement.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.190
So if you're thinking about
monetizing a web app now or

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.530
sometime soon, be sure to take
a look at the documentation.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.990
We're actually going to
go through some of the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.460
subscriptions, changes,
and JSON Web Token

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.130
documentation today.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.560
And the link for the
presentation that we gave at

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.930
I/O is bit.ly/gwdgslides.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.550
That's Google Wallet for
digital goods slides.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.820
And do you just want
to cover it now?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.260
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, sure.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.980
Let's go look at the slides--

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.240
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.320
PENG YING: Let's take a look
at the slides, specifically

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.400
the slides about what changed
before, how to add

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.780
subscriptions to your
JSON Web Token.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.020
MIHAI IONESCU: So let's
switch to the slides.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.270
PENG YING: Cool.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.930
What you see on the screen
right now is the JSON Web

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.380
Token that defines a
subscription item.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.190
If you're not familiar with
JSON Web Tokens, it's

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.690
basically a method to encode
some JSON and append a

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.050
signature to it.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.150
Because of the way the API
works, it's a JavaScript call

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.510
to initiate the purchase flow,
all of your information passes

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.430
through the client side.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.760
And in order to secure this
information on the client

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.170
side, we pretty much append a
signature or use a JSON Web

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.300
Token for our standard to append
a signature to the data

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.820
to make sure that it hasn't
been altered.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.420
What you're seeing here is the
item itself, an item that

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.510
defines a subscription item.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.020
And the differences are
highlighted in yellow.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.970
So here, the type is a
little bit different.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.420
It's a Google Payments In-App
subscription, and it's v1.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.180
And then, within the item
request itself, you're

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.420
defining the initial item,
like it could be initial

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.170
purchase, something like
prorated, or it could be a

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.690
free trial for a month,
or anything else.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.510
And then you're defining
the recurrence.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.350
Right now we only support
monthly frequency, but in the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.210
future, we hope to support a few
more different time cycles

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.310
like biweekly, annually,
weekly, daily.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.640
So we'll give a lot of different
options to the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.650
developers.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.980
Is there anything I'm
missing Mihai?

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.670
MIHAI IONESCU: I think
that covers it.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.510
So, as you can see, it's
very easy to implement

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.580
subscription.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.570
Once you've implemented the
single-item payment,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.920
subscription is just a matter
of adding a few lines to the

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.940
JWT and processing some
extra callbacks.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.870
Now why don't you talk a
little bit about the

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.900
difference in callbacks
for subscriptions.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.490
PENG YING: Sure.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.570
So there's one main difference
in the callback, and this

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.950
occurs when a subscription
is canceled.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.020
So when a user decides to cancel
a subscription within

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.010
their buyer center, you'll get
a notification on your server

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.810
saying that we can no longer
process the subscription.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.930
And your server should then end
their access to whatever

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.810
content that you were
providing them.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.550
So all this documentation
can be found on

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.120
our Developer's Guide.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.565
And the Developer's Guide can
be found at developers.googl

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:17.750
e.com/in-app-payments.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.670
Plural.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.220
So yeah, take a look at it.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.880
It's there if you're
interested.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.820
And it's really, really
easy to integrate.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.150
I mean, we can go through the
slides and then speak a little

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.120
bit to the integration, but it's
basically define the JSON

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.020
Web Token, call our JavaScript
library, and that initiates a

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.550
purchase flow.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.490
And there's some postback
handling, but that's really

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.270
easy as well.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.240
MIHAI IONESCU: Great, so, to
recap what we did at I/O. A

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.385
new pricing structure based on
feedback from developer.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.810
For larger transactions with
high order value, we now

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.290
charge 1.9% plus a fixed fee.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:08.000
And for microtransactions, it's
still 5%, and you will

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.590
get the most favorable
rate automatically.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.970
And of course, also based on
developer feedback and

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.040
requests, we added subscription
support, which

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.020
very simply and naturally can
be integrated with your

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.270
existing integration.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.610
Great.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.440
PENG YING: And there's more
coming, probably.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.740
MIHAI IONESCU: And there is
more coming, stay tuned.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.132
PENG YING: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:40.110
MIHAI IONESCU: So you can
start integrating

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.320
subscriptions right now.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.190
They are available
in the Sandbox.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:49.650
Very soon, we plan to release
them into production.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:56.100
If you have any issues, we have
a group where you can ask

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.470
questions or at our next office
hours session, we can

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.340
go over any of those issues.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.120
PENG YING: These are biweekly
by the way, so we'll be

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.640
covering any questions
that you have

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.260
about Google Payments.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.710
MIHAI IONESCU: Great,
so let's move on and

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.690
look at some questions.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.820
So questions that we got from
our moderator page.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.225
PENG YING: We can also talk
about Google developer

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:25.580
accounts, the other thing we
released at Google I/O.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.150
MIHAI IONESCU: So many new
things to talk about.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.580
So let's look at one
more thing here.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.980
So, also since I/O, we launched
a new site for

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.179
developers, which is called
Google Developer Academy.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.930
So it's at
developers.google.com/academy.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.260
And if you go there, you'll
find a lot tutorials and

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.110
courses covering all kinds
of Google APIs.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.130
And in particular for Google
Wallet, we have a new course

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.100
called Google Wallet for digital
goods, which gives you

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:09.860
a step-by-step tutorial on how
to integrate the API with your

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.800
web application.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.985
Very simple.

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:16.130
Go have a look just
for simple steps.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.850
And of course, we have a sample
app that will guide you

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.390
through all these steps.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.600
And in less than a day, you can
be set up and start making

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.840
some money.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.520
So
developers.google.com/academy.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.130
Right, so let's now take
some questions.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.620
PENG YING: Yeah, we're taking
some questions from the--

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.450
what was it called again?

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.780
MIHAI IONESCU: On our moderator
page, and maybe you

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.950
have some others from
other sources.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.200
So let's see.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.850
Since we've been talking about
subscriptions, we have a

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.680
couple about subscriptions,
so let's address those.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.440
So, for subscription,
is monthly the

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.950
only supported frequency?

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.750
PENG YING: Well, right
now, monthly is the

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.850
only supported frequency.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.270
Like I said, we're looking
to support

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.870
additional ones in the future.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.620
It's only in sandbox right now,
and I don't really know

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.255
the backend code that well, but
I imagine is like similar

00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:24.380
to setting up a separate job
or some time schedule.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.870
So it shouldn't be
too difficult.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.800
I guess we're trying to just
get it out in the wild and

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.060
have developers start
using it.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.090
MIHAI IONESCU: We'd also like to
hear some feedback on what

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.520
particular frequency would be
more useful for developers.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.560
Is it bimonthly, you want
to charge weekly?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.600
It would be great to know.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.520
PENG YING: Yeah, and I think
we'll also do something like

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.230
we will enable developers to
have a separate API call to

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.760
initiate their recurrence
requests.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.930
So you could say, oh I want to
make 12 recurrences, and then

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.700
you schedule it yourself.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.230
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:06.010
So also subscription related,
when are you launching the new

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.390
subscription API into
production?

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.830
When will that happen?

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.360
PENG YING: That's another
question, but because it's

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.240
Google, unfortunately we can't
share specific dates.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.290
But we know that's
coming very soon.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.140
I hope you all are
enjoying it.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.710
I hope you all are playing
around with it in Sandbox.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.150
And the API won't
change at all.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.050
So, in order to change a
production when production is

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.590
ready, all you have to do is
change production config in

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.590
the loader, and you have to
switch out your Seller ID and

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.610
Seller Secret when you're
defining your JSON Web Tokens.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.050
MIHAI IONESCU: So it may happen
sooner than you think.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.450
If you plan to have
subscriptions get ready,

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.265
implementing the Sandbox, and
then it'll be just a matter of

00:11:49.265 --> 00:11:52.660
flicking a switch to enable
it in production.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:12:01.590
All right, so one more
question related to

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.350
subscription.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.470
There's another one.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.710
Is Google Pay subscriptions a
solution for software as a

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.510
service application
subscriptions?

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.020
Sure.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.570
PENG YING: Yeah, sounds like
it should be fine.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.910
MIHAI IONESCU: Sounds
like a great fit.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.200
It depends, again, based on
the previous question, how

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.700
often do you want to charge
the customer?

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.520
But it sounds like an excellent
fit, and you can add

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.980
additional application and
additional subscriptions as

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.560
you see fit.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.980
So go play with it, and let
us know how it works.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.390
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.020
So Google Wallet for digital
goods had been optimized for

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.060
digital goods.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.740
I mean, if you're selling
something like a service, you

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.730
can also use it.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.780
It just depends on what
additional information you

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.710
need to provide within the
purchase experience that

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.420
sometimes Google Wallet
for digital goods

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.910
may or may not support.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.380
But I think in this case, where
they're trying to sell

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.140
software as a service, that it
should be completely fine.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.800
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.910
OK, so we covered the
subscription questions.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:10.640
Let's take one about
currencies.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:17.000
So, one developer says his
merchant account is in euros,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.850
but he would like to charge
users in a different currency,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.170
probably in another European
country which does not use the

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.950
euro currency.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.210
Is that possible?

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.610
So let's take an example.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.780
Let's say you are in euros and
you want to charge in British

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.470
pounds, so from euro to GBP.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.150
Yes, it is possible, and you
can find the available

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.160
currencies listed in
our documentation.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.950
You would just need to specify
the new currency in the JWT

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.320
when you place the
payment request.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.550
What will happen, the user
will be charged in that

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.120
particular currency, let's
say British pounds.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.820
And on his credit card
statements, everything will be

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.640
in British pounds.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.830
You, however, will receive the
payout in your local currency,

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.570
which in this case is euros,
and the transaction, the

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.310
exchange, will happen
automatically at the best rate

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.770
of the day.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.350
So you don't have to worry
about any of those.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.010
You just have to make sure you
charge the user in the amount

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.280
you want in his local currency,
and then you will

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.260
automatically get the funds in
the currency of your account.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.990
Everything happening
transparently at the

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.800
best rate for you.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.150
PENG YING: And we pull something
like every hour,

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.430
every two hours, against the
forex rate, so we typically

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:44.340
have pretty decent rates,
pretty accurate rates.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.390
MIHAI IONESCU: OK, let's
get another one.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.400
We have a couple of questions
about adding other debit,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.280
credit cards to the Google
Wallet account.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.580
I'm not sure if this is related
to the Google Payments

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:09.050
API or just the in-store
Wallet account.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.720
PENG YING: So I think that one
may be for adding additional

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.120
cards into the offline wallet,
into NFC wallet.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.520
That's what it sounds like.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.360
That is another good question.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.460
I mean, we're always trying to
expand the availability and

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.090
usability of Wallet.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.860
Right now, it's Citi
MasterCards, but we are

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.870
looking to expand.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:38.340
I would say to stay tuned for
announcements in the future.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.270
I mean, this is Google, we can't
pre-announce anything.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.840
I'd love to be like, yes.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.760
But we'll see what comes
down the road.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.000
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.390
And with Payments right now,
users can use their credit

00:15:54.390 --> 00:16:01.230
card or debit card for
the online API.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:06.090
PENG YING: Online Payments
supports all credit cards, all

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.400
major networks.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.380
It's just the offline NFC
portion that is limited to

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.150
Citi Mastercards right now.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.280
MIHAI IONESCU: And of course,
we're looking to add new forms

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:21.550
of payment to both, including
local forms of payment.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.820
Good, so we covered that.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.070
Let's see.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.920
There's a question about
using Google

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.710
Wallet on a rooted phone.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.520
So I think that one has been
also answered in the past.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.990
We strongly recommend not to
install or use Google Wallet

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.840
on a rooted phone.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.880
The reason is, when you root the
phone, you remove an extra

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.730
layer of security.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:59.500
So of course, you can use it,
but then you have to know

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.080
what's happening on your
phone, and you'll be

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.374
responsible for any applications
trying to steal

00:17:06.374 --> 00:17:08.690
your PIN or do stuff
like that.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.950
So the short answer
is, don't do it.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.020
Use Google Wallet on
a non-rooted phone

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.369
for your own security.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.220
OK, we have anything else?

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.160
PENG YING: I don't know.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.410
Are there any more questions?

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.870
MIHAI IONESCU: They're along the
same lines about loyalty

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.600
cards to Google Wallet.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.730
So as we said, we are
looking into that

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.160
and plan to add those.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.840
PENG YING: So right now, the
loyalty card world is kind of

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.310
interesting.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.820
There's a lot of different
providers, a lot of different

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.030
proprietary systems.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.630
So we're still investigating
different possibilities of

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.060
loyalty cards for
offline Wallet.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.690
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.150
I think this is it for this
week, and we'll see you back

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.390
again in two weeks.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.600
PENG YING: Yeah, so just a note,
we'll be doing a couple

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.280
different formats.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.190
And sometimes we'll invite some
people from the risk team

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.460
here so they can answer
questions about, what are

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.040
risky transactions, how
do I minimize my risky

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.230
transactions?

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.120
Why are some of my orders
canceled, and

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.340
so on and so forth.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.710
In addition to that, we'll
probably review some of the

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.170
applications that we find
really good or that are

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.460
monetizing very well, and then
invite them in to speak with

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.560
them about their experiences.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.570
So, stay tuned.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.420
We'll be on every two weeks,
every other week.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.820
Post any questions
that you have.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.280
Tell us what you want, and we
will try to fill your needs.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.040
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.600
Bye.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.850
PENG YING: Cool, see you.
