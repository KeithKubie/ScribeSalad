00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.810
One attack on confidentiality is called eavesdropping,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.700
where an attacker, Eve, might gain unauthorized

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.340
access to information being sent between Alice

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.280
and Bob. So for example, if Alice and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.820
Bob were chatting on instant message, or if Alice sends an email to Bob, the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.980
potential exists In other words, there's a threat that Eve might be able to hear

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.730
that communication. There are various packet sniffing

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.320
tools, such as wireshark and tcpdump, that

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.570
set a machine's networking interface card into

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.790
what's called promiscuous mode. If Alice, Bob,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.610
and Eve are on the same local area network Where packets are being flooded.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.800
For example, if they where being connected

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.330
by a hub that flooded all packets everywhere,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.700
or if the learning switch did not have an entry for Alice or Bob then Eve might

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.040
be able to hear some of those packets.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.880
If the network interface card is in promiscuous mode.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.110
Than Eve's machine will be able to capture

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.350
some of the packets that are being exchanged between

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.460
Alice and Bob. Its worth thinking about how different

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.340
types of traffic might reveal important information about communication.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.345
For example, the ability to see DNS

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.800
look-ups would provide the attacker information about, say,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.650
what websites you're visiting. The ability to capture

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.040
packet headers might give the attacker information, not

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.920
only about where you're exchanging traffic, but what

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.450
types of applications you're using. And the ability

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.940
to see a full packet payload would allow

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.930
an attacker to effectively see every single thing

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.260
that you are sending on the network. Including

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.620
content you're exchanging with other people. Such as private

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.450
message, email communication, and so forth. Given the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.160
ability to see a packet, Eve might not only

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.690
listen to that packet, but might also modify

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.150
it and re-inject it into the network, potentially after

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.350
altering the state of the packet. If additionally Eve

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.030
could suppress the original message Let's consider an attack

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.960
on authenticity. If, in addition to being able to observe packets that traverse

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.610
the network, Eve could re-inject packets after

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.880
having modified them, and suppress Alice's original

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.660
message, then Eve could effectively impersonate Alice.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.320
This is sometimes called a 'Man in

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.280
the Middle' attack. Alice could also make it appear as though this message came

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.040
from Alice. In which case, the attack would be an attack on message integrity.
