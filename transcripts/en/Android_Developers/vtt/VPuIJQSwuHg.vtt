00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.759
&gt;&gt;Reto: Welcome to The App Clinic at the brand
new time of 10:30 AM, Mountain View time.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:16.759
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.060
&gt;&gt;Reto: My name's Reto Meier.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I'm still asleep.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.619
[Reto laughs]

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.140
But if I were awake, I would be Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.140
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.750
And today we're gonna take a look at photography
and camera apps in The App Clinic.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.750
We've got a good

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.789
range of apps to look at.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:31.949
In fact, these are them.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.140
We've got EyeEm, PicsArt, Glimmr and Camera
Zoom FX.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: I've really been looking forward to
these, Reto, 'cause I know we're both photographers,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.680
or I should say you're a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.119
photographer and I own a camera.

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:45.119
[Reto laughs]

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:47.909
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think it's probably fair to say
I also own a camera.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.330
Actually, our erstwhile engineer, Mr. Daniel
Pham, is

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.869
probably--I think it's fair to say--a photographer.

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:55.869
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's quite true.

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.710
He takes all the pictures for our promotional
videos.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.930
And in fact, I was so confident in his ability
that the photos that we're gonna look at,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.930
I actually

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.979
sent him around this morning with our demo
device to take some photos of stuff so we

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.880
would have some decent examples to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880
show people.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: Excellent.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.460
And just to be clear, our demo device today
is a Galaxy Nexus, right?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.550
&gt;&gt;Reto: It is, indeed.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.550
Yes.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.770
&gt;&gt;Dan: I don't wanna disappoint you guys,
but I really just took photos of the studio.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.020
So, maybe the viewers will have a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.110
good time looking at some behind the scenes
photos of how messy it really is in here.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.110
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.560
Well, I assume that they're gonna be highly
artistic and well-filtered photos of our studio.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.760
So, I guess

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.770
we should kick off.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.770
Let's do it.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, as per usual, we're gonna go through
each of the apps, give them a two to five

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.979
minute overview before having

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.370
a look at what we think the key is to making
a really great camera and photography app,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.840
and some links to some developer

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.450
resources that should help you to be able
to take your app to that next level.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.040
So let's start off with EyeEm.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040
And this is

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.870
a team that has actually worked with some
of our developer advocates over in London,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.870
I think.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.920
Rich Hyndman or Hyndman, or

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.950
however we have decided to say his name today
has been working with these guys and giving

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.950
them some advice.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.950
So, let's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.040
take a look and see how it looks.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.400
By the way, I noticed the QR codes are back.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400
Check that out.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: Indeed.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.329
&gt;&gt;Ian: Someone always complains when we don't
have the QR codes.

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.010
&gt;&gt;Reto: This is true.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.779
&gt;&gt;Ian: Getting used to it now.

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:26.779
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.499
I've noticed that our Chroma Key is slightly
off as well.

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.689
So, we don't have quite the background that
we should

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:31.689
there, but--.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:32.689
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, is that what happened?

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.689
I thought maybe you just chose to--

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:34.689
&gt;&gt;Reto: To leave it off?

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.689
&gt;&gt;Ian: get rid of the--.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:36.689
&gt;&gt;Reto: No.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.689
&gt;&gt;Ian: 'Cause Roman was, you know?

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.689
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true.

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.689
But Roman is a trendsetter.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.909
And I don't think I'm quite up to that level.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:41.909
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's true.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:42.909
We are always following Roman.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:43.909
In fact, all I did--.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.090
So, I did the intro video for today.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.220
&gt;&gt;Reto: That was awesome by the way.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: Thank you.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.389
It's all Roman.

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.400
All Roman's artwork.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400
[Reto laughs]

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.930
So, if we can switch to the phone shot, we'll
take a look at--.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.579
I can see it now.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.579
There you go.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.579
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.579
&gt;&gt;Reto: So this is, this is Em.

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.390
So, we've, as you can see, folks, we have
removed the backwards facing camera and we're

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.499
doing HDMI.

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.549
Ooh, Chroma Key is almost right.

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.639
No.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.639
Not gonna work.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.639
&gt;&gt;Dan: Alright, guys.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.639
I'm trying.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.639
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's alright.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.639
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's alright.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.639
It's beautiful.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.639
&gt;&gt;Reto: We'll let you continue to do that.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.639
So, but what you've got up here is EyeEm.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.769
So what it is, is basically what

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:21.769
you'd expect.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.159
It's an app which lets you take photographs.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.900
It lets you apply filters to them.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.400
And it has a community for

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.959
sharing those photos with your friends, I
think particularly on Twitter and Facebook.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.359
It's got the links for that

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.689
directly.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.540
So you can see here, your front page is basically
what you would expect.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.670
It's a rolling list view of all of the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.519
photos that your friends have taken.

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.370
And one of the things which they've done quite
well here is they've got these tabs,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.400
these tab labels that you can see here.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.049
&gt;&gt;Reto: And so, as people are tagging them,
you can go, "Oh, actually I'd be interested

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.419
to see more photos from Sam

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.349
Benedetto del Tronto."

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.230
You click that and it will take you to a bunch
of other things--show you on a map where it's

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.610
at and all the other photos by him.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, that's very cool, yeah.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: I quite like that.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.099
So, this passes a big test of mine, which
is "can you get lost in the app?"

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.099
Are you gonna

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.099
spend a lot of time going, "Oh, cool.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.949
I wanna see more of those sorts of photos
from those sorts of people."

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:13.949
One of the

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.030
really key features of this app, which I really
wanted to highlight, is they've done a really

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.919
good job on the UI of the

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:19.919
actual picture display.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.830
You can see here they've got this heterogeneous
list view, or grid view I suppose it is.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mm-hmm.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.180
&gt;&gt;Reto: And you can see here, we've got different
sized images all coming together to create

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.819
something which is quite

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.230
compelling to look at.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.240
And again, you can click through to each of
these.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.030
Now this isn't a particularly well-accelerated
list view, though.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.030
It feels a little janky.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.030
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's a little janky, yeah.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.030
Absolutely.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'll say that's one thing.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.740
So, Dan Galpin's actually been working for
about a year on some new techniques for

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.520
doing faster list view rendering for photos.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.940
And hopefully one of these days, he'll actually
get that released.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.190
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's right.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.190
Yeah.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.190
This is a nice shot.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.190
This is the Googleplex.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.190
Although, it says Googleplex 46.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.190
It's not.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.190
It's

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.190
Googleplex 44.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.050
And in fact, we are in the room just above
the honeycomb.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.050
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's right.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.050
Just here.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.050
We're in here.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.050
So you can wave to us.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.460
If you're here at the right time, we would
love to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.409
have people holding signs outside the window.

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:14.409
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:15.409
&gt;&gt;Reto: That would be cool.

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: We're on the second floor, so that
would be insanely cool if they were right

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:18.970
outside the window.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: What?

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.970
You think our fans don't own ladders?

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.290
Do you think they don't have the dedication
it takes?

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.290
&gt;&gt;Ian: I assume they own jetpacks.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.290
&gt;&gt;Reto: Do you think that we don't have fans?

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.290
Hmm.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.290
It could be a problem.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.290
Anyway.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.789
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, I'll tell you the first thing that
strikes me about this app is this button down

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:34.870
here.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.870
It looks like maybe

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.150
that's how I'm gonna take a picture.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.150
&gt;&gt;Reto: It is.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.689
And you can see, I think if you're on a different
phone, maybe a Galaxy S2 or something, you

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:45.689
would think this

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:47.099
is a pretty cool design.

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:52.210
Once you get onto one of these no-button phones,
you realize this is actually kind of a bad

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.210
idea.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.010
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's very close, very, very close
to your 'home' button.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.010
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.099
It's very close to the 'home' button.

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.190
It's very similar to the action that you're
gonna use to bring up

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.569
Google Now.

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.131
There's a lot of things that you can screw
up with the camera button here.

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.979
And that's, as we've mentioned

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.660
before, that's one of the reasons that we
discourage tabs on the bottom because you

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.449
can very easily get mixed up with

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.090
that bottom row of buttons.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.569
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:19.569
&gt;&gt;Ian: So.

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.020
And, of course, they do also have a 'menu'
button down here, which is--.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: And this is the confusing thing because
they have something which looks a lot like

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.189
an action bar which has a

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.189
'menu' button.

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.080
And if you click that, you do get an overflow
menu.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.189
And so they've done this thing where you've
still got

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:35.689
the 'menu' button and that brings up the drop
down.

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: I wonder if they're using something
like Action Bar Sherlock and then they're

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.530
not setting the API level high

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.530
enough.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.409
Because we actually don't document this correctly.

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.449
It's changed since the Docs were released.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.050
You can't absolutely guarantee that that thing
will go away until your API level is 15.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.129
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, right.

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:56.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: And we had originally said all that.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.130
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.539
So, make sure it's up to it.

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.340
I thought 14, but let's make it 15 and just
be safe.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mm-hmm.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.340
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, that's one thing.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.720
You can get rid of that really easily 'cause
it'll come back for devices which don't have,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.419
which do have hard 'menu' button.

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:11.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.699
&gt;&gt;Reto: So the other call-out that I wanted
to mention here is that they have implemented

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:17.699
the Draw Pattern.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:18.699
And I'm pretty

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:20.749
sure they're aware that this isn't quite the
right Draw Pattern, but I wanted to put it

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:22.129
out there for other people who

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:23.129
may be watching.

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:24.129
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:29.259
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, this is following that prototype
G+ model where the action bar all shifts across

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:30.270
and you can see that here.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.159
So, everything's moved across.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:35.849
The right model is actually the way YouTube
does it, which is that your action bar is

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:36.909
consistent.

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:40.860
So all of the--oops--all the stuff here along
your action bar, this should stay here no

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.860
matter what.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.860
And

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.949
rather than having a draw icon, you would
have your application icon or logo with an

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:48.090
up affordance.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.090
So then, clicking

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.189
that will then leave everything here as it
is and then just have this side part here

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:54.189
slide out.

00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:55.189
So in the same way, but

00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:58.039
still having the action bar along the top.

00:07:58.039 --> 00:07:59.921
And I think, so that's the right way to do
it.

00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:00.921
And that's all listed in the

00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:02.949
design patterns on Android design.

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:03.949
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.449
And again, it's not that these guys got it
wrong.

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:07.699
It's that there wasn't a design pattern.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:08.699
Now there is.

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:11.630
&gt;&gt;Reto: [chuckles] If they followed an example,
which turns out we decide it wasn't quite

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.630
the right example.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.889
So, I'll tell you this is driving me crazy
'cause I'll tell you.

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:17.659
So, we have two options.

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:18.659
You can scoot

00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:19.659
over or we can move the camera.

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:20.949
&gt;&gt;Reto: I can scoot.

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:22.590
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.590
Wow.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.620
Reto does not want to move the camera I think.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.949
&gt;&gt;Reto: Leave the camera alone, Ian.

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:28.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.400
I fixed it last week and now it's back up
and not fixed again.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.400
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hey, guys.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.729
Please don't touch my stuff.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:34.729
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alrighty.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:35.729
[Reto laughs]

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:37.529
&gt;&gt;Reto: So otherwise, things here work as
you'd expect.

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:39.120
You have the ability to 'like'.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.849
A nice little animation comes up

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:41.849
there.

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:42.849
You can add comments.

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:46.220
They've got a pretty custom UI here with their
own custom buttons, but it's consistent

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.220
throughout.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220
There's a color scheming.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.560
There's a design ethos here, which I think
works.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.560
It passes the--.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.560
Is it different?

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.560
Yeah.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.560
Does it look good?

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560
Yes.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.560
Let's try the share here.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.110
&gt;&gt;Ian: What I probably would've liked to see,
what--?

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.720
&gt;&gt;Reto: Standard share intent.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.540
Probably would've liked to see the actual
'share' button.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.580
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's something that I think people
are getting used to.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.610
And as we use that more, it becomes a consistent
way to

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:21.330
say "I want to share something that's agnostic
to services or what's hot this week."

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.430
I think we've said it before.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.430
If

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.280
this phone had been designed five years ago,
everybody would have MySpace buttons.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280
[chuckles]

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: And we'd all feel like fools, wouldn't
we?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.790
The other thing is, what is flag?

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think for inappropriate things.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, I see.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.370
Gotcha.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.370
OK.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.370
Flag it for nudity, yeah.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: There is a naked Android right there.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:47.810
Yeah, and I love this, the animation that
you got to work that I can't.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: This is the problem when you have
touch targets which are less than 48 pixels.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.000
People have trouble hitting them.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: Small-fingered Reto wins again.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720
&gt;&gt;Reto: Boom.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, the only thing that I miss is I
feel like I'd like to see that carried out

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.370
everywhere.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sure.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:11.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's always so sad when you see a beautiful
user interface and it's been lovingly crafted

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.140
and then you get to the

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.580
point where like, the world ends and everything
stops and you realize they ran out of time

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.350
and it's just a normal Android

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.700
system dialog.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.780
And it's not just Android that does this.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:29.320
I've got plenty of apps on my PC that do this,
but I think that

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.470
especially for an app like this it's all about
beauty.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.810
It's worth taking the extra time to make sure
that the entire

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:39.820
interface follows whatever design theme you've
chosen, whether that's the stock Android design

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.820
or something completely

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.820
different.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.820
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.850
So, let's have a quick look at the photo-taking
functionality before moving on.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.130
So we'll start using the

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.450
camera 'cause otherwise it starts to get a
little bit confusing.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.600
Oh, yeah it does work.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600
Nice.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, wow.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.130
That's awesome.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.130
[pause]

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.130
&gt;&gt;Reto: Boom.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.590
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a winner.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.230
That's your new--.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's my new album cover.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.300
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.620
I guess that's a tick.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, it's just a mole.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.470
[Reto laughs]

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: And so we can go through here and
apply all of the usual hipster filters.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.130
Let's see if we can make you even more

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.370
jaundiced 'cause I think that's kind of awesome.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.370
There we go.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a win.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.010
So, what you'd expect except that it stopped
there.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.600
So, that's a bug.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.120
Let's report that to the guys

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120
so that they--.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: That could be any number of things.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: What build are you running on this?

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.660
&gt;&gt;Reto: Whatever the latest public release
is.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: The stock retail?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.800
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.800
Alright.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.800
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, let's move on.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.800
So, that's EyeEm.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: Awesome.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800
&gt;&gt;Reto: A really popular app.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.510
Got a lot of great comments on the moderator
link for that one.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.680
So, we will be returning to

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.670
this later on when we look at the prescriptions
for a great app.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.860
But definitely a good start.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.860
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's take a look at PicsArts.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.860
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.860
Loading PicsArt.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.860
Alright.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.600
Let's open that up.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.700
So, right off the bat, we get the 'follow
us on Twitter.'

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.560
This doesn't come up every time the activity
launches, but it comes up often enough to

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.110
be a pain, particularly 'cause all

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.440
you have there is a 'follow' button.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.350
And you can hit back to cancel it, but we're
kind of anti-dialogs to begin with.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:26.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: And we're anti forcing people to do
things to help verify your own brand.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.510
"Go rate me in the Store five stars,"

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.510
that sort of thing.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.520
And "Follow us on Twitter?"

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.880
By all means have a Twitter account which
people can follow for news, but

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.640
trying to force them to do so?

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.510
It's overly attached girlfriend being.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.370
It's like, "Follow me."

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.370
No.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.370
This isn't cool.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.370
Like,

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.370
people will find it.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.890
Make it easy for them to do it, but you don't
need quite that much validation.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, actually, yeah.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.270
It is a little desperate.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.520
OK, so they've got this nice like, what do
you call this?

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.520
It's

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.160
like a city UI or some sort of urban UI.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: I guess, yeah.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.760
Suburban area UI, something like that.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:12.430
So, it's an interesting pattern.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:18.640
I probably would have maybe taken out some
of these.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: It makes it kind of busy.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680
There's a lot going on there.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.000
&gt;&gt;Reto: It reminds me a little of--.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.120
It's a shop.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.240
That's interesting.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: But in general, really nice.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.760
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: I mean, the colors are nice and bright.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.410
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's got an appealing look.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.410
OK.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.410
So, what can you do with PicsArt?

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.410
&gt;&gt;Reto: What can you do?

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.690
So, let's have a flick through.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.370
So basically, it's, no data?

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.000
That's just nice.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.280
So, basically

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.620
it's a combination of a few different kinds
of camera apps.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.410
So you can take your photos and apply hipster
filters.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.410
[Ian sneezes]

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: Excuse me.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.090
&gt;&gt;Reto: Which we'll do.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.540
Once again, let's try and get--.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's get Dan.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.180
Yeah.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.180
[pause]

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.180
&gt;&gt;Reto: There we go.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.180
Very nice.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.110
So you can take your photos and apply your
hipster filters as you would normally expect.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.230
And it's got a good selection of you know,
different standard things.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.660
And you can actually do quite a lot here in
terms of applying different kinds of presets.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.660
Eventually.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.660
Maybe.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: It does seem to be taking a long time
but I do like their little rotating status

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.560
bar.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.560
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, and this is one of those things
too, where they're obviously not using the

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.410
stock Android art but it is part of their
branding.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.410
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: And you know, I know we harp on this
a lot but we get this question a lot, you

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:37.220
know people bring us an app that uses some-
Let's call a spade a spade, sometimes they'll

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.440
pull in assets directly from the iPhone-

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: - or Windows Mobile.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.540
And they'll say, well, that's just the way
our designers like it.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.540
And I think that's not really cool.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.400
I mean first off, it's not Android but second
off, it's not yours.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.480
It's somebody else's stuff.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's right.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: But when you take something that Android
provides and then make it completely yours,

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.900
so it works exactly the same, you know has
the little cycling colors so that you know

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.380
what's going on but has your branding in it?

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.380
I think that's great.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.380
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: I wish that more apps would do that.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.380
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.530
And then you get the advantage of having that
consistency across all the versions of your

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.960
app and everything else.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now we also have the very consistent--.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.260
You know, this should be a built in control
right now-

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: You're right.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: -the hipster strip.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: And they've actually got like a bunch
of different ones.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.900
So they've got the standard effects that you're
applying there.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:29.360
And you can actually modify the degree of
each of these which is nice as well.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.850
Let's see, apply that and then I think you
can go through and apply a bunch of different

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.850
kind of filters.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.800
So they've got the distortion filters, they've
got you know all those different things.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.530
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think it's really interesting that
compared to some of the other apps that we've

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:47.690
looked at, this app is really slow at applying
filters and I wonder if it's because they're

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.530
not taking advantage of acceleration.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:58.380
In Android, especially in Honeycomb and above,
you can use RenderScript or you can use the

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.990
GPU to accelerate this sort of thing.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.230
And this is- most of these filters just boil
down to convolutions of one kind or another.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.290
So you can- and Java is just not good at convolutions
at all.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:16.480
Its memory layout is wrong, it doesn't have
access to SIMD floating point instructions.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.040
I don't even think it has access in non-strict
floating point instructions which means you're

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.550
gonna be abiding by IEEE standards and getting
into all sorts of performance problems.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:33.130
So you really, really, really don't want to
write your filter code in Java or even in

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:38.900
just generic C++, you really wanna be using
NEON or- for the best compatibility actually

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.120
just write it in OpenGL.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.250
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.410
So let's um- we'll click through.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.040
So we've all seen this sort of thing beforehand,
so if you hit OK then you have a bunch of

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040
options.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.840
You can upload it to PicsArts, save it to
the SD card, Tweet it, export it a whole bunch

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840
of things.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.350
Now, personally I would kind of prefer if
it just did something sensible by default.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.300
Maybe save it to the SD card and then take
me back to a page where it just displays all

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.430
the things that I've saved and allow me to
share or add to a timeline or whatever from

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:04.430
there.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:05.570
Rather than asking for this explicit thing.

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well and this- it seems like a lot
of people get this wrong.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:14.100
In a mobile app- and Reto you had a great
talk about this at Google I/O, you have the

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.620
opportunity to make your app work like magic.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.280
Forget about saving and loading and knowing
what file paths are and all sorts of things

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.290
like that.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.640
If you look at good mobile apps, they just
always work.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:31.290
They do what the user probably wants and they
give the user a way to back out if it's not

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.290
what they wanted.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:37.640
So, it shouldn't be about saving, it should
be about deleting things that have already

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.090
been saved because everything gets saved.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.090
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.640
You know, you don't have this problem anymore
where you've got a totally really, really

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.941
limited amount of storage and one or two extra
photos are gonna kill you.

00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:47.920
You can take a lot of photos before it's a
problem.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.120
&gt;&gt;Reto: You know back in the day where, you
know back in the DOS days where the only thing

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.910
you had to identify a file was its filename
and its extension and so then you had to create

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.040
these complex hierarchical folder structures
in order to be able to find anything.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.170
So you're basically creating metadata out
of a file system.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.340
These days you can use the metadata, you can
display the photos you can do all that stuff.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:12.010
&gt;&gt;Ian: I dare say almost no one knows or cares
what the file names are for their photos now.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.010
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.250
Particularly not on your mobile where- see
this is all a little bit confusing.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.760
See I've already saved it and just took me
back here-

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.120
&gt;&gt;Reto: So I'm just gonna hit close and assume
it's kept it somewhere.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: Good luck.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.140
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.110
So then it takes us back to the photos, we
can continue taking photos or hit back again-

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: So they've done their own kind of camera
view, too.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: They have.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.790
So, they've done it completely from scratch.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:40.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: That one- Yeah I'm not as excited about
this just because I feel like this isn't quite

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.340
as much their branding.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.430
I mean, I look at these icons and I'm like
yeah I think I've seen those somewhere before.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:46.520
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah and they're really small-

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: They really are.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.870
&gt;&gt;Reto: -and they're not particularly high
res either.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.170
I can see a little bit of mess around some
of the vector art.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:57.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, Galaxy Nexus is always a good
test case for finding out if you've got the

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.300
right resources because it's a 720p phone.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.060
And same thing for I think Galaxy s3, Galaxy
s2 are the same resolution.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:11.590
So it's an extremely high resolution display
and if you're just thinking to yourself, "oh

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.500
these things look good on a four inch display"
that's not always true if you're on this-

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.930
one of these xhdpi devices.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: So the other little thing I want to
point real quick is that you're hiding my

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.090
status bar which is pain.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:27.671
Because we've now been going on for 15 minutes
about this app and I don't know-so please

00:19:27.671 --> 00:19:30.150
don't, please, please I beg of you, do not
hide my status bar.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.680
I want to know what time it is, I wanna to
see my emails coming in.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.040
That is actually more important than your
app.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.823
&gt;&gt;Ian: If you must hide the status bar at
least let me tap and get it back.

00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:39.823
&gt;&gt;Reto: Something to get it back.

00:19:39.823 --> 00:19:40.823
Yeah.

00:19:40.823 --> 00:19:43.830
Like it's fine if you've got like a gallery
view and I wanna look at my photos in fullscreen

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.860
and flick through it, sure.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.540
But you know, give me that tap ability to
get things back.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:53.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, couple apps that do this really
well are the ereaders, so Google Play Books,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.730
Amazon Kindle.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.800
Both have really good status bar hiding and
showing functionality.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.150
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.500
See if we can get data, so I don’t know
if we- apparently can.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.640
OK so we've got some here.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.880
So we can see this is the community aspect
of it.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:12.031
This is less janky in terms of the scroll
but we're still seeing a reasonable amount

00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:14.250
of time taken to load each of the pictures
here.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, it's tough to get around that
because we've got network latency, we’ve

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.540
got the decoding.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.640
These are probably not small bitmaps.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: And that's kinda the question here,
is that-

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.972
&gt;&gt;Ian: And you can see actually once things
end in cache.

00:20:28.972 --> 00:20:29.972
&gt;&gt;Reto: So the caching is good.

00:20:29.972 --> 00:20:30.972
It's keeping them there, which is nice.

00:20:30.972 --> 00:20:37.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think of the apps that I've looked
at, these guys are doing exactly the right

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.580
thing.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's right.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: You can't overcome the laws of physics,
but-

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: Really?

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.170
Or are you just not trying hard enough?

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, well.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.200
They're trying pretty hard actually.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.200
This-

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200
&gt;&gt;Reto: No, it does look pretty good.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200
[unintelligible]

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.010
&gt;&gt;Ian: it's very hard to see on the video,
on YouTube but this is an extremely smooth

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.010
scrolling experience.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.010
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: The flinging is just right-

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.750
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's got the right physics, yeah.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, it's all good.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:04.860
So, Bravo.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: And you click through, and so this
is a good experience.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.070
You're swiping, swipe left right and you can
see here the physics are right.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:17.020
It's moving at the same speed as my finger
but then I can just do a quick flick and it

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.020
feels about right.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.300
So they've done a good job.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: And they've got the pinch to zoom.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.200
And then it's always an interesting question
what do you do once you've pinched to zoom-

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.230
&gt;&gt;Reto: And get to the edge.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: But this seems fine.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: I like that.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: I like the idea of once I get to the
edge of the picture – as long as I'm able

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.240
to take it back and undo my swipe across,
I think that's the right approach.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm actually wondering if there's any
chance that these guys are actually using

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.370
Dan Galpin's library because it does exactly
this.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.370
[Reto laughs]

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: That is exactly this behavior.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: Possibly.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.750
Or Dan's maybe seen this and used it as a
basis.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Quite possibly.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.750
Yeah.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.670
But yeah I think that these guys are doing
everything right as far as- the physics there

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.020
are a little bit-

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: It gets a little funny once you're
bouncing off the edge.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: wheeee wheeee

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.050
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's too much fun for this time
of day.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.550
And again we've kinda got the- this is interesting.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:10.130
So now we've got the menu button on the action
bar here, but they've still got legacy button

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.900
down here and that does absolutely nothing.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.830
So that's now confusing because it's ambiguous.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: So at the very least, I mean really
the right solution here is get rid of this.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.690
Set your target SDK to 15.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.690
You know, at the very least.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:23.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: Or set it to 16 now.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.850
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.800
It should always be the latest version, that's
a good tip for you guys as well.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.000
Always tie with the latest SDK, there's really
no reason not to.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
It voids your app.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well the only possible reason not to
is if you have no confidence that your app

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:42.790
works on the latest SDK and you're unable
to test on any new device or new emulator.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.790
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: So I would have sympathy with, let's
say hard core video apps-

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sure.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: - that are trying to do streaming that's
only been supported recently.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: And is still a little buggy.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.910
But in general, your UI should support the
latest SDK app.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.960
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright, so let's jump out of this
cause I'm not actually sure how much time

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.960
we've spent.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.030
But let's have a look at Glimmr.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.310
So Glimmr's a little bit different.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.991
This is not a sort of standard camera replacement
app.

00:23:09.991 --> 00:23:12.750
This is actually a app to browse Flickr.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:20.000
So, in terms of functionality, much more simplistic
here, you basically sign into your Flickr

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.940
account and then you can scroll all the pictures.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.880
What does Daniel Pham have to say about ricers?

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.880
[laughter]

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.340
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was like that, alright?

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, looks like you know how to party.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: That was actually at I/O last year,
not this year but-

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, cause this year it was Train
and nobody was partying.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:47.220
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, I was close enough to Dave Navarro's
leg to almost reach out and grab him.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.550
Decided that that was probably not a good
idea.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: You decided that was probably be a
problem considering the restraining order.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, well yeah.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.860
So for those of you who didn't make it to
I/O-

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.860
&gt;&gt;Reto: This is what it looked like.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: -feast your eyes on some of these shots.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.620
&gt;&gt;Reto: There's Mr. Galpin.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yeah, without his beard.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.030
&gt;&gt;Reto: Beardless Galpin.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a little scary.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.680
&gt;&gt;Ian: It is.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.340
[silly voice] The Master is having a party
tonight.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: Overall, it's a nice effect, again
you've got the nice smooth swiping between

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.450
items.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.690
You've got the standard action bar along the
top here which behaves in the way that it

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.690
should.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.580
You've got the refresh icon which works in
place.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.950
Again probably no need for an explicit refresh
as a primary action just because your photos

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.210
aren't going to be updating that quickly.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.420
You can probably get away with coming up with
some sort of sensible refresh model.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now you know what I love about this
app?

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.330
&gt;&gt;Reto: Please.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: This page right here.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.990
This is exactly what a photos oriented list
view should look like.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: Right.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: Look at this they've done a great job-

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's all images.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.480
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's all images.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:52.280
They've overlaid text that looks nice, it's
big enough, it's readable.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:58.040
Now, one thing that I haven't seen, I haven’t
seen any photo that is just really really

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.300
bad for text.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.300
Well, there's one.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, but you can see that they-

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: But you can see that yeah, they've
overlaid some – it could be a little darker

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.240
on this one.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.240
Exactly.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240
That's the whole idea really.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: You make the photo everything.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:19.940
Don’t put little drop shadows behind it,
don't put bars between it, don't shrink the

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.380
photo down so it's thumbnail sized.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.380
This just looks beautiful.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly, I mean there's all kinds
of things here and straight away you can see

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:31.720
where- you can tell from a photo even from
this relatively small portion of it, whether

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.720
it's going to be something you're interested
in exploring more of-

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.910
&gt;&gt;Reto: -and I think they've done a great
job there.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: The only disappointing thing is it
feels like their caching isn't quite as good

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.220
as the last app.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: No, you can see here, as soon as you
sort of get more than sort of half a swipe

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.510
beyond the page you're looking at, you've
got the white screen.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: That is understandable though, the
view pager is sort of set up to do that.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:54.950
And you have to really go out of your way
to do cache management, if you want to serve

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.320
lots and lots of images very quickly.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.320
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.210
And one thing you can do as well which maybe
at issue here, make sure you're downloading

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.990
different sized images as well.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.451
So obviously you're going to have the double
hit if you click on it and then you have to

00:26:06.451 --> 00:26:07.770
download the full sized image.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.850
But at least you're dealing with a smaller
memory footprint, faster downloads, faster

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.670
load times, those sorts of things.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:17.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now right after that, all the sudden
I'm sort of disappointed because-

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ahh, you're back into text mode.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:20.170
Right.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:21.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a shame.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:26.510
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, I mean this is for your Flickr
groups, I guess, and obviously the photos

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:32.240
are maybe less important but I would argue
that- if it were linked in, I'd be like, yeah

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.559
photos whatever.

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:34.559
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sure.

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:35.559
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's Flickr.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:36.559
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's Flickr.

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:37.559
&gt;&gt;Ian: You're not there for anything else.

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:38.559
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:42.000
So it feels like you could do the same thing
here where you're just taking that image associated

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.420
with the group, make that your full background.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:49.290
And then maybe because there's more text and
it's more important you overlay more of that

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:50.290
on top of the text.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.050
But when you've got images, like you know
look at the way magazines work.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:58.660
The big advantage of magazines is that you've
got rich color, full color and with apps like

00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.660
this if you have the pictures, use them.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.720
The pictures are awesome.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.720
Yeah.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.720
&gt;&gt;Reto: So this is looking pretty good.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.570
We don't have the hipster filters to go through
so I think maybe we'll move onto the next

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:09.570
app.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.690
The last one which we're gonna look at today.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.020
Which is Camera ZOOM FX.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.179
&gt;&gt;Ian: Camera Zoom.

00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:17.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: So this is just your hipster filters.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.880
It's locked into landscape view which we decided
to leave this way to kinda prove a point which

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.100
is I don't want to always take my photos in
landscape view.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: True.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.410
&gt;&gt;Reto: So your UI particularly you can see
here this is basically an entirely custom

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.410
camera UI.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.670
They've drawn all that themselves.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.980
&gt;&gt;Reto: So there's really no reason here why
they can't rotate the assets, right?

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:46.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: And even these days- I remember back
in the days of Android 1.1, you had to take

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.600
photos in landscape mode because there was
no way of knowing what orientation the camera

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.309
was at.

00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:55.690
That changed a long time ago now so you can
actually query the device to find out what

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.880
orientation of the camera is and rotate things
so that they're sort of in the right aspect

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.070
ratio and perspective.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:06.179
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's also worth asking yourself if
you really, really need to do a custom camera

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:07.179
view because-

00:28:07.179 --> 00:28:08.179
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:28:08.179 --> 00:28:13.309
&gt;&gt;Ian: -whenever you duplicate system functionality,
you risk looking out of date once the system

00:28:13.309 --> 00:28:14.309
updates.

00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:18.640
And, in particular, you're going to miss out
on any brand new functionality-

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.640
Absolutely.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: -that the new system gives you.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now for this, you know maybe they've
got some really cool camera stuff going on.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:35.540
The problem is that a lot of the coolest camera
technology in Android is being supplied by

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:43.660
OEM libraries so, you may be missing out on
something really, really slick if you completely

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.660
override the camera.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.429
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's interesting, if I hit front
facing it doesn't do anything.

00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:50.010
So, it may be a bug.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, that's what you get right?

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's certainly freezing.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: Did it just freeze, you think?

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.410
&gt;&gt;Reto: No, it's back.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:58.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.410
&gt;&gt;Reto: It seems to just take a while.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:03.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: So the only reason I can think of that
you'd want to build a custom camera and do

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:09.580
the preview yourself is if you really need
to do live preview.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.250
So do these guys do live preview?

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: I believe that they do, yeah if you
hit the- if you start it up and hit the FX

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.180
button I believe that it will apply-

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.180
[pause]

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: K.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.070
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's have a look.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:28.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright, let's see this is coloring
or-

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.299
&gt;&gt;Reto: Branding effects.

00:29:30.299 --> 00:29:31.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.190
Oh here, vignette.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.920
Vignette's always good.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.010
There it is.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:45.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, there you go, so they're applying
that in real time, you can see that on the

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.160
edge there.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.850
But, you'll notice that a lot of the effects
that you want are actually disabled in the

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:51.850
real time mode.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.440
&gt;&gt;Reto: In the real time mode, yeah.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, which isn't surprising.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:30:00.340
It's actually, in ICS we improved things,
in Jelly Bean we improved them even more,

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:06.580
I think there's one extra step that the GL
team is talking about.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:14.070
But we've systematically been reducing the
number of operations that it takes to do a

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.240
live preview with effects.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:22.890
So, originally it was extremely tedious and
you had to bring things through Java.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:23.890
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmhmm.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:31.940
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now there's a single copy involved
if you're doing the GPU acceleration on your

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:32.940
effects.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmhmm.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: And in the future at some point, we
don't know exactly when, but the team thinks

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.570
that they can get that down to zero copies.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:45.760
So, you'll be able to go directly from the
camera to the GPU to whatever without passing

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.560
through user mode code at all.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, that's excellent.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.250
&gt;&gt;Reto: In fact, the app which I've seen which
really does the most intensive real-time effects

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.250
is I think Paper Camera?

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.330
They do a pretty good job of this.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:55.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, they really do.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: they have quite most of their effects
at runtime which is kinda nice.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep, and they've done a lot of work
to make that successful.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.820
&gt;&gt;Reto: I'm not surprised.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.840
So that's basically the way this app works
and it's got all of the standard filters that

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.340
you'd expect and you can apply them to photos
either from the camera or from your gallery

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.540
as well which is nice.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:18.679
There's no sort of community picture viewing
sharing functionality built in, at least not

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:19.679
that I could find.

00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:23.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's a shame because the share intent
is really really easy to do and it works well

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.350
for photos.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:25.929
&gt;&gt;Reto: Well share they've got, so they've
got the standard share intent.

00:31:25.929 --> 00:31:28.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh OK, so you're just saying that they
don't hook into a-

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:29.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:30.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: -like a Flickr client.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.950
&gt;&gt;Reto: Like I start it up for the first time
and I can't flick through and look at other

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.250
photos that people have taken and shared and
that sort of thing.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.880
Which makes a app like Instagram a big part
of that.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm kinda on the fence about that.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.900
&gt;&gt;Reto: Really?

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because on the one hand I'm like, yeah,
you're right, every time I pick up an app

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.350
like it's really cool.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:51.179
On the other hand I'm like well, gee, don't
I have social networks for that?

00:31:51.179 --> 00:31:53.050
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, it's true it's true.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:57.679
But you know, I kinda like the combination
particularly if it's not- if the community

00:31:57.679 --> 00:32:01.850
is really simplified, so it's not about anything
other than taking a photo and letting other

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:02.850
people see it.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:03.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: Cause then you kinda get that experience
of being able to interact and share with people

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.900
who, you know, are using the same app, taking
the same sorts of photos, I think it adds

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.900
something to it.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think you're right.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: OK, cool.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.710
So that's- now see and again we're hiding
the status bar.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.910
Please stop hiding the status bar.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:20.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:21.910
&gt;&gt;Reto: I beg you.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: Just make sure you have a way to get
back, that's so important.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because here's the thing, let's say
I am completely immersed in your app and let's

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:36.950
say I'm also an adult with responsibilities,
if I can get back to the status bar I can

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:41.030
find out what time it is, I can respond to
a notification, I can check my calendar, I

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.040
can do all these things.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:49.230
If not, then I have to leave your app anytime
my phone beeps, which is annoying.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.230
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because some notifications I literally
do not care about-

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.750
&gt;&gt;Reto: No.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: -but I don’t know until I've looked
at the status bar.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.340
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's right.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.419
And you know, if you're doing a show like
this you need to know what time it is to see

00:32:58.419 --> 00:33:00.230
if you're massively over time.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.230
Which we always are.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: We're not.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.442
&gt;&gt;Reto: But at least we're not actually past
the end time of our show yet, which is, which

00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:06.442
is nice.

00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:07.442
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's quite true.

00:33:07.442 --> 00:33:08.442
&gt;&gt;Reto: So let's have a look.

00:33:08.442 --> 00:33:09.442
So we've had-

00:33:09.442 --> 00:33:12.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: I've been actively sabotaging the show
as we go on, you're carefully-

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:13.330
&gt;&gt;Reto: [unintelligible]

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, OK, let's talk about-

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.330
&gt;&gt;Reto: We've both been sabotaging.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: -what are the prescriptions for apps?

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960
&gt;&gt;Reto: Indeed.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.611
So these are the things we're looking for
having browsed through a bunch of these apps.

00:33:21.611 --> 00:33:23.540
The things that we've found which makes them
good.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:28.520
You know, we always say that you can't contradict
the design guide and that certainly still

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.000
holds here but I think one additional thing
that we want to note is that it should really

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.440
look good.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.800
These are apps which are targeted at people
who like the way things look; photographers,

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.960
design folks, hipsters.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.140
It's really important that you create something
that's immediately appealing and you can see

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.741
that at the beginning when I showed you the
feature graphics, and I meant to point it

00:33:49.741 --> 00:33:51.600
out at the time but completely forgot to.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.460
They all have feature graphics; they're all
really compelling-

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, really really pretty.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.620
&gt;&gt;Reto: -highly saturated images which look
great.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.950
And so that's the same sort of thing you want
here, you want to make sure the entire process

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.730
is appealing.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:10.129
Similarly you want to make sure that the app
works on every image in the gallery and at

00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:12.049
the same time works on devices without the
camera.

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:19.030
So for most of these apps, they allow you
to add effects both to live photos on the

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.639
camera and to things you already have on your
phone.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:26.159
And so I want that to work on anything I can
pick from the Picasa gallery or from the phone

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.159
gallery.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:31.029
And similarly I want it to work on my Galaxy
Nexus, I'm sorry on my Nexus 7, even though

00:34:31.029 --> 00:34:35.550
it has no rear facing camera, I'm not going
to use it to take photos but I have all of

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:40.399
my Picasa gallery images synced to it, so
maybe I want to apply all these filters on

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.399
a bigger screen.

00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:42.440
It should let me do that.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.669
&gt;&gt;Ian: Or you wanna just browse your friends'
photos.

00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:45.669
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:48.109
[unintelligible]
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's actually one of the biggest

00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:54.929
problems that we had when we introduced Nexus
7 was photography apps that just assumed that

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:58.049
if you didn't have a camera you wouldn't be
interested in a photo app and that's just

00:34:58.049 --> 00:34:59.049
not true.

00:34:59.049 --> 00:35:00.049
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:35:00.049 --> 00:35:03.180
And obviously you want to have the standard
and some unique hipster filters which I think

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.740
most of the apps which we looked at today,
actually managed to do.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:13.079
&gt;&gt;Ian: To me, it's not just about hipster
filters, it's about ways to make the photo

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:14.079
look good.

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:18.599
So even if you have really unique filters,
one thing that I think the most successful

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:25.900
apps do is a little bit of automatic tweaking,
behind the scenes, maybe even without telling

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.900
the user.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.369
So maybe just a little bit of auto level balance,
auto white balance to try and make the photos

00:35:31.369 --> 00:35:32.369
look good.

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:34.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely, I mean that's the thing
we all know that we're not expecting to be

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.329
able to take great photos with our camera
phones off the bat.

00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:41.590
It's not an SLR, you can't tweak all of your
manual settings and get it just so.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:47.140
So you're looking to concentrate on making
sure you're getting a good shot, good angles,

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.380
good framing and all that sort of stuff.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.309
And then having the software help you make
it look like something that really represents

00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:53.309
it well.

00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:54.309
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:55.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: So let's give you some tips.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:00.170
The first tip here is on using the camera,
so you've got two options here which we saw

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:05.839
both of which is either an app which uses
a completely custom UI which is what Camera

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:14.930
ZOOM FX have done here so you get that completely
custom camera user interface which I can't

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:15.930
find.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:21.930
Let's see, save and close, again save button,
so here you've got the completely custom camera

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.329
user interface.

00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:25.660
And I think the first app that we looked at,
Eyeme-

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:32.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: By the way, I think that where we're
seeing save, the correct verbiage to use is

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.260
done.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.390
That's not a verb, but that's the label you
should be using.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:43.250
Because there is a case for having this intermediate-
like we've talked about this with alarm apps.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:48.451
There is an intermediate stage where you are
working on something and you don’t really

00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:49.559
feel complete.

00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:53.069
You don’t feel- like when I'm setting my
alarm I'm doing the hours, I haven't done

00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:54.069
the minutes yet.

00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:58.890
If it just- if I got a phone call then and
my alarm got saved in that state, that would

00:36:58.890 --> 00:36:59.910
not make me happy.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:00.910
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:06.339
&gt;&gt;Ian: Likewise when I'm applying filters
and doing a lot of tweaking, you want to have

00:37:06.339 --> 00:37:10.400
sort of a commit step but you shouldn't call
it save.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: No.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: Cause that doesn't make any sense.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.619
&gt;&gt;Ian: You should be saving as you go along.

00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:15.619
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:19.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because even though the user hasn't
committed they still don’t want to lose

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.980
work, but you do want to get to a point where
you can roll back essentially.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.910
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, particularly when you're applying
filters like this it's all logical operations,

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:29.910
it's all maths right?

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:30.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.720
&gt;&gt;Reto: So while you don’t want to have
to keep each of those operations for every

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.470
photo, once you're done, you're done.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.370
But in terms of being able to save your progress
even before you permanently alter the image,

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:43.309
you can just keep a track of exactly which
effects, which filters have been applied,

00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:47.480
save that and then you can always reapply
it if they come back to the app after your

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.480
process has been killed.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.609
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, so you should always be prepared
for interruptions even interruptions that

00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:54.769
happen at a very inconvenient time for you.

00:37:54.769 --> 00:37:55.849
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:37:55.849 --> 00:38:03.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: But you should never ask the user to
manage storage, to do anything but commit

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.150
an action that's already in progress.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.849
&gt;&gt;Reto: Anytime you want to surprise a user
is with delight, not with annoyance.

00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:09.849
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:38:09.849 --> 00:38:17.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: So this is Eyeme and you can see that
when you hit the camera button it goes to

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.720
the basically to the built in camera.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.000
So this using all of the functionality that
you would have on the standard built camera

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.099
app and then you can take a photo and then
it lets you retake or cancel or whatever you

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:31.099
want to do.

00:38:31.099 --> 00:38:36.690
So that's your two approaches and both of
those described in the link down there in

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.809
the camera topic of the Android developer
guides.

00:38:39.809 --> 00:38:42.599
So they will tell you how to use both approaches.

00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:47.720
Let's have a look, so the other thing we talked
about what conforming to the design guide.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.329
And so again we kind of have a few different
approaches here with these apps and I think

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:58.550
they've pretty much all, except for Glimmr
done some form of sort of custom user interface.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:03.650
&gt;&gt;Reto: And I think that's alright in this
circumstance it kinda makes sense.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:07.970
When you have a particular ethos, a design
ethos which you want to be consistent with

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:12.890
on these apps, there were a few little bits
and pieces that- Eyeme I think is my favorite

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:16.480
look and feel in that it feels the most consistent
the most strongly branded.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.380
And they've done a decent job, they need to
get rid of the legacy menu button down here,

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.859
they need to make the draw conform to our
new guidelines.

00:39:23.859 --> 00:39:27.819
The search here you should probably be using
the- so this is a little weird here where

00:39:27.819 --> 00:39:29.650
it goes off into its own search.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.720
This should really just be using a standard
action bar search.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's always annoying.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.720
Yeah.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.720
&gt;&gt;Reto: That should just be-

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.059
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think you know to a certain extent
that's our fault, these guys have obviously

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:43.479
tried to mimic the action bar pattern but
since our action bar support library is still

00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:44.479
not done-

00:39:44.479 --> 00:39:45.520
&gt;&gt;Reto: It makes it hard.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.530
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's tough.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:50.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: But that's something definitely something
to keep in mind and something to look for,

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.380
wherever you see sort of these standard patterns,
and I have to admit, we tend to have a different

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.589
view on what a standard pattern is based on
the fact that we're always using the latest

00:39:58.589 --> 00:40:00.690
versions of the phones and the operating system.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:01.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: That is true.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: For us it's like well I've seen that
appropriate search action bar thing for like

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.990
a year, why is it taking people so long?

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: So yeah, bear with us.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:14.400
But particularly for these guys and for other
people sort of implementing these sorts of

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.960
patterns, you want search to be simple is
kind of the key element here.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.529
Right now search is one, two, three-

00:40:21.529 --> 00:40:22.529
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yikes.

00:40:22.529 --> 00:40:23.660
&gt;&gt;Reto: -type, four-

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:28.119
&gt;&gt;Ian: And you know what's terrible, too,
is that it even looks like you should be able

00:40:28.119 --> 00:40:29.640
to type into that right?

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.640
It looks like something-

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's the faux action bar.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.640
The faux search bar.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mean and horrible.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:40.049
&gt;&gt;Reto: And so you know, if you take the alternative
approach based on the standard sort of action

00:40:40.049 --> 00:40:45.040
bar version is that you will have one button
here and that'll expand and then you type

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.700
and then you hit enter and you're done.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.559
So it's sort of only a couple of actions and
you straight away have it.

00:40:49.559 --> 00:40:54.499
And if you do it that way, it will build your
search into a bunch of ways which will make

00:40:54.499 --> 00:40:57.109
it easy for you to leverage that across the
system.

00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:58.109
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:40:58.109 --> 00:41:04.200
Once again, the feel that I get from this
app is that it had some good people behind

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200
it-

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.200
&gt;&gt;Reto: Definitely.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.930
&gt;&gt;Ian: Some really good design and they ran
out of time and I can tell you exactly where

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:15.549
on every piece of the UI exactly where they
ran out of time and decided, screw it, we're

00:41:15.549 --> 00:41:16.549
gonna ship anyway.

00:41:16.549 --> 00:41:17.859
&gt;&gt;Reto: That may well be the case.

00:41:17.859 --> 00:41:23.349
In fact, you know we got I think a fair amount
of response from the Developers Strike Back

00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:25.700
show just yesterday.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.360
So we're going to invite the guys from Eyeme
to join us next Thursday and see if they can

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.690
use a bit of feedback on exactly at which
point they got to before they decided they

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.729
had to ship it.

00:41:34.729 --> 00:41:35.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know what?

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:41.849
Shipping stuff before it's done is for Microsoft
Program Managers.

00:41:41.849 --> 00:41:42.849
Don't be that guy.

00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:43.849
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] Don't be that guy.

00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:47.579
Alright, so I think all of the apps did pretty
good so that's I think that's something which

00:41:47.579 --> 00:41:49.529
was custom designed which looked pretty good.

00:41:49.529 --> 00:41:52.940
&gt;&gt;Ian: I should mention by the way that I
did work for Microsoft, I'm not just slagging

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.940
off on them.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.859
&gt;&gt;Reto: Slagging off the competitor for fun,
no you've been there.

00:41:55.859 --> 00:41:56.859
You've done that job.

00:41:56.859 --> 00:41:57.859
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's right.

00:41:57.859 --> 00:41:58.859
&gt;&gt;Reto: You've been that guy.

00:41:58.859 --> 00:41:59.859
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:41:59.859 --> 00:42:01.469
&gt;&gt;Reto: And so this is kind of the other approach.

00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:07.880
So you're looking at Camera FX here and that
again is totally custom but I feel like here,

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.150
it's not really adding to it.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:12.440
It makes it a little bit harder to navigate,
harder to understand what's going on and for

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.839
not a huge amount of gain.

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:15.019
This doesn’t look incredible.

00:42:15.019 --> 00:42:16.789
&gt;&gt;Ian: Those touch targets are tiny.

00:42:16.789 --> 00:42:18.029
&gt;&gt;Reto: Tiny, tiny touch targets.

00:42:18.029 --> 00:42:19.859
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, they're really really difficult
to use.

00:42:19.859 --> 00:42:23.400
So yeah, basically this is a performance dis-improvement.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.079
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:27.049
This is gonna make it harder for people to,
to do.

00:42:27.049 --> 00:42:31.401
I mean, basically, if you've got an app like
this, the intention is gonna be that they

00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:33.079
use this instead of their camera app.

00:42:33.079 --> 00:42:34.079
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:37.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: So every time they take a photo, it's
gonna be with this, including from within

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.170
other apps.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:39.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:42.380
&gt;&gt;Reto: So you need to make it at least as
easy to use, as feature complete as the built

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.410
in camera app which can be tricky.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:48.420
But in terms of UI here in particular you
wanna try and make sure that it's easy to

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.420
use.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.683
And certainly not harder and slower to use.

00:42:50.683 --> 00:42:56.539
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, and again can't emphasize this
enough, especially for apps like camera.

00:42:56.539 --> 00:43:01.479
Camera has voice recorders, the timers, anytime
that you're doing something where you may

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:07.469
not actually be looking at the screen closely,
or you may not be concentrating on the UI,

00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:14.020
[clunk in background] it's absolutely critical
that you test on some of these newer devices

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:20.710
that have no hard buttons, because if you
look at the camera for- we were are on PicsArt?

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.739
&gt;&gt;Reto: We were on Camera FX.

00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:25.759
&gt;&gt;Ian: Camera FX, sorry.

00:43:25.759 --> 00:43:30.480
If I'm taking a picture, what am I gonna hit?

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.390
What button am I gonna hit when I try to take
that picture?

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:41.059
[door closes in background] I'm sorry, we're
apparently getting bossman stopping by here.

00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:44.229
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very strange things happening in the
corner of our eyes.

00:43:44.229 --> 00:43:45.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: Lot of people.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: Not sure why.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:50.779
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh Hi, I have no idea who you are.

00:43:50.779 --> 00:43:52.700
OK cool.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.730
Let's move on.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:54.780
&gt;&gt;Reto: Indeed indeed.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:59.930
So the next thing I wanted to point out was
around, something that you described earlier.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.759
So the hipster filters.

00:44:01.759 --> 00:44:06.660
So there's a bunch of ways you can do this
and it's all basically maths and Android actually

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.589
has a pretty good tool for making maths work
quickly.

00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:11.589
And that is RenderScript.

00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:12.589
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:16.220
&gt;&gt;Reto: And so actually Jeff Sharkey gave
a great presentation at I/O this year, which

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:21.079
included a big section
on how to use RenderScript to perform complicated

00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:22.079
computational mathematics.

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:26.150
And in fact, in the example he gave was being
able to start creating hipster filters.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.310
And in fact we have a library of them.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: Indeed indeed.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:34.980
And so check this out and that will sort of
help you to get those sort of standard things

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:39.289
and give you the right processes to be able
to create your own more interesting and innovative

00:44:39.289 --> 00:44:40.289
filters as well.

00:44:40.289 --> 00:44:46.059
&gt;&gt;Ian: There's also some great resources out
there if you're interested in GPU accelerating.

00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:50.969
RenderScript will actually use the GPU in
some circumstances but you're always better

00:44:50.969 --> 00:44:55.559
off just using openGL if it's something that
the GPU can handle all by itself.

00:44:55.559 --> 00:45:02.369
So, one of those two or if you absolutely
must, drop in C and use NEON but that should

00:45:02.369 --> 00:45:03.369
be your last resort.

00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:07.630
And the reason it should be your last resort
is because there is currently Intel phones

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:11.769
on the market, there's MIPS phones on the
market, you can't guarantee that you're gonna

00:45:11.769 --> 00:45:13.729
be running on an ARM device.

00:45:13.729 --> 00:45:16.410
You could this year, next year it's anybody's
game.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.999
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think that's one of the advantages
of something like RenderScript is that it

00:45:18.999 --> 00:45:21.440
really does all of that for you so it's gonna
to figure out-

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.420
&gt;&gt;Reto: -the right processor and infrastructure
to take advantage of those –

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.019
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah you know who wrote RenderScript
is the guys we hired from NVIDIA, they were

00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:29.019
on the CUDA
team so-

00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:30.019
&gt;&gt;Reto: There ya go.

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:31.019
&gt;&gt;Ian: -they know their stuff.

00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:32.019
Alright.

00:45:32.019 --> 00:45:34.289
&gt;&gt;Reto: Great, alright so let's move on.

00:45:34.289 --> 00:45:37.440
The next piece of advice was around supporting
Picasa.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.309
So I do have- I think most of these apps did,
I think there was one which didn't.

00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:43.619
I'll have to refresh my memory-

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:46.619
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well not about Picasa, we're talking
about in general.

00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:50.150
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly, basically anything which
comes in the gallery is something you can

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:54.250
pick to apply a filter to, I expect that to
work.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:55.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:58.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: I expect to be able to apply that
filter to any image which comes back now.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:03.979
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, would it be correct to say then
what we really wanna do is support image providers?

00:46:03.979 --> 00:46:04.979
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:46:04.979 --> 00:46:05.979
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:46:05.979 --> 00:46:06.979
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:46:06.979 --> 00:46:07.979
Any image provider which can end up in my
gallery, yeah.

00:46:07.979 --> 00:46:09.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, because you know this isn't
just about Picasa.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:15.229
Picasa is sort of the default because it ships
with the device, but we encourage everybody

00:46:15.229 --> 00:46:16.630
to make image providers and-

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:17.630
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:18.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: -many OEMs do.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:24.559
We don't actually ship a Facebook image provider
as part of Android, but many of the different

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:29.460
OEMs you know, Samsung, Motorola they have
their own builds and they have a Facebook

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.460
image provider.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh nice.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.369
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know, Flickr image provider etcetera,
etcetera.

00:46:34.369 --> 00:46:42.849
So you really wanna be able to work with that
so the user doesn't see something in the gallery,

00:46:42.849 --> 00:46:47.420
see something that their phone is seamlessly
offering without saying "Oh this is special

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.420
because it came from service Provider Y.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:50.420
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: You see it all in a big list and then
if you select one and if it doesn't work,

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:55.890
people are just going to get frustrated by
your app.

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:57.510
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly and so that's what you want
to get away from.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:02.539
Now it turns out this is not entirely a trivial
problem so you really need to, to look at

00:47:02.539 --> 00:47:07.069
the URLs the URIs which you get back when
you do the picking action.

00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:12.579
I had a quick look online, it turns out we
don't have a great document on how to do this

00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:15.999
across sort of the different versions, which
is something we should do.

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:18.680
So, I'm gonna put that to our writing team
and see if we can get something put together.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:24.330
In the meantime, I did find this blog post,
I haven't validated it in detail, it did look

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:28.500
like it was suggesting the right things, so
you may want to check that out and that will

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.819
give you an idea for the right way to do that
for the Picasa at least.

00:47:31.819 --> 00:47:32.819
&gt;&gt;Ian: Excellent.

00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:35.349
&gt;&gt;Reto: So now the lack of transparency is
gonna bite us.

00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:37.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, it is.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:42.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: The other thing which we mentioned
as well is we want these apps to work on all

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.400
devices.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.349
Now it turns out after the latest updates,
all of these apps did.

00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:51.710
When I tested them last night, a couple did
not appear to be installable on my Nexus 7

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:52.719
but this morning they did.

00:47:52.719 --> 00:47:54.219
So thank you-

00:47:54.219 --> 00:47:55.219
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:47:55.219 --> 00:47:57.869
&gt;&gt;Reto: -to those apps which pushed out an
update late last night to make that happen.

00:47:57.869 --> 00:48:02.440
But this link below will take you to a blog
post which will tell you exactly how to make

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:07.180
sure that your app does work on devices if
you don’t have a back facing camera.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now see here is where we missed a QR
code.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.540
&gt;&gt;Reto: Well, that's true.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.240
It's all a learning curve.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: Next week.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.359
&gt;&gt;Reto: Next week, exactly.

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:18.700
So definitely do keep that in mind and so
the reason why this is particularly important

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:24.359
for cameras is because there was an assumption
at the very, very, very early days of Android

00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:28.609
that every device would have a camera as part
of the compatibility test sweep.

00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:34.739
And since that has gradually relaxed over
time to give more opportunities for differences

00:48:34.739 --> 00:48:40.300
in hardware, we have had to maintain that
assumption that if you are asking for a camera

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:44.319
permission, that must mean you need a camera
for the device.

00:48:44.319 --> 00:48:45.880
And that’s no longer the case.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.359
And so you have to explicitly say hey, I know
that I've asked for the permission to use

00:48:50.359 --> 00:48:53.559
the camera, but even if the camera isn't there,
that’s fine I'm still happy to run.

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:59.049
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, you need to mark that optional
in your manifest and, in addition, one thing

00:48:59.049 --> 00:49:02.630
that I personally find very confusing and
I think that maybe other people do too is

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:05.779
remember that camera in this case means a
rear-facing camera.

00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:08.660
A front-facing camera is something completely
different.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:09.880
Which is not a camera.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.219
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, that's totally a different string.

00:49:11.219 --> 00:49:12.820
That's front-facing camera, not camera.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:17.789
I mean, I know that a lot of this stuff is
gonna seem weird and arbitrary but really

00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:20.609
it's just there to ensure backwards compatibility.

00:49:20.609 --> 00:49:26.760
So where, beforehand camera meant rear-facing
camera, it just didn't say that it meant rear-facing

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.739
camera, we can't change the string because
that will break all the apps which have made

00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:31.890
that assumption beforehand.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:38.089
So it can get a little bit confusing but that's
why backwards compatibility is no joke.

00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:42.799
So OK, that's basically all of things in terms
of prescriptions and the advice there.

00:49:42.799 --> 00:49:46.640
So we've got a couple of minutes because the
next show isn't starting for a half hour.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.029
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, we're doing great, I thought
we were doing an hour today, I mean officially

00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:51.029
an hour.

00:49:51.029 --> 00:49:52.029
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh we are, we've got eight minutes.

00:49:52.029 --> 00:49:53.029
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright, well let's get on to the recap
then.

00:49:53.029 --> 00:49:55.390
&gt;&gt;Reto: If you think that we're going to finish
off in less than eight minutes, I think you're

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:56.390
sorely mistaken.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:57.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh lightning round!

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.839
&gt;&gt;Reto: [chuckles] So this is the prescriptions,
so we just looked at each of these in more

00:50:00.839 --> 00:50:01.839
detail.

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:05.759
So let's take a look at each of the apps specifically
and see how many of these they managed to

00:50:05.759 --> 00:50:06.759
do.

00:50:06.759 --> 00:50:09.819
Today I have not used green as a way of saying
they've done it.

00:50:09.819 --> 00:50:12.479
I've left it in blue so that it doesn't disappear
into our background.

00:50:12.479 --> 00:50:13.479
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK

00:50:13.479 --> 00:50:14.479
&gt;&gt;Reto: So this is our first app-

00:50:14.479 --> 00:50:15.829
&gt;&gt;Ian: Not that this was a problem.

00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:20.539
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, yeah, but it was hard to see that
that meant good, because it could be any color

00:50:20.539 --> 00:50:21.910
based on whatever was behind it.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.089
&gt;&gt;Ian: Quite true.

00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:24.089
Alright.

00:50:24.089 --> 00:50:27.459
&gt;&gt;Reto: So what they did really well here
they offered the standard unique hipster filters,

00:50:27.459 --> 00:50:31.660
they have the community photography which
was really easy and fun to browse through

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.460
and it works on devices without cameras so
you can just enjoy looking at photos on whatever

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.180
device you happen to have.

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:41.130
What they didn't do was support every image
in the gallery.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:44.859
So this was the app where when I clicked through
to try to and apply a filter to something

00:50:44.859 --> 00:50:49.650
from my gallery, which is all stuck in Picasa,
I got the I can't access this image.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:54.799
So that would be the number one tip for these
guys would be please do make sure that works.

00:50:54.799 --> 00:50:59.859
We're happy to help provide the information
you need to make that happen.

00:50:59.859 --> 00:51:02.309
And you know, it does look great without contradiction
the design guide.

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:05.930
I gave that one a yellow just because you
know, like there's a couple of little things

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:10.839
the search bar, the draw pattern, the menu
button, those sorts of things which-

00:51:10.839 --> 00:51:12.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: They re-implemented the action bar-

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.630
&gt;&gt;Reto: They did.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: --which is always tricky because you're
gonna get something wrong, and even if you

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:18.789
get it perfectly right, you're gonna get broken
by the next version.

00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:24.809
So hopefully they can move over to you know,
Action Bar Sherlock or Action Bar App Compat

00:51:24.809 --> 00:51:30.890
and start using something that Google is supporting
directly and that'll make their app easier

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:32.170
to maintain I think.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:33.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.170
So I think this was a great app.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: I really liked the look of it.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:36.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:37.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: I can see why it's so popular.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:42.749
I think if you add that support for Picasa
or for generic images in the gallery, you're

00:51:42.749 --> 00:51:45.319
on to a real winner.

00:51:45.319 --> 00:51:49.479
Second app we looked at was PicsArts, again
so this ticked almost all of the boxes.

00:51:49.479 --> 00:51:52.829
It supports every image, it offers the standard
and unique hipster filters.

00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:54.249
You've got community stuff there.

00:51:54.249 --> 00:51:55.930
It works on devices without cameras.

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:57.410
So it's pretty good.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:52:04.130
Again, I gave it a yellow against the design
guide, in this case they've done the action

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.140
bar correctly, they’ve got the search filters
and everything else.

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:11.119
I think where I got a little more concerned
was around things like the camera which again,

00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:13.690
they've got the custom UI, it doesn't seem
to be adding a lot.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:17.739
&gt;&gt;Ian: And the shutter button is not only
tiny but directly next to the home button

00:52:17.739 --> 00:52:20.390
where my thumb will very easily slide over
that.

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:21.779
&gt;&gt;Reto: [chuckles] Very easy to hit.

00:52:21.779 --> 00:52:22.779
&gt;&gt;Ian: Very bad idea.

00:52:22.779 --> 00:52:23.779
&gt;&gt;Reto: So that’s a concern.

00:52:23.779 --> 00:52:28.259
And I also found that once I started sort
of tunneling into this app a little bit more,

00:52:28.259 --> 00:52:31.770
it started to get a little more difficult
to navigate and a little harder to understand

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:34.809
what the navigation patterns were, what some
of the user ability stuff was.

00:52:34.809 --> 00:52:39.239
So they've done a really good job on the front
page, but it starts to go downhill a little

00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:40.239
bit after that.

00:52:40.239 --> 00:52:43.070
Once you navigate past that first home screen
in view pager.

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:47.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, but I will say that they did
a great job on their image list.

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:48.150
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:49.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: They look really really pretty.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.239
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a great example of the right
way to do that.

00:52:51.239 --> 00:52:52.469
Yeah, nicely done.

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:53.469
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:52:53.469 --> 00:52:55.299
&gt;&gt;Reto: Third app was Glimmr.

00:52:55.299 --> 00:52:57.440
So this was the Flickr viewer.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.619
So obviously that gets red dots for anything
to do with applying filters because that's

00:53:01.619 --> 00:53:02.619
not what this app does.

00:53:02.619 --> 00:53:03.619
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's a little unfair.

00:53:03.619 --> 00:53:04.619
&gt;&gt;Reto: I was gonna –

00:53:04.619 --> 00:53:07.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: Maybe it should be black dot or a white
dot.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.359
&gt;&gt;Reto: I was gonna change them.

00:53:08.359 --> 00:53:09.380
I should just remove them.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: Get them out of there cause it's not
really appropriate but- it does look great.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.299
Great looking UI.

00:53:15.299 --> 00:53:17.359
It's all about the community of photographers.

00:53:17.359 --> 00:53:19.420
It works on any device.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.890
Again, it's a much more simple app than some
of the others we looked at today but they've

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:25.700
done a really good job with what they've got.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:26.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.700
Alright.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: and last off we looked at Camera ZOOM
FX.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.799
So this didn't have the community photography,
it didn't have that ability to see other photos

00:53:34.799 --> 00:53:38.490
that people have taken with the great app
and I don't know, I like it if for no other

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:42.660
reason than it shows you what's possible with
a camera phone and with their app.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.609
So it's kinda great advertising for your own
app if you have that in there.

00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:50.739
And similarly the design guide issues were
a little bit questionable in terms of how

00:53:50.739 --> 00:53:57.450
much value are you adding by creating this
new skin for your- for your camera.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:58.660
Really small icons a little bit blurry.

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:04.880
So I think they can do a little bit there
to make it a much better app.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.880
So that's all.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.380
That's all we wanted to look at in terms of
apps today.

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.009
&gt;&gt;Reto: We've got I think, three or four minutes
left to go.

00:54:10.009 --> 00:54:11.009
&gt;&gt;Ian: Woohoo.

00:54:11.009 --> 00:54:12.209
&gt;&gt;Reto: Which is nice.

00:54:12.209 --> 00:54:18.459
We are going to pass on each of the apps we've
looked at today to the guys, to Roman, Nick,

00:54:18.459 --> 00:54:21.839
and Adam, to look at in Android Design in
Action on Tuesday at ten thirty.

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:22.931
So definitely check that out.

00:54:22.931 --> 00:54:27.170
I'm not sure which apps they're planning on
to look at today, it will be amongst those

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:28.170
four.

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:31.660
But keep an eye on the Android Developers
Plus page, we'll announce exactly which apps

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.369
those are hopefully later today.

00:54:33.369 --> 00:54:38.249
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely, and once again join us
next Thursday when Developers Strike Back

00:54:38.249 --> 00:54:46.030
against both Reto, myself, and Roman and his
crew and see what they think of the suggestions,

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:49.160
criticisms and potentially new designs-

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: -that we've suggested to them.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.701
&gt;&gt;Reto: So make sure, if you are one of the
developers we talked about today, do make

00:54:53.701 --> 00:54:57.410
sure we have a way to get in contact with
you so we can invite you to the show.

00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:01.250
If you are one of our viewers and you have
questions for the developers, again let us

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:05.430
know in the comments to the events to the
Gplus event and we'll be sure to put those

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:09.440
questions to the developers when we have them
live via Hangout in the studio.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:15.789
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now if you're a game developer or you
like games or you like beer or you're bedridden

00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:22.029
and you just have nothing else to do, don't
forget that the Friday Games Review is happening

00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:24.530
today and has also moved to another time.

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:31.710
We're doing that at noon Pacific so in just
about half an hour, Daniel Galpin and myself-

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:32.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:33.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: -will be doing that.

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:37.289
I will change from my lab coat into my hoodie.

00:55:37.289 --> 00:55:42.339
We'll get down, we'll get jiggy, we'll do
game stuff.

00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:45.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: I'm concerned that you went the Redbull
during the wrong show.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: You think maybe?

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:47.949
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think maybe you did.

00:55:47.949 --> 00:55:49.539
Maybe that's when the Mountain Dew's coming
out.

00:55:49.539 --> 00:55:50.539
I dunno.

00:55:50.539 --> 00:55:53.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: You don't even know, I'm like- I'm
kicking it Elvis style, alright?

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:54.900
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh wow.

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is the- you gotta get right in
the middle.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, sure.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright nice.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.150
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I think maybe you guys are gonna
match levels, I think it's less about getting

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:06.170
a Redbull for yourself and maybe getting a
Valium for Neil.

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.579
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true-

00:56:07.579 --> 00:56:08.859
&gt;&gt;Ian: That might be true.

00:56:08.859 --> 00:56:09.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: That might be-

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.440
&gt;&gt;Reto: So that's pretty much it for us.

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:18.809
We are going to look at travel booking and
planning apps in the App Clinic.

00:56:18.809 --> 00:56:20.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely right.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:23.619
We're getting ready for the holidays so we
figure everybody travels during the holiday.

00:56:23.619 --> 00:56:24.619
&gt;&gt;Reto: Pretty much.

00:56:24.619 --> 00:56:26.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: Either to be with family or to get
away from family.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.240
So-

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: True that.

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.660
&gt;&gt;Ian: -it's about time to start booking those
flights.

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:35.680
We're gonna look at booking apps and then
later on, we're going to look at travel apps

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.619
as in apps to help you when you're on the
road.

00:56:38.619 --> 00:56:39.619
So-

00:56:39.619 --> 00:56:40.619
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:56:40.619 --> 00:56:41.619
&gt;&gt;Ian: -make sure that get right.

00:56:41.619 --> 00:56:42.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: So your currency converters etcetera
later.

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:46.549
For tomorrow- for next week we wanna have
apps which help you make bookings help you

00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:48.229
figure out where to go, those sorts of things.

00:56:48.229 --> 00:56:49.229
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:56:49.229 --> 00:56:53.000
&gt;&gt;Reto: So yeah, definitely give us your suggestions
on the moderator page and tune in same time

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.239
as this week, next week.

00:56:54.239 --> 00:56:57.829
This is gonna be the new time unless it turns
out that we've been talking to an audience

00:56:57.829 --> 00:57:00.209
of three, when we may reconsider.

00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:01.579
That's pretty much it from us.

00:57:01.579 --> 00:57:07.489
Thank you very much for joining us at the
new time and thank you for everyone who nominated

00:57:07.489 --> 00:57:08.739
apps and voted for them.

00:57:08.739 --> 00:57:12.079
Without that we would have a pretty boring
show, or at least perhaps more boring than

00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:13.079
it already is.

00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:14.079
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:15.079
&gt;&gt;Reto: My name's Reto Meier.

00:57:15.079 --> 00:57:16.079
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:57:16.079 --> 00:57:17.079
&gt;&gt;Reto: And we will see you all next week.

00:57:17.079 --> 00:57:17.082
&gt;&gt;Ian: See ya.
