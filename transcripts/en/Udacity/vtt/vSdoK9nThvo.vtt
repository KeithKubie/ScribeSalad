To get Greg back for bringing in the snake, I decided to use him to demonstrate

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.489
some of the concepts we're going to learn about in this lesson. He's going to

00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:09.110
come in. I'm going to ring the bell,

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.425
[SOUND]

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:11.890
and then shoot him with a toy gun. I'm going to do that,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.184
[SOUND]

00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:12.952
all day long.

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:13.382
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:14.054
[NOISE]

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:19.346
&gt;&gt; He's going to be our real life example of classical conditioning.
