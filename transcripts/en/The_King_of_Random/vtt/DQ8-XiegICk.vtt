00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
This rocket launcher made from PVC and a bungee cord can launch rockets made from pool noodles up to 50 feet

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.930
To start this build you'll need to head to your local hardware store to grab some PVC pipe and to pick up some ABS and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.180
PVC fittings. To start off we'll want a length of 2-inch diameter PVC a two

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.039
Inch slip to thread adapter and a two inch to 1/2 inch

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.348
Adapter all in PVC. The projectiles for this whole contraption will be made of pool noodles

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.030
So we've got a couple of those lying around

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.759
I have a two inch by two inch by one and a half inch by one and a half inch ABS cross piece

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.259
Let's start by cutting our 2 inch diameter PVC pipe to 1 foot in length using some ABS to PVC cement

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.800
We'll attach our cross onto our 2 inch diameter pipe use some paper towel to wipe off any excess glue

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.070
next we have a 2 inch to 1/2 inch adapter which will fit into the other side of our ABS tube

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.459
At the other end of our 2 inch diameter PVC pipe. We want to add the 2 inch slip to thread adapter

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.939
This piece is smooth on one side and will fit right over our pipe and on the other side is designed to take a 2

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.299
inch threaded pipe our green glue is specifically meant for

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.990
Combining the 2 different materials of our ABS and our PVC pipe when we're combining PVC to other PVC

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.570
We want to use glue specifically made for that

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.269
These 4 pieces will make up part of the main body and the air chamber where pressure is built to launch our rocket

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.280
Using these 2 side pieces off of our ABS cross. Let's add a handle for ease of use

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.979
we have two one and a half inch to

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.540
3/4 inch adapters which will allow us to go from the ABS plastic down to some standard 3/4 inch PVC pipe

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700
We also have these for PVC

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.828
3/4 inch elbows, which will let us build a handle that wraps around our ABS cross piece

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.210
Once again using our ABS to PVC cement, let's attach our two adapters

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.159
On both sides of this cross we'll use some 3/4 inch PVC to connect our pieces together

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.459
short ones

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.319
Connecting onto the sides and one long piece that will act as our handle going across

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.029
I need four pieces of the 3/4 inch PVC just over 2 inches long

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.789
We want to cut the PVC handle at about 9 and 1/4 inches long

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.449
To be able to attach all of these pieces we're going to do things in a bit of a strange order

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.390
I'll put the elbow on one side of our large handle and then IÂ´ll fix that with the two small pieces of the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.699
3/4 inch pipe on one end

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.009
Another piece of 3/4 inch pipe will be attached to the bottom and

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.299
An additional piece will be used to connect two of our elbows into a sort of u-shape

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.989
The u-shape will go on last fitting over both the long and the short pieces of the 3/4 inch pipe at the same time

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.910
With the handle glued in place, we now have the main body of our pool noodle rocket launcher assembled

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.799
Let's move on to the plunger. The main body of our plunger will be one in a quarter inch PVC

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.239
There are two different lengths that we need to cut off of our one and a quarter inch pipe

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.019
One is 1 foot long and the other is two and a half inches

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.949
We have the PVC cut into two separate pieces because we're going to use a coupler and a cap as part of the plunger design

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.060
this plunger design is borrowed from

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.259
youtuber Nighthawk and Light who has a similar pool noodle rocket launcher design. When I was trying to come up with a design for a

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.020
Large pool noodle rocket launcher his design popped up and I was amazed at how similarly our ideas

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.340
coincided. This rubber o-ring has a one and a half inch inner diameter and a one and seven eighths inch outer diameter

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.100
We're using this rubber o-ring because when it's pulled over a one and a quarter inch piece of PVC pipe

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.619
It makes a diameter that almost

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.470
Perfectly fits inside of a two inch pipe the coupler and the cap will be used to hold it in place on

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.809
the section of one and a quarter inch PVC

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.970
using our PVC glue

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.339
Let's attach first the coupler and then the cap to our small section of pipe with the o-ring in between them

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.500
With our coupler and cap attached around our o-ring we can now attach that whole piece

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.589
Onto our one foot section of one and a quarter inch pipe

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.720
We've now made a plunger that fits very snugly into our two-inch PVC body

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.370
We only want our plunger to go to about the end of the 2-inch piece of PVC

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.519
Not entering the ABS cross piece

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.210
Let's grab a piece of our pool noodle and make a stopper that will remain inside the interior of our launcher

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.769
Our pool noodle is cut to the right length, but it's still a little bit too wide to fit nicely into the PVC

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.570
let's cut out a small section of the middle that should still allow the two round pieces to fit together and be inserted into the

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.540
tube

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.540
The two sections now have a much smaller

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.799
Diameter and still have enough of a hole down the middle that air should be able to flow easily

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.809
To ensure that air really can travel all the way down the length of this without being slowed down

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.989
Let's use our exacto knife and hollow this out just a bit more

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.949
Nighthawk and Light had a really cool design on his channel and I liked it a lot but there were a couple things that I

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.149
Wanted to change for this adaption one is I wanted it to fire automatically

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.900
So I wanted to make this whole thing

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.620
Spring-loaded the other change I wanted to make is that on his device you had to draw back the plunger add the pool noodle

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.560
Ammunition and then fire it by pushing the plunger down

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.040
I wanted to be able to have the pool noodle on drop back and fire all in one go to do that

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.650
We need to allow the air to flow in when we're pulling back but be stopped when it's moving forward

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.320
So we need to have the air travel through the plunger and then be stopped by a one-way valve at the back

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:10.619
The design for this one-way valve is extremely similar to something Grant has made previously. We have a three quarter inch male adapter

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.989
Which on one side is a press fitting for three-quarter inch PVC and then reduces down in diameter

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.959
So that it's narrower on the bottom than it is at the top

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.039
This O ring fits perfectly down into the wider end of our adapter

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.510
This rubber stopper is wider than the o-ring at the top but narrower at the bottom

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.149
Which means it can fit about halfway down into it

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.669
the result is that any pressure coming from the wide end will push the stopper down into the o-ring and

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.309
Restrict the flow of the gas pressure coming from the narrow end will move the stopper away from the o-ring

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.160
Allowing the gas to flow around it and into the system if I try and blow into the narrow end the air travels easily

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.849
But if I try and blow into the wide end the stopper is forced up against the o-ring and doesn't go anywhere

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.639
Our connecting piece of 3/4 inch PVC

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.599
Needs to be close enough that it will prevent the rubber stopper from moving far

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:06.839
But leave enough space that it can still move to let air through

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.229
Let's cut a two-inch section of our PVC to complete our one-way valve

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.140
By itself the PVC pipe may prevent the stopper from moving

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.569
But the stopper is actually able to fit into a piece of 3/4 inch PVC with a little bit of pressure

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:28.119
So let's add another barrier onto the bottom of this piece of PVC in the form of a segment of nail

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.429
Crossing through from one side to the other. I've selected a nail and a drill bit that are the same diameter

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.500
So we'll drill a hole through our PVC and then fit our nail through trimming off the excess

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.360
Our nail is almost the perfect width

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:47.020
Well, let's use a file to take down the sharp edges to be sure that it will really easily fit inside the adapter

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.779
Now even with the nail in place our PVC pipe should fit smoothly into the adapter

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.080
Just like that, we have a one-way valve that only cost about a dollar fifty to build

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.010
now, of course

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:07.420
Our one-way valve is only going to make any difference if air can get down to it currently our plunger is all stopped up

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.820
So that no air can get past the o-ring

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.520
Let's drill a hole into the tip of our plunger so that air will travel down inside it and reach our air valve

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:22.029
We're going to want the elastic that powers our whole rocket launcher to pass behind the tee and stay in place

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.489
Let's drill a small hole into the back of the tee and install an eye bolt that will fit inside

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.469
That we can let our elastic pass through to keep it from sliding off either side

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.709
We can now begin assembling the back end of our plunger

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.169
we'll also need one small section of

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:44.559
3/4 inch PVC to connect our T to our adapter the back of our plunger will have a one and a quarter inch coupler

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:51.730
Attaching to a 1 and 1/4 to 3/4 inch reducer a small piece of 3/4 inch PVC

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:57.670
Will attach a T. The T will be stopped on one side by a plug and on the other side

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.360
We can add our one-way valve at this point

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.710
We should be able to attach our entire plunger assembly onto the body of our launcher

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.770
but before we do it's still a little tough to

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.929
Slide this thing inside the launcher the rubber grips the inside walls of the PVC pretty well

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.000
So let's add an oil as a lubricant

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.549
This liquid silicone should prevent it from binding

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.429
if you don't have silicone you can use things like cooking oil or

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.860
Wd-40 but be aware that some oils will degrade the rubber seal overtime

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.569
We can now thread our two adaptors together locking our plunger in place

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.229
The plunger moves easily and air is definitely pushed out the front. I have here a three-foot bungee cord

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.319
Let's adapt this to give our launcher some spring power

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.159
Our elastic will wrap down through the I bolt and then hook around both sides of our plastic tee using a couple of zip ties

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.909
The last step to make it functional is to add a small piece of one-half inch PVC

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.550
Onto the very front our pool noodle will fit over that and help guide our Rockets

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.019
Let's cut a piece about 15 inches long off of this 1/2 inch PVC pipe

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:19.110
Our elastic powered PVC pool noodle launcher is built and at this point what we need is some ammunition

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.779
We've got a few colors of pool noodles a couple of sheets of craft foam a foam

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:29.279
Football this and our glue gun is all we're going to need to make our missiles to start

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.399
Let's grab a pool noodle and cut off a length 15 inches long

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.139
At this point our tube is hollow and air can pass right through it

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.170
So we need a way to stop that up. Once again borrowing from Nighthawk and light and his design of these similar noodles

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.780
Let's cut off a strip of this craft foam roll it up and use that as a plug in our pool noodle

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.730
To add a little bit of weight and shape to our missile

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.969
Let's cut off the front of this foam football where it has a circular diameter. That's the same as our pool noodle

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:05.610
We can then glue that on to give it a nice point and some weight at the other end of our missile

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.389
We're going to want to add some fins and we want them evenly spaced out

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.780
We can use more of our craft foam to make those fins

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.619
Adding a little bit of a twist into our fins should help stabilize our missiles in flight

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:31.190
With the fins attached our missile is ready to fly. We now have our launcher in a few different missiles

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.090
And of course both of those also can have a little bit of decoration done

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.170
 

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:07.459
