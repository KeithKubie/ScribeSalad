00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.956
NIMAI DELGADO: First of
all, thank you, Bobby.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.950
The word bodybuilder normally
has certain connotations along

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.820
with it, such as strength,
power, muscle, masculine,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.090
and, particularly,
immense physical strength.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.700
But I don't believe
that strength

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.430
is measured by how
much muscle you have

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.620
or the amount of
weight you can lift.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.380
I measure strength
by how resilient you

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.750
are through times of adversity.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.510
I believe that strength should
be measured by standing up

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.190
for what you believe
in even if it

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.410
makes the path to where you want
to go that much more difficult.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.720
And most of all, I believe
that strength should

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.320
be measured by compassion.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.610
Most people seem to confuse
compassion for weakness.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.580
But I believe that compassion
is the ultimate measure

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.670
of a person's strength.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.890
My name is Nimai Delgado.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.350
I'm the first vegan male
professional bodybuilder

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.440
to compete in the IFBB,
which is the world's most

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.276
prestigious bodybuilding league.

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:16.650
And last year I
had the privilege

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.870
of gracing the cover
of "Muscle &amp; Fitness"

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.305
to become the first
ever vegan to promote

00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:24.960
an alternative lifestyle
that not only promotes health

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.020
and longevity, but also
promotes compassion.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.270
And I've never had a piece
of meat in my entire life.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.510
Now some of you
may be wondering,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.500
how can a person like myself,
a professional bodybuilder,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.370
grow up and never have a single
piece of meat in my life?

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.960
Well, to understand
that, you have

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.410
to understand a little bit more
about me and how I was raised.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.290
So it all starts
back with my parents

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.770
way down in South
America in Argentina.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.830
Whenever my parents were
both in their early 20s,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.780
they converted from Catholicism
to a new lifestyle of Hinduism.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.260
Now, they actually renounced
all material possessions

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.570
and decided to live
a faith-based life

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.060
and devoted themselves
completely to God.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.460
And by doing this, they
followed their spiritual master,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.675
their guru from temple to temple
from Buenos Aires, Argentina,

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:22.840
to Florianopolis, Brazil,
to Miami, to New Orleans,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.030
and eventually making a
home and settling in South

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.860
Mississippi, where I was born.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.940
Now, as you can
imagine, growing up

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.430
in a Hare Krishna farm in South
Mississippi was quite unique.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.890
We had a cow sanctuary,
where we accepted rescue cows

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.100
from other farms that provided
milk for the community.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.590
We also had a
self-sustaining garden,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.440
which provided vegetables
and fruit for the community.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.040
There was also a temple,
where the surrounding members

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.860
of the community would
practice Bhakti yoga, which

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.010
is essentially devotional yoga.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.960
And I would frequent
these temples,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.920
and I would, as you can see,
dress in traditional Hindu

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.190
garments.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.110
We would wear tilak.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.610
We would wear neck beads.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.650
And growing up this way
was really quite unique

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.170
because I had quite a strong
connection with animals

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.340
in particularly.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.070
And I've learned certain
concepts growing up

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.740
this lifestyle that
I still follow today.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.230
And one of those
concepts in Hinduism

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.400
is something called ahimsa.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.300
Now ahimsa is an
ancient Sanskrit word

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.900
that roughly translates
into a meaning nonviolence.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.430
So Hindus try to embody
this in every way

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.360
possible and in every
aspect of their life,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.200
including the food that
they put on their plate.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.510
So, essentially, it
means showing compassion

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.460
to all living beings,
including animals.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.390
Because in order for an animal
to end up on your plate,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.130
the animal had to
suffer and the animal

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.220
had to eventually die
for your convenience.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.330
So if you can imagine,
I grew up in this bubble

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.910
and then had to assimilate
outside of this bubble

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.470
and go to public school.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.020
Now my parents were
very free thinkers.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.360
They didn't really care much
about the outside world,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.420
and they sent me to my first
day of kindergarten head

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.180
to toe dressed in
traditional Hindu garments,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.180
wearing neck beards,
wearing tilak on my forehand

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.220
like I showed you in
the picture earlier.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.470
And I quickly
realized how different

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.340
I was from everybody else.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.360
And not only did I quickly
realize, the kids in my class

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.640
quickly realized as well,
and they let me know.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.270
So growing up in
South Mississippi

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.330
as a Hare Krishna was
very difficult at times

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.980
because I can remember bringing
my lunch and my lunchbox

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.740
to the class, and
opening up my lunchbox

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.360
and immediately filling a room
with aromas of Indian cuisine

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.180
because that's what I
was being fed at home,

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.520
things like curry,
cumin, turmeric,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.770
and all of these things
that are very aromatic.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.940
And kids would
immediately look at me,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.220
and they would look at the
food that I was eating.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.110
And they would begin to ask
questions like, what is that?

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.670
Why are you eating that food?

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.880
And as a young child,
it's very difficult

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.840
to explain a concept
like ahimsa to somebody

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.920
that's unfamiliar with it.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.220
So what happened was
is that I constantly

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.320
had to defend myself and explain
my belief system growing up

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.170
to kids that didn't
necessarily understand,

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.890
so much to the point where I got
almost self-conscious about who

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.040
I was as a person and ended
up becoming somewhat ashamed

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.830
of my background and how I
was raised because I was so

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.520
different than everybody else.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.420
So when I would attend
parties, and birthday parties,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.042
and different events at school,
and the parents of the kids

00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:41.500
would ask me why aren't I eating
the hamburgers or why am I

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.920
not eating the pizza, I would
simply just respond by saying,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.380
I don't like it
because that was easier

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.540
for me to say than
I don't eat it

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.170
because I don't believe in
harming other living beings.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.710
So, essentially,
I suppressed who

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.900
I was as a person
and this mentality

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.952
followed me all the way up
until college, where I went on

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:04.660
to study to get my
mechanical engineering

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.830
degree in Louisiana.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.350
And what happened was after
I graduated from college

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.870
in Louisiana, I had these
big dreams and aspirations

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.560
of coming to California and
living the California lifestyle

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.740
and longboarding along the
beach in front of palm trees.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.040
But what happened
was I ended up moving

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.144
to a place called
Bakersfield, which

00:06:27.144 --> 00:06:29.560
I don't know if many of you
are familiar with Bakersfield.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.480
It's not too far from here,
it's only about 2 and 1/2 hours

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.350
north.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.840
And Bakersfield is very similar
to Louisiana and Mississippi

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.960
in the sense that it is a
predominantly agriculturally

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.970
based town with loads of
cattle farms, dairy farms.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.120
They also grow lots of
crops in Bakersfield,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.980
and I, in particularly, went
to work for an oil company

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.580
because oil is also heavily
prevalent in Bakersfield.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.070
So my job as a mechanical
engineer working for this oil

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.370
company was to
essentially ensure

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.890
that the pipelines, the
tanks, and the vessels

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.290
maintain their mechanical
integrity because whatever

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.500
happens when you
extract these oils

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.750
and liquids from
the ground, they're

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.450
highly corrosive to
metal in particular.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.270
So it was my job to
assess these assets

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.770
and make sure that they maintain
their mechanical integrity.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.649
Now while it was a very
intellectually stimulating job

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:26.940
and a very important job
because I was not only keeping

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.140
the environment safe, I was
keeping the co-workers of mine

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.940
safe as well, it did not
fulfill me in any sort of way

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.850
because I was deeply
uninterested in what

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.590
I was doing and going
to work every day,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.760
working for a corporate job.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.590
And this actually made
me quite depressed

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.410
because I had
achieved everything

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.310
that I had ever wanted.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.200
I had made it.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.880
I had graduated as an engineer.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.430
I had fulfilled
my parents dreams

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.990
of giving me a
better opportunity

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.810
to provide for myself and
my family financially.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.480
And this made me
very sad inside.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.520
And what happened afterwards
is that I found an escape

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.990
through fitness.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.270
So in Bakersfield,
there isn't much to do.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.840
You either become very involved
with partying and drinking

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.790
or you find other more
productive outlets.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.880
And I chose to spend my
time more productively,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.250
working on myself and becoming
the healthiest version

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:20.760
of myself.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.690
Because what I had found
even looking at things

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.240
as an engineer is that
everything can be broken down

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.650
into systems and processes.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.679
And your body, in particular, is
a very highly adaptive machine.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.530
So if you can
understand the processes

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.080
and how your body works, you
can optimize it the same way

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.820
you can optimize
what type of fuel

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.520
you can put in a car to make
it operate better to prevent

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.929
maintenance from in the future.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.610
Now in that discovery what
I started looking into

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.590
was the type of foods
that I was consuming.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.197
And by this time, I was very
heavily focused in the gym.

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:54.780
I was spending a lot of energy,
and I was seeing some results.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.870
And as a vegetarian
bodybuilder, I

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.760
tended to follow a more
traditional bro science

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.330
approach to building muscle,
meaning that approximately 40%

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.700
of my calories were
coming from protein.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.820
Now as a vegetarian, I
tended to really heavily rely

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.312
on things like whey
protein, cottage cheese,

00:09:15.312 --> 00:09:16.770
and certain types
of dairy products

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.550
in order to meet my
protein requirements.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.170
Now along the same time, a
video that my mom happened

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.690
to share on Facebook
surfaced in my News Feed,

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.530
and I looked into it.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.060
And it was showing what was
going on in the dairy industry

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.650
and at these dairy farms.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.930
Now I had always
grown up believing

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.010
that it wasn't a real
issue drinking milk

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.560
and consuming dairy
products because in my mind,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.670
I justified it by the cows
weren't dying to provide milk

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.250
so there isn't really
anything wrong with it, right?

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.960
But what this
video exposed to me

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.890
is the processes and the
systems that these companies

00:09:54.890 --> 00:10:01.840
use to extract milk
from their product.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.750
And I looked at it with
a different set of eyes

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.970
than I normally had
before because working

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.210
in the corporate world taught
me how to look for efficiencies

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.360
and make the profit
margins for the company

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.420
that I worked with higher.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.580
So in this video, they
show exactly what goes on

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.580
behind dairy industries.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.950
And, yes, of course, there
are many, I would say,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.180
unethical practices that
go on in these industries.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.638
But what really
caught my attention

00:10:29.638 --> 00:10:32.340
is the mechanical processes
that goes onto extracting

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.750
the milk from these cows.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.480
And I immediately
related to it because it

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.820
looked very similar
to a processing plant

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.270
that I had worked in before.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.470
So looking at this image with
a set of engineering lenses,

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.940
I understood that there
was a guy that was exactly

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.480
like me that was working
for this company,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.060
trying hard and thinking really
hard how to maximize efficiency

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.080
from their systems and processes
at the expense of these living

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.470
beings and having no
regard for whether or not

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.930
they're suffering, whether
or not they're comfortable.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.120
So at that moment, I
made a conscious decision

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.740
that I wasn't
going to contribute

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.144
my dollar to supporting
these companies because by me

00:11:15.144 --> 00:11:16.810
supporting these
companies, essentially,

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:21.310
I was paying this guy's salary
to work harder and smarter

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.050
and create more suffering.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.060
And this all goes back
to the word ahimsa,

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.030
which basically means try to
live a most compassionate life

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.160
as possible.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.170
After this, you could imagine
as a very enthusiastic

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.000
bodybuilder, I
became very concerned

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.760
that I was giving up my
primary source of protein.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:50.710
And I Googled what are some of
the concerns or maybe health

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.050
risks of giving up
dairy in particular?

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.060
Because I've always
heard that dairy

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.990
was a primary source of calcium.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.960
It was also a primary
source of protein or whey

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.850
protein in particular.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.630
And what I found is
quite astounding.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.830
So, immediately, one of
the biggest statistics

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.390
that jumped out
at me was the fact

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:13.130
that studies show that 65%
of the world's population

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.422
is intolerant to dairy.

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:17.380
That doesn't necessarily
mean they're allergic,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.480
but they show some
type of intolerance.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.640
Now this number
drastically increases

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.760
for people of Asian descent
and particularly people

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.610
of any kind of color descent.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.570
It goes up to the high 90s.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.890
Now these intolerances
don't show the same symptoms

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.620
as say an allergy in the
way that your body will

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.170
go into some type
anaphylactic shock

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.350
and produce antibodies
to fight these allergens.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.860
What happens is that these
symptoms are much more subtle.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.470
Essentially, you could be
suffering from an intolerance

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.750
not knowing it and be
experiencing things

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.780
like chronic fatigue,
chronic inflammation,

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.380
digestive problems.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.460
And I was experiencing every
single one of these things,

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.350
given the fact that I
was so predominantly

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.040
dependent on dairy
products for my protein.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.270
Not only that, but dairy,
in particular milk,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.630
has been shown to
increase estrogen in males

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.290
by 26% within an
hour of consumption.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.929
Now as a bodybuilder,
the last thing

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.470
you want floating
around in your body

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.980
is more estrogen because you
can't produce muscle as good.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.480
So you want your
testosterone levels

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.880
to be as high as possible and
manage your estrogen levels

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.920
as closely as possible.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.780
Not only that,
but what was shown

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.480
was that increased
estrogen levels also

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.800
put you more at risk to
certain types of cancers,

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.334
particularly prostate cancer
and breast cancer in females.

00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:40.000
And this number was
quite alarming to me

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.150
because 8 out of 10 men
who reached the age of 80

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.829
develop some type of
prostate cancer cells.

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:49.620
Doesn't mean they're
diagnosed with cancer,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.970
but they are at a much higher
risk of developing cancer

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.050
at the old age.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.140
Now I mentioned earlier
about inflammation

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.350
and how dairy can
cause inflammation.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.570
Well, it turns out
there is a sugar

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.050
molecule that's called Neu5Gc.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.690
And, basically, this
molecule is exclusively

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:14.710
found in dairy and
in meat products.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.310
So by consuming this
molecule, what happens

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.860
is that your body
recognizes this as a threat.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.490
So your body will start
to produce antibodies,

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.530
and these antibodies
will cause your body

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.500
to become in a chronic
state of inflammation.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.200
And what happens when your
body is chronically inflamed

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.130
is that the amount of blood
flow that your body is producing

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.000
becomes greatly restricted.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.580
And, of course, if you are
trying to get pumped in the gym

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.060
and produce as much blood flow
in your veins to shuttle all

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.430
the nutrients and oxygen to
your muscles to provide you

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.240
power to push you
through those workouts,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.650
this is the last thing
that you would want.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.890
So I was very intrigued.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.230
And by this point, I was
already completely convinced

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.270
that I had made
the right decision.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.880
And what I found was
that what would happen

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.460
if I replaced those dairy
calories that I was normally

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.500
getting with more
plants, and the results

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.390
were quite astounding.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.120
Basically, what happens
is plant-based diets

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.240
have been shown to decrease
the risk of prostate cancer

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.130
by up to 35%.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.530
Now I don't know about you guys,
but whenever I'm 80 years old,

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.610
I want to be healthy.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:20.179
I want to be happy,
and I definitely

00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:22.720
don't want to be dealing with
something like prostate cancer.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.610
So this was a huge
benefit for me.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.450
Not only that, but plants almost
exclusively contain something

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.100
called antioxidants.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.640
Now antioxidants decrease
the body's inflammatory state

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.640
by basically binding
themselves to free radicals

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.980
that are produced through
oxidative processes

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.640
in your system.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.820
So they bind themselves and
basically detoxify your system,

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.920
thus, increasing the
amount of blood flow

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.290
that you can have
during exercises.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.370
Also, plants are rich in fiber,
which decrease blood pressure

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.320
and increase
insulin sensitivity.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.380
And insulin is another
hormone that is essentially--

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.580
its purpose is to shuttle
nutrients into the cells.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.250
So when it comes to
recovery, you definitely

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.590
want this hormone
to be fully active

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.600
and shuttling as much
nutrients for recovery

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.790
and rebuilding as possible.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.330
Also, plants contain
something called nitrates.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.540
Nitrates basically act
as vessel dilators,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.900
which dilate your blood vessels
to allow for more blood flow

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.790
to reach your muscles.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.910
And they increase the
amount of oxygen utilization

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.840
during exercise.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.060
So one study even
showed that simply

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.630
by drinking beetroot
juice before exercise,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.649
maybe an hour or two before,
can increase your performance

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:36.190
by up to 20%.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.940
So after I made this decision
to completely give up

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.540
dairy products, I had
also made a commitment

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.960
to compete in my very
first bodybuilding show.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.680
I made it very difficult for
myself because, first of all,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.200
this was the first ever show
that I had ever competed in,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.940
and I was a brand new vegan.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.470
And I had no idea
how to structure

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.840
a diet for a bodybuilding show.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.300
So I had to adapt what I was
reading, what I was learning,

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.910
and make it work for my body.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.710
And what happened was
really quite amazing

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.200
is I only had about
eight weeks to prepare.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.050
And, lo and behold,
I step on stage,

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.450
and I win the entire contest.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.180
I sweep every single
division, and I took home

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.400
a stupid amount of hardware.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.609
Now what's interesting about
winning a bodybuilding show

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.820
is that immediately
after you step off stage,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.510
people want to know what you
did to get into that shape.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.120
So the question that
had been avoiding

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.530
my entire life, the question
of what do I eat, now

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.630
became the most frequently
asked question to me.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.210
And I was put in
a position where

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.730
I had to talk about
what I ate and how

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.190
I was able to achieve these
results without following

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.440
any type of traditional
bodybuilding diet that

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:59.500
contained eggs, whey protein,
chicken, beef, or steak.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.840
And people became immediately
really intrigued in what

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.140
I was saying, so I thought
to myself, why don't I

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.562
share this journey online?

00:18:06.562 --> 00:18:08.020
And that's when I
made the decision

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.940
to start trying
to educate people

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.670
about an alternative approach to
reaching these kind of results,

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.690
but not only that, an
alternative approach that also

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.560
promoted health and longevity
from the inside out.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.010
And not long after,
I did another show,

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.020
and I ended up winning
the entire thing again.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.260
And then shortly after that I
earned my professional status.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.170
And kind of my bodybuilding
career and my fitness career

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.460
were paralleling
in the same way.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.700
But my passion for
bodybuilding was greatly

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.430
exceeding my passion
for engineering.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.760
And more opportunities
began to present themselves

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.970
like this one in the
form of public speaking.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:50.950
And I can remember I gave
this speech in London.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.210
And after giving this speech,
a gentleman came up to me,

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.410
and he was in tears.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.590
And he embraced me, and he
goes, thank you so much.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.210
And I go, for what?

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.820
And he goes, you
saved my mom's life.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.280
And I was really
blown away by that.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.500
And I go, how?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.560
And he goes, I found veganism
and the plant-based lifestyle

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.490
through you.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.430
And you made me believe that
it was possible to be healthy.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.400
And through that process,
I helped my mom transition

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.500
to a vegan diet, and she
was suffering from type

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.870
2 diabetes so much so that she
was unable to get out of bed.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.450
And after adopting
a plant-based diet,

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.910
she was able to almost
reverse and manage her type

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.800
2 diabetes symptoms completely.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.470
And he fully believes that
that helped save her life.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.970
So whenever I came
back to work on Monday,

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.500
I knew I had a decision to make.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.240
And I knew that I wasn't
spending my energy properly.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.460
And I knew that by
sharing this information

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.380
it can not only help
people, but it can also

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.350
help somebody save their life.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.360
So I walked into
my boss's office,

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.950
and I put in my two weeks
resignation at that moment.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.550
And it was really quite
a very fulfilling moment

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.920
in my life, but also
a very comical one

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.200
because he asked
me, he said, Nimai,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.840
what are you going to do?

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.340
And I tried to explain to him
what I was doing, and he goes,

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.820
so you're quitting
engineering to become a vegan.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:26.380
And I'll never forget
it, but I believe

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.840
that there is so much importance
in sharing this message

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.530
and, particularly, to the
bodybuilding and fitness

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.560
community because
bodybuilders in general

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.640
consume two to three times more
protein than what they actually

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.540
need.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.910
So this means that
bodybuilders are

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.000
at a much higher risk of
developing these diseases later

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.810
on in life.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.800
So just to give you an
idea of how much protein

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.740
an average
bodybuilder consumes--

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.230
normally, if you go to any
kind of bodybuilding website

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.270
or read any kind of
fitness magazine,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:03.100
they recommend to eat at
least 1 to 2 grams of protein

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.390
per pound of body weight.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.310
So let's give a hypothetical
example of this guy named Bob.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:14.180
So Bob the bodybuilder like
me weighs about 180 pounds.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.000
That would mean by following
that type of logic,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.190
you would have to get at least
180 to 360 grams of protein

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.190
in order to build
and sustain muscle.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.190
So I started thinking,
what kind of impact

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.800
does this have on the
world, and how many animals

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.290
need to die in order to provide
Bob this amount of protein?

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.250
So I reverse
calculated this figure,

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.800
and let's just say
for simplicity's sake

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.920
that Bob only consumed
chicken as his primary source

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.490
of protein.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.990
So he wanted to get 180 grams
of protein from chicken.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.946
Now 1 ounce of chicken has
about 6 grams of protein.

00:21:50.946 --> 00:21:53.070
So that means he would need
at least on the low end

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.860
to get at least 30 ounces
of chicken per day.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.230
Well, I looked up
how much usable meat

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.724
is in a full grown chicken.

00:21:59.724 --> 00:22:01.140
And, normally,
full grown chickens

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.610
weigh about 4 pounds
after you remove

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.776
the feathers and everything
else that you don't eat.

00:22:04.776 --> 00:22:07.260
You're left with about
2 pounds of meat.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.520
So that means that Bob here
requires one chicken per day

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.980
in order to build his muscles.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.210
If you think about
that for a second,

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:20.180
what does that many
chickens look like?

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.930
If you would imagine 365
chickens in this room,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:24.879
how loud would it be?

00:22:24.879 --> 00:22:25.920
What would it sound like?

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.961
What would it smell like?

00:22:26.961 --> 00:22:30.500
There's so much life
with 365 living beings,

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.405
and that's on the low
end of the spectrum.

00:22:32.405 --> 00:22:34.280
Think about it-- if he
goes with the high end

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.640
of the spectrum, that's
almost 1,000 animals per year.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.750
Not only that, when I looked
into the deeper information

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.780
in regards to how much
energy and resources

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.920
it takes to feed these
chickens to get to that state,

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.880
it takes roughly six times
the amount of grains and plant

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.939
protein in order to produce
1 gram of animal protein.

00:22:57.939 --> 00:22:59.730
You don't have to be
an engineer to realize

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.440
that's really inefficient.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.450
Next, approximately 83%
of agricultural land

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.430
is used for livestock.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:15.050
And of that 83%, it
only provides about 18%

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.180
of the world's calories.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.600
Again, very inefficient.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.910
And just to give you an
idea of how much resources

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.880
it takes to raise these animals
and raise the crops that

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.680
feed these animals--

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.350
one hamburger in order
for it to reach your plate

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:34.810
has about 660 gallons of
embedded water to get there.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.400
Approximately 27% of the
world's Freshwater consumption

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.145
is used to produce crops
to feed the animals.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:50.640
In fact, along with
these amazing statistics

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.420
is that animal agriculture
is approximately

00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:00.060
responsible for 18% of
greenhouse gas emissions

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.330
according to the United
Nations Food of Agriculture.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.980
That is approximately equivalent
to all of the greenhouse gas

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.600
emissions combined, such
as all the automobiles, all

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.120
the planes, all the trains,
and all the ships combined.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.310
Let that sink in.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:26.220
On the other hand, let's say
you have a vegan bodybuilder.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.230
He requires zero
animals per year.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.650
And he still achieves
the exact same results.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.130
Not only that, but he
cuts out the middleman

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.550
and goes straight to the
source and increases efficiency

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.170
by up to six times.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.220
On top of that, he helped
save over 400,000 gallons

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.820
of water per year simply by
choosing to eliminate his meat

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.650
and dairy consumption.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.640
And he reduces approximately
11,000 square feet

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.290
of deforestation per year.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.190
Now if you can imagine
everybody in this room reducing

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.030
their meat consumption, just
the amount of profound effects

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.340
it would have on the
environmental impact

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.280
around us--

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.920
in fact, if everybody in
the United States, which

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.070
happens to consume
approximately three times more

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.250
than the global average
of meat consumption--

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.840
if the United States shifted
away from meat consumption

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.290
to a plant-based diet, it would
reduce agricultural emissions

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:25.910
by 73%.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.960
Now this all sounds nice in
theory, and it sounds great.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.950
But the question that
mostly everyone in this room

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.740
must be wondering is, OK,
if I cut all this meat out

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.480
and all those dairy, what
the heck do I eat, right?

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.850
This is one of the
biggest challenges

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.070
that I have as a
vegan influencer

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.770
is to convince
people that vegans

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.780
don't just only eat lettuce.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.890
And I could tell you
this a million times,

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.130
but I would rather
just show you.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:05.460
So foods that I typically like
to eat consist of sushi, tacos,

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:11.640
stir fry, sandwiches,
sometimes all at the same time,

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.680
also burritos.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.750
You've got pizza.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.200
I mean, the possibilities
are absolutely endless when

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.870
it comes to plant-based foods
that are not only delicious,

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.750
but also very
nutritionally rich as well.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.950
So even different
types of cuisine,

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.170
like Thai food or
Mediterranean--

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.870
everything you see here is
completely plant-based and free

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.200
of any kind of dairy
or animal products.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.160
As you can see, it
looks quite delicious,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.330
and I'll vouch for you
that it definitely was.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.190
So you might been
looking at those meals

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.650
and been wondering
since you cut out

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.520
all of the dairy and
the animal proteins,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.860
how much protein
are in these meals

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.190
and is it enough to fully
sustain a healthy lifestyle,

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.690
let alone build muscle?

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.720
And this is another
question that I

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.320
get asked every single day
at least 100 times a day.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.230
And if I had $1 for
every time that somebody

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.360
asked me this question,
I would own my own island

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.056
in the Caribbean
with an avocado farm.

00:27:14.056 --> 00:27:15.430
What's ironic
about this question

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.980
is that most people who ask
this question don't even

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.960
know how much they need.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.770
So the USDA actually
recommends 46 to 56 grams

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.010
of protein per day for your
average sedentary person.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.640
To give you some perspective,
three cups of cooked lentils

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.266
gives you 54 grams of protein.

00:27:32.266 --> 00:27:34.390
That's approximately 100%
of your daily recommended

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.581
intake for protein.

00:27:36.581 --> 00:27:38.080
On top of that,
another study showed

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.280
that vegans, in particular,
consume 70% more protein

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.810
than they actually need.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.700
So there is no
shortage of protein

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.290
when it comes to a vegan diet.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:52.480
However, athletes are different,
especially bodybuilders.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.160
They require a high
amount of protein

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.650
because you are putting
your body under an insane

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.194
amount of metabolic stress.

00:27:58.194 --> 00:27:59.860
You are breaking your
body down, and you

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.510
need to regenerate and repair.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.730
So this requires protein.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.420
One of the largest
meta analyst that

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.850
studied how much is optimal
protein for trained individuals

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.330
determined that 1.8
grams per kilogram

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:20.830
or 0.82 grams per pound
is the upper limit

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.980
for protein consumption for
building and sustaining muscle.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.060
That means that anything
above 1.8 grams per kilogram

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.730
did not show any more
meaningful results as far

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.840
as building muscle
or building strength.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.420
Just to give you an example of
what that looks like-- again,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.460
somebody like my size
that's 180 pounds--

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.490
you would multiply 0.82
times your body weight,

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.130
and you would get
148 grams per day.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.280
That would be your my
necessary requirements

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.940
for building and
maintaining muscle.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.290
So you might be thinking,
how easy is it to get

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:56.320
148, approximately 150
grams of protein per day?

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.750
These are some of the
meals that I typically eat.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.320
I actually created a separate
Instagram account specifically

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.880
where I could show
people what I ate

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.792
because I got so many
questions and DMs about protein

00:29:09.792 --> 00:29:11.000
concerns and everything else.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.340
So I said, why don't
I just show you?

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.110
So as you can see
the meal on the left,

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.310
it's a very simple meal.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:18.160
It just contains lentils,
tofu, and greens.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.856
This meal on the left
has 41 grams of protein.

00:29:21.856 --> 00:29:27.020
That's approximately 30% of
my daily protein requirements

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.936
and approximately 100% of a
regular person's requirements.

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:33.060
The meal on the
right also contains

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.360
tofu, oyster mushrooms,
sweet potatoes, and kale--

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.010
again, 33 grams of
protein, almost 100%

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:45.060
of the regular person's
needs for protein.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.134
Now, if you want to go for
more of a low carb option

00:29:48.134 --> 00:29:49.800
because plants do
contain a lot of carbs

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.841
and there's a lot of
phobias around consuming too

00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:55.380
many carbs, there
are things like pasta

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.730
that are made of zucchinis.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.190
This meal also has approximately
30 grams of protein.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.900
And I also wanted
to show how easy it

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.450
is to structure a diet based off
whatever fitness goal you have,

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.420
so whether you want
to bulk or shred

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.090
how simple it is
to adapt your plate

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.530
to meet your fitness goals.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:12.300
For example, the
meal on the left--

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.050
it has mixed vegetables, white
rice, and cooked lentils.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.260
The meal on the right simply
replaces the white rice

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.150
with more green
vegetables, which

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.954
you can eat in high
amounts of volume

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.870
and not really increase
the amount of calories

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:30.180
that you have because they are
not very calorically dense,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.100
but they are very
nutritionally dense.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.800
So you can see both
meals provide over

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.270
20 grams of protein.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.270
Now, you might be looking
at some of these meals

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.645
or some of the
other meals that I

00:30:40.645 --> 00:30:43.890
posted and notice that
they have things like tofu,

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.320
which is made from soy.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:52.020
Now soy has quite a lot
of conflicting information

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.790
about it, and there's
a lot of phobia

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.930
around consuming soy as well.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.780
One of the biggest
misconceptions

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:02.040
is that soy contains
estrogen. Now I just

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.230
want to set the record clear.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.290
Soy contains zero
estrogen. What soy contains

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.380
is something called
phytoestrogens.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.780
Now these
phytoestrogens may have

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.950
a similar molecular structure
to estrogen. So what happens

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.400
is they can actually bind to
your estrogen receptor sites

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.810
in your body and inhibit
real estrogen from attaching

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.730
to those receptor sites.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:33.330
And in turn, what happens
is you lower your estrogen

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.670
concentration in your body.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.510
And the way this happens is
that, as we mentioned earlier

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.740
about drinking milk and
increasing estrogen levels,

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.870
it actually decreases the risk
of certain types of cancers

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.450
like prostate and breast cancer.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.290
Other studies show that it
does not affect testosterone

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.250
or fertility at all.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.360
There has not been a single
study produced and published

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:04.360
that conclude that it affects
testosterone in a negative way.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.570
Another big misconception
is that all soy is GMO.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:13.750
Now there is a wide variety
of USDA organic soy products

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.930
that are available at
every single supermarket,

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.580
and it's also
important to consider

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.740
that a large percent of
the soy crops that are GMO

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.240
are actually fed in animal feed.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.410
So these animals are consuming
high amounts of GMO soy,

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.470
and then, again, you get it
secondhand through the animal

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:37.810
whenever you consume that.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.570
So if you're trying
to avoid soy,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.290
you're still getting
it secondhand.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.780
So the next biggest
question is can a vegan diet

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.760
provide me with all
the essential nutrients

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.160
and vitamins that I need to
be healthy and to thrive?

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:56.130
One of the most commonly talked
about vitamins that a vegan

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.680
diet supposedly lacks is B12.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.130
Now it's important to
understand what is B12.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:08.720
Vitamin B12 is a vitamin that's
essential for optimal health.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.960
And the way it's produced
is it's commonly found--

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.430
it's produced in bacteria
and commonly found in soil

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.640
and in natural water sources.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.040
Having low amounts of
vitamin B12 in your system

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.820
can produce symptoms like
fatigue, digestive issues,

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.540
nerve issues, and
even vision loss.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.290
So it's really an
important vitamin.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.840
But this isn't a vegan problem.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.680
It's actually a general
population problem

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.190
because approximately 40%
of the general population

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.570
is low in B12.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.570
And there's a reason for this
is that we as humans used

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.140
to get B12 through eating
trace amounts of soil that

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.007
was on dirty or
unwashed vegetables.

00:33:51.007 --> 00:33:53.340
And we would consume that,
and that would be enough B12,

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.130
or we would drink from
natural water sources.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:01.860
But over time through sanitary
and agricultural farming

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.910
techniques, the pesticides,
and everything that is used,

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.680
they inhibit any
kind of bacteria

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.940
from forming or producing
these B12 for the bacteria.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.889
So, in fact, some
factory farm animals

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.840
never even graze on soil.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.790
They never even see
daylight, so they

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.760
have to supplement
these animals with B12.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.889
And a big misconception
is that B12 is only

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:26.819
found through animals.

00:34:26.819 --> 00:34:28.860
But the reality is that
these animals are getting

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.750
supplemented would
be 12, and then you

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.360
get it secondhand by
consuming the animal.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.659
So a much more efficient
way to get your B12

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.270
is to simply
supplement it yourself.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:43.860
And although this may not
seem like a natural thing

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.100
to supplement a pill, well,
it's important to realize

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.090
that we don't live in such
natural conditions anymore.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.130
And we've kind of
created this problem,

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.030
and it's important that we have
to address it because everybody

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.650
should take a look are what
their B12 levels are and decide

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.110
whether or not to supplement.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.700
Next thing to consider
is omega-3 fatty acids.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.440
Now, fatty acids are
optimal for brain health,

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.060
for managing blood
triglycerides,

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.810
and also reducing inflammation.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.300
The most well-known source
of omega-3 fatty acids

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.200
come from fish.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.780
So you've heard fish
are healthy for you,

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.940
take your fish oil supplements.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.860
And the problem with that is
that fish and factory farming

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.970
conditions, even
for fish farms, they

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.280
have high levels of heavy
metals because the world's ocean

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.760
supply and water supply
is so heavily contaminated

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.020
with these heavy metals.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.344
And what happens is these
fish eat other fish,

00:35:47.344 --> 00:35:49.135
and these heavy metals
kind of concentrate.

00:35:49.135 --> 00:35:52.710
And they become more
bio-accumulated and stored

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.050
in the fat cells of fish.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.940
And they store other
things too like PCBs

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.350
and other heavy metals.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.756
And what happens is these
heavy metals, such as mercury--

00:36:00.756 --> 00:36:02.880
they can attack your system
in many different ways,

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.190
particularly your
thyroid, which can

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.490
have a great effect
on how efficiently

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.150
your metabolism operates.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.140
Now an alternative source
of omega-3 fatty acids

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.040
come from a wide variety of
plants, such as algae, chia

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.540
seeds, hemp seeds, flax seeds,
walnuts, avocados, and Brussels

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.180
sprouts.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.540
The difference is that
the form of omega-3s

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.046
found in these sources
are what you call ALA.

00:36:32.046 --> 00:36:33.670
So there's three
different active types

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.770
of omega-3 fatty acids.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:40.600
And our body has to convert
ALA omega-3 fatty acids

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.530
into a more active component,
such as DHA and EPA, which

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.720
are both very critical
for optimal health.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.740
Now this conversion process
can be very inefficient

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:55.280
if your ratio of omega-6,
which is a very highly

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.290
inflammatory fatty
acid, is too great

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.000
to your omega-3 concentration.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.710
So, basically, you
want to optimize

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:08.150
your omega-6 to omega-3 ratio
so you can convert as much ALA

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.430
to DHA and EPA.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.580
Now foods that
contain omega-6 are

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.560
things that are highly
processed-- things that

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.330
contain canola oil, palm oil.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.200
All of these things
have really high amounts

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.290
of omega-6, which not only
affect your ability to convert

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:28.490
ALA to DHA, but also produce
a highly inflammatory state

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:32.620
in your body, which can
again reduce blood flow.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.310
The next thing to
consider is vitamin D. Now

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:40.080
vitamin D is essential
for calcium absorption

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.580
and immune system support.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.640
Now, sunlight is needed
for the body's ability

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.400
to produce vitamin
D. The problem is

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.500
that not everybody goes
out into the sunlight,

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.870
or there may not be enough
sunlight available, depending

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.760
on which part of the
world you live in,

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.060
to get enough sunlight
to produce vitamin D.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.070
And, again, this is
not a vegan issue.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.290
This is a worldwide
issue, and studies

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.080
show that a large
population of the world

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.270
is low or deficient
in vitamin D.

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.730
So, again, it is just
best to supplement.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.840
And what's ironic
is that there's

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.340
so many concerns
about a vegan diet

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.890
not being able to provide
all the essential vitamins,

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.830
minerals, and macronutrients.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.290
But according to the latest
US Dietary Guidelines,

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.530
there are seven
critical nutrients

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.890
that most Americans aren't
getting, such as calcium,

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:39.550
potassium, fiber, magnesium,
vitamin A, C, and E.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:43.450
And what's interesting is that
these vitamins and minerals are

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:48.310
found in abundance in
a plant-based diet.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:52.700
Now you might be thinking to
yourself, OK, I'm convinced.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.100
I want to give this thing a try.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.850
How do I start?

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.970
So these are a few
tips that I suggest

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.130
to how to successfully
transition

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.660
into a plant based lifestyle.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.590
Now, I've had many conversations
and many interactions

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.830
with people about how to make
the most efficient transition

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.190
into a plant-based diet
that is sustainable,

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:16.100
meaning it lasts you a lifetime.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.250
It's not a diet.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.500
It's a lifestyle change.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.780
Because what happens
is when most people try

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.300
to go vegan and give up
all these other products,

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.770
they become
overwhelmed, and they

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.230
go back to what they
were originally doing.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:29.540
So what I suggest is
to slowly phase out

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.620
animal products
at your own pace.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.390
You can swap out dairy products
for plant-based alternatives.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:39.520
There are a million different
plant-based alternatives,

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.430
such as milk, butter, cheeses.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.440
You name it, they have it.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.390
The next thing
would be to swap out

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.510
one for one, like for
like meat products

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.130
with plant-based alternatives.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.660
You can still eat
the exact same way

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.480
that you eat now,
just replace real meat

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.530
with a plant-based
version of it.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.120
The next thing
would be to just try

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.050
to replace one meal with
a vegan meal per day.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.630
And as you become more
accustomed to the variety

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:07.490
of different foods
that you can eat,

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:11.210
maybe try one
vegan day per week,

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.310
and then eventually one
vegan week per month,

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.070
and then one vegan
month per year,

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.380
and then eventually
a fully transition

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.210
plant-based lifestyle.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.750
There are also tons of resources
out there available to you

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.020
if you have any concern about
anything regarding a vegan

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.240
lifestyle or nutrition--

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.130
things such as
veganfitness.com, which

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:37.290
is a website that I started
along with my business partners

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.270
just so we can help
educate athletes

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.270
in particular about their
concerns and showing them

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:45.240
that it's possible to
reach their athletic goals

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.890
and not sacrifice any
performance at all.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.210
There are also things
like nutritionfacts.org,

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:54.510
which is run by somebody
named Dr. Michael Gregor, who

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.681
takes a look at almost
every single medical journal

00:40:56.681 --> 00:40:58.680
and every single medical
study that is published

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.036
in regards to nutrition.

00:41:00.036 --> 00:41:01.410
There's also
another organization

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:05.820
called Switch4Good, which is
an athlete-founded coalition

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.680
of people who are educating
people about the dairy industry

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.750
and some of the benefits
of giving that up.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:15.166
And there's also something
called the Physicians Committee

00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:17.040
for Responsible
Medicine, which is

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.660
a coalition of
medical professionals

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.390
that are trying
to bring awareness

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.130
to the benefits of a
plant-based lifestyle.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:28.450
Now, before I end
this presentation,

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:32.090
I would like to leave
it with a question.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.920
By a show of hands,
how many people

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.820
have lost a loved one due
to a premature death that

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.530
was somewhat lifestyle related?

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.330
Almost everyone.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.020
Now, if you had the
opportunity to go back

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.920
in time and share with
them some information that

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.440
could potentially
save their life

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:00.240
or add additional happy
healthy years to their life,

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.160
would you share that
information with them?

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.440
Of course, you would.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.110
So that brings me to
my next question--

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.530
why wouldn't you implement
this information for yourself

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.440
that way you can live a
longer, healthier, happier life

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.930
and spend it with
your loved ones?

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:23.060
Because in reality,
we have two homes.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.910
We have our body, and
we have our planet.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.790
And it's imperative that we
take care of both of them.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:29.960
My name is Nimai Delgado.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.793
Thank you very much.

00:42:30.793 --> 00:42:34.000
[APPLAUSE]
