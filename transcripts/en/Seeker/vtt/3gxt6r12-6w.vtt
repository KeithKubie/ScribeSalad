00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.370
Say if we found life on Mars that had a similar
genetic structure as life on Earth.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.470
Does that mean we discovered aliens?

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.470
Sadly not.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.710
It’s more likely a sign of a dirty, DIRTY
robot.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.010
Hello!

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.860
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News and I wanted to take a few minutes to

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.279
talk about Martians.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.880
Unfortunately, THESE Martians may not be from
Mars at all.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880
Confused?

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.769
Well, if you’ve ever seen those signs in
public toilets urging you to wash your hands

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.310
to avoid the spread of germs and viruses,
you will probably already have a fairly good

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.930
grasp of planetary protection and why spreading
bacteria far and wide can be a bad thing.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.690
And this rationale goes for Mars where we
recently discovered short-lived flows of liquid

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.690
water.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.070
This discovery isn’t “just another”
Mars water discovery -- we already knew water

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.870
exists in the ground, in the atmosphere and
at the poles in the form of ice and vapor

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.940
-- but this is the amazing finding that liquid
water exists on the surface of modern Mars.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.390
On Earth, where there’s liquid water there’s
life, so when NASA made this discovery, astrobiologists

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.390
got really excited.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.840
Although it would be totally unadvisable to
drink Mars water from the source -- because

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.239
it contains highly toxic salts -- there’s
the possibility that some kind of basic Mars

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.680
life may be using this water as an oasis.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.320
To test the hypothesis, scientists would LOVE
to send a Mars rover mission to the slopes

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.250
where these water flows have been found.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.330
But there’s a problem.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.820
Although NASA goes through great pains to
sanitize their hardware before it leaves Earth

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.140
to land on Mars, some hardy Earth bacteria
are known to be particularly adept at surviving

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.290
in extreme conditions, surviving the decontamination
procedures.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.299
Also, as cleaning solar panels, circuit boards,
gears, bolts and cables costs a lot of money,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.789
NASA has cut back on some decontamination
measures to save cash.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:33.789
###[[$$$]]

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.030
Interestingly, the cleanest Mars surface mission
was actually the Viking landers that explored

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.510
the red planet in the 1970s -- these first
missions were designed specifically to seek-out

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.659
life, so NASA spared no expense making sure
they were crazy clean.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.340
Now that NASA’s Mars program is more focused
on seeking out “habitable environments”

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.799
rather than specifically searching for life,
have terrestrial bacteria hitched a ride?

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.570
For example, there’s been concerns about
NASA’s Curiosity rover currently exploring

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.610
Gale Crater.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.400
After the rover was launched to Mars before
landing in August 2012, the rover’s wheel

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.369
tread and drill bits were singled out as possible
safe-havens for microbes.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.420
Although some of the flows of liquid water
have been discovered in the vicinity of Curiosity,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.200
astrobiologists have warned NASA that the
rover may be contaminated enough to deposit

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.640
some Earthly microbe on these slopes and they
could POTENTIALLY set up home on Mars, using

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.200
this toxic water as fuel.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.980
Of course, it’s a long-shot, but when searching
for arguably the most important discovery

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.630
for human-kind, it would be great to know
that the aliens we discover are indeed EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.040
microbes and not TERRESTRIAL germs taking
a camping trip.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.480
Currently scientists are hard at work identifying
which bacteria might be able to survive the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.140
cold, highly radioactive conditions of space
and be able to colonize the red planet.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.709
One bacteria identified -- Bacillus pumilus
SAFR-032 -- is known to be hanging out in

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.460
NASA’s clean rooms after decontamination.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.680
So, astrobiologists are sending samples of
this bacteria up on high-altitude balloons

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.750
to see if they die in a near-vacuum environment
in the upper atmosphere.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.500
The concern about contamination could, however,
be moot.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.520
There’s the idea that Mars may ALREADY be
contaminated with Earth microbes as, over

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.280
the evolution of the solar system, chunks
of Earth rock filled with bacteria have been

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.000
blasted from the surface via asteroid impacts
and floated over to Mars, landing as meteorites.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.480
This hypothesis, known as “panspermia,”
would have spread life far and wide long before

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.380
the first NASA Mars lander touched down.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.629
For more information about the discovery of
liquid water on Mars and its implication for

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.660
Mars bacteria, check out Trace’s recent
video.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:30.640
Make 
sure you check out that video, there’s a

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.870
link in the description if you’re on your
mobile device.

think planetary protection is a valid concern

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.060
or not.
