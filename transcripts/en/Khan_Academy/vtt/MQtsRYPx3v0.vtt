00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.120
We're asked to graph
the following equation y

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.610
equals 5x squared
minus 20x plus 15.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.400
So let me get my
little scratch pad out.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.770
So it's y is equal to 5x
squared minus 20x plus 15.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.620
Now there's many
ways to graph this.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.060
You can just take three
values for x and figure

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.960
out what the
corresponding values for y

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.000
are and just graph
those three points.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.945
And three points actually
will determine a parabola.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.320
But I want to do something a
little bit more interesting.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.330
I want to find the places.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.770
So if we imagine our axes.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.900
This is my x-axis.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.600
That's my y-axis.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.240
And this is our curve.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.050
So the parabola might
look something like this.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.420
I want to first figure out where
does this parabola intersect

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.880
the x-axis.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.690
And as we have already
seen, intersecting

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.430
the x-axis is the same thing
as saying when it does this

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.970
when does y equal
0 for this problem?

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.740
Or another way of
saying it, when

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.390
does this 5x squared
minus 20x plus 15,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.560
when does this equal 0?

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.280
So I want to figure
out those points.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.446
And then I also want to
figure out the point exactly

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.241
in between, which is the vertex.

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.990
And if I can graph
those three points then

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.690
I should be all set with
graphing this parabola.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.540
So as I just said,
we're going to try

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.360
to solve the equation 5x
squared minus 20x plus 15 is

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.892
equal to 0.

00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:28.600
Now the first thing
I like to do whenever

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.330
I see a coefficient out here on
the x squared term that's not

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.289
a 1, is to see if I can
divide everything by that term

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.830
to try to simplify
this a little bit.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.880
And maybe this will get us
into a factor-able form.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.350
And it does look like every
term here is divisible by 5.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.740
So I will divide by 5.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.210
So I'll divide both sides
of this equation by 5.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.200
And so that will give
me-- these cancel out

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.820
and I'm left with x squared
minus 20 over 5 is 4x.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.420
Plus 15 over 5 is 3 is
equal to 0 over 5 is just 0.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.389
And now we can attempt to
factor this left-hand side.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.356
We say are there two numbers
whose product is positive 3?

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:12.980
The fact that their
product is positive

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.070
tells you they both
must be positive.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.480
And whose sum is negative
4, which tells you well

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.840
they both must be negative.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.082
If we're getting a
negative sum here.

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:22.540
And the one that
probably jumps out

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.915
of your mind--
and you might want

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:26.590
to review the videos
on factoring quadratics

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.230
if this is not so fresh-- is
a negative 3 and negative 1

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.790
seem to work.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.050
Negative 3 times negative 1.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.400
Negative 3 times
negative 1 is 3.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.470
Negative 3 plus negative
1 is negative 4.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.730
So this will factor out as
x minus 3 times x minus 1.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.230
And on the right-hand
side, we still

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.260
have that being equal to 0.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.550
And now we can think about what
x's will make this expression

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.300
0, and if they make
this expression 0,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.190
well they're going to
make this expression 0.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.600
Which is going to make
this expression equal to 0.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.700
And so this will be true if
either one of these is 0.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.080
So x minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.860
Or x minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.460
This is true, and you can
add 3 to both sides of this.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.270
This is true when
x is equal to 3.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.640
This is true when
x is equal to 1.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.810
So we were able to figure
out these two points

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.476
right over here.

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:18.040
This is x is equal to 1.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.000
This is x is equal to 3.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.260
So this is the point 1 comma 0.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.072
This is the point 3 comma 0.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.780
And so the last one
I want to figure out,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.150
is this point right
over here, the vertex.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.160
Now the vertex always
sits exactly smack dab

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.240
between the roots,
when you do have roots.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.740
Sometimes you might not
intersect the x-axis.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.650
So we already know what its
x-coordinate is going to be.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.940
It's going to be 2.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.690
And now we just have
to substitute back in

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.980
to figure out its y-coordinate.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:54.230
When x equals 2, y is going to
be equal to 5 times 2 squared

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.730
minus 20 times 2 plus 15,
which is equal to-- let's see,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.260
this is equal to 2 squared is 4.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.090
This is 20 minus 40 plus 15.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.970
So this is going
to be negative 20

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.810
plus 15, which is
equal to negative 5.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.920
So this is the point
2 comma negative 5.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.690
And so now we can go
back to the exercise

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.231
and actually plot
these three points.

00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:21.880
1 comma 0, 2 comma
negative 5, 3 comma 0.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.280
So let's do that.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.130
So first I'll do the vertex
at 2 comma negative 5,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.760
which is right there.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.740
And now we also know
one of the times

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.590
it intersects the
x-axis is at 1 comma 0.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.550
And the other time
is at 3 comma 0.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.610
And now we can check our answer.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.900
And we got it right.
