before I jump to the second derivative
let me just address a question that came

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820
let me just address a question that came
 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.480
let me just address a question that came
up in the break which is just the the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490
up in the break which is just the the
 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.700
up in the break which is just the the
nature of the the nature of the

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710
nature of the the nature of the
 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.470
nature of the the nature of the
parameters that you might see you know

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
parameters that you might see you know
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.419
parameters that you might see you know
here I might know that there is very

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:33.429
here I might know that there is very
 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:38.150
here I might know that there is very
little change if I change X a little bit

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
little change if I change X a little bit
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.720
little change if I change X a little bit
but here I know that if I change X a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730
but here I know that if I change X a
 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.020
but here I know that if I change X a
little bit there's a lot of change okay

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
little bit there's a lot of change okay
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.290
little bit there's a lot of change okay
and that you in problems like let's say

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300
and that you in problems like let's say
 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.939
and that you in problems like let's say
climate change that comes up all the

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949
climate change that comes up all the
 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.939
climate change that comes up all the
time so one of the standard topics is G

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949
time so one of the standard topics is G
 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.210
time so one of the standard topics is G
here is the greenhouse gas concentration

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220
here is the greenhouse gas concentration
 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.020
here is the greenhouse gas concentration
in the atmosphere and this might be the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030
in the atmosphere and this might be the
 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.550
in the atmosphere and this might be the
damage and damage here is broadly

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
damage and damage here is broadly
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.380
damage and damage here is broadly
defined it could be economic damage or

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390
defined it could be economic damage or
 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.040
defined it could be economic damage or
it could be other kinds of damage the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050
it could be other kinds of damage the
 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.010
it could be other kinds of damage the
question might be well does it look like

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020
question might be well does it look like
 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:35.190
question might be well does it look like
that does it look like this or does it

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200
that does it look like this or does it
 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:47.340
that does it look like this or does it
look like that okay and so clearly what

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
look like that okay and so clearly what
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.230
look like that okay and so clearly what
really matters here is what's the slope

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
really matters here is what's the slope
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.470
really matters here is what's the slope
or what's the derivative of the damage

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480
or what's the derivative of the damage
 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.390
or what's the derivative of the damage
function close to where we are and so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400
function close to where we are and so
 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.830
function close to where we are and so
all kinds of analysis is done to try to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
all kinds of analysis is done to try to
 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.690
all kinds of analysis is done to try to
determine whether the slope looks like

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700
determine whether the slope looks like
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.610
determine whether the slope looks like
this or it looks like that or it looks

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620
this or it looks like that or it looks
 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.580
this or it looks like that or it looks
like that and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590
like that and
 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.509
like that and
so much of the debates surrounding the

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519
so much of the debates surrounding the
 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.920
so much of the debates surrounding the
costs and benefits of carbon dioxide

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930
costs and benefits of carbon dioxide
 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.280
costs and benefits of carbon dioxide
mitigation really hinge on whether you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290
mitigation really hinge on whether you
 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.380
mitigation really hinge on whether you
think that the damage function looks

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390
think that the damage function looks
 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.410
think that the damage function looks
like this or this or that okay okay now

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420
like this or this or that okay okay now
 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.229
like this or this or that okay okay now
the the second derivative so we all

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239
the the second derivative so we all
 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.940
the the second derivative so we all
understand what the first derivative is

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950
understand what the first derivative is
 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.490
understand what the first derivative is
if you think of the first derivative not

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500
if you think of the first derivative not
 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.630
if you think of the first derivative not
just as a slope but as itself a function

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640
just as a slope but as itself a function
 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.839
just as a slope but as itself a function
of X then you might want to know well

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849
of X then you might want to know well
 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.630
of X then you might want to know well
how does this function of X the first

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640
how does this function of X the first
 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.900
how does this function of X the first
derivative how does its slope behave

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910
derivative how does its slope behave
 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.949
derivative how does its slope behave
okay in in this example here is a

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959
okay in in this example here is a
 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.319
okay in in this example here is a
function f of X I took its first

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329
function f of X I took its first
 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.979
function f of X I took its first
derivative and that first derivative

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989
derivative and that first derivative
 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.530
derivative and that first derivative
happens to be a straight line I could

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540
happens to be a straight line I could
 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.069
happens to be a straight line I could
ask well what what how does the slope of

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079
ask well what what how does the slope of
 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.190
ask well what what how does the slope of
this first derivative behave and you'd

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200
this first derivative behave and you'd
 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.490
this first derivative behave and you'd
probably have an easy answer right it's

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500
probably have an easy answer right it's
 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.479
probably have an easy answer right it's
just a straight line the slope of this

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489
just a straight line the slope of this
 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.759
just a straight line the slope of this
first derivative is everywhere constant

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769
first derivative is everywhere constant
 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:56.850
first derivative is everywhere constant
okay and so it would actually look like

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860
 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.950
anybody want to take a guess parallel to

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960
anybody want to take a guess parallel to
 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.560
anybody want to take a guess parallel to
the x-axis is this correct or wrong

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570
the x-axis is this correct or wrong
 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.110
the x-axis is this correct or wrong
wrong okay it's negative right so it

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120
wrong okay it's negative right so it
 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.360
wrong okay it's negative right so it
should be something like that why is it

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370
should be something like that why is it
 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.650
should be something like that why is it
negative because it's done with sloping

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660
negative because it's done with sloping
 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:28.730
negative because it's done with sloping
okay so this is f prime prime of X ok so

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740
okay so this is f prime prime of X ok so
 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.070
okay so this is f prime prime of X ok so
this well this is the second derivative

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080
this well this is the second derivative
 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.270
this well this is the second derivative
that is this is the slope of that slope

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280
that is this is the slope of that slope
 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.520
that is this is the slope of that slope
and that is the slope of that okay so

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530
and that is the slope of that okay so
 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.720
and that is the slope of that okay so
this function is the slope of that

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730
this function is the slope of that
 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.070
this function is the slope of that
function and this function is the slope

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080
function and this function is the slope
 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.050
function and this function is the slope
of that function but this function is

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060
of that function but this function is
 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.559
of that function but this function is
itself a slope yes

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569
 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:08.020
no it's just because I've shown you a

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030
no it's just because I've shown you a
 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.439
no it's just because I've shown you a
relatively simple initial function here

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449
relatively simple initial function here
 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.189
relatively simple initial function here
that its first derivative was a straight

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199
that its first derivative was a straight
 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.070
that its first derivative was a straight
line and because its first derivative

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080
line and because its first derivative
 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.779
line and because its first derivative
was a straight line its second

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789
was a straight line its second
 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.180
was a straight line its second
derivative was a horizontal line if I

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190
derivative was a horizontal line if I
 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.520
derivative was a horizontal line if I
yeah if I went back to that the crazy

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530
yeah if I went back to that the crazy
 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.770
yeah if I went back to that the crazy
function its first durable its first

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780
function its first durable its first
 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.170
function its first durable its first
derivative looks a little bit more

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180
derivative looks a little bit more
 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.230
derivative looks a little bit more
complex than that actually it's even

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240
complex than that actually it's even
 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.560
complex than that actually it's even
more complex than this if I were to take

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570
more complex than this if I were to take
 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.409
more complex than this if I were to take
a derivative of this then I would get a

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419
a derivative of this then I would get a
 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.580
a derivative of this then I would get a
function that's still nonlinear and that

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590
function that's still nonlinear and that
 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.350
function that's still nonlinear and that
too would have its own derivative and

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360
too would have its own derivative and
 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.649
too would have its own derivative and
that might still be nonlinear and so on

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659
that might still be nonlinear and so on
 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:07.920
that might still be nonlinear and so on
okay in a sense the the amount of

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930
okay in a sense the the amount of
 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.689
okay in a sense the the amount of
differentiation the number of times you

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699
differentiation the number of times you
 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.899
differentiation the number of times you
have to differentiate to get to a

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909
have to differentiate to get to a
 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.219
have to differentiate to get to a
straight line is a measure or a metric

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229
straight line is a measure or a metric
 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.409
straight line is a measure or a metric
of the non-linearity of a function you

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419
of the non-linearity of a function you
 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.899
of the non-linearity of a function you
know so when you see away when you're

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909
know so when you see away when you're
 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:30.300
know so when you see away when you're
going to do your science classes or your

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310
going to do your science classes or your
 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.610
going to do your science classes or your
climate classes and so on you'll hear of

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620
climate classes and so on you'll hear of
 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.820
climate classes and so on you'll hear of
highly nonlinear functions highly

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830
highly nonlinear functions highly
 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.570
highly nonlinear functions highly
nonlinear when when we say highly or not

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580
nonlinear when when we say highly or not
 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.230
nonlinear when when we say highly or not
so highly that's determined by the

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240
so highly that's determined by the
 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.100
so highly that's determined by the
number of times that you'd have to take

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110
number of times that you'd have to take
 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.580
number of times that you'd have to take
a derivative to get to a straight line

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590
 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.930
okay

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940
 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.340
yeah most functions if you kept taking

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350
yeah most functions if you kept taking
 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.140
yeah most functions if you kept taking
derivatives you'd get very close to a

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150
derivatives you'd get very close to a
 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.730
derivatives you'd get very close to a
straight line not it wouldn't ness if

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740
straight line not it wouldn't ness if
 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.570
straight line not it wouldn't ness if
you take functions that we can imagine

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580
you take functions that we can imagine
 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.379
you take functions that we can imagine
in some random way not function that

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389
in some random way not function that
 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:18.450
in some random way not function that
we've constructed specifically to be

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460
we've constructed specifically to be
 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.240
we've constructed specifically to be
pathological you know then if you just

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250
pathological you know then if you just
 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.100
pathological you know then if you just
took some random functions that we

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110
took some random functions that we
 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.600
took some random functions that we
constructed you can almost certainly say

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610
constructed you can almost certainly say
 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.550
constructed you can almost certainly say
that in a finite number of steps you'd

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560
that in a finite number of steps you'd
 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.950
that in a finite number of steps you'd
of differentiation you'd get to a

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960
of differentiation you'd get to a
 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.090
of differentiation you'd get to a
straight line but you can also construct

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.100
straight line but you can also construct
 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.460
straight line but you can also construct
pathological functions which don't

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.470
pathological functions which don't
 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.040
pathological functions which don't
converge to a straight line easily and

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.050
converge to a straight line easily and
 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.110
converge to a straight line easily and
that's those are the kinds of functions

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120
that's those are the kinds of functions
 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.730
that's those are the kinds of functions
that are used in crip in encrypted grams

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:50.740
that are used in crip in encrypted grams
 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.460
that are used in crip in encrypted grams
in encryption because one of the ways of

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:53.470
in encryption because one of the ways of
 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.710
in encryption because one of the ways of
carrying out encryption is to look for

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720
carrying out encryption is to look for
 

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.020
carrying out encryption is to look for
derivatives of underlying random

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.030

to be labeled as the philosophical one

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:12.460
to be labeled as the philosophical one
 

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.320
to be labeled as the philosophical one
in your class because because she's

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:16.330
in your class because because she's
 

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.740
in your class because because she's
always giving me imponderable questions

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:18.750
always giving me imponderable questions
 

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.710
always giving me imponderable questions
but but so that's a it's a deeply

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720
but but so that's a it's a deeply
 

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.589
but but so that's a it's a deeply
philosophical question as to whether the

00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599
philosophical question as to whether the
 

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:29.000
philosophical question as to whether the
functions that we see in nature are

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.010
functions that we see in nature are
 

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:34.490
functions that we see in nature are
complex because we because there's noise

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500
complex because we because there's noise
 

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.680
complex because we because there's noise
and that noise creates complexity or

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:39.690
and that noise creates complexity or
 

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.680
and that noise creates complexity or
because nature itself is complex and we

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:43.690
because nature itself is complex and we
 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.620
because nature itself is complex and we
don't know we don't know all the

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:46.630
don't know we don't know all the
 

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.600
don't know we don't know all the
variables that affect it so it looks

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:48.610
variables that affect it so it looks
 

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.360
variables that affect it so it looks
like noise to us but actually if we

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.370
like noise to us but actually if we
 

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.120
like noise to us but actually if we
worked out or if we knew all the

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.130
worked out or if we knew all the
 

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.220
worked out or if we knew all the
variables that affected it it wouldn't

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.230
variables that affected it it wouldn't
 

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.930
variables that affected it it wouldn't
look like noise at all but that's beyond

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:00.940
look like noise at all but that's beyond
 

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.240
look like noise at all but that's beyond
the scope of this certainly this session

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.250

ok so then what you want to know is the

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880
ok so then what you want to know is the
 

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.180
ok so then what you want to know is the
second derivative of a function

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:09.190
second derivative of a function
 

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.880
second derivative of a function
is the derivative of the derivative of

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:11.890
is the derivative of the derivative of
 

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.880
is the derivative of the derivative of
the function okay so it's a function

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:14.890
the function okay so it's a function
 

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.160
the function okay so it's a function
that gives you the slope of the

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.170
that gives you the slope of the
 

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.430
that gives you the slope of the
derivative or the slope of the slope and

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440
derivative or the slope of the slope and
 

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.610
derivative or the slope of the slope and
it also has its notation F double prime

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:23.620
it also has its notation F double prime
 

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.220
it also has its notation F double prime
X is the most convenient one but you'll

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.230
X is the most convenient one but you'll
 

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:33.030
X is the most convenient one but you'll
also see d squared Y over DX squared or

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040
also see d squared Y over DX squared or
 

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.370
also see d squared Y over DX squared or
d squared f of X over DX squared okay to

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:38.380
d squared f of X over DX squared okay to
 

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.020
d squared f of X over DX squared okay to
denote that and you'll see a third

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.030
denote that and you'll see a third
 

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.890
denote that and you'll see a third
derivative too sometimes generally you

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:43.900
derivative too sometimes generally you
 

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.500
derivative too sometimes generally you
will not see the third derivative in in

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:46.510
will not see the third derivative in in
 

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.720
will not see the third derivative in in
economics but you will see it quite a

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:48.730
economics but you will see it quite a
 

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:56.750
economics but you will see it quite a
lot in biology and climate science and

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760
lot in biology and climate science and
 

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:02.970
lot in biology and climate science and
engineering okay I haven't yet shown you

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:02.980
engineering okay I haven't yet shown you
 

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.820
engineering okay I haven't yet shown you
what convexity in concavity mean but

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:05.830
what convexity in concavity mean but
 

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.110
what convexity in concavity mean but
just keep in mind that by definition for

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120
just keep in mind that by definition for
 

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.080
just keep in mind that by definition for
differentiable functions if the second

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.090
differentiable functions if the second
 

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.070
differentiable functions if the second
derivative is positive then the function

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.080
derivative is positive then the function
 

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.710
derivative is positive then the function
is convex if the second derivative is

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720
is convex if the second derivative is
 

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.230
is convex if the second derivative is
negative the function is concave and you

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240
negative the function is concave and you
 

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.480
negative the function is concave and you
don't you'll see what that means in a

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:24.490
don't you'll see what that means in a
 

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:33.630
don't you'll see what that means in a
second okay okay so here is a concave

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640
second okay okay so here is a concave
 

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:39.180
second okay okay so here is a concave
function okay it's very common to see

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.190
function okay it's very common to see
 

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.870
function okay it's very common to see
both students and instructors become

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880
both students and instructors become
 

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.720
both students and instructors become
confused about what's concave and what's

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:45.730
confused about what's concave and what's
 

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:51.540
confused about what's concave and what's
convex part of it is that a concave up

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:51.550
convex part of it is that a concave up
 

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.540
convex part of it is that a concave up
function is also referred to as a convex

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:54.550
function is also referred to as a convex
 

00:10:54.550 --> 00:11:00.480
function is also referred to as a convex
down function so and that terminology

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:00.490
down function so and that terminology
 

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.970
down function so and that terminology
comes from pure mathematics so we we

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:02.980
comes from pure mathematics so we we
 

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.460
comes from pure mathematics so we we
tend not to use that usually in

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:05.470
tend not to use that usually in
 

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.430
tend not to use that usually in
applications this is referred to as a

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440
applications this is referred to as a
 

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:15.540
applications this is referred to as a
concave function that's concave up so

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:15.550
concave function that's concave up so
 

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.720
concave function that's concave up so
generally in these applications you if

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:18.730
generally in these applications you if
 

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:24.710
generally in these applications you if
it says concave it means concave up

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720
 

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:33.240
and usually what that means is that the

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.250
and usually what that means is that the
 

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:41.450
and usually what that means is that the
greater than set the greater than set

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:41.460
greater than set the greater than set
 

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:54.860
greater than set the greater than set
which is this set here is concave okay

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:54.870
which is this set here is concave okay
 

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.210
which is this set here is concave okay
so you can try to remember that we

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:57.220
so you can try to remember that we
 

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.670
so you can try to remember that we
concave up means that the greater than

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680
concave up means that the greater than
 

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.210
concave up means that the greater than
set is concave or you can just get

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220
set is concave or you can just get
 

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.350
set is concave or you can just get
internalize that this is a concave

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360
internalize that this is a concave
 

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:15.450
internalize that this is a concave
function okay okay now what is concavity

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:15.460
function okay okay now what is concavity
 

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.760
function okay okay now what is concavity
a differentiable function f is concave

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:17.770
a differentiable function f is concave
 

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:24.110
a differentiable function f is concave
if its derivative function its slope is

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120
if its derivative function its slope is
 

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.670
if its derivative function its slope is
monotonically decreasing that means it's

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.680
monotonically decreasing that means it's
 

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.690
monotonically decreasing that means it's
always decreasing concave function has

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:30.700
always decreasing concave function has
 

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.960
always decreasing concave function has
decreasing slope okay let's go back and

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:33.970
decreasing slope okay let's go back and
 

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.810
decreasing slope okay let's go back and
look at this concave function here it's

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:36.820
look at this concave function here it's
 

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:43.220
look at this concave function here it's
upwards steeply upwardly sloped here

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.230
upwards steeply upwardly sloped here
 

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.280
upwards steeply upwardly sloped here
it's still upwardly slope but more

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:47.290
it's still upwardly slope but more
 

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.980
it's still upwardly slope but more
shallow so it's slope while always

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:52.990
shallow so it's slope while always
 

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:59.490
shallow so it's slope while always
positive is becoming smaller okay so

00:12:59.490 --> 00:12:59.500
positive is becoming smaller okay so
 

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.760
positive is becoming smaller okay so
that is a concave function slope is

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:02.770
that is a concave function slope is
 

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:12.420
that is a concave function slope is
always decreasing and okay convex

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:12.430
always decreasing and okay convex
 

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:17.250
always decreasing and okay convex
function is just the opposite slope is

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:17.260
function is just the opposite slope is
 

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.060
function is just the opposite slope is
always increasing okay so what's going

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.070
always increasing okay so what's going
 

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:25.790
always increasing okay so what's going
on here up here the slope is steep but

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800
on here up here the slope is steep but
 

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.420
on here up here the slope is steep but
negative so this is the slope here is a

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:30.430
negative so this is the slope here is a
 

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:35.960
negative so this is the slope here is a
large negative number let's say minus

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:35.970
large negative number let's say minus
 

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:45.180
large negative number let's say minus
aight here it's probably closer to minus

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.190
aight here it's probably closer to minus
 

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:52.230
aight here it's probably closer to minus
1 so its slope goes from minus a 2-1

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240
1 so its slope goes from minus a 2-1
 

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.510
1 so its slope goes from minus a 2-1
that means its slope is increasing here

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:57.520
that means its slope is increasing here
 

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.620
that means its slope is increasing here
its slope is 0 and here its slope is

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:01.630
its slope is 0 and here its slope is
 

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.410
its slope is 0 and here its slope is
positive so slope is always increasing

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:04.420
positive so slope is always increasing
 

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.200
positive so slope is always increasing
for this function it's a convex function

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.210
for this function it's a convex function
 

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.970
for this function it's a convex function
ok ok an alternative definition that you

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:14.980
ok ok an alternative definition that you
 

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:22.050
ok ok an alternative definition that you
will see of concavity and convexity has

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:22.060
will see of concavity and convexity has
 

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:28.829
will see of concavity and convexity has
to do with intermediate points is this a

00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839
to do with intermediate points is this a
 

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:33.210
to do with intermediate points is this a
concave or convex function concave right

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:33.220
concave or convex function concave right
 

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:38.220
concave or convex function concave right
for a concave function if you take two

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.230
for a concave function if you take two
 

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:44.010
for a concave function if you take two
points along the x-axis let's say X 1

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:44.020
points along the x-axis let's say X 1
 

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:53.940
points along the x-axis let's say X 1
and X 2 and you evaluate the function at

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:53.950
and X 2 and you evaluate the function at
 

00:14:53.950 --> 00:15:05.470
and X 2 and you evaluate the function at
those points

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480
 

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:11.050
you draw a straight line joining you

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:11.060
you draw a straight line joining you
 

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.160
you draw a straight line joining you
draw a straight line joining the two

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:15.170
draw a straight line joining the two
 

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:21.100
draw a straight line joining the two
values of the function that straight

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.110
values of the function that straight
 

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.470
values of the function that straight
line will always lie below the function

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480
line will always lie below the function
 

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.240
line will always lie below the function
itself ok that's a concave function and

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.250
itself ok that's a concave function and
 

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.840
itself ok that's a concave function and
you could if you like to do logical

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:31.850
you could if you like to do logical
 

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.670
you could if you like to do logical
proofs you could play around it's not a

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680
proofs you could play around it's not a
 

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.490
proofs you could play around it's not a
difficult proof to show that this

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:42.500
difficult proof to show that this
 

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.930
difficult proof to show that this
definition of concavity will is

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:46.940
definition of concavity will is
 

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.420
definition of concavity will is
equivalent to this definition of

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:49.430
equivalent to this definition of
 

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:55.240
equivalent to this definition of
concavity ok I'm vice versa for

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:55.250
concavity ok I'm vice versa for
 

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.329
concavity ok I'm vice versa for
convection but that shouldn't be your

00:15:58.329 --> 00:15:58.339
convection but that shouldn't be your
 

00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:09.220
convection but that shouldn't be your
primary focus in this program ok but

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:09.230
primary focus in this program ok but
 

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.990
primary focus in this program ok but
this is a useful thing to keep in mind

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000
this is a useful thing to keep in mind
 

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.900
this is a useful thing to keep in mind
actually the reason I'm telling you this

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:13.910
actually the reason I'm telling you this
 

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.110
actually the reason I'm telling you this
is not for you to do a proof but because

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120
is not for you to do a proof but because
 

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.150
is not for you to do a proof but because
you'll find that this this idea or this

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160
you'll find that this this idea or this
 

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.040
you'll find that this this idea or this
mathematical definition actually has

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:26.050
mathematical definition actually has
 

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:32.199
mathematical definition actually has
quite a practical application and you'll

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:32.209
quite a practical application and you'll
 

00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:33.819
quite a practical application and you'll
see that when we start doing economics

00:16:33.819 --> 00:16:33.829
see that when we start doing economics
 

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:38.069
see that when we start doing economics
but it has to do with the values of

00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079
but it has to do with the values of
 

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:42.730
but it has to do with the values of
averages so here it for a concave

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:42.740
averages so here it for a concave
 

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.050
averages so here it for a concave
function the function evaluated at some

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:47.060
function the function evaluated at some
 

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.590
function the function evaluated at some
average of x1 and x2 is always going to

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600
average of x1 and x2 is always going to
 

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.590
average of x1 and x2 is always going to
be higher than the average of the

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600
be higher than the average of the
 

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:00.550
be higher than the average of the
functions yeah that was quick for a

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560
functions yeah that was quick for a
 

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:07.319
functions yeah that was quick for a
concave function the function evaluated

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:07.329
concave function the function evaluated
 

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:17.260
concave function the function evaluated
at an average of x1 and x2 will always

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:17.270
at an average of x1 and x2 will always
 

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.740
at an average of x1 and x2 will always
be higher

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:19.750
be higher
 

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.970
be higher
then the average of the function of x1

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:24.980
then the average of the function of x1
 

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:36.160
then the average of the function of x1
and the function of X 2 and and that

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.170
and the function of X 2 and and that
 

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.410
and the function of X 2 and and that
will that'll turn out to be a very

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:38.420
will that'll turn out to be a very
 

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.640
will that'll turn out to be a very
useful application property when you

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:42.650
useful application property when you
 

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:46.300
useful application property when you
deal with things like risk and its

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:46.310
deal with things like risk and its
 

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:51.810
deal with things like risk and its
evaluation and and other applications to

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:51.820
evaluation and and other applications to
 

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:58.390
evaluation and and other applications to
okay yes yeah so this so think of let's

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400
okay yes yeah so this so think of let's
 

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.670
okay yes yeah so this so think of let's
say this is the average of x1 and x2

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:02.680
say this is the average of x1 and x2
 

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:08.640
say this is the average of x1 and x2
it's at the midpoint let's say okay then

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:08.650
it's at the midpoint let's say okay then
 

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:14.560
it's at the midpoint let's say okay then
this is f of X 2 this is f of X 1 and

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:14.570
this is f of X 2 this is f of X 1 and
 

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.630
this is f of X 2 this is f of X 1 and
this is f of X of X bar which is the

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640
this is f of X of X bar which is the
 

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:34.870
this is f of X of X bar which is the
average and this ok this is this is the

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880
average and this ok this is this is the
 

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:46.820
average and this ok this is this is the
average i'm using excel notation here

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:46.830
 

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:52.070
okay so that average of the functions is

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080
okay so that average of the functions is
 

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.710
okay so that average of the functions is
always less than the function of the

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720
always less than the function of the
 

00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:07.659
always less than the function of the
average right for a concave function yes

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:07.669
average right for a concave function yes
 

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:12.259
average right for a concave function yes
the average of the functions okay that's

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:12.269
the average of the functions okay that's
 

00:19:12.269 --> 00:19:16.310
the average of the functions okay that's
this the average of the functions is

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320
this the average of the functions is
 

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.340
this the average of the functions is
always less than the function of the

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:19.350
always less than the function of the
 

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.649
always less than the function of the
average that's the function of the

00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:21.659
average that's the function of the
 

00:19:21.659 --> 00:19:24.169
average that's the function of the
average that's the average you go up

00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179
average that's the average you go up
 

00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:25.700
average that's the average you go up
till you hit the function that's the

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:25.710
till you hit the function that's the
 

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.019
till you hit the function that's the
function of the average and this is the

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:30.029
function of the average and this is the
 

00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:31.789
function of the average and this is the
average of the functions because this is

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799
average of the functions because this is
 

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:33.710
average of the functions because this is
the function here that's function here

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720
the function here that's function here
 

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:41.539
the function here that's function here
and that's the average right and that's

00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:41.549
and that's the average right and that's
 

00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:50.320
and that's the average right and that's
the definition of a concave function hmm

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:50.330
 

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.210
the secant yeah the secant here is

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220
the secant yeah the secant here is
 

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.330
the secant yeah the secant here is
always below so you know and when we

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340
always below so you know and when we
 

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.299
always below so you know and when we
went if you go back and look at that

00:19:58.299 --> 00:19:58.309
went if you go back and look at that
 

00:19:58.309 --> 00:20:02.060
went if you go back and look at that
that secant line tangent line thing

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:02.070
that secant line tangent line thing
 

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.700
that secant line tangent line thing
you'll see that that was a convex

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:04.710
you'll see that that was a convex
 

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.529
you'll see that that was a convex
function so the secant line was always

00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539
function so the secant line was always
 

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:17.600
function so the secant line was always
above okay okay okay now so we're going

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:17.610
above okay okay okay now so we're going
 

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.360
above okay okay okay now so we're going
to jump into the technical part of this

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:20.370
to jump into the technical part of this
 

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.060
to jump into the technical part of this
the differentiation rules but before I

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.070
the differentiation rules but before I
 

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.669
the differentiation rules but before I
jump to that I want to make sure that

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679
jump to that I want to make sure that
 

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:31.940
jump to that I want to make sure that
you have at least an intuitive grappling

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:31.950
you have at least an intuitive grappling
 

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.470
you have at least an intuitive grappling
I don't you don't have to have a grasp

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480
I don't you don't have to have a grasp
 

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.820
I don't you don't have to have a grasp
but you have to have an intuitive sort

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:37.830
but you have to have an intuitive sort
 

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.230
but you have to have an intuitive sort
of grappling with the idea of a slope a

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240
of grappling with the idea of a slope a
 

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.990
of grappling with the idea of a slope a
derivative doesn't really matter about

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000
derivative doesn't really matter about
 

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.220
derivative doesn't really matter about
the second derivative too much okay if

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.230
the second derivative too much okay if
 

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.669
the second derivative too much okay if
you get that then that's that's a lot

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679
you get that then that's that's a lot
 

00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:56.180
you get that then that's that's a lot
and in general the way that you know of

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:56.190
and in general the way that you know of
 

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.960
and in general the way that you know of
course the way knowledge is constructed

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:58.970
course the way knowledge is constructed
 

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.710
course the way knowledge is constructed
if you under

then the the simplest twenty percent of
 

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.649
then the the simplest twenty percent of
the material then you understand eighty

00:21:06.649 --> 00:21:06.659
the material then you understand eighty
 

00:21:06.659 --> 00:21:11.060
the material then you understand eighty
percent of the problem and if you and

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:11.070
percent of the problem and if you and
 

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:16.810
percent of the problem and if you and
you generally spend a lot of time

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:16.820
you generally spend a lot of time
 

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.220
you generally spend a lot of time
understanding the last twenty percent of

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:19.230
understanding the last twenty percent of
 

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.840
understanding the last twenty percent of
the problem but when you learn you

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:23.850
the problem but when you learn you
 

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.340
the problem but when you learn you
should try to make sure you spend eighty

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:25.350
should try to make sure you spend eighty
 

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.620
should try to make sure you spend eighty
percent of the time understanding the

percent of the time understanding the
 

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.700
percent of the time understanding the
simplest twenty percent okay so now this

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:31.710
simplest twenty percent okay so now this
 

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.169
simplest twenty percent okay so now this
part is really all mechanical and in

00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179
part is really all mechanical and in
 

00:21:36.179 --> 00:21:39.529
part is really all mechanical and in
real applications you probably won't use

00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539
real applications you probably won't use
 

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:43.730
real applications you probably won't use
it that is if you have a very

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740
it that is if you have a very
 

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.620
it that is if you have a very
complicated function well you're going

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:45.630
complicated function well you're going
 

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.320
complicated function well you're going
to ask your computer software to

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:48.330
to ask your computer software to
 

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.390
to ask your computer software to
determine its derivative you know

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400
determine its derivative you know
 

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.130
determine its derivative you know
whether it's MATLAB or octave or or your

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140
whether it's MATLAB or octave or or your
 

00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.830
whether it's MATLAB or octave or or your
computing derivatives numerically and if

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840
computing derivatives numerically and if
 

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.529
computing derivatives numerically and if
it's really simple the only reason that

00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539
it's really simple the only reason that
 

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:05.600
it's really simple the only reason that
you need to learn to take a derivative

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:05.610
you need to learn to take a derivative
 

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.049
you need to learn to take a derivative
is for exams and we all know that exams

00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:09.059
is for exams and we all know that exams
 

00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:11.600
is for exams and we all know that exams
are not going to be your determinant of

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:11.610
are not going to be your determinant of
 

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:16.010
are not going to be your determinant of
success in the endeavor that you've

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020
success in the endeavor that you've
 

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:21.590
success in the endeavor that you've
staked out for yourselves but so there's

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600
staked out for yourselves but so there's
 

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.940
staked out for yourselves but so there's
a lot of slides here but I'm going to

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:22.950
a lot of slides here but I'm going to
 

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.600
a lot of slides here but I'm going to
take you through them relatively quickly

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:25.610
take you through them relatively quickly
 

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:32.840
take you through them relatively quickly
but stop me if if you want to okay but

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:32.850
but stop me if if you want to okay but
 

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.760
but stop me if if you want to okay but
some basic rules you do want to

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:34.770
some basic rules you do want to
 

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.970
some basic rules you do want to
internalize that is functions of course

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980
internalize that is functions of course
 

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.909
internalize that is functions of course
might be sums of many different terms

00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919
might be sums of many different terms
 

00:22:42.919 --> 00:22:48.049
might be sums of many different terms
and as such when you differentiate you

00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:48.059
and as such when you differentiate you
 

00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:53.930
and as such when you differentiate you
can generally take the sums of the

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940
can generally take the sums of the
 

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.549
can generally take the sums of the
derivatives that is if you have a

00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559
derivatives that is if you have a
 

00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:58.510
derivatives that is if you have a
function that's the sum of two functions

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520
function that's the sum of two functions
 

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.880
function that's the sum of two functions
it's derivative is going to be the sum

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:01.890
it's derivative is going to be the sum
 

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.210
it's derivative is going to be the sum
of the two derivatives that is you could

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220
of the two derivatives that is you could
 

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.760
of the two derivatives that is you could
take a derivative of each function and

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:07.770
take a derivative of each function and
 

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.210
take a derivative of each function and
add them together and you'd get the

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:10.220
add them together and you'd get the
 

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.760
add them together and you'd get the
derivative of the original function so

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:13.770
derivative of the original function so
 

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:19.280
derivative of the original function so
and you'll see you'll see well actually

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.290
and you'll see you'll see well actually
 

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.620
and you'll see you'll see well actually
that's probably the next rule the first

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:21.630
that's probably the next rule the first
 

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.370
that's probably the next rule the first
rule is you can take each term you can

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380
rule is you can take each term you can
 

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.260
rule is you can take each term you can
you can try to take a derivative of each

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:27.270
you can try to take a derivative of each
 

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.700
you can try to take a derivative of each
term at a time and the derivative of a

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:31.710
term at a time and the derivative of a
 

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.000
term at a time and the derivative of a
constant you already know is 0 right the

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.010
constant you already know is 0 right the
 

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.720
constant you already know is 0 right the
slope of a constant is 0 a constant

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:38.730
slope of a constant is 0 a constant
 

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.570
slope of a constant is 0 a constant
function is a horizontal line it has

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580
function is a horizontal line it has
 

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:50.870
function is a horizontal line it has
zero slope ok ok so another rule when X

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880
zero slope ok ok so another rule when X
 

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.470
zero slope ok ok so another rule when X
is raised to the power of one that then

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480
is raised to the power of one that then
 

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.440
is raised to the power of one that then
the slope of the coefficient on the

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:57.450
the slope of the coefficient on the
 

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.360
the slope of the coefficient on the
slope is just a coefficient on that X

00:23:59.360 --> 00:23:59.370
slope is just a coefficient on that X
 

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:04.940
slope is just a coefficient on that X
right so if Y is equal to 2 X the slope

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:04.950
right so if Y is equal to 2 X the slope
 

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:10.580
right so if Y is equal to 2 X the slope
of 2 X is just too and what's the slope

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:10.590
of 2 X is just too and what's the slope
 

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:16.130
of 2 X is just too and what's the slope
of 15 0 so the slope of 2x plus 15 is 2

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140
of 15 0 so the slope of 2x plus 15 is 2
 

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:24.500
of 15 0 so the slope of 2x plus 15 is 2
plus 0 ok Rule three when X is raised to

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:24.510
plus 0 ok Rule three when X is raised to
 

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.230
plus 0 ok Rule three when X is raised to
some power n greater than one but an

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240
some power n greater than one but an
 

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.920
some power n greater than one but an
integer then to get the slope you pull

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:30.930
integer then to get the slope you pull
 

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.890
integer then to get the slope you pull
out the coefficient this this sounds

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900
out the coefficient this this sounds
 

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.070
out the coefficient this this sounds
more complicated than it really is you

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080
more complicated than it really is you
 

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.230
more complicated than it really is you
pull out the co-efficient you multiply

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240
pull out the co-efficient you multiply
 

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.860
pull out the co-efficient you multiply
that by the power of X you multiply that

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:42.870
that by the power of X you multiply that
 

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.340
that by the power of X you multiply that
term by X and you carry it to the power

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:46.350
term by X and you carry it to the power
 

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.270
term by X and you carry it to the power
n minus 1 you know if i read that i'd

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280
n minus 1 you know if i read that i'd
 

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:56.060
n minus 1 you know if i read that i'd
have no idea what that meant but but if

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.070
have no idea what that meant but but if
 

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.340
have no idea what that meant but but if
you have done even a little bit of

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:58.350
you have done even a little bit of
 

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.000
you have done even a little bit of
calculus you'll remember that you know

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.010
calculus you'll remember that you know
 

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:16.250
calculus you'll remember that you know
that the derivative of x n is n X to the

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260
that the derivative of x n is n X to the
 

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.540
that the derivative of x n is n X to the
M minus 1 ok and that's all of that says

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:20.550
M minus 1 ok and that's all of that says
 

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.750
M minus 1 ok and that's all of that says
so you can see that sometimes sometimes

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760
so you can see that sometimes sometimes
 

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.450
so you can see that sometimes sometimes
it's easier to speak in mathematics than

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460
it's easier to speak in mathematics than
 

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.880
it's easier to speak in mathematics than
in English

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:27.890
in English
 

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.070
in English
sorry right right which is the reason

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080
sorry right right which is the reason
 

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.770
sorry right right which is the reason
for this okay which is why you want to

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:33.780
for this okay which is why you want to
 

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.390
for this okay which is why you want to
spend three hours before Labor Day

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.400
spend three hours before Labor Day
 

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.030
spend three hours before Labor Day
weekend doing this okay so what's the

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:41.040
weekend doing this okay so what's the
 

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:48.170
weekend doing this okay so what's the
slope of 5x cubed plus 10 well I guess I

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:48.180
slope of 5x cubed plus 10 well I guess I
 

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.440
slope of 5x cubed plus 10 well I guess I
gave you the answer there so so that's 3

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:51.450
gave you the answer there so so that's 3
 

00:25:51.450 --> 00:26:01.280
gave you the answer there so so that's 3
times 5 is 15 times X to the 3-1 okay so

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:01.290
times 5 is 15 times X to the 3-1 okay so
 

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.060
times 5 is 15 times X to the 3-1 okay so
that's 15 x squared and then the

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:05.070
that's 15 x squared and then the
 

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:09.980
that's 15 x squared and then the
derivative of that is 0 okay how many

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:09.990
derivative of that is 0 okay how many
 

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.960
derivative of that is 0 okay how many
for how many people is this completely

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:11.970
for how many people is this completely
 

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:17.390
for how many people is this completely
new a few of you right okay so what what

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400
new a few of you right okay so what what
 

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.480
new a few of you right okay so what what
I want you to do is to make sure that

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:20.490
I want you to do is to make sure that
 

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.340
I want you to do is to make sure that
you come and talk to me afterwards or

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:24.350
you come and talk to me afterwards or
 

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.960
you come and talk to me afterwards or
rather actually send me an email and

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:26.970
rather actually send me an email and
 

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.220
rather actually send me an email and
I'll make sure that we spend time
