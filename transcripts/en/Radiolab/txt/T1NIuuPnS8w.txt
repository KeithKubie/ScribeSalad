Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. We're continuing with our live performance of apocalyptical from the paramount Peter in Seattle, Washington. And we just heard a new theory about the end of the dinosaurs, a very sudden fast, dramatic end with a sudden musical boom at the very, very end. Now for the next question, this is sort of the obvious next question, uh, which is what made it through and how well we did ask scientists that question and here is what they told us.

Speaker 2:          00:33          [inaudible] if on that day you were a creature in the ocean and you happened to be within 300 feet of the water surface. So you imagine this room filled with ocean water, we're talking about you guys up in the balcony up there will not surprise you to learn. You don't do very well. Uh, there's a certain amount of heat and mostly there's acid rain pouring in. So a lot of you will die. Look down with the higher paying seats if you're below 300 feet. And this always happens to people with different, with the better anyway. You do find, and on land it turns out plain ordinary dirt is a very good insulator. If you've got 1200 degrees on the surface, then about three, four inches down, you'd be comfortable there for several hours. Oh, just a couple inches. You only need a few inches. So that means you could be a little warm and if you squiggle down, you're okay. You could be a Beatle squiggling down. You're okay. You could be a dinosaur tending to an underground nest. And if the nest isn't far enough below the ground, and a lot of them were, then the babies that hatch will have babies that hatch will have babies that hatch, we will call their babies and years later birds. And if you're an early version of a crocodile, you bury yourself deep enough into the mud. You also get through as do the plant's roots. A lot gets through action.

Speaker 1:          01:59          And that actually brings us to, uh, what I find to be one of the coolest parts of this story. This is the part that involves all of us in this room. So it turns out on that day as the fire was raging above on the surface, somewhere in a little hole in the ground happened to be a furry little animal. It has the distinction of being the same.

Speaker 3:          02:20          Great. Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great. Okay, great. Great, great. Okay, great.

Speaker 4:          02:46          Et cetera. Grandma of everybody in this room. It is true. There was a creature down there. Um, there is a creature down there. I thought we should stop there because we were getting away with

Speaker 1:          03:00          something and I didn't want to push it too far. All of a sudden it was just usually, yeah. Though there is a creature down there, uh, in a, in a little hole and when the dinosaurs got cleared away, this creature could step out of her hole. She could step out of her niche. She had more food, more places to roam. She could populate the planet ushering in the age of mammals. And now here we all are in Seattle. Oh, don't flatter yourself. It's not a straight line. It's a weekly lie. Well, here's the problem. We've never known anything about this animal that gave rise to all of us. We've never known what she looked like. We've never known, uh, you know how she spent her days who'd never known anything cause we've had no fossils of her. But recently actually, literally as we were reporting this story right in the middle of our reporting, uh, a team of scientists led by a woman named Maureen O'Leary who is herself a memo. She took, uh, fossils that we do have fossils of this creature's descendants. And then using fancy algorithms was able to cross reference the traits to work our way back for the first time to a composite picture of what we think our great, great grandma look like. So now Seattle, a radio lab exclusive. We present to you our great, great, great, great here. A giant rodent costume thing runs out onto the stage.

Speaker 2:          04:21          All right, well this is what she looks like. And we got to point out certain anatomical features that Papa scientists admiration. First of all, she has very, very pink and fleshy ears, so show them that and a pale soft underbelly. It was all very nice for as Jad is now demonstrating, could you show them your profile just so they can see your head? Her skull is considered either rat flight or a crocodilian. You could go either way, but she does have enormous BD, black eyes, fleshy pink nose and would you show them your teeth? She's kind of proud of her teeth because they can tear flesh, they can rip medicine. She is an omnivore.

Speaker 1:          04:58          However, here was the issue. You was the issue that we ran into when we asked Maureen and the scientist who did this work. We were like, okay, now we've got an image of this creature. That's amazing. What do we call her? What is her name? This was Maureen's response. Its official name is the hypothetical placental mammal kind of a name. Was fat suddenly feeling bad for this little creature? Well, it's not something that we thought of as we were sort of visibly working on the paper. But then a funny thing happened. Our producer, Molly was talking to Maria and she was saying, Jesus, such an awful name and Maureen system, Molly, well, you can name it, and Molly says to Marie, wait, are you serious in Maureen System, Ali? I don't know. Are you serious? So we're like, hell yeah, we're serious. Let's crowd source this, right? This is what mammals do these days. We crowd source. I mean, think of this opportunity. A little radio show gets the name, the ancestor of us all. So we put out the call to the Internet. We got a thousand submissions in response. Great names. Like let's send doors first. First at Burs de Nova. Oh Ba, eh, after eight rounds of voting, the winning name was, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it.

Speaker 5:          06:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:29          on the screen. You see the following letters appear one after another, s, c, h, r, e. W. D, I, n. G, e, r,

Speaker 5:          06:42          shooting her, shooting her. I can't even tell you what a crisis this was for the staff. It's just such a bad day and the whole experience made us wonder, should we have died in that asteroid? Do we deserve to be here? [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:12          so if you're asking yourself, what is the moral of our story, here's what we've shown you. But we have a big mighty species that died and then a smaller species, which is you and I, we take it's place. So you've gotten death and you've gotten resurrection and you got it maybe in a single afternoon. So that's the argument we're making here. This is Jay Molossia's argument that it was boom over. I mean it is the suddenness of, of the whole over

Speaker 1:          07:36          that is kind of unimaginable. I mean like there you are, one day you have evolved over millions of years to be this long neck, beautiful creatures, 70 feet from your nose to your ass and then tail or tail. And then in an afternoon, like I'm on one Tuesday afternoons, suddenly you, everyone you knew gone.

Speaker 2:          07:58          Yeah. But there are other ways to think about this. The extinction yes, was sudden, but in the grand sweep of time it wasn't. Yeah, really. In the end. It was just a moment in a stream of endless change cause everything we see around us, the tallest mountains, the size of oceans, the animals about us that seem so different from ourselves. Every category that we have in our heads that seems so permanent, blurs given enough time, mountains erode and become hills. That beaches, animals changed in any kind of all kinds of ways and the only thing that's constant, it's always is change. You like to think of ourselves, we humans are somehow inevitable or crucial. Pivotal. The past was a time and we were missing in the future. We'll always have us in it, but that's an illusion. Says this great science writer, Lauren Isley. We are wrecked dolls made out of many ages and skins. He says, changelings who in wood nests or he is still the uncouth guys and waddling amphibians. We've played such roles for infinitely longer ages and we had been men. Our identity is a dream

Speaker 5:          09:08          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          09:09          We are process not reality. What we call realities as Isley is an illusion of the day light, the light of our own particular day.

Speaker 6:          09:27          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          09:28          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          09:31          just a couple of notes before we go on. Uh, that whole dinosaur thing, but the sudden fast end, that is just a theory. Uh, verdict is obviously still out. In fact, in 2011, a team of scientists published a paper saying that maybe the asteroid that hit the earth that created that devastation was not that distinct, but another asteroid with a different name, but with the same size and dimensions and all that. So who knows? Also, when I said to the people up in the balcony, if you were in the balcony, you might've been killed off by heat. I think that turns out to be a little bit wrong. If you've been in the shallow ocean of the day, he would've been acid rain and some other factors would have been in not so much heat.

Speaker 1:          10:12          Okay, so this is the part of the show coming up where we, uh, we, we, we traveled with a bunch of different comedians. Patton, Oswald, Simon Amstel, Ophir Eisenberg, Kurt Braunohler. Actually, Kurt opened this particular show. You can see his full set at radiolab.org/live super funny. But on this night, we had two comedians. And so right at this spot in the middle of the show, out walks a guy, one of the most talented mammals he looks like, actually, it's like someone with his finger in an electric socket. Huge amounts of here that are standing like, ouch. You know, like he's got a halo. His name

Speaker 5:          10:53          [inaudible]. We're just going to play his whole set. It's a little Seattle specific in spots, but it's just, well, hello. Hello, hello,

Speaker 7:          11:07          hello. What I get done. And then [inaudible] 11 [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] you can eat the, I could eat more.

Speaker 5:          11:36          Oh, you're the height. Warm music. Yeah. Zoom. Yeah. Zoom more room.

Speaker 7:          11:53          Microsoft.

Speaker 7:          12:01          Thank you. Um, this is a, this is a moment that you have to take, uh, if you can, uh, and if you can't, uh, you know, then you've lost it. But, um, once you have it, once you possess the moment, um, you can do so many things with it. Um, a lot of people tend to just exist within it. Um, others pawn it off to moment brokers. Um, uh, or if you're big fan fan of moment. Shawn's, uh, um, you, um, I can do that. Uh, also the moment, a moment, glory blend of coffee, single origin from Argentina is excellent. You can get that at most Bauhaus or participating in Stumptown coffee roasters. Um, so definitely check that out. I'm really stoked that we finally closed down that awful Bauhaus. Um, coffee and books. It was just what a terrible location, right?

Speaker 7:          13:03          You know, right on a like a corner where you can see it really visibly. And, um, I don't like that. Um, and, and I called the, the city, the city comptroller and I just said, we need to get rid of it and we need to get rid of many, many buildings cause there's a lot of those buildings are so old up on Capitol Hill, it's just, it gets, it gets old. Um, and so I'd like to replace them with new constructions, um, mostly glass, some contemporary metal. Um, and I want to be able to see the architect's idea and then see them have to shave off about 40% of that idea,

Speaker 5:          13:43          um,

Speaker 7:          13:44          by replacing a lot of the materials with cheaper versions of the original design. Um, I enjoy seeing that and I would rather see that than in a coffee shop that promotes, um, a type of communal living that can only happen in an area that it is located in. I just prefer it.

Speaker 5:          14:01          That's what I prefer. That's just me. Sorry guys.

Speaker 7:          14:08          I love new buildings. Okay. Maria? My, my, um, okay. So, um, obviously as you know, uh, Seattle is, is, uh, is, is becoming Vancouver. And the thing is,

Speaker 5:          14:23          um,

Speaker 7:          14:24          I'm going to do a song, um, that is about that. So you guys can get a little bit more used to the, the Vancouver Culture, um, that is spreading down

Speaker 5:          14:33          Canada, Canada,

Speaker 7:          14:37          um, little, uh, uh, Mr. Rogers reference, but, um, Canada is Atlanta may belief.

Speaker 5:          14:45          Okay,

Speaker 7:          14:50          here we go. Oh,

Speaker 5:          14:55          okay. Okay. Here we go.

Speaker 7:          15:00          Any big fans of anybody born after 1990?

Speaker 5:          15:05          Yeah, that's about the tonality you'd expect. Um, why is it always higher? I don't understand that.

Speaker 7:          15:17          Um, okay. Anyways, um, so you're gonna know this reference. This is a from the old, uh, buck Rogers series,

Speaker 5:          15:25          Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, g, Buck,

Speaker 7:          15:27          you know, that kind of stuff. So that's for you guys after nine to 98 so you guys can relate to what I'm doing on stage. And so,

Speaker 5:          15:34          um,

Speaker 7:          15:36          I hope you like this. This is, this is definitely, definitely a song. Okay.

Speaker 5:          16:33          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          16:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          17:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          17:08          good moment that you [inaudible] got home on my own food. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          17:45          [inaudible] [inaudible] right. [inaudible] thank you very much.

Speaker 7:          18:01          Um, if you're, if you're down, um, at a, in, in, in Ballard and having a good time, um, it's, it's because there's so much Scandinavian energy there that they just do, they just do it. Right.

Speaker 5:          18:18          Um,

Speaker 7:          18:19          so when you hit the sunset tavern and you're like, why isn't this turned into a glass tower? It's because the power of Norway, it's Norway. They're going to screw with that. You know what I mean? Like Norway at all. No, what I'm saying, there's no way out of this. I mean, you're basically, you know what I'm saying? It's like a hotdog. You know, you think you want it and you're like, ah, probably not. But

Speaker 5:          18:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          18:56          um, and I'm pretty stoked I've said this before, but I am going to say it again just because we're in Seattle. I am pretty stoked. Um, I balance, uh, of Vivace, um, being replaced by the Starbucks. I just think that it makes sense. It makes sense. Let the people who do it really well do it better. You know what I'm saying? That's what I'm saying. So this song is going to be one of those songs where you're gonna think to yourself, is this better than the original? Maybe. Okay.

Speaker 5:          19:26          Alright.

Speaker 7:          19:31          It's called pastiche in lieu of originality. Here we go.

Speaker 5:          20:00          [inaudible] hey. Hi.

Speaker 8:          20:04          Whoa. [inaudible] I want to talk in the ones that [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          20:23          I got it.

Speaker 8:          20:27          Whoa, Whoa, whoa. A little girl. [inaudible] characters reading her name's [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          20:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          20:40          Yay. You, you

Speaker 7:          20:43          know, the thing is a, the thing is

Speaker 5:          20:51          I think

Speaker 7:          20:52          using, using, using logic, um, I think, you know, obviously it, it is smart to name a company after a, a character from Battlestar Galactica, but I just,

Speaker 5:          21:05          it makes sense.

Speaker 7:          21:07          And that's why I'm starting my own coffee business called cylons.

Speaker 5:          21:11          Cylons coffee is the best coffee [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          21:20          I have a new movie coming out called silence of the lambs and, um, it's a theme song, uh, is done by Garfunkel notes. Of course, you can probably guess what that song is called a the sound of silence and, um, which is just

Speaker 5:          21:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          21:44          and sometimes and sometimes,

Speaker 5:          21:51          yeah,

Speaker 7:          21:56          it's the sound of silence. Okay. So,

Speaker 5:          21:58          um, this song, thank you for my next trick.

Speaker 7:          22:03          No, it's been a pleasure. This is my last, uh, Radicchio lab and I am, and I'll say no, in all seriousness. That's a totally different show, but I'm radio lab. Um, it's been awesome, man. I mean, uh, I discovered some really great friends the first time I did something, um, for radio lab and I continue to find great friendships and a love and passion for sound and um, science and knowledge and art. And so I think that, um, I'm lucky,

Speaker 5:          22:36          lucky to be a part of it in this small way that I am. So thanks, Radiolab, wherever you are.

Speaker 7:          22:43          Okay. So this is a, it's a quick song that goes.

Speaker 5:          22:51          Okay. Okay. And, uh, this song is,

Speaker 7:          22:58          this song is a, that's a, that's a good one.

Speaker 5:          23:04          Okay. There we go. [inaudible] oh. [inaudible] the snow. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          23:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          23:50          but no, we know

Speaker 8:          23:53          and is nine.

Speaker 5:          23:55          Oh Du du, du Du du Du, Du, Du, Du, Du [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          24:12          When I facing those dumb lizards walking cross this barren plane last born baby, ya can go and blame when those [inaudible] go. Tear into the sky, squawking with the laser precision swooping down seeking breeze and no wait. That shining little.in the distance is not a super extra shiny star. All the astro physicist dinosaurs would have said in that time before the [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          24:58          Uh Huh.

Speaker 8:          25:07          Matt. It was great to see the earth concoct his dreams. Large Lizard family, those lizards made sounds and attacked each other in more coats and clothing. But whoa, well all of that got burned off in the evidence of the natural intellectual society may not be apparent to us. Whoa. Ooh. I know what happened to the sleaze stacks. What happened to blow those slurping sleaze, eggs moving, and probably a top speed of three miles per hour or the aliens that donated genetic material to the hominy hands in order to create the society people that we are now. This explains our fascination for diamonds and goals because we've just kinda dug it up for their spaceships. Oh, Yay.

Speaker 5:          26:22          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          26:28          [inaudible] no knowing me, knowing me, nobody. Nobody. Nobody, nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody my age. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          26:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          27:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          27:21          okay.

Speaker 5:          27:27          Thank you so much guys. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          27:55          let's just take stock for a second. Robert, we did our super fast radical dyno ending. Reggie did his Reggie ending, which, which you never quite sure what he's saying. You know? Can you imagine we have scripts having magic. If I just want you over through the river

Speaker 5:          28:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          28:13          it would be outer space, man. Okay, so what's the, what's next? What's our next step? I think we're ready for the pink ending now. The pink thing, you mean like the color? Yeah, this is the one that answered, I think the most basic question you could ask in a show like this. This asks, when did endings begin? It's a serious question. That's a weird one. When did endings begin? Wouldn't there always, I mean the moment you had beginnings, wouldn't that then imply an end because the beginnings have to do something and you'd think so, but if you think hard about the origin of the universe, I would propose that when the universe began, which by some interpretation was a huge explosion of energy which then condensed and cooled into matter that that whole event came in without any notion of endings at all. Huh? When you get matter, when you get that condensation, you get a list of elements which we can now turn to in the periodic table of elements with which you I'm sure very familiar and enjoy every evening before dining or sleeping.

Speaker 3:          29:12          Keith here now puts the periodic table up on the screen. So if we look at this at this chart, let me start up in the upper left hand side of the hydrogen and we move through it, the helium and lithium and beryllium and Boron and carbon and on and on. As we move through the list, I can tell you that every one of the first 82 elements on this chart with two exceptions, which I'll mention in a minute, every one of these has a version of itself that goes on forever and ever and ever until the end of time. Every one of these you're saying is immortal. Is that what you're saying? Yes. Now here's the thing. When we get to, um, number 83 B, that's business. I would argue that this is where the universe invents in things. Really what is, what is business? It's a rock, a kind of a shiny black rock.

Speaker 3:          29:54          And you're saying this shiny black rock is, is, is where death begins. Yes. Yes. I would say that that's a fair apply. Would that be well, because all the atoms at the bottom of this chart are a little heavier than the ones on the top. Meaning they have lots and lots of of neutrons and protons here. Keith brings up an image of a business. Adam with lots of jiggling, protons and neutrons. There's so many of them. As you can see, they're having a little trouble holding their themselves together and French scientists studying this. Adam recently determined that inevitably, inevitably something will happen to this. Adam. It goes something like this.

Speaker 3:          30:30          Protons and neutrons fly off the atom and Amazingly Roberts Pew was perfectly timed in this case with Keith hitting the button to do it visually and that had never happened before. Whoa. Do that again. Okay. I don't think I can do it twice. No, you don't add sound effects. I'm to the sound effects when you do that one more time. Oh Man. Now you're bringing strike made him angry. Stop it. The point I'm trying to make Keith, is that this Adam, when it loses protons, it loses its identity. What an Adam decays this. Adam is no longer bismuth if it doesn't have the right number of programs. That's the way chemistry you were saying like as it as it sheds its protons and neutrons, it's dying. That's right. Now here's the cool thing. When we go back to the chart to number 83 every element after it po at room for raw riff, dubs, dis and rig elements, 84 to one 18 also decay. So on the periodic table you see two teams basically that once the top there, forever hours they go forever. And on the bottom you have the ones that die, right? That's correct, that's correct. But with the two exceptions I mentioned, I should say 43 and 61 that's tech medium and promethium. Nobody really likes those too.

Speaker 3:          31:58          There I find them actually unnecessary. I'll tell you what if they, if they mess up the whole logic here, let's just, let's just get rid of them. Let's to get rid of them. Get Out, get them out of here. We just spoke two holes into the table. Let me just say when we divided up like this, now you can see that bismuth is at a dividing line, maybe of the universe. Cause this is like, this is where you see, it's like the KT boundary with the dinosaurs. This is a, this is the for everything. For everything, but the cute, cool thing is business is pretty good for you. Really. People swallow a little bits of business every time they get Tommy x to do this all the time. You recognize this color, maybe screen fills the think pink. I mentioned, do you recognize the product associated with this color? You know this product. Pepto-Bismol. Yeah, but just say it, right? Say it the way it should be. Said pepto. What did I say? What? Bismol no, no. Say the only, the first syllable pepto is, are you applying that you're playing the Bismol stands for business. I don't have to imply it's true. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          32:57          I don't know Robert and I was with you right up until this point, but if I had to guess, I would say that Bismol is just the name of the dude that made pepto B j Jake f Bismol. I'm telling you that each bottle of pink liquid, there are little black rocks and that's just the truth. I don't know man. I don't know. [inaudible] relevant to me. I hear Robert Appears on the screen in chemistry goggles, you know, laboratories with eight chemistry teacher. By my time in Brooklyn and what you then see us do is we take in tablets of Pepto B. We Mush them up with a mortar and pestle. We add some water, we add some hydrochloric acid, we shake it some aluminum, and you get to see little bits of black rock precipitate out of the pepto bismal. Lots of them. I was surprised at how much black stuff is in there. And then I showed the test tube to Jack Jad. Look, you can't deny scientific fact at hiding inside every single pepto bismal tablet is pure street-level grade crystal business in the side, pepto B. You will find an element that not only cures eggs, barely and introduces death to the universe. I think it's such a great element. We should have a toast to business. Yeah, it's toast.

Speaker 5:          34:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          34:23          can we close the segment by both of us taking two big pint glasses, filling them up to the top with pepto Bismol Chunky

Speaker 5:          34:39          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          34:41          You always did it faster just by a hair. So special thanks to Gail Carnow, my chemist Sam keen who helped write this thing. Lauren swarthout who got us study, got us the lab connection and Zack Fan and who shot it, edited it and re edited it and re edited it. In typical Radiolab fashion, it's there now we will pause only to do some business.
