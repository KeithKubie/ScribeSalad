[ELECTRIC CURRENT]

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:34.840
ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome to the stage

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.670
the CEO of Google,
Sundar Pichai.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.170
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.130
SUNDAR PICHAI: Good
morning, everyone.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.780
It's great to be here.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.690
Thank you all for joining us.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.800
I suppose I should start
out with a confession.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.750
I'm actually not a
big gamer, though I

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.650
do play "FIFA '19" quite
a bit and really enjoy

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.642
how immersive it is.

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:12.860
I also play "Ashes
Cricket" quite a bit.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.620
And for those of you who are
wondering what cricket is,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.323
it's kind of like
baseball but better.

00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:21.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.480
Another little known
fact is that Google

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.590
makes arguably the most played
game on the internet today.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.070
It's the Dino Chrome
game, mostly played when

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.685
there's no internet connection.

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:35.810
I'm not going to talk to
you about the high quality

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.195
graphics and sophistication
you all are used to,

00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:41.570
but it does have
a lot of players

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.590
and I've probably logged more
hours than I care to admit.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.140
While I'm not a big gamer,
I do have the privilege

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.510
of working at a
company and leading

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.260
a company full of people who
love to solve hard computer

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.070
science problems.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.250
For many Googlers, their
journey with computers

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.520
started with games.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.280
Games have inspired many
generations of people

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.010
to pursue careers in tech.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.220
And through that process,
they build resourcefulness,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.770
creativity, and collaboration.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.550
All qualities that are key
to solving hard problems.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.610
And within Google
and Alphabet, games

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.390
play a big part in developing
our own technology.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.150
The best example I
can think of is how

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.920
we are making progress on AI.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.650
DeepMind's AlphaZero
uses self-play to learn

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.360
from scratch and master games
like chess, shogi, and go.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.340
It's an important
step towards creating

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.370
a flexible general
purpose system that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.160
can learn to solve many
foundational problems.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.640
More recently, AlphaStar
became the first AI

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.840
to defeat a top professional
player at "StarCraft II."

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.540
using a deep neural
network trained directly

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.170
from real game data.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.680
Increasingly, games are helping
AIs learn to tackle real world

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.240
challenges.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.790
Even beyond DeepMind,
another great example we have

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.460
is Waymo, where
we use simulations

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.030
in gaming-like
environments to test things

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.730
that aren't actually
possible or safe at scale

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.450
in the real world.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.959
In fact, Waymo has driven
more than five billion hours

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.630
in simulations of
edge case scenarios

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.850
that vehicles wouldn't
normally encounter.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.460
And we use it, we learn from
it, and actually improve

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.940
the systems that we'll be
deploying in the real world.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.340
Perhaps the biggest
impact of gaming

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.050
is how it pushes us to
make big leaps in computing

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.300
and networking
power, high fidelity

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.050
graphics, and the infrastructure
that supports it all.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.440
All of you are pushing computing
and technology forward,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.570
and I find that really exciting.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.670
At Google, we have
always believed

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.400
that technology should adapt
to people, not the other way

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.560
around.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.010
We have been building towards
this vision for sometime.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.920
For example, when we
launched Chrome a decade ago,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.260
we imagined, we
envisioned that it

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.010
could be a modern platform
for web applications

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.070
and bring the power of
web to everyone, including

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.560
use cases that seemed
impossible at the time,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.690
like high quality games.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.780
Finally, we are making
progress towards that goal.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.320
In fact, over the past two
years, we've been hard at hard

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.660
at work on game
streaming technology.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.570
And last fall, we launched
our first public test

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.120
with Project Stream.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.650
As some of you guessed,
a technical test

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.980
wasn't the whole
view of our ambition.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.770
It was probably the worst
kept secret in the industry.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.260
Internally, we were
actually testing our ability

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.220
to stream high fidelity graphics
over a low latency network.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.100
We learned that we
could bring a AAA game

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.900
to any device with
a Chrome browser

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.650
and an internet connection
using the best of Google

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.130
to create a powerful
game platform.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.950
And when we say
"best of Google,"

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.870
it always starts with our cloud
and networking infrastructure.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.140
Our custom server
hardware and data centers

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.130
can bring more computing power
to more people on planet Earth

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.990
than anyone else.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.770
Today, we are in 19 regions
and in over 200 countries

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.830
and territories connected
by hundreds of thousands

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.680
of miles of fiber optic cables.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.590
The best of Google, also
includes our open platforms

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.310
that allow you to reach
billions of people.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.590
With Google, your games
will be immediately

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.830
discoverable by over
2 billion people

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.580
on a Chromebook browser,
Chromebooks, Chromecast,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.140
Pixel devices.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.240
And we have plans to
support more browsers

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.900
and platforms over time.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.540
That's in addition to all the
people playing and watching

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.920
games across YouTube
and Google Play.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.780
And when we build
these ecosystems,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.690
we always take the
approach that we only

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.030
succeed when our partners do.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.150
Collectively, our partners
across web, Google Play,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.560
and YouTube have earned more
than $110 billion dollars

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.200
over the past four years
alone, and we are committed

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.910
to this approach here as well.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.730
So now we have focused
on our next big effort,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.210
which is to build a game
platform for everyone.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.010
And when we say "for
everyone, we really mean it.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.530
It's one of our most
cherished values as a company.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.180
Be it Android, or
Chrome, or AI, we

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.640
are dead serious about
making technology

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.170
accessible for everyone.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.900
But if you think
about games, there

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.920
are a lot of barriers for
users to play high end games.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.180
Beautiful graphics really
need high end consoles or PCs.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.220
And games don't
have instant access.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.130
Think about the
way the web works.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.970
You can easily share a link,
and it works seamlessly.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.490
We want games to
feel that way too,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.020
instantly enjoyable with
access for everyone.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.480
I think we can change the
game by bringing together

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.840
the power and creativity
of the entire community--

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.820
people who love to play games,
people who love to watch games,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.840
and people who love
to build games.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.850
That means all of you.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.690
We are really excited
to work with you.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.540
We want to build a
platform, and We.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.340
Want you to show
us what's possible.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.670
And together, I think we
can create a new games

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.970
experience powered by best of
Google and built for everyone.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.925
Let's take a look.

00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:34.110
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.490
- From the beginning
of time, games

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:42.635
have brought us together,
players and spectators

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:47.580
by the handful, the
hundreds, and the thousands.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.190
We built stadiums,
places to gather around

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.698
every kind of spectacle.

00:08:55.698 --> 00:09:03.970
Glory, tragedy, pageantry,
community, rivalry, and wonder,

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.570
until every city,
town, and village

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.330
had a place where
anyone could play.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.430
Thousands of years in,
our games have changed,

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.030
but our need to come
together remains.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.488
This new era of gaming
needs a new place to gather.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:33.270
One place, where anything
you dream can be built,

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.340
playgrounds for
every imagination,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.030
one place where you and everyone
you know and everyone they know

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.360
will all play together.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.610
- Let's go, let's go, let's go

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.930
- Let's go, squad!

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:46.900
- Let's go!

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.870
- Yes, get him!

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.810
Boom!

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.235
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.330
- One place that
never stops evolving,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.970
where everyone will play.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.380
- Where did he come from?

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.341
- And watch.

00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:04.110
- Yes, high five.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.628
- Bam.

00:10:04.628 --> 00:10:05.170
- And create.

00:10:07.795 --> 00:10:08.737
- Winner.

00:10:08.737 --> 00:10:09.679
- Woo!

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:11.250
- Nice!

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.461
From any screen at anytime.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.290
One place for all
the ways we play.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.290
This is Stadia.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.290
Gather round.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.290

[APPLAUSE]

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.560
SUNDAR PICHAI:
Welcome to Stadia.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.990
We are so excited by this.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.230
To do this well, it's important
that we have the right people

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.010
working on this, experts with
deep history and heritage

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.320
in games.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.450
That starts with Phil Harrison,
who joined us about a year ago.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.590
He's a great leader
and a great gamer.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.750
Definitely someone who
knows the difference

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.850
between RPGs and NPCs.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.940
I'm going to pass the mic
over to Phil to show you

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.840
what we have built.
Take it away, Phil.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.921
PHIL HARRISON:
Thank you, Sundar.

00:11:09.921 --> 00:11:10.921
SUNDAR PICHAI: Hi, Phil.

00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:18.190
PHIL HARRISON:
Thank you, Sundar.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.330
It's such a pleasure
to be here today.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.290
And thank you for joining
us at GDC, as we finally

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.890
get to share Google's vision
for the future of games,

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.050
where the worlds of
watching and playing games

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.410
converge into a new
generation game platform

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.500
purpose-built for the
21st century, powered

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.680
by the best of Google.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.020
Our vision for
Stadia is simple--

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.990
one place for all
the ways we play.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.470
It's focused on gamers,
inspired by developers,

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.120
and amplified by
YouTube creators.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.930
Today, our industry captivates
over 2 billion players

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.100
from all around the world.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.100
At the center of that
community, its beating heart,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.070
are the game
developers, the people

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.070
in this room that create
the most incredible game

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.030
experiences that delight
players with engrossing stories,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.350
characters, and worlds through a
dazzling display of technology,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.260
artistry, and magic.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.600
Games are now the
single biggest form

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.400
of entertainment
on the planet, one

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.300
that connects a vast community
across geographies, cultures,

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.860
and language.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.600
And within that
passionate community,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.360
there is a universe of people
who love playing games,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.970
and there's a universe of
people who love watching games.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.910
Hundreds of millions of
people watch gaming content

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.580
every single day on YouTube.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.810
But those two worlds are mostly
disconnected, fragmented,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.630
and often independent
of each other.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.870
Our vision is to bring those
worlds closer together,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.320
to connect game developers with
players and YouTube creators

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.710
in a way that only
Google can, creating

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.160
a richer and more vibrant
gaming community for everyone

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.050
to enjoy.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.120
Through the power
of our data centers,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.090
the extraordinary reach
and community of YouTube,

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.700
and our investments in the
fundamental technologies

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.460
that are the foundations
of the open internet,

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.710
we offer a truly
unique opportunity

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.140
to combine these worlds.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.180
We will be handing that
extraordinary power of the data

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.000
center over to you,
the game developers,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.590
where playgrounds for every
imagination can be created.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.130
Our first public test of this
came in October of last year

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.010
with Project Stream, where
we streamed a AAA HD game

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.900
at up to 1080p and 60 frames
per second over the internet

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.930
from Google data centers
to a Chrome browser.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.480
We were humbled by the
overwhelmingly positive

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.760
response from players
who were able to join us

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.290
on Project Stream.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.880
A huge thank you
to those of you who

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.900
participated in Project Stream
and for your vital feedback.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.870
And also to the amazing
people at Ubisoft

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.210
for trusting us with
the latest incarnation

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.950
of their incredible game
franchise, "Assassin's Creed."

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.980
Ubisoft has always been at
the forefront of advancements

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.980
in the games industry, and they
have an incredible track record

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.880
of success and creativity.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.710
And joining us here
in the audience today,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.250
I'm delighted to welcome the CEO
and co-founder of Ubisoft, Yves

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.790
Guilllemot.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.194
Thank you, Yves.

00:14:18.194 --> 00:14:20.679
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.590
I'd like to thank
Yves and his team

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.000
for partnering with us,
and to producer Marc-Alexis

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.680
Cote and the entire
Ubisoft Quebec studio

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.220
for their masterpiece creation,
"Assassin's Creed Odyssey."

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.800
Thank you for bringing
your game to our platform,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.930
and congratulations for
being the first game

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.870
played by the public on Stadia.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.360
As many of you experienced with
"Assassin's Creed Odyssey,"

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.450
we now have the ability to take
a sophisticated, graphically

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.960
intense AAA game and stream
it to a Chrome browser running

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.200
on a simple laptop without
any sacrifice to the quality

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.330
or vision of the game developer.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.490
As successful as
Project Stream was,

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.120
our ambition is of course
far beyond a single game.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.040
As we developed our strategy
for this new platform,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.590
we asked developers
how we can help

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.160
solve some of the most
critical challenges you face.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.790
There were three very clear
themes that resonated.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.790
You told us you wanted to
unleash your creativity

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.630
without limits, get to
the widest possible scale,

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.170
and make it easier for people
to connect with your games.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.260
We used these three themes
to anchor our vision

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.420
and build our
platform architecture,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.730
and began to share it with
the leading publishers

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.140
and developers in the world.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.050
Now, let me show you how we have
brought this vision to life.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.510
Imagine you are watching
games on YouTube,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.480
and you discover the latest
"Assassin's Creed Odyssey"

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.560
trailer on Ubisoft's
official channel on YouTube.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.440
You will notice the
"Play Now" button.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.150
By simply clicking
on that button,

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.460
the player is brought
directly into the game

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:04.350
in a browser in as quick as
five seconds with no download.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.815
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:17.200
With no download, no patch,
no update, and no install.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.950
Stadia offers instant
access to play.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.630
Our platform vision
for Stadia is

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.870
to reduce the friction between
getting excited about a game

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.280
and playing a game.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.130
On Stadia, you just need
to click on a YouTube video

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.670
or link, and you can be
playing your game instantly.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.450
Compare that to today, where
gamers are all too familiar

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.440
with things like this.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:46.000
With Stadia, this waiting game
will be a thing of the past.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.180
The power of instant
access is magical

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.350
and has already transformed
the music and movie industries.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.090
And with Stadia, it is now
available at the highest

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.170
level of gaming.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.840
But wouldn't it be
even more magical

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.260
if that same game and that
same instant experience

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.520
could be available across
any screen type in your life?

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.869
A key benefit of our platform
is that a single creative vision

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.500
and a single codebase can
now be enjoyed instantly

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.579
across any screen.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.310
At launch, we'll support
being able to play games

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:24.510
across desktops, laptops,
TV, tablets, and phones.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.530
This new generation of
gaming is not a box.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.020
With Stadia, the data
center is your platform.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.890
There is no console that limits
the developer's creative ideas,

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.820
and no console that limits
where gamers can play.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.320
And we're about to
show this to you now.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.333
This is not a concept.

00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:42.000
It's not a test.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.162
This is real.

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.120
I'd like to bring my
friend Khaled to the stage

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.799
to show you this working.

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:50.264
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.950
So imagine you've
just discovered

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.390
that game for the first time.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.350
You're running it on
the Chrome browser.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.240
And here it is on a Pixelbook
running the Chrome OS.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.090
There is basically no hardware
acceleration on that laptop

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.970
whatsoever, and the
game is running directly

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.560
from our data center.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.370
It's then easy and instantaneous
to move that same game

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.310
experience from exactly
that moment onto the phone

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.421
here on a pixel 3 XL.

00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:22.726
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.260
Once again, no loss
in quality, and we

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.390
can go straight
onto the desktop PC.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.960
We actually went to buy the
least powerful PC we could find

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.850
here, and we could enjoy the
same vision that the developer

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:42.380
had, the same high quality 1080p
stream at 60 frames per second,

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.320
and the full game vision
regardless of the hardware

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.652
that you're using.

00:18:46.652 --> 00:18:48.110
And then it's, once
again, seamless

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:53.570
to go from running on our
PC to running on a tablet.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.500
In this case, once again,
running the Chrome OS

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.125
on a Pixel Slate.

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:02.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.080
And then finally, we then
move seamlessly to the TV.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.660
And so this TV is accessed using
this, which is a Chromecast

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.390
Ultra HDMI streamer.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:25.630
There is no console required
to reach this experience.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.620
Thanks, Khaled.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.988
Great presentation.

00:19:35.988 --> 00:19:38.418
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.160
Welcoming any and all players
is fundamental to Stadia,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.170
where you can try
with your friends

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.970
on devices you already own.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.910
And as such, we're
also enabling players

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.850
to use your existing
USB controller or mouse

00:19:55.850 --> 00:20:00.680
and keyboard when playing
Stadia on a laptop or PC.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.610
By eliminating that friction,
that barrier to entry,

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.170
we will make it simple
and easy for players

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.960
who want to try Stadia
for the first time.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.410
But of course, we will
have our own controller

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.590
that is being uniquely designed
to enhance the experience

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.570
for the Stadia player.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.310
I'd like to introduce
you to the newest

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:24.443
member of the Google hardware
family, the Stadia controller.

00:20:24.443 --> 00:20:26.848
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.440
This is your gateway
to the best of Stadia.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.220
It enables you to access
the full Stadia experience.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.830
And there are many advantages
to the Stadia controller.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:46.330
And the first is that it will
connect through Wi-Fi directly

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.450
to the game that is running
in the Google data center.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.720
The Stadia controller identifies
which screen or device

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.870
you want to play on and links it
with your game session running

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.940
in the cloud,
ensuring the highest

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.270
possible performance and the
best experience for players.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.920
In addition to the
standard functions

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.470
you'd expect to see on a
modern game controller,

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.330
the Stadia controller
features two

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.730
very important new buttons--

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.180
the Capture button is for
sharing and saving your game

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.030
experience back out to YouTube.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.220
The gamer can choose to
share their experiences,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.110
starting with the
click on this button,

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.140
to themselves, to their
friends, or to the world.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.140
They are in control.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.800
And the second one is the
Google Assistant button.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.920
Pressing this button allows
players to immediately access

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.930
the controller's
built-in microphone

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.730
so they can get help
from the Assistant

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:42.560
for special in-game features
integrated by developers.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.960
Our goal with Stadia is
to help fuel developer

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.760
creativity at every level.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.030
And next, we'll take a look
at the incredible computing

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.430
power we have
custom-built into our data

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.923
centers that will further
accelerate innovation.

00:21:55.923 --> 00:21:57.840
I'd like to introduce
my friend and colleague,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.780
the head of engineering
for Stadia, Majd Bakar.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.725
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:02.725 --> 00:22:04.100
MAJD BAKAR: Thanks
so much, Phil.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.320
Let's look at the
real-time computing power

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.450
we have put into our
data centers that

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.890
will change how we view
what a game platform can be.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.840
In order to deliver an amazing
experience for your games,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.460
we needed to bring powerful
computing closer to users.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.320
We've built Stadia's
architecture

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.250
on top of the Google data center
network, the same network that

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.840
has been delivering
search results

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.120
to your fingertips
in milliseconds

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.740
for more than 20 years.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.800
The network consists of
fiber optic links and subsea

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.740
cables between hundreds
of points of presence

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.760
and more than 7,500 edge node
locations around the globe,

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.290
all connected with
our network backbone.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.270
Stadia is built on
an infrastructure

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.020
that no one else has.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.600
More edge nodes means
the compute resources

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.650
are closer to players, which
results in better performance.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.830
We took that proven
model and infused it

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.490
with custom design purpose
built gaming hardware

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.390
creating the most powerful
and connected gaming platform.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.460
Each of Stadia's data
centers is composed

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.610
of interconnected racks
that deliver the high power

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.700
graphics, memory, and
storage needed to run

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.340
the most demanding games.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.570
Only with Google can you apply
the power and flexibility

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.260
of data centers to
game development.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.030
This architecture
is the foundation

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.467
for this new
generation of gaming.

00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:41.300
We've been testing this
technology privately

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.590
within Google for years.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.490
For our initial public test
with Project Stream in 2018,

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.550
we delivered up to 1080p
60 frames per second

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.070
with stereo audio.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.860
When Stadia launches, we will
have increased performance

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.960
significantly to
support resolutions up

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.462
to 4k at 60 frames per second.

00:24:00.462 --> 00:24:02.822
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.480
With HDR and surround sound.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.010
And in the future, we'll
be able to stream games

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.920
in up to 8k resolution.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.950
We know there are not
that many homes or TV is

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.890
in the world that have
8k today, but we also

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.880
know the widespread adoption
of 8k is inevitable.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.880
We have built our
platform to scale up

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.860
with the highest
performing networks

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.920
to deliver the visual quality
demanded by future generations

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.130
of gamers and game developers.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.280
What's even more exciting
is that, in addition to

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.140
the stream you get
as a player, there

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.310
is a second simultaneous stream
at 4K 60 frames per second

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.470
that you can choose
to share directly

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.140
to YouTube from the
Stadia data center,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.710
meaning your gaming memories
will be saved at the highest

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.740
possible quality.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.020
Stadia is not constrained
by the limitation

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.490
of traditional console systems.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.420
Instead, we have built a truly
flexible, scalable, and modern

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.748
platform that allows us to push
performance beyond what was

00:25:09.748 --> 00:25:11.040
previously considered possible.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.840
This architecture gives us
even more flexibility to scale.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.540
And thanks to fast transfer
speeds between the Stadia

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.940
instances in our data
center, our platform

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.150
can connect instances
together to dynamically expand

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:32.120
the capabilities along with
the need of your games.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.610
As a developer, you're
used to being forced

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.560
to tone down your
creative ambitions that

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.630
are limited by the hardware,
but our vision with Stadia

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.650
is that the processing resources
available will scale up

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.700
to match your imagination.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:53.190
In this new generation, the
data center is your platform.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.780
We've partnered with our friends
at AMD to build a custom GPU.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.680
I'd like to personally thank Dr.
Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.370
who is here with us today.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.000
Lisa and her team
helped us design a chip

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.330
to bring you more than 10
teraflops of power, which we've

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.940
coupled with a custom CPU
to make up a single Stadia

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.440
instance.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.340
And here's how the
graphical power of Stadia

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.640
compares to the top two
consoles in the market.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.390
You can see--

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:27.430
Thank you.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:38.640
You can see that a single Stadia
instance is a big step forward.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.210
10.7 teraflops is more
powerful than the top two

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.037
consoles of the previous
generation combined.

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:48.382
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.210
Stadia will be using
the Linux operating

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.980
system and the open
graphics API Vulkan.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.520
And when it comes
to game engines,

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.190
we are excited to announce
that we have partnered

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:06.700
with Unreal, who will be fully
supporting the Stadia platform.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.720
We are also
partnering with Unity

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.840
to bring full support for the
two most popular and familiar

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.550
game engines to our
development community.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.470
And we're empowering
developers was

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.870
an amazing array of
familiar middleware

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.880
that you already use
to power your game

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:27.380
development, including the most
popular physics engine, Havok.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.560
And here's a list
of our partners now.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.900
And of course, this list will
continue to grow over time.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.270
With this suite of
tools, game development

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.150
can evolve as quickly inspires
the imagination of content

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.450
creators.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.030
To achieve that, we're
providing multiple ways

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.250
to make games for Stadia.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:53.330
You can develop on our cloud,
your cloud, and at your desk.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.540
Our goal is to make Stadia
the most flexible development

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.450
environment ever put together.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.810
And that power is, of course,
used to create the best

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.460
content.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.020
Our first guest
is from a company

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.690
known for creating the most
sophisticated and impressive

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.330
gaming experiences
in the industry, that

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.380
always demand the most of
every system they run on.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.710
We had the chance to give our
friends at id early access

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.930
to our tools and technology.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.960
It's my absolute pleasure to
welcome to the stage executive

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.719
producer from id,
Marty Stratton.

00:28:27.719 --> 00:28:30.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:34.481 --> 00:28:36.480
MARTY STRATTON: Hi, everyone.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.470
Thanks so much for having
us here, Phil and Majd.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.990
I'm honored to be
part of a team at id

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:45.410
that has spent more than
25 years on the bleeding

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.310
edge of technical innovation.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.480
When we first met with Google
about game streaming, frankly,

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.940
we were skeptical,
about how it would work,

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.880
and in particular how it could
work with a game like "Doom."

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.900
However, we recognized not
just your ability and resources

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.710
to make game streaming a
reality, but more importantly,

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.800
the passion to support
a game as fast,

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.060
fluid, and
uncompromising as "Doom."

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.980
After all, if you're going
to prove to the world

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.640
that you can stream
games from the cloud,

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.528
what better proof than "Doom"?

00:29:22.528 --> 00:29:24.320
And if you're going to
prove to a developer

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.890
that you're serious about
building a robust platform,

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.550
what better team than id,
where we push every platform

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.520
to its limit.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:38.490
In fact, back in 2016,
"Doom" was the first AAA game

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.550
released on Vulkan.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:45.120
And because Stadia is built
on that same Vulkan API,

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.340
it didn't take us
more than a few weeks

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.610
to get our upcoming sequel,
"Doom Eternal," looking

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.790
and playing great on Stadia

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.340
Built on the fun
and sense of power

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.710
players expect from the
series, "Doom Eternal"

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:03.180
is a pure and unfiltered
action FPS experience.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.200
You play as an unstoppable hero
sent to destroy Hell's fiercest

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.810
demons across an
expanding universe

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.520
of unbelievable locations.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.400
We couldn't be
happier to be bringing

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.070
"Doom Eternal" to
Stadia, and are

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.640
thrilled to announce that the
game will be capable of running

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.570
a true 4K resolution
with HDR color

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.366
at an unrelenting 60
frames per second.

00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:30.756
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:35.623 --> 00:30:38.040
We actually can't wait to show
you more of "Doom Eternal,"

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.000
very soon, in fact.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.900
We have the full game
running on Stadia,

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.920
live from Google data centers,
and you can see it today

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.465
at our developer session.

00:30:48.465 --> 00:30:51.390
It starts at 12:30
over in West Hall.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.360
You won't want to miss it.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.080
Thank you to Google
and Stadia team

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.330
for giving us this
opportunity to share

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.130
a bit about "Doom Eternal."

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.736
Thanks so much.

00:31:01.736 --> 00:31:04.176
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:08.258 --> 00:31:09.800
PHIL HARRISON: Thanks
so much, Marty.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.620
It's a privilege to work with
id and your incredible engineers

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.150
and creators.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:16.310
For anyone who
knows the franchise,

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.340
you know Doom Eternal will
look and play amazingly well

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.080
on our platform.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.730
It was important
for us to partner

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.590
with a developer
like id, so that we

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.970
could prove, not
just to ourselves,

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.720
but to the entire industry
that our platform is

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.650
capable of supporting the
most demanding titles.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:38.390
And Doom will be running
on a single Stadia GPU.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.290
The fundamental benefit of our
cloud native infrastructure

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.940
is that developers
will be able to take

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.230
advantage of hardware and power
in ways never before possible.

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.790
And that includes
taking advantage

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.480
of the power of
multiple GPUs at once.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.020
We've asked our friends at UL
Benchmarks, makers of 3DMark,

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.210
to put Stadia to the test.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.580
In this video, you can
see some comparison points

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.520
showing the difference between
our single GPU and multiple

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.690
GPUs.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.520
What you see here on
the left of the line

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.795
is running on a single
10.7 teraflop GPU.

00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:12.170
And on the right
of the line, you

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:16.610
can see the same content running
on Stadia using multiple GPUs.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.540
In this demo, we're highlighting
real time fluid defamation.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.150
Accurate water simulation
is one of the most compute

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.350
intensive effects for games.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:28.950
And it's a powerful example
of what Stadia is capable of,

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.610
and I'm so excited to see
where game developers go

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.460
with this kind of performance.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.320
When we designed
Stadia, our goal

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.450
was to solve many
of the pain points

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.780
that we've heard about from
developers, particularly

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.090
those related to multiplayer.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.940
In traditional platforms,
the client and server

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.670
are connected by the
unpredictable internet.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.770
And therefore, the
multiplayer experience

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.400
is limited by the client with
the slowest or poorest quality

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.770
connection.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.330
But with Stadia, that
game client and server

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.240
both remain on Google's
networking backbone,

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.440
resulting in predictable low
latency, reliable connectivity,

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.630
and data security,
since no traffic gets

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.820
exposed to the public internet.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.310
Developers who use Google's
data centers can create

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:16.100
a predictable multiplayer
experience that scales

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.860
to an order of magnitude
greater than anything

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.020
enjoyed by gamers today.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.910
What that means is
a synchronized state

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:26.210
across a very high volume of
players, where innovations

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.690
like distributed physics can
be built into your games, where

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:33.980
battle royale games could go
from hundreds of players today

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.160
to thousands of
players tomorrow.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.380
And yes, no cheating
and no hacking.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.210
Google has always
believed that the world

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.910
is a better place when
we are able to connect

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.410
without barriers.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.960
And as a new generation
game platform,

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:56.038
Stadia will of course embrace
full cross-platform play.

00:33:56.038 --> 00:33:58.458
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.740
Developers will have
the ability to enable

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.570
cross-platform multiplayer
for all players

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:12.030
and even bring games saves and
progression across as well.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:14.909
I'd now like to introduce a
member of Stadia's R&amp;D team

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:17.460
who are pushing the envelope,
bringing the best of Google

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.900
to game developers.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.120
Please welcome to the
stage our lead designer

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.311
for research and development
at Stadia, Erin Hoffman-John.

00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:27.696
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.190
ERIN HOFFMAN-JOHN:
Thank you, Phil.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:37.219
One of our team's favorite
comments about Project Stream

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:40.130
was a tweet that describes
Stadia's technology

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.239
as the work of wizards.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.800
And we are incredibly fortunate
to work with wizards every day,

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.560
bending their
magic toward games.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.080
I'd like to take you through a
few technologies and features

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.622
that we've been working on that
are going to enhance the game

00:34:53.622 --> 00:34:57.210
development process for
developers big and small.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.040
The first one is
focused on multiplayer.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.760
Stadia not only provides
high-performing multiplayer

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.830
experiences from
player to player,

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.130
but also allows developers to
create new, gorgeous gaming

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.600
environments.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.040
Our friends at
Tangent Games have

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.230
been working with us on a
technical proof of concept

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.060
that you can see here behind me.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.340
They spent a few
short weeks creating

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.970
this beautiful multiplayer world
with a persistent massively

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.540
destructible environment.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.440
It is a raw demonstration
of scale and power

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.750
using the best of
Stadia technology, where

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.600
every piece of the environment
in this multiplayer world

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.940
is destructible using real
time, rigid body physics.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.920
Using Google's unique
infrastructure,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.690
developers can
create games built

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.510
to house hundreds of
players with low latency

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.553
and perfect synchronization.

00:35:44.553 --> 00:35:46.470
This demo will be available
on the show floor,

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.545
if you want to check
it out this week.

00:35:49.545 --> 00:35:50.920
As we were building
the platform,

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.180
we collaborated with
individual developers,

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.080
but we also thought about
trends in game development.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.720
When we thought about our most
treasured gaming memories,

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.190
something kept coming back,
something that we'd lost.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.260
When modern games start
to push the boundaries

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.990
of current hardware,
rendering two or more scenes

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.120
simultaneously becomes
too resource intensive.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.800
And so split screen couch co-op
has been fading from gaming.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.170
But when all of your
clients are in the cloud,

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.190
couch multiplayer has new
life again through Stadia,

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.140
in what we're calling
Stream Connect.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.150
In the past, the
resources required

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.000
to execute split screen co-op
have required developers

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.850
to sacrifice more of
their creative goals.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.320
With Stream Connect,
we're making

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.690
it possible to realize
split-screen multiplayer

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.515
without any performance penalty.

00:36:36.515 --> 00:36:38.640
Behind me, you'll see a
technology proof of concept

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.160
that we built at Google.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.510
It's called the Night
Forest, a co-op demo

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.820
with asymmetric player roles.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.520
Here we have two players,
one hunter on the ground

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.740
and a supporting
aerial player, set up

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.170
in a standard split-screen view.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:56.060
Each of these screens is powered
by a separate Stadia instance.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.810
But what would happen
to squad-based games

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.310
if developers
could allow players

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.160
to call up the views of
their teammates on demand,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.280
or utilize any polygonal
surface as a receiver

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.830
for another player's
video stream?

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.320
Stream Connect makes this
possible with extremely little

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.180
effort on the part
of the developer,

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.120
bringing dynamic squad-based
gaming into easy reach,

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.920
even for very small teams.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.420
We've shown you three views,
but we can keep going.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.420
We can keep adding streams
and shape how they're

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.010
shown to the player,
giving a designer not one,

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.690
but many cameras into a scene.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.880
Now imagine if you
could go beyond seeing

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.470
into players' worlds.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.682
What if you could
interact with them?

00:37:33.682 --> 00:37:35.140
Here we have our
streams configured

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.300
into a command center,
where a fourth player

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.030
can coordinate the movements
of our drone, scientist,

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.792
and hunter characters.

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.750
Now that coordinator is
reaching into the world

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.460
and placing a beacon
to call attention

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:49.910
to a particular location, seen
instantly by the other players.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:51.800
Stream connect is
just one of the ways

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.480
Google is working to
support developers

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.480
in creating more immersive
and creative experiences,

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.210
whether bringing back
effortless couch-based co-op

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:03.240
or inventing entirely
new multiplayer games.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.760
Our next technology demo focuses
on the power of the Google

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.888
cloud and machine
learning, and how

00:38:07.888 --> 00:38:09.930
they can have an impact
on accelerating developer

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.820
creativity.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.160
Every developer feels the
burn in pre-production

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.245
to get to a game's magic sooner.

00:38:16.245 --> 00:38:18.120
We think Google's machine
learning technology

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.150
might have some answers.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.160
Here to talk about it
is a developer known

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.160
for creating some amazing,
stylish, and celebrated

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.580
independent games, including
"Deadlight," "Rime,"

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.530
and "The Invisible Hours."

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:34.961
Please welcome chairwoman of
Tequila Works, Luz Sancho.

00:38:34.961 --> 00:38:37.396
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.800
LUZ SANCHO: Thank you, Erin.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.080
I am very excited to be here
for the unveiling of the Stadia

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.340
platform.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.230
There are so many
different benefits

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.480
that the Stadia delivers to
all developers, big and small,

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.400
and particularly for
a studio like ours.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.595
At Tequila Works, we are
very proud of the artist

00:39:00.595 --> 00:39:02.170
styles of our games.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:06.220
It's something we spend
a lot of time perfecting.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.900
Our development cycles
typically last 24 months.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.700
And as you can imagine,
a large part of that time

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:17.500
is dedicated to defining the
artist style of the game.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.270
We are particularly
proud of "Rime."

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:24.430
It's visual identity
created a lasting impression

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.110
with our players.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.850
But it took us a long time
to get to that final style.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.140
That's why we were so excited
to hear from Google about one

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.690
of the tools they
are making available,

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.640
an amazing tool that will
dramatically influence and ease

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.530
this process.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.320
With Style Transfer
ML, Google is

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:52.525
applying the science of machine
learning to art visualization.

00:39:52.525 --> 00:39:53.900
ERIN HOFFMAN-JOHN:
Style Transfer

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.580
is a machine learning
technology that

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.400
runs on the video frame
created by the game.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.760
All of this happens in real
time on a Stadia instance.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.550
We built this demo to
show you what it can do.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.100
We start with a gray box world
and take any image we want,

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.920
in this case, Kandinsky's
"Yellow, Red, Blue,"

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.540
and the model does the rest.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.180
Throw it "Starry Night,"
and you have another style.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.290
Give it scratch art,
and you get this.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.180
We're doing our part
to empower the artist

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.710
inside of every developer.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.140
The R&amp;D team iterated through
hundreds of art styles,

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.788
testing this technology.

00:40:27.788 --> 00:40:29.830
And one of our favorites
came from an old friend.

00:40:33.232 --> 00:40:35.662
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.720
What excites us and some of
our partners so far is how many

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.360
playable art styles we can
create just by feeding it

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.950
more and more images.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.025
It inspires and
empowers our artists

00:40:50.025 --> 00:40:51.400
to get the visions
in their heads

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.290
into interactive environments
in a whole new way.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.660
And this is just the beginning.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.060
LUZ SANCHO: We are using Style
Transfer ML in our studio

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.700
today, and we are blown
away by the impact it's

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.190
having on our latest creations.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.090
You will see it.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:11.180
This could really
change everything.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.170
Thank you so much.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.977
Thank you.

00:41:12.977 --> 00:41:15.362
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.380
ERIN HOFFMAN-JOHN:
Thank you, Luz.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.410
What Style Transfer,
our goal is to help

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.110
developers find the magic
of their games quicker.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.660
You can check out Style Transfer
during the show this week.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.430
We can't wait to
hear your feedback.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.700
Creators inspire us to bring
the best of Google to games,

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:38.340
and creators are at
the heart of Stadia.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.100
It isn't just what they create,
but how those moments are

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.460
experienced by players, moments
that resonate for generations

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.270
to come.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.360
The last feature we
want to introduce today

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.540
is another special experience
made possible by the cloud.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.070
It's called State Share.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:58.100
And here to talk about it from
Q Games is Dillon Cuthbert.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:03.836 --> 00:42:05.530
DYLAN CUTHBERT: Hey, everyone.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.310
It's great to be here
with all of you today.

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:11.880
As a veteran game developer,
I love how creators on YouTube

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.218
have brought our games to life.

00:42:14.218 --> 00:42:16.260
But I've always wished
those experiences could be

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.918
more social and even more fun.

00:42:18.918 --> 00:42:20.460
I'm extremely excited
about what I've

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.940
learned from Google about
bringing new ways to share

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.560
a game's replayable moments.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.860
With a new technology
called State Share,

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.400
developers can let a
player instantly share

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.810
a playable moment from a game.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.670
This could include the world
state, the player's position,

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.850
items they're carrying, anything
the developer wants to pack

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:45.040
into a shareable moment.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.660
The game state can be encoded
into a link that tells Stadia

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.470
where to pick up the game.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.080
This could be sent
to one player,

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.580
or it could be
shared with thousands

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.020
at the same time on YouTube,
through email, apps, messaging,

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.240
or wherever links can go.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.460
To me, this totally
changes how I

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.310
think about the
experiences for players.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.250
I can create
moments specifically

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.590
for this kind of
sharing, challenges

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.450
to beat my incredible
speed runs,

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:17.240
or chances for other
players to also experience

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.600
those same tough boss battles.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.150
I can build as many
sharable moments as I want,

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.330
and let the internet turn my
whole game into an infinitely

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.890
replaceable treasure hunt.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.940
I was so intrigued with the
possibilities of State Share

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.630
that I designed a brand
new game around it,

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.380
and it's the biggest
title ever for Q Games.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.532
Right now, it's
still under WRAPS

00:43:40.532 --> 00:43:42.490
but I can't wait to reveal
more about this game

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.140
later this year.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.275
Thank you very much.

00:43:45.275 --> 00:43:46.700
Thank you very much.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.075
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:53.860
ERIN HOFFMAN-JOHN:
Thanks, Dylan.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.990
State Share is one
more way that Stadia

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:59.530
is working to empower developers
with entirely new tools that

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:03.100
embrace a player's desire to
discover, share, and build

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.120
a community.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.580
We're extremely excited by
the reception it's gotten

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.078
from our early partners so far.

00:44:09.078 --> 00:44:11.370
And with that, I'd like to
introduce the head of gaming

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:12.960
at YouTube to tell
you what Stadia

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.760
means for content creators.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.792
Please welcome Ryan Wyatt.

00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:19.122
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.540
RYAN WYATT: Thanks, Erin.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.840
I'm very excited to be here
at the unveiling of Stadia.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.750
As you've heard, Stadia is about
delivering the best developer

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.835
experience so that the
best games can be made.

00:44:32.835 --> 00:44:34.460
But we're also
committed to making sure

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.500
we have the best
creator experience,

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.040
so that the entire community
gets stronger together.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.920
YouTube is where people
come to watch gaming.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.470
More than 200
million gamers come

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:48.110
to YouTube every
single day to engage

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.830
with their favorite
games and creators.

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:53.260
And they come because of the
community of gaming creators

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.385
and viewers who have turned
YouTube into the gaming

00:44:55.385 --> 00:44:57.508
platform that it is today.

00:44:57.508 --> 00:44:59.300
We're always looking
for ways to strengthen

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.490
the connection between
creators and viewers,

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.400
and Stadia is designed to
bring them together like never

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.133
before.

00:45:06.133 --> 00:45:08.050
Gaming has always been
the backbone of YouTube

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:11.300
since the platform first
was founded in 2005.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.990
And one thing YouTube
gaming creators want

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.240
is to engage with their fans.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.780
That will always be the most
important thing to them.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.230
That's why over 50 billion
hours of gaming content

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:26.050
was watched on YouTube
last year alone.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.620
And to just give you an idea of
how much 50 billion hours is,

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:34.650
you could walk to Pluto and
back more than a dozen times.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.660
Stadia's focused on empowering
both creators and viewers

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.350
to achieve new heights by
breaking barriers of content

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:44.310
capture and creating unique
ways to engage with and grow

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.860
a creator's audience.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.660
Established creators will have
new ways to engage and monetize

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.570
on YouTube with Stadia features.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.310
And with aspiring
creators, we're

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.370
going to break down the barrier
of entry in capturing content

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.760
by giving you the
ability to highlight,

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.622
live stream, and capture
directly from Stadia.

00:46:02.622 --> 00:46:04.580
We've already seen the
idea of any YouTube link

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.380
being a direct access
point into the game,

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.210
and that is a huge
opportunity for

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.640
both big and small creators.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.190
We're empowering creators
to forge deeper connections

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:14.412
with their audience.

00:46:14.412 --> 00:46:16.370
And one of those ways
will be to make it easier

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.680
to actually game with them.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.180
Often when you're
watching a stream,

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.638
you find yourself
wishing you could

00:46:21.638 --> 00:46:24.620
be in there, playing alongside
with your favorite creators.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.120
On traditional
platforms, you'd have

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.400
to fire up your
console or your PC,

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.540
and just hope that you
get matched up with them.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:34.310
However, with Stadia and a
new feature called Crowd Play,

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.710
you'll be able to simply click
a button, displayed right

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:39.290
in the stream, and jump in
and play with YouTube creators

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.320
that you're watching.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.930
Take a look at the
video behind me.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.110
It's a live stream of NBA 2K.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.960
The person watching can
simply click the link

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.875
and be placed into the
lobby for the next game.

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.250
If you think about
it, Crowd Play

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:55.820
can act like an all-new
lobby system for games.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.040
And with Stadia, YouTube
becomes the ultimate discovery

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.015
and engagement tool for content.

00:47:01.015 --> 00:47:03.390
And of course, YouTube creators
will have full management

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.000
capabilities over this feature.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.160
To all of the game
developers, publishers,

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.562
and the millions of YouTube
content creators out there,

00:47:10.562 --> 00:47:12.270
soon we'll have more
information to share

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.985
on these engagement
tools and how

00:47:13.985 --> 00:47:16.110
we'll be working with you
to connect with and build

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:17.640
your communities.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.490
I'd now like to introduce a
friend of mine to the stage.

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.040
He has over 11 million
subscribers on his channel

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.960
the Game Theorist,
and he and his wife

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.090
Stephanie have often been
advocates for the creator

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:27.900
community.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.940
So we were delighted to
talk to him about Stadia

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.160
and what it means
for Creators please

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.080
welcome to the stage
my friend, MatPat.

00:47:42.635 --> 00:47:43.510
MATPAT: Thanks, Ryan.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:46.420
It's an incredible
honor to be here today.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.980
Now, for us creators, our
audience is our lifeblood.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.750
Whether we're breaking
down the real life

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.060
science of the fictional
world of Fallout,

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.250
or diving into the
theories behind Bendy

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.580
and the Ink Machine, or
simply streaming gameplay

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.630
on our live stream
channel, GT Live,

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.480
we're always
looking for new ways

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.400
to connect and engage
with our audience.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.880
Which is why when I first
met with the Stadia team,

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.940
I was floored by the impact
that it can have for not just

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.120
gamers but also creators.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.630
Stadia not only empowers me
to easily create and share

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.840
my work, but it also unlocks
completely new ways for me

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.690
to build a stronger
bond with my audience.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.080
Crowd play, for example,
gives our audiences the chance

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.480
to instantly jump
into a game with us,

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.880
and then the creator
can feature them live

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.350
on the stream in real time.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.500
Another feature that I'm
incredibly excited about

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.650
is State Share.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.480
Here, the possibilities
are literally endless.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.160
Live streaming horror
games, for instance,

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.850
has been one of the most popular
formats for live streaming

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.010
on YouTube since its inception.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.530
But now with State
Share, you can actually

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.170
take this to the next level
by letting the people who

00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:00.160
were just watching you replicate
the exact same scenario you

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.020
just played through in-game.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.870
Like that impossible moment
when you're out of med kits

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.840
and you suddenly have a zombie
breathing down your neck,

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.900
imagine the endless
variations that creators

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.390
can layer on top of all
their favorite games

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.300
by specifically designing
challenges oriented

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.310
to their unique audience.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:22.240
For creators, you suddenly
become a game maker yourself.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.580
Creating challenges
through State Share

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.580
allows us to continue creating
content for all your favorite

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.750
games long after the game
itself has been completed.

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.460
And on the other
hand, the audience

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.640
now can reconnect with all their
favorite games in completely

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.460
new, exciting, and fresh ways.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.950
But of course, also
as a gamer, I'm

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.990
looking forward
to, tremendously,

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:47.660
all the new possibilities of
gameplay that Stadia opens up

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.590
and that can be built
only for Stadia.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:52.360
I mean, think about this.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.170
1,000 player battle
royale matches, incredible

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:57.980
new graphical possibilities.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.450
And of course, all of this is
available across any screen.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.970
Literally, I could
just pick up my phone

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.300
and start playing exactly
where I left off on my laptop,

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.100
even while sitting
in an audience

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.940
of a keynote like this one.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.490
I hope you're not
playing right now.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:14.282
A lot of exciting stuff
happening on stage.

00:50:14.282 --> 00:50:15.400
But you could do it!

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.730
Stadia just truly
unlocks new opportunities

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:22.960
to create, share, and
engage across YouTube.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.240
I am personally
thrilled about what

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:29.230
Stadia brings to the table,
how it unites technology

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.390
and entertainment in
completely new ways

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.270
that we have never seen before,
and in ways that can only

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:38.740
be possible through the combined
power of Google and YouTube.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.770
So I thank the Stadia team
for having me in here today.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.110
I can't wait to see what
else you guys have in store,

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:47.905
and I'll see the rest of
you on the floors of GDC.

00:50:47.905 --> 00:50:50.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:56.210
PHIL HARRISON: Thanks
Ryan and MatPat.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.390
Connecting players and creators
to their favorite games

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.860
is core to our vision.

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.350
We've shown you how
YouTube and Stadia offer

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:06.500
the ability for gamers to
connect with content creators

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.620
and game developers
in extraordinary ways.

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.170
There is another Stadia
integration with YouTube

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.510
that we're really excited about.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.250
Designers love
creating challenge,

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.490
but as games reach
more and more people,

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.270
the design problem of
creating a perfect challenge

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.160
gets more and more difficult.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.770
When a player is stuck
on a level or puzzle

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:29.560
and desperately wants that
next beat in the story

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.280
or the breathtaking views in
the next level, what do they do?

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.530
Today, they have
to leave the game,

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.930
fire up YouTube,
find the right video,

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.830
scrub to the right part of that
video, and watch how it's done.

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:46.270
With Stadia, that help will
be just a button press away.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:47.740
Take this example
from our friends

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:50.080
at Crystal Dynamics with
the Rise of the Tomb Raider.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.670
When the player gets
stuck on a level,

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:54.790
like me, instead of grabbing
a laptop or a phone,

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:57.310
they just need to push the
button on the Stadia controller

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:59.950
to get help from the
Google Assistant.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.430
No distractions, no need to
take your eyes off the game,

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:07.222
and no secondary devices needed.

00:52:07.222 --> 00:52:09.642
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.470
It's another deep way in
which we're connecting players

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:19.090
with the games they love.

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:22.510
Stadia is about removing
barriers for players

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.960
to get to their favorite
content and moments.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.890
With Stadia, any link can be
an access point to the game.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:36.460
So for a developer, the entire
internet can become your Store

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:40.590
whether it's from our Stadia
Store, text messages, Reddit,

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:44.160
Facebook, Twitter, Discord,
Google search results, YouTube

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.690
videos, Gmail, or from
the Google Play Store,

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:50.820
gamers are going to be able
to find, discover, and enjoy

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.540
your games anywhere
they are and easily

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.160
share them with their friends.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.510
It's a truly revolutionary
way to discover your games.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:04.420
Stadia will be home
to a variety of games,

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.040
and we're happy to
say that we will

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:11.560
offer comprehensive parental
controls for all content.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.310
We've already shipped
development hardware

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:16.170
to more than 100 studios
around the world,

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:18.890
and more than 1,000
creatives and engineers

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:22.610
are hard at work bringing
their games to our platform.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.910
In addition to partnering
with developers big and small,

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:29.080
I'm also thrilled to
announce that today we

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.590
are forming Stadia Games
and Entertainment, which

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:35.020
will build experiences
designed exclusively

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:40.888
for Stadia as Google's own
first party game studio.

00:53:40.888 --> 00:53:43.273
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.670
And we've recently been joined
by one of the industry's

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.160
most successful
executive producers

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.260
to lead that organization.

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.910
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:01.110
the new head of Stadia Games
and Entertainment, Jade Raymond.

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:03.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.690
JADE RAYMOND: Thank you, Phil.

00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:11.870
Thank you, everyone.

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:16.960
I am so honored to be here
at the unveiling of Stadia.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.180
In my career, I've
been lucky enough

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:23.530
to work with some of the
most talented and passionate

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.540
developers in the world.

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:29.320
Passion is at the root
of all great games.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.530
And it's what motivated
me to join Google.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:34.960
What I love about games
is that we continue

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.620
to redefine what a game is.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.260
When I was 12, I
saw the holodeck

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.420
on an episode of Star Trek.

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.820
And even though the games
I played at the time

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:50.860
were side-scrolling pixel-based
kind of games like "Mega Man,"

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:55.150
it was obvious to me that one
day games would take place

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:58.210
in fully immersive worlds.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:03.460
Today, you have seen
some incredible tech.

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.310
And hopefully, like
me, you now believe

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:11.710
that we are on the brink of
a huge revolution in gaming,

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:16.630
one that will unlock a whole
new level of creativity

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:18.490
for developers.

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:22.280
There are no limits to
the human imagination.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:26.670
Now that the data
center is your platform,

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:31.700
the processing power
is limitless as well.

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:36.040
I'm excited to announce that
as the head of Stadia Games

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:40.030
and Entertainment, I will not
only be bringing first party

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:45.190
games studios to re-imagine
the new generation of games,

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:48.880
our team will also be working
with external developers

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:53.080
to make all of the bleeding
edge Google technology you've

00:55:53.080 --> 00:56:00.270
seen here today available to
partner studios big and small.

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:01.721
We are committed--

00:56:01.721 --> 00:56:04.176
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:12.310
To going down the bold path,
learning what is working best,

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:16.870
and sharing key tools and
tech, so that we can take games

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:20.620
to the next level together.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:24.550
The way I see it, there has
never been a more exciting time

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:29.380
to be a developer, and Stadia
will be a driving force,

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:34.150
defining the future of
games and entertainment.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.112
Thank you.

00:56:36.112 --> 00:56:38.582
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:40.448 --> 00:56:42.740
PHIL HARRISON: Thank you,
Jade, and a very warm welcome

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.570
to Google.

00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:46.850
With Stadia, our
goal is to combine

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.520
the world of people who play
games and the world of people

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.300
who watch games into one
global community, powered

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.430
by the best of Google.

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:57.290
We've shared a lot today.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:59.870
With Stadia, you'll be able
to build your games backed

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:02.540
by Google technology,
like Google Assistant, ML,

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:03.950
and TensorFlow.

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:05.630
You will be able to
deliver your games

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.990
to more gamers across the globe
through Chrome, Chromecast,

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.953
and Pixel.

00:57:09.953 --> 00:57:11.870
And you'll be able to
connect with the biggest

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:15.810
community of gamers and
YouTube content creators.

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:19.070
So how do you get involved?

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:22.070
For developers who want to
create content for Stadia,

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:24.740
we welcome you to
go to stadia.dev,

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.400
where you can apply to get
access to development tools.

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.530
If you want to partner
with our team at Google

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.300
to help bring your
game to market,

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.090
we have Stadia Partners,
a program designed

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:37.610
to give you the
resources your team needs

00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:39.630
to make something great.

00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:42.840
And for players who want to
be the first to learn more,

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.380
you can go to
stadia.com and follow us

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:48.760
on these social channels.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:53.730
So when will players be
able to experience Stadia?

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.470
I'm thrilled to
announce that Stadia

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:58.080
is launching this year, 2019.

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.555
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.210
We will launch first
in the US, Canada,

00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:10.450
the UK, and most of Europe.

00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:14.050
It's been my privilege today
to introduce Stadia on behalf

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.540
of the thousands of Googlers
who've worked tirelessly

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.520
to bring this vision to life.

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.920
This is the first
step in the journey,

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.780
and we'll be connecting
with you again

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.690
in the summer to share more
details on the games you'll get

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:28.520
to play at launch and beyond.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.240
Thank you very much for
gathering around with all of us

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.230
today.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:35.800
With Stadia, we can all
dream bigger, and together

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.840
build a playground
for every imagination.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.180
Thank you.

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.630
[MUSIC PLAYING]
