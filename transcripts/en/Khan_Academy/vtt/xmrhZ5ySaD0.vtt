00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] We're asked to mark all

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:06.006
the relative extremum
points in the graph below.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.343
So pause the video and see
if you can have a go at that,

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.665
just try to maybe look at the screen and,

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:15.218
in your head see if you can
identify the relative extrema.

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:16.983
So now let's do this together.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.956
So there's two types of relative extrema.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:22.347
You have your relative maximum points,

00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:25.847
and you have your relative minimum points.

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.777
And a relative maximum
point or relative minimum,

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:33.167
they're relatively easy
(laughing) to spot out visually.

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.953
You will see a relative maximum point as

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.602
the high point on a hill,

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:39.227
and the hill itself
doesn't even have to be

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:40.226
the highest hill.

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:42.200
For example the curve
could go at other parts

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.080
of the domain of the function,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.077
could go to higher values.

00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:48.469
It could also look like
the peak of a mountain,

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.025
and once again since we're talking about

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:51.348
the relative maximum,

00:00:51.348 --> 00:00:52.765
this mountain peak doesn't
have to be the highest

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:53.763
mountain peak.

00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:56.039
There could be higher mountains,

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.920
and actually each of these peaks,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.124
each of these peaks would
be a relative maximum point.

00:01:01.124 --> 00:01:03.701
Now relative minima are the opposite.

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:07.486
They would be the bottom of your valleys.

00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:09.855
So that's a relative minimum point.

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:12.780
This right over here is
a relative minimum point,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.591
even if there are other
parts of the function

00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:16.542
that are lower.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.980
Now there's also an edge
case for both relative

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.209
maxima and relative minima,

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.808
and that's where the graph is flat.

00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:27.200
So if you have parts
of your function where

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.709
it's just constant,

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.660
these points would actually be both.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.493
For example, if this is our x-axis

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.720
right over here,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.090
that's our x-axis,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.248
if this is our y-axis right over there,

00:01:41.248 --> 00:01:43.872
and if this is x equals c,

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:47.099
if you construct an
open interval around c,

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.536
you notice that the value
of our function at c,

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:53.508
f of c, is at least as large as the values

00:01:53.508 --> 00:01:55.760
of the function around it.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.572
And it is also at least as small

00:01:57.572 --> 00:01:59.801
as the values of the function around it,

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.356
so this point would also be considered

00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:03.980
a relative minimum point.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.579
But that's an edge case that
you won't encounter as often.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.880
So with that primer out of the way,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.666
let's identify the relative extrema.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:14.615
So first the relative maximum points.

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:17.355
Well that's a top of a
hill right over there,

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:18.980
this is the top of a hill.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.861
You might be tempted to look
at that point and that point,

00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:22.742
but notice, at this point right over here,

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:23.973
if you go to the right,

00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:25.807
you have values that are higher than it.

00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:27.827
So it's really not at the top of a hill.

00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:29.545
And right over if you go to the left,

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.473
you have values that are higher than it,

00:02:31.473 --> 00:02:34.770
so it's also not the top of a hill.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.883
And what about the
relative minimum points?

00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:41.690
Well this one right over here
is a relative minimum point.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.357
This one right over here is
a relative minimum point.

00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:48.098
And this one over here

00:02:48.098 --> 00:02:50.420
is a relative minimum point.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.971
Now let's do an example
dealing with absolute extrema.

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:58.756
So here we're told to
mark the absolute maximum

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:01.032
and the absolute minimum points

00:03:01.032 --> 00:03:03.214
in the graph below.

00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:04.213
So once again,

00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:07.649
pause this video and see if
you can have a go at this.

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.732
So you have an absolute maximum point

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:14.553
at let's say x equals c

00:03:15.637 --> 00:03:19.074
if and only if, so I'll write iff

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.233
for if and only if,

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:24.066
f of c is greater than or equal to

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:29.208
f of x for all the x's in
the domain of the function.

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:32.863
And you have an absolute minimum

00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:35.221
at x equals c

00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:37.854
if and only if, iff,

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.835
f of c is less than or equal to

00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:46.125
f of x for all the x's over the domain.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.099
So another way to think about it is,

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.419
absolute maximum point is the high point.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.134
So over here, that is the
absolute maximum point.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.340
And then the absolute
minimum point is interesting

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.548
because in this case,

00:03:58.548 --> 00:03:59.987
it would be actually one of,

00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:02.286
it would happen at one of
the endpoints of our domain.

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:04.619
So that is our absolute max,

00:04:06.884 --> 00:04:10.390
and this right over here is our absolute,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.473
absolute min.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.267
Now once again there is an edge case

00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:16.195
that you will not see too frequently.

00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:17.495
So for example,

00:04:17.495 --> 00:04:19.562
if this function did something like this,

00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:22.116
so if it went up like this,

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:25.366
and then it just stayed flat like this,

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.269
then this would no longer be an absolute

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:29.569
maximum point.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.797
But any of these points
in this flat region,

00:04:32.797 --> 00:04:35.839
because they are at least
as high as any other points

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.487
on our entire curve,

00:04:37.487 --> 00:04:42.039
any of those could be considered
absolute maximum points.

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.686
But we aren't dealing with
that edge case in this example,

00:04:44.686 --> 00:04:46.427
and you're less likely to see that.

00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:48.145
And so in most problems,

00:04:48.145 --> 00:04:49.446
it's pretty easy to pick out.

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:51.744
Because the absolute
highest point on the curve

00:04:51.744 --> 00:04:53.765
will often be your absolute maximum,

00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:55.831
and the absolute lowest
point on your curve

00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:57.466
will be your absolute minimum.
