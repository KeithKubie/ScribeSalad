Opposers, we all know

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:06.072
who the most persecuted group
in America is.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.841
That's right, men.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:12.278
Did you know a whopping
five percent of U.S. companies

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:14.280
had female CEOs?

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:17.016
Which means that, with the
exception of 95% of the economy,

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:19.352
women control the economy.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.753
(laughter)

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:22.522
This all points to one thing.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.824
Wardrobe lady?
(clears throat)

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.960
(laughter)

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:29.929
There's a war on men!

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:33.199 line:0%
Something ominous is happening
to men in America.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.801 line:0%
...a war on men.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.035 line:0%

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.409 line:0%
Boom! That's right, men,

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.912 line:0%
there's a war on<i> us.</i>

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.047 line:0%
And not even
the spurriest of bone spurs

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.283 line:0%
will get us out of it.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:53.352
You see, women have decided
we're the bad guys,

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:56.222
just because we're
"reluctant to change a system"

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:59.225
that benefits us
at their expense.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:01.627
And now they're hitting us
below the belt,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.663
and slightly to the side.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.898
And-- get your head
out of the gutter,

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.700
I'm talking about our wallets.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.003 line:0%
-Battleground one: money.
-(woman's echoing laughter)

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.506 line:0%
-(loud boom)
-Yes.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.143 line:0%
You know that fake pay gap
women keep complaining about?

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:20.746 line:0%
Well, I believe in it now,
because it's hurting men.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.182
There are now seven places
in the U.S.

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:25.685
where women earn more than men.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.987
Seven places!

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.324
But I say even one is too many.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:34.293
Did you know that every time
a woman out-earns a man,

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:37.497
an angel loses his erection
and then punches a wall?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.465
-(laughter, whooping, applause)
-Yeah.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.100
It's true.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.804
And now these greedy women don't
just want to<i> take</i> our money,

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.739
they want to<i> be</i> our money.

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:48.241
Check it.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:52.345 line:0%
A new bipartisan bill to put

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:05.525 line:0%

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.360
No.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.329
More like non-appropriate.

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:13.299
I can't make heads
or tails of this.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:14.834
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.670
I mean heads or lady heads
of this.

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:20.506
Ugh. Do you see how gross
and oppressive that feels?

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.608
This is a huge problem.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.777
And not just because
four girl quarters

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.881
will only be worth 79 cents.

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:32.518
It's clear the female vagenda

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.620
is trying to use small change

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:36.822
to change the world
as we know it.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:40.359
So don't tell me, "Relax, man,
it's just a coin."

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.195
No, no.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.263
Representation matters, okay.

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.532
First, it's our quarters,
then our dollars.

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:48.634
And then young girls
start seeing themselves

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.603
represented everywhere.

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.605
And pretty soon, I have
to explain to my son, Truck,

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:55.174
that he can't grow up
to be whatever he wants.

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:56.809
Because they put a lady
on a quarter,

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.011
and now there's
a more qualified women out there

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.781
who also wants to be
a ninja astronaut.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.183
So you better learn to cook
a goddam egg!

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.952
It's just not fair!

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.954
(applause)

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.356
Yes, yes!

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.992
But look, women aren't just
coming for our moolah.

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.361 line:0%
They're also coming
for our manhood,

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:17.697 line:0%
which brings me to
battleground two: penises.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.699 line:0%
(woman laughing, explosion)

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.902 line:0%
Look what they're doing
with our penises.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.438 line:0%
Actresses Cate Blanchett
and Sandra Bullock,

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.673 line:0%
-they're both gorgeous women.
-Yes.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.343 line:0%
-Flawless skin.
-Yes.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.678 line:0%
They have tried the so-called--

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.914 line:0%
-this is an anatomical
reference-- -(gasps)

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.383 line:0%
the so-called "penis facial."

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.452 line:0%
-Wait, wait.
-It happens to be derived

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.654 line:0%
from the foreskin
of Korean newborns.

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:42.989 line:0%
Oh, my goodness.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.890
Ugh.

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:46.859
(laughter)

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:54.033
A hard-hitting report from
what I could only assume

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:57.103
is an every day episode
of<i> Good Morning, Belfast.</i>

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.105
(laughter)

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:01.207
This is outrageous.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.976
These penis facials go against
the natural order.

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:05.678
I'll say it loud and proud:

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.882
penises are only for men
to enjoy.

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:12.551
But now women are using
our dicks to trick us

00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:14.553
into thinking they're prettier
than they are.

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.856
That is vain.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.993
Women, what have men ever done
to make you think your value

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:24.897
is based on your
physical appearance?

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.300
This is clearly
a diabolical plot

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.336
to steal our male essence,
our power, our influence,

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:33.339
our ability to grill meat
outdoors.

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:36.876
And don't tell me, "Relax, man,
it's just the tip."

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.878
(laughter)

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.114
That's how it starts.

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:44.250
First, it's the foreskin facial,

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:46.819
then it's the testicle earrings,
and before you know it,

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:49.088
some witchy woman is wearing
your skin, doing your job,

00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:50.890
and woman spreading
all over the bus,

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:54.327
while screaming at you
to smile more.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.229
No, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:04:57.262 --> 00:04:59.699
I don't want to smile.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:04.036
You've taken my skin and my job
and it sucks.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.572 line:0%
Final battleground:
physical strength.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:08.574 line:0%
(woman laughs, explosion)

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:11.043
Look, maybe you're a tough guy.

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:12.778
Maybe you think women are weak.

00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:14.046
Well, think again.

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:16.082 line:0%
The Northeastern ladies
basketball team

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.817 line:0%
was on the way to a, a game,
a big game,

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.186 line:0%
and something horrible happened,
their bus got stuck.

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.655 line:0%
<i> So you know what they did?
 They did what women do.</i>

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:25.658 line:0%
<i> They got out and they started
 pushing it,</i>

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.193 line:0%

<i> The power of estrogen.</i>

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:32.698
Oh, the power of estrogen.

00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:36.569
What is that, the tag line for
<i> Wonder Woman 2?</i>

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:39.872
Kamala Harris'
2020 campaign slogan?

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:42.808
A little known "B" side from
Huey Lewis and the News?

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.977
♪ That's the power
of estrogen. ♪

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.412
What is it?

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:50.282
But power of estrogen is scaring
the (bleep) out of me.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:52.885
An not just because I once read
that eating edamame

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:55.454
will give you moobs, no.

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:56.956
This is America.

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.024
Men are supposed to be
the strong ones.

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:01.527
Have you seen me open a jar?
(laughs)

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.129
Trick question.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:07.166
If you'd seen me,
we'd already be dating.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.803
But these women, they are
stealing my thunder.

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:13.439
And don't tell me,
"Relax, man.

00:06:13.472 --> 00:06:15.241
"It's just an inspiring story

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:17.309
about a women's
basketball team."

00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:19.945
No. This is the beginning
of the end.

00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:21.881
These women are saying,
"Hey, men,

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.716
we don't need you anymore."

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.084
Instead of waiting

00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:27.019
for some streetwise Hercules
to bail them out,

00:06:27.052 --> 00:06:31.323
they Voltroned
into one big Her-cules,

00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:34.460
and she's scaring the (bleep)
out of me.

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:36.762
So, men,
let this be a call to you

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:38.631
to join the resistance.

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:42.601
Men, we must stand up
and defend ourselves.

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:45.504
We must be defensive.

00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:48.474
Hell, we'll be overly defensive.

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:50.976
Equality is a finite resource,

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.213
and women on a shopping spree
to gobble it all up.

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:57.616
So we need to protect
what little we have left,

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:59.318
which is going to be tough,

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:02.855
because it's still
almost everything.

00:07:02.888 --> 00:07:04.790
It's so hard.

00:07:04.823 --> 00:07:06.325
Stay strong, men.

00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:07.360
The fight continues.
