00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.039
yo like how is seeing like I'm gonna
ride that but now what the foils because

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049
ride that but now what the foils because
 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.180
ride that but now what the foils because
they're actually catching the energy

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190
they're actually catching the energy
 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.409
they're actually catching the energy
below the surface of the water

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419
below the surface of the water
 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.960
below the surface of the water
what's up Voyles I'm not they have these

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970
what's up Voyles I'm not they have these
 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.719
what's up Voyles I'm not they have these
things called Hydra foils so originally

things called Hydra foils so originally
 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.520
things called Hydra foils so originally
there's a guy named Mike Murphy who

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530
there's a guy named Mike Murphy who
 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.869
there's a guy named Mike Murphy who
created something called the air chair

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879
created something called the air chair
 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.030
created something called the air chair
and they were they've been putting foils

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040
and they were they've been putting foils
 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.819
and they were they've been putting foils
on like water skis and different funky

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829
on like water skis and different funky
 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.069

his friends got an air tear and cut the

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150
his friends got an air tear and cut the
 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.420
his friends got an air tear and cut the
chair off and put us snowboard boots

chair off and put us snowboard boots
 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.310
chair off and put us snowboard boots
bindings quick-release so you stand on

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320
bindings quick-release so you stand on
 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.570
bindings quick-release so you stand on
it you're booted in and

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580
it you're booted in and
 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.610
it you're booted in and
whoa is this basically a mini airplane

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620
whoa is this basically a mini airplane
 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.300
whoa is this basically a mini airplane
with a strut so for example yeah there's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310
with a strut so for example yeah there's
 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.249
with a strut so for example yeah there's
a shot of one and this is a smaller one

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259
a shot of one and this is a smaller one
 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.929
a shot of one and this is a smaller one
Jamie do you have any ones of the big

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939
Jamie do you have any ones of the big
 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.240
Jamie do you have any ones of the big
with the boots I think this is what

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250
with the boots I think this is what
 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.270
with the boots I think this is what
people are used varies do you know what

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280
people are used varies do you know what
 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.689
people are used varies do you know what
about this wow he knows about everything

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699
about this wow he knows about everything
 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.189
about this wow he knows about everything
what are you talking about he's plugged

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199
what are you talking about he's plugged
 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.369
what are you talking about he's plugged
in is plugged in look at him give her

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379
in is plugged in look at him give her
 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.040
in is plugged in look at him give her
girlfriend

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050
girlfriend
 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.029
girlfriend
well what happened to this dude's head

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039
well what happened to this dude's head
 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.110
well what happened to this dude's head
oh yeah

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120
oh yeah
 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.089
oh yeah
so there's Laird on the left obviously

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099
so there's Laird on the left obviously
 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.770
so there's Laird on the left obviously
so you see how he they're in the boots

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780
so you see how he they're in the boots
 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.890
so you see how he they're in the boots
and also he the reason he looks so puffy

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900
and also he the reason he looks so puffy
 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.950
and also he the reason he looks so puffy
is he has floatation underneath his

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960
is he has floatation underneath his
 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.749
is he has floatation underneath his
wetsuit so if you hit your head or what

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759
wetsuit so if you hit your head or what
 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.439
wetsuit so if you hit your head or what
have you but it's basically a miniature

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449
have you but it's basically a miniature
 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.450
have you but it's basically a miniature
airplane underneath the surface and if

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460
airplane underneath the surface and if
 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.689
airplane underneath the surface and if
he gets into trouble if they wiped out

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699
he gets into trouble if they wiped out
 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.860
he gets into trouble if they wiped out
they have a quick release but now

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870
they have a quick release but now
 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.230
they have a quick release but now
they've gotten this developed so that he

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240
they've gotten this developed so that he
 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.339
they've gotten this developed so that he
can do it without the boots because that

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349
can do it without the boots because that
 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.860
can do it without the boots because that
adds an element of danger that because

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870
adds an element of danger that because
 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.330
adds an element of danger that because
you're strapped in you're strapped in

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340
you're strapped in you're strapped in
 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.330
you're strapped in you're strapped in
and you're strut is you know four feet

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340
and you're strut is you know four feet
 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.110
and you're strut is you know four feet
long you know that's so strange looking

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120
long you know that's so strange looking
 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.749
long you know that's so strange looking
yeah but what's going on below the

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759
yeah but what's going on below the
 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.550
yeah but what's going on below the
surface so there's a miniature airplane

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560
surface so there's a miniature airplane
 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.110
surface so there's a miniature airplane
do you have Jamie do have any pictures

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120
do you have Jamie do have any pictures
 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.029
do you have Jamie do have any pictures
of it flipped up I'm sure if you look on

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039
of it flipped up I'm sure if you look on
 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.469
of it flipped up I'm sure if you look on
Laird stuff you can see the bottom it's

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479
Laird stuff you can see the bottom it's
 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.689
Laird stuff you can see the bottom it's
like a miniature airplane because water

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699
like a miniature airplane because water
 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.459
like a miniature airplane because water
is denser than air so it's sort of like

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469
is denser than air so it's sort of like
 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.730
is denser than air so it's sort of like
a miniature plane and it is like the

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740
a miniature plane and it is like the
 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.219
a miniature plane and it is like the
Oracle guys that do those boats do have

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229
Oracle guys that do those boats do have
 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.790
Oracle guys that do those boats do have
made foils for Laird it's yeah so those

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800
made foils for Laird it's yeah so those
 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.689
made foils for Laird it's yeah so those
are kind of more low performance ones

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699
are kind of more low performance ones
 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.149
are kind of more low performance ones
when you see the high performance they I

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159
when you see the high performance they I
 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.990
when you see the high performance they I
mean you know aerodynamics hydrodynamics

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000
mean you know aerodynamics hydrodynamics
 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.809
mean you know aerodynamics hydrodynamics
it's all of that so now what you're

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819
it's all of that so now what you're
 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.640
it's all of that so now what you're
doing is because there's energy below

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650
doing is because there's energy below
 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.369
doing is because there's energy below
the surface moving so we think of a wave

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379
the surface moving so we think of a wave
 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.619
the surface moving so we think of a wave
like pushing and dropping but there's

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629
like pushing and dropping but there's
 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.540
like pushing and dropping but there's
actually the energy circular energy

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550
actually the energy circular energy
 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.309
actually the energy circular energy
below so now you've got the foil that

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319
below so now you've got the foil that
 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.050
below so now you've got the foil that
can ride that but you're not you don't

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060
can ride that but you're not you don't
 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.899
can ride that but you're not you don't
have drag so like they can go there's a

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909
have drag so like they can go there's a
 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.719
have drag so like they can go there's a
wave on kawaiii where they're going over

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729
wave on kawaiii where they're going over
 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.059
wave on kawaiii where they're going over
you know 50 big Oh about 50 they can go

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:30.069
you know 50 big Oh about 50 they can go
 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.379
you know 50 big Oh about 50 they can go
up get up to 52 miles an hour so imagine

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389
up get up to 52 miles an hour so imagine
 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:35.730
up get up to 52 miles an hour so imagine
if you did something well you've you

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740
if you did something well you've you
 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.589
if you did something well you've you
know dedicated yourself to martial arts

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599
know dedicated yourself to martial arts
 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.779
know dedicated yourself to martial arts
it's like but then there's like a new

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789
it's like but then there's like a new
 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.490
it's like but then there's like a new
way to do it

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500
way to do it
 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.650
way to do it
and so he's been doing the big stuff for

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660
and so he's been doing the big stuff for
 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.870
and so he's been doing the big stuff for
25 years but now they're getting the

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880
25 years but now they're getting the
 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.150
25 years but now they're getting the
equipment right that he can ride ways

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160
equipment right that he can ride ways
 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.940
equipment right that he can ride ways
that actually wouldn't be that great but

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950
that actually wouldn't be that great but
 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.010
that actually wouldn't be that great but
now they're super fun Wow

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020
now they're super fun Wow
 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.140
now they're super fun Wow
so he gets it makes him excited and he

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150
so he gets it makes him excited and he
 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.990
so he gets it makes him excited and he
still pursues it and that's how that's

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000
still pursues it and that's how that's
 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.610
still pursues it and that's how that's
on Kauai right there and see how it's

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620
on Kauai right there and see how it's
 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.680
on Kauai right there and see how it's
not even breaking where he rides it yeah

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690
not even breaking where he rides it yeah
 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.800
not even breaking where he rides it yeah
so it no drug correct and it's it's

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810
so it no drug correct and it's it's
 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.680
so it no drug correct and it's it's
actually riding the energy below the

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690
actually riding the energy below the
 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.190
actually riding the energy below the
surface which you know for him he's just

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200
surface which you know for him he's just
 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.500
surface which you know for him he's just
