00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.010
An ecologist surveys the
age of about 100 trees

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.450
in a local forest.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.070
He uses a box-and-whisker plot
to map his data shown below.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.540
What is the range of tree
ages that he surveyed?

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.730
What is the median age
of a tree in the forest?

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.040
So first of all, let's
make sure we understand

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.760
what this box-and-whisker
plot is even about.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.310
This is really a way of
seeing the spread of all

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.180
of the different data points,
which are the age of the trees,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.630
and to also give
other information

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.780
like, what is the median?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.390
And where do most of the
ages of the trees sit?

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690
So this whisker part, so you
could see this black part

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.440
is a whisker, this
is the box, and then

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.670
this is another whisker
right over here.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.220
The whiskers tell us essentially
the spread of all of the data.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.190
So it says the lowest to
data point in this sample

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.740
is an eight-year-old tree.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.580
I'm assuming that this axis
down here is in the years.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.800
And it says at the highest--
the oldest tree right over here

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.310
is 50 years.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.172
So if we want the
range-- and when

00:00:58.172 --> 00:01:00.130
we think of range in a
statistics point of view

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.980
we're thinking of
the highest data

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.319
point minus the
lowest data point.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.630
So it's going to be 50 minus 8.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.411
So we have a range of 42.

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:10.910
So that's what the
whiskers tell us.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.300
It tells us that everything
falls between 8 and 50 years,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.550
including 8 years and 50 years.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.400
Now what the box does,
the box starts at-- well,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.234
let me explain it
to you this way.

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:23.150
This line right over
here, this is the median.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.490
And so half of
the ages are going

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.740
to be less than this median.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.980
We see right over
here the median is 21.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.300
So this box-and-whiskers
plot tells us

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.590
that half of the ages of
the trees are less than 21

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.070
and half are older than 21.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.300
And then these endpoints
right over here,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.950
these are the medians for
each of those sections.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.960
So this is the median
for all the trees

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.810
that are less than
the real median

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.170
or less than the main median.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.360
So this is in the middle
of all of the ages of trees

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.790
that are less than 21.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.280
This is the middle
age for all the trees

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.610
that are greater than
21 or older than 21.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.780
And so we're actually
splitting all of the data

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.070
into four groups.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.430
This we would call
the first quartile.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.680
So I'll call it Q1 for
our first quartile.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.170
Maybe I'll do 1Q.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.530
This is the first quartile.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.891
Roughly a fourth of the
tree, because the way

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:21.640
you calculate it,
sometimes a tree ends up

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.160
in one point or another,
about a fourth of the trees

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.870
end up here.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.651
A fourth of the trees
are between 14 and 21.

00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:30.936
A fourth are between 21
and it looks like 33.

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:32.560
And then a fourth
are in this quartile.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.310
So we call this the first
quartile, the second quartile,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.430
the third quartile, and
the fourth quartile.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.640
So to answer the question,
we already did the range.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.361
There's a 42-year spread between
the oldest and the youngest

00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:46.860
tree.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.440
And then the median age of a
tree in the forest is at 21.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.610
So even though you might have
trees that are as old as 50,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.360
the median of the
forest is actually

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.387
closer to the lower end of
our entire spectrum of all

00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:02.370
of the ages.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.790
So if you view median as your
central tendency measurement,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.860
it's only at 21 years.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.910
And you can even see it.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.810
It's closer to the
left of the box

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.930
and closer to the end
of the left whisker

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.920
than the end of
the right whisker.
