00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.650
Let's do some
examples simplifying

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.590
trigonometric expressions.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.210
So let's say that I have 1
minus sine squared theta,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.190
and this whole thing times
cosine squared theta.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.110
So how could I simplify this?

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.820
Well the one thing
that we do know--

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.550
and this is the most
fundamental trig identity,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.383
this comes straight out
of the unit circle--

00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:27.470
is that cosine squared
theta plus sine squared

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.520
theta is equal to 1.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.790
And then, if we subtract sine
squared theta from both sides,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.300
we get cosine squared
theta is equal to 1

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.530
minus sine squared theta.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.750
So we have two options.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.580
We could either replace this
1 minus sine squared theta

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.670
with the cosine
squared theta, or we

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.300
could replace this
cosine squared theta

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.335
with the 1 minus
sine squared theta.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:51.210
Well I'd prefer to do
the former because this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.810
is a more complicated
expression.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.510
So if I can replace this with
the cosine squared theta,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.499
then I think I'm
simplifying this.

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:01.040
So let's see.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.850
This will be cosine
squared theta times

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.690
another cosine squared theta.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.796
And so all of this is going to
simplify to cosine theta times

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:12.170
cosine theta times cosine
theta times cosine theta, well,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.780
that's just going to be
cosine to the fourth of theta.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.930
Let's do another example.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:31.350
Let's say that we have sine
squared theta, all of that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.920
over 1 minus sine squared theta.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.674
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:42.590
Well we already know
that 1 minus sine squared

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.730
theta is the same thing
as cosine squared theta.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.020
So it's going to be sine
squared theta over-- this thing

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.050
is the same thing as
cosine squared theta,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.250
we just saw that-- over
cosine squared theta, which

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.540
is going to be equal
to-- you could view

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.010
this as sine theta over cosine
theta whole quantity squared.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.970
Well what's sine over cosine?

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.160
That's tangent.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.670
So this is equal to
tangent squared theta.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.600
Let's do one more example.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:26.944
Let's say that we have cosine
squared theta plus 1 minus--

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:28.360
actually, let's
make it this way--

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.185
plus 1 plus sine squared theta.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.947
What is this going to be?

00:02:37.947 --> 00:02:40.030
Well you might be tempted,
especially with the way

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.446
I wrote the colors,
to think, hey,

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:43.875
is there some identity for
1 plus sine squared theta?

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:45.630
But this is really
all about rearranging

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.640
it to realize that, gee, by
the unit circle definition,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.730
I know what cosine squared theta
plus sine squared theta is.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.820
Cosine squared theta
plus sine squared

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.500
theta, for any given theta,
is going to be equal to 1.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.580
So this is going to be
equal to 1 plus this 1 right

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.300
over here, which is equal to 2.
