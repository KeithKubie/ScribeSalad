00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.620
In the movie Self/Less, which hits theaters
July 10th, Sir Ben Kingsley transfers his

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.230
consciousness to Ryan Reynold’s body in
an effort to stay alive forever, and effectively

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.470
become immortal in a process called ‘shedding’.
Which sounds pretty awesome – I mean who

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.600
wouldn’t want more time to accomplish their
dreams and goals in a younger body of your

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
choice? Try being a professional athlete or
solve the world’s greatest problems. But

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.470
is shedding actually plausible? Could you
really be immortal in this way?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.869
First, we need to understand how memories
are stored. Your brain is a three-pound lump

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.880
of fatty tissue that contains about 86 billion
brain cells called neurons. By passing electricity

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.390
or chemicals between them, neurons can send
signals to each other. Most neuroscientists

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.930
believe memory is stored as a network of neurons
that form links with each other and all fire

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.140
at the same time. Each time a memory is recalled,
the same network of neurons fires together.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.910
In fact, scientists have shown that if you
stimulate certain parts of the brain with

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.309
electricity, you can cause an individual to
recall certain memories - for example, the

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.000
smell of burnt toast.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.950
So to download a memory, we could simply track
which neurons are activated when you’re

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.310
thinking about it. And, as we explained in
a previous video, scientists have already

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.799
done this. By using computers to match these
patterns of firing neurons with real images

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.549
or scenes, we can already read people’s
minds to a limited degree.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.650
Many scientists believe it should one day
be possible to create a kind of map of all

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.710
the neurons in the brain and the connections
between them: this map would be called a “connectome.”

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.390
Both the United States and the European Union
have launched major research programs with

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.880
this goal specifically in mind, much like
the organizations in Self/Less. This task

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.869
will likely take decades, but once it’s
done, scientists should be able to build a

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.470
computer model of the connectome, a kind of
virtual brain that would be able to send signals

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.140
between neurons through artificial synapses.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.720
So if downloading memories is possible, what
about uploading? That too is becoming a reality

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.259
thanks to a technique called optogenetics.
This involves injecting specific neurons with

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.619
DNA from algae that causes them to produce
a light-sensitive protein on their cell surface.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.009
When light is shone into the brain, it stimulates
the protein and activates only those neurons

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.979
that express it. In this way, scientists can
artificially activate groups of neurons associated

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.540
with particular memories.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.049
All this may sound pretty scary, and may make
you think that a scenario like that found

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.219
in Self/Less can’t be far off. But there
a few reasons to relax.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:25.150
Our brains are unbelievably complex, perhaps
too complex to copy. The number of synapse

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.609
connections is a thousand times bigger than
the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.379
On top of that, your brain is constantly remodeling
itself, creating new connections and letting

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.439
old ones expire. It’s a reflection of who
you are at this specific moment in time, and

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.889
it took your entire lifetime to create.

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:48.120
A copy of your mind would be just an imitation.
And the second it started integrating new

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.029
thoughts, memories and experiences, it would
become someone else. Which, in a way, helps

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:58.010
us appreciate how unique we truly are. But
with increasingly sophisticated technology,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.299
who knows what the future may hold! Perhaps
a world like Self/Less isn’t too far away.

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.859
Be sure to check out Self/Less which is in
theatres July 10th - we’ll be there and

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:07.980
are excited to hear what you all think about
it.
