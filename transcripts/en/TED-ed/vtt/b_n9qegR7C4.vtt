00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:10.997
Many of us will experience some kind 
of trauma during our lifetime.

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:14.227
Sometimes, we escape 
with no long-term effects.

00:00:14.227 --> 00:00:18.110
But for millions of us, 
those experiences linger,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.801
causing symptoms like flashbacks,

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.708
nightmares,

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.735
and negative thoughts 
that interfere with everyday life.

00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:27.052
This phenomenon, 
called post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:28.450
or PTSD,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.440
isn’t a personal failing;

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.788
rather, it’s a treatable malfunction 
of certain biological mechanisms

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:39.245
that allow us to cope 
with dangerous experiences.

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:40.893
To understand PTSD,

00:00:40.893 --> 00:00:45.520
we first need to understand how the brain 
processes a wide range of ordeals,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.624
including the death of a loved one,

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:48.884
domestic violence,

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:50.695
injury or illness,

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:51.744
abuse,

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:52.678
rape,

00:00:52.678 --> 00:00:53.468
war,

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:54.412
car accidents,

00:00:54.412 --> 00:00:55.947
and natural disasters.

00:00:55.947 --> 00:00:59.356
These events can bring on feelings 
of danger and helplessness,

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:01.583
which activate the brain’s alarm system,

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:04.969
known as 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:06.493
When this alarm sounds,

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:09.745
the hypothalamic, pituitary, 
and adrenal systems,

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:11.677
known as the HPA axis,

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:16.064
work together to send signals 
to the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:19.828
That’s the network that communicates 
with adrenal glands and internal organs

00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:22.046
to help regulate functions like
heart rate,

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:22.936
digestion,

00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:24.589
and respiration.

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:26.842
These signals start a chemical cascade

00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:30.153
that floods the body with several 
different stress hormones,

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:34.580
causing physiological changes 
that prepare the body to defend itself.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.156
Our heart rate speeds up,

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:37.163
breathing quickens,

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.470
and muscles tense.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.110
Even after a crisis is over,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.629
escalated levels of stress hormones 
may last for days,

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:46.215
contributing to jittery feelings,

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:47.037
nightmares,

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:48.619
and other symptoms.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.182
For most people, these experiences
disappear within a few days to two weeks

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:55.216
as their hormone levels stabilize.

00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:58.063
But a small percentage of those
who experience trauma

00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:00.208
have persistent problems

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:04.545
—sometimes vanishing temporarily 
only to resurface months later.

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:07.503
We don’t completely understand 
what’s happening in the brain,

00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:10.564
but one theory is that 
the stress hormone cortisol

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:14.589
may be continuously activating 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:19.864
while reducing overall brain functioning,
leading to a number of negative symptoms.

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:22.353
These symptoms often fall 
into four categories:

00:02:22.353 --> 00:02:25.441
intrusive thoughts, 
like dreams and flashbacks,

00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:27.418
avoiding reminders of the trauma,

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:31.315
negative thoughts and feelings,
like fear, anger, and guilt,

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:36.236
and “reactive” symptoms like irritability 
and difficulty sleeping.

00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:38.719
Not everyone has all these symptoms,

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.672
or experiences them to the same extent 
and intensity.

00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:46.531
When problems last more than a month, 
PTSD is often diagnosed.

00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:47.485
Genetics,

00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:49.736
on-going overwhelming stress,

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.464
and many risk factors 
like preexisting mental illnesses

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:54.959
or lack of emotional support,

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.272
likely play a role in determining 
who will experience PTSD.

00:02:59.272 --> 00:03:04.613
But the underlying cause 
is still a medical mystery.

00:03:04.613 --> 00:03:09.302
A major challenge of coping 
with PTSD is sensitivity to triggers,

00:03:09.302 --> 00:03:11.453
physical and emotional stimuli

00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:14.375
that the brain associates 
with the original trauma.

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:18.354
These can be everyday sensations 
that aren’t inherently dangerous

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:21.930
but prompt powerful physical 
and emotional reactions.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.659
For example, the smell of a campfire

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.302
could evoke the memory of being trapped 
in a burning house.

00:03:28.302 --> 00:03:30.209
For someone with PTSD,

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.571
that memory activates the same
neurochemical cascade

00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:35.563
as the original event.

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:39.584
That then stirs up the same feelings 
of panic and helplessness

00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:43.645
as if they’re experiencing 
the trauma all over again.

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:47.638
Trying to avoid these triggers,
which are sometimes unpredictable,

00:03:47.638 --> 00:03:49.741
can lead to isolation.

00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.775
That can leave people feeling invalidated,

00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:52.529
ignored,

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:53.894
or misunderstood,

00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:56.385
like a pause button has been
pushed on their lives

00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:59.248
while the rest of the world 
continues around them.

00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:01.621
But, there are options.

00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:04.123
If you think you might 
be suffering from PTSD,

00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:07.827
the first step is an evaluation 
with a mental health professional

00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:11.155
who can direct you towards 
the many resources available.

00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:14.385
Psychotherapy can 
be very effective for PTSD,

00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:17.575
helping patients better 
understand their triggers.

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:20.402
And certain medications 
can make symptoms more manageable,

00:04:20.402 --> 00:04:25.182
as can self- care practices,
like mindfulness and regular exercise.

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:29.116
What if you notice signs of PTSD 
in a friend or family member?

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:33.658
Social support, acceptance, and
empathy are key to helping and recovery.

00:04:33.658 --> 00:04:37.187
Let them know you believe their
account of what they’re experiencing,

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:39.730
and that you don’t blame them 
for their reactions.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.970
If they’re open to it,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.994
encourage them to seek evaluation 
and treatment.

00:04:43.994 --> 00:04:46.880
PTSD has been called “the hidden wound”

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.608
because it comes 
without outward physical signs.

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:54.427
But even if it’s an invisible disorder, 
it doesn’t have to be a silent one.
