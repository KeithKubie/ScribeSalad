00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[D. Evans] Let's get started with programming.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Programming is really the core of computer science.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Most machines are designed to do just one thing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is supposed to be a toaster.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.662
It's more of a representational drawing than an accurate one.

00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:18.000
A toaster - well, we can do more than one thing with a toaster maybe.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We can put different things in it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.877
We can toast bread, we can toast muffins.

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:26.000
Maybe it has some things we can use to change its behavior a little bit.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We can turn a setting to make it toast for longer or shorter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But it's pretty limited what it can do.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Everything it can do is a variation on this basic functionality that it was designed for,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
this basic process of putting toast in, heating it up, and getting the toast to pop out.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If we want to change its behavior to do something really different,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we'd have to physically alter the machine.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We could maybe take the parts out, put them together in a new way.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we're really creative we could make a bicycle from the toaster.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That would be a pretty big project, though.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So without a program, a computer is even less useful than a toaster.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Can't do anything without a program.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The program is what tells the computer what to do.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And the power of a computer is that, unlike a toaster,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
which is really designed to only do a few things,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a computer can do anything.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
A computer is a universal machine.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We can program it to do essentially any computation.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So anything that we can imagine,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
anything that we can figure out how to write a program for,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we can make the computer do.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And what the program needs to be is a very precise sequence of steps.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The computer by itself doesn't know how to do anything.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It has a few simple instructions that it can execute.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And to make a program do something useful,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we need to put those instructions together in a way that does what we want.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So we can turn the computer into a web browser, into a server,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
into a game-playing machine, into a toaster without anywhere to put the bread,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but into anything that we can imagine - at least any computation we want to do.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And the power of the computer is that it can execute those steps super, super fast,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so we can execute billions of instructions in one second.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The program gives us a way to tell the computer what steps to take.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
There are many different languages for programming computers.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The language we're going to learn in this course is a language called Python, like the snake.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.538
It's also named after Monty Python.

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:18.000
The important thing about Python is it gives us a nice high level language

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that we can use to write programs.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And that means instead of our program running directly on the computer,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the programs that we write will be an input to the Python program,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
which runs on the computer.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What Python is is called an interpreter.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
That means it runs our programs, it interprets them,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
executes the program that we wrote in the Python language

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
by running a program in the language that the computer can understand directly.
