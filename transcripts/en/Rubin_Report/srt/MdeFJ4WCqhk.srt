1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,420
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,400
joining me today is the Milbank family
centers senior fellow at the Hoover

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,810
Institution at Stanford University,

4
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:15,430
a senior fellow at the Center for
European studies at Harvard where he also

5
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:20,431
served as a professor of history for 12
years as well as the author of 14 books.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,090
Neil Ferguson. Welcome to the Rubin
report. It's exciting to be here.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,530
How'd I do on the intro there? I mean I
was looking through your bio 14 books.

8
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,440
There were 87 other things I
could have credited you for.

9
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:35,530
We've already done an interview here in
just the 15 minutes we've been sitting

10
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:38,610
here. How was that all right. I mean
I could've just made it quicker.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,070
The better is my feeling
about introductions just to
set. He is Neil. All right,

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,710
here's Neil. All right. There's
a ton we got to cover here and I,

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,300
we've already done half of it
I think without the cameras.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,750
So let's just dive in immediately to
the culture war stuff cause I can tell

15
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:56,470
you've been traveling a lot.
Half jet lags, half wide awake,

16
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:59,020
but I can see that's really where
your head's at at the moment.

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,210
So let's talk some culture war stuff.

18
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:06,040
What do you feel is happening sort of
in the gestalt of the universe at the

19
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,460
moment?
We'll look assaulted.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,890
The university might be where we should
begin since I've spent a lot of my life

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,910
in universities. You mentioned a couple
of them that Stanford and Harvard.

22
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,880
I was at Oxford before that and I'm,
much of my life has been,

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,540
I think witnessing the gradual
homogenization of academic life,

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,880
especially in the field like history.

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,150
When I became a historian back in the
1980s in Oxford and then in Cambridge,

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,520
it was generally accepted that that could
be conservative historians and liberal

27
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:43,060
historians and socialist historians
and then some oxys and towards,

28
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,830
it was really quite a heterogeneous
community, Oxbridge in those days.

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,940
And if you,
uh,

30
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:53,941
as I was attracted to the Conservatives
because they were more fun and it was a,

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,920
I think I can say more right?
But on more fun.

32
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,140
The Fun was the initially
attractive thing.

33
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:01,540
When I first got to Oxford
in the early eighties,

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,170
it was clearly at the funniest
people where the facture rights, uh,

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,180
the young Andrew Sullivan who was
a year ahead of me at Moreland.

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,740
So this was all great fun and
it led to intellectual, uh,

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,950
insight because they turned
out all sorts of B writes,

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,970
the historians take Bob Conquest,
who was then at the Hoover institution,

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,040
one of the few historians who got
the Soviet Union right at the time,

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,350
who wrote about Stalin's crimes not
long after they were perpetrated.

41
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:36,610
I mean, those were the
heroes, uh, of my early years.

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,160
But in the course of my career,

43
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:44,161
what has happened has been that one
history department after another has moved

44
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,660
steadily and relentlessly
to the monochrome left.

45
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,230
And it has become steadily harder to,

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,420
to be seen as a conservative.
I say seen us, cause I,

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,060
I've never really felt
that I'm a conservative,

48
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:02,350
but I've often been as one to be seen
as a conservative historian has become

49
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,950
steadily harder and harder.
And as a result,

50
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:10,951
the culture war to use your phrase in the
universities has been won by the left.

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,060
There will really be soon a handful left
of conservatives at institutions like

52
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:23,890
Harvard and Stanford and Harvey Mansfield
will probably be the last one at

53
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:28,840
Harvard. Uh, and, and that's
to me deeply depressing,

54
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,340
deeply troubling. Do you remember a
moment when you saw that shift occurring,

55
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,470
because you're saying in the,
in the 80s, mid eighties,

56
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:38,560
it was pretty diverse in terms of ideas.

57
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:42,670
Do you remember seeing something or did
you see markers that started that you

58
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,070
can start putting together the map
of where this thing was going to go?

59
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,450
I think the definition of defeat in the
culture war is that it's imperceptible

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,050
that you're,

61
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,050
you're aware of it a little bit each
year because in a typical department each

62
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,660
year somebody retires or dies.
Uh,

63
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,120
but they're always replaced
with somebody working on that.

64
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:08,130
Say for the sake of argument,
gender history. So you,

65
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:10,350
your colleague was,
uh,

66
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,560
was lecturing on the history of
the Soviet Union. Richard Pipes,

67
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,820
who was at Harvard and uh,
and just lately died,

68
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:22,900
one of the great historians
of the Bolshevik revolution.

69
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,660
You don't ever see someone like that
replaced with somebody like him.

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,900
There'll always be replaced by
somebody working on gender history,

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
native American history,
that,

72
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,170
that process whereby there was no
replacement of conservative historians,

73
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,690
was a more or less annual events.

74
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,250
I got accustomed to
being in a real minority,

75
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:50,740
a minority of conservative,
uh, historians.

76
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,310
I got accustomed to losing
pretty much every vote.

77
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,900
Being in the minority on every committee.
It became a kind of,

78
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,970
you've got to climatize to it,

79
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:05,971
and then one day suddenly hit you that
you were practically the last one left.

80
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,080
Uh, and you know, when
I moved to Stanford, the
revelation was quite startling.

81
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,650
I was invited to come to
the Hoover institution.

82
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,980
Many Hoover fellows serve associations,
uh,

83
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,590
joint appointments with
Stanford departments.

84
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,260
I had been pretty successful
as a teacher at Harvard.

85
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,510
My classes had been very large.
Uh,

86
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,560
the students gave me very
powerful evaluations. Uh,

87
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,010
I kind of assumed that I would come to
Stanford and have some relationship with

88
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:37,270
the history department. And then I
was told, oh, no, no, none at all,

89
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,070
not even a courtesy appointment.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And it was clear that that moment that
I had become in the eyes of the Stanford

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
History Department, a
pariah, somebody who,

92
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,890
who simply couldn't be allowed
in the building because of my,

93
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,660
my conservative leanings.

94
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,440
Can you explain little bit more about how
the universities work like that, that,

95
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,510
that could even happen? They're going to,
they're going to bring you in. You're,

96
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:06,740
you're a fellow there and that you're
just going to be ignored by the department

97
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,470
that you're an expert in.
It's quite insulting,

98
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,970
especially as you've mentioned.
Uh,

99
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,900
as I've published all there are lots of
boutiques. Yeah. Find rather more than,

100
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,870
than most of the department put together.

101
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,380
And I think,
uh,

102
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,570
a department with falling enrollments
might have been expected to,

103
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,530
to want to have a me playing apart.

104
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,090
But what happened is,

105
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,150
and it's happened in most departments
and most universities inexorably the left

106
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:44,420
to Kovar and an implicit rule,

107
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,460
a tacit rule was,
uh,

108
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,080
impose that one does not hire
right leaning, uh, historians,

109
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,280
nor does one hire. They're
graduate students so that they too,

110
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,330
people who have been my graduate
students have found it difficult, uh,

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,020
to get hired.
So it's essentially a straightforward,

112
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,160
a process whereby the institution has
taken over one committee at a time and the

113
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:12,410
left has been good at that for the
better part of a century. They've all,

114
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,700
how do you think they saw that? How did
they have the foresight to go, all right,

115
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,430
we've got to take over
the university's first.

116
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,120
I think that on the right,
uh,

117
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,910
the previous generation of historians,

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,930
and this was also true of philosophers
and people working in other fields,

119
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,770
did not fight very hard,
uh,

120
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,990
or effectively to promote their
successes in academic life.

121
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:41,120
You need to be mindful of the succession.

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,420
The left was better at
ensuring that it's Pratap.

123
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:51,020
Jay's got the appointments. Ultimately,
academia is a committee's game.

124
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,880
It's all about getting to be the chair
of the department to be in charge of the

125
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:59,270
committees. If you control the
process, you control the selection,

126
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,720
you control the recruitment.
And I suppose I'm,

127
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,490
I'm such a naive person.

128
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,520
I kind of in my youth assumed we were an
abroadly meritocratic world in which if

129
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,100
you were smart and hardworking,

130
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,330
then then good things would would happen
and it took me off for your, yeah,

131
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,700
I was completely naive.

132
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:23,990
It took me a while to cottoned
onto the fact that in in reality,

133
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,480
in academic life as another walks of
life patronages everything and you can be

134
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,400
as talented as you like if you're
not in the right patronage network,

135
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,780
then you're done. And I suppose it's
been thinking about these issues,

136
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:43,781
how do networks capture institutions
that that led me to write the most recent

137
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:44,900
book,
the square and the tower,

138
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:49,901
which is actually book number 15 to try
to think about how networks operate.

139
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,080
We tend to talk casually about networks,

140
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,340
but I came to realize that in academic
life has another areas you need to

141
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:04,341
understand quite exactly quite precisely
how networks operate to see how power

142
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:05,850
is truly wielded.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,560
We can all see the hierarchical
institutions that are
where power is located.

144
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,700
I mean, universities are clearly
not as powerful as as governments,

145
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,390
but the critical point is
to understand the disease.

146
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,420
Often networks that capture institutions,
the capture, the hierarchies,

147
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,740
and that's what happened in academic life.

148
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,980
And now I think pretty soon they're just
won't be conservatives in university

149
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,150
departments.
More importantly than that,

150
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,010
nobody will be teaching subjects
like the history of the Soviet Union.

151
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,130
So no students will be taught about the
crimes of Lenin and Stalin and students.

152
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:47,361
Like the students I taught yesterday will
not hear from anybody that there was a

153
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,480
religious motivation
to the nine 11 attacks.

154
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,080
I had a class at Stanford yesterday and
was allowed to sit in and teach somebody

155
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,270
else's class as a guest professor.

156
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,310
And it happened to be a
discussion about nine 11. Uh,

157
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,090
and it became clear to me
that the students had never
considered the possibility

158
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,190
that there was a religious motivation,
uh,

159
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,430
to the nine 11 attacks.
Uh,

160
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,800
and more or less accepted the idea that
they were retaliation for the misdeeds

161
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,940
of US foreign policy in the Middle East,
what are called the Howard Zinn theory.

162
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,170
And since Howard Zinn's books are more
widely read in the United States than

163
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,090
anybody else's history books,

164
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,720
we therefore arrive at a situation in
which there will be nobody in any measure

165
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:40,620
university saying,

166
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,360
actually Howard Zinn is completely wrong
and this is not what nine 11 was about.

167
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,430
So that's what I find depressing when I
say that the culture was kind of over in

168
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,900
the universities.
That's really what I mean.

169
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,610
Yeah. So let's circle back because
it does bring us to your 15th work.

170
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:00,750
I stand corrected. Um, this
I this idea of networks,

171
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:04,230
because we were talking right before
we started that there is something

172
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:09,231
happening here with this loose association
of people that has been coined the

173
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:12,540
intellectual dark web.
And I said to you when you walked in,

174
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,240
are you part of the intellectual dark
web as if you were going to give me a

175
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:20,130
secret handshake or a special card or
when I was, I denied all knowledge.

176
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,750
Yeah.

177
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,210
The assumption that it was secret and
then it turned out to be all over the New

178
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,290
York Times. Yeah, but are you weren't,

179
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,650
you weren't photographed in
the bushes like the rest of us,

180
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:32,880
but I suspect that you secretly are
in the intellectual dark web. Well,

181
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:35,670
I couldn't possibly reveal
that because it's secret.

182
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,830
But when you said something
interesting about,

183
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,860
because of your level of academic sort
of academic credit that you thought

184
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,420
perhaps that took you out of it.

185
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,850
But then Christina Hoff Summers
said something interesting.

186
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,530
I don't know who goes in there,
what

187
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,950
Barry was emailed me on,
my wife Ayaan Hirsi Ali,

188
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:57,610
who's been on your show is much more
interesting than me is the greatest.

189
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:00,370
And I mean, we, she must be
tough for you because, you know,

190
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,920
it's like the millions of people
love your work and everything else,

191
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:06,590
but it's like ion is like transcended.
She's wonderful. It's tough.

192
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,620
It's the most enormous,

193
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,730
wonderful blessing in my life to be
married to somebody who's just way more

194
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,480
interesting than me. At best
they're looking to. So that,

195
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,740
so we were both asked by Barry, uh,
why supplant the intellectual dark web?

196
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,910
And I said, look, how can I
really claim to be part of that?

197
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,250
When I taught for 12 years at Harvard,

198
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:31,990
left of my own volition and here at
Stanford can write newspaper columns and

199
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:34,930
have them published more or
less where I want it would,

200
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,170
it would be a little disingenuous to
claim kinship with people like Bret

201
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,280
Weinstein who've been persecuted by the
academic left. Now I've been attacked.

202
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:48,250
I've been criticized, but I haven't
really been driven underground,

203
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:52,740
at least not at this point. But
Christina's summers said to me, uh,

204
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,640
just the other night.
No,

205
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:58,750
it's not about whether you've been
denied a platform or not. Clearly,

206
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,640
almost all the people in the article
that Barry wrote have plenty of

207
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:06,190
opportunities to make their views known.

208
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,520
It's about whether you are seen to speak
for people who feel that they have been

209
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,190
silenced, who feel that their
voices aren't heard night.

210
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,470
That's quite a good definition
of what this is about,

211
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,390
but you're also right to see that it's
a network. As I was reading the article,

212
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:24,970
I was thinking how funny
I know all these people.

213
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,350
I'm the sole exception of Jordan
Peterson who I've never met. Um,

214
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,910
I sent that's coming. Well, yeah, I
hope so. I look forward to it. Um,

215
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,480
but I, I, I think it's a
network of the most, uh,

216
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,190
ideal sought.

217
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,280
It is a truly informal network of
people from right across the political

218
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,180
spectrum because nobody could call Bret
Weinstein are conservatives who have

219
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:53,080
come together spontaneously,
informally.

220
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,000
Nobody called it into being and said,
I'm forming the intellectual dark web,

221
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,420
turn up on Monday at 5:00
PM and I does it change?

222
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:04,000
Does it change the second it's name?
Generally a network.

223
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,950
So if this is the right type of network,
right,

224
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:09,910
it's cool kind of diverse group of
people who had all sorts of different

225
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,940
motivations and everything else.
Once it's sort of named,

226
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,450
does that change the way a network
has to operate? Cause I sent,

227
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:19,600
that's what the discussion is
about right now, although not, not.

228
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:23,320
I think fundamentally that the critical
thing is when something ceases to be

229
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,620
secret.
I tell the story of the Illuminati,

230
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,800
a network in the late 18th century in
Germany that sought to advance a radical

231
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:37,460
version of the enlightenment but
covertly as a secret organization. Uh,

232
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,770
the intellectual dark web,
um,

233
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,890
I semi seriously said was secrets until
Barry wrote that and now that it's out

234
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:48,070
in the,
in the open,

235
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:51,740
what will happen is that it will grow
because people are Andrew Sullivan.

236
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,800
I was discussing with him to a
said, hmm, why am I [inaudible]?

237
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,300
And of course the answer is, but you
should be ready. I mean, anybody who,

238
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,540
who is engaged in critical thinking
about the whole range of ideas,

239
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,100
uh, in our society ranging from the
political to the social and cultural,

240
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:15,101
anybody who is in the debate and is
antagonistic to the dogmas of the left,

241
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,860
uh, the political correctness,
the identity politics,

242
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,300
the spurious pursuit of so called
social justice. If you are skeptical,

243
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,750
if you are thinking critically
about the dogmas of the left,

244
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,460
then you belong in the intellectual dark
web because you're the kind of person

245
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,350
who at some point will be no platformed,
who at some point will be taken down.

246
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,800
Who at some point will be the target
of a hit piece in the New York Times.

247
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,910
One of the characteristic features of
the intellectual dark whereby think is

248
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:51,911
that most members at one time or another
have fallen foul of the leftist thought

249
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,940
police.
And as soon as you've had that experience,

250
00:15:55,941 --> 00:16:00,440
it's happened to me a number of times.
That is quite transformative. Yeah,

251
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,120
I mean it literally changed my life.

252
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:05,670
It's the only reason you're sitting here
right now. I was once one of them and,

253
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,210
and I suspect that your
experience was like mine.

254
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,140
You're kind of taken aback to be on the
receiving end of a social media mob.

255
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,340
You're kind of taken aback to be attacked,

256
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,670
not for the substance of anything
that you've argued or written or said.

257
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,800
You're attacked for your reputation,

258
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,370
you're attacked for
your alleged bad faith.

259
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,290
And each time this has happened to
me, I've, I've been a little stunned.

260
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,540
I was naive.
Not only was I a believer in meritocracy,

261
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,990
I was also a believer that we were engaged
in irrational debate about the past.

262
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,310
That's what historians do.
Uh,

263
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,820
and that one made ones case
presented the evidence.

264
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,570
And then the other side did the same.
But I wrote a book,

265
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,910
a book about the British Empire.
Now what, 15 or so years ago,

266
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,313
an argument,

267
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,530
their argument of that book was that not
everything about the British empire was

268
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:10,580
bad than there are benefits as
well as costs to imperialism.

269
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,870
And I never had a debate
about that argument.

270
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,110
I only ever was attacked by the left
for being an apologist of empire,

271
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,610
a neocolonialist, et cetera. Uh,

272
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,720
and so in that curious debate that
that is central to the cultural war,

273
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,260
you never really are engaged with
on the ideas or the evidence.

274
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,170
It is always about whether
you have bad faith or not,

275
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,320
whether you are covertly
racist and Islamophobe,

276
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,860
uh, our homophobe that there's a long
list of things that you can be accused of.

277
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,670
But those are the most popular ones.

278
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,840
Ones never really discussing
the arguments of the books.

279
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,300
One's always discussing the
personality of the author. Yeah.

280
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,180
So this is just sort of simply put the
ideas verse people conversation. Right.

281
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:06,300
So in a, in a case of a violin, I mean,

282
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,890
to live through the things that she has
lived through between FTM and her and

283
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:14,460
her and her friend being
murdered and the whole thing, uh,

284
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,710
to be called the things that she's called.
I mean,

285
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:21,300
it flips you're very personhood
on its head, which is,

286
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,300
I mean, it's, it's so deeply twisted.

287
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,170
The episode for me brought it
into bold relief was the Brandeis,

288
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,900
uh,

289
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,790
honorary degree fiasco when ion was
invited by the president of Brandeis.

290
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:40,200
And this was in 2014. Yeah. Except an
honorary degree in speak at commencement.

291
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:41,280
And then,
uh,

292
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,310
was very publicly and humiliatingly
disinvited under pressure from an unholy

293
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:51,951
alliance as far as I could see of leftists
and Islamists who set out online to

294
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:58,580
smear her reputation with the usual
confection of selective quotation and,

295
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,610
and misrepresentation.
And as often happens in these situations,

296
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:06,890
the university authorities
capitulate without a fight, uh,

297
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,880
to the left and, and they do it
publicly. And that that for me was,

298
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:12,270
uh,

299
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,950
that was a moment when I learned a lot
about what was going wrong in American

300
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:20,250
academic life and realize that it's,
it's the combination of,

301
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,820
of aggressive activists on the left,
um,

302
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,470
and useful idiots in, in university
bureaucracies [inaudible] fold.

303
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,260
Is it that they're useful
idiots or is it just,

304
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:34,470
is it just sort of blanket cowardice by,

305
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,040
I'm part of some of the academics,
but really the,

306
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,020
the administrators and the upper brass
at all the schools and the fact that the

307
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,860
donors, although this is changing right
now and as we're taping this today,

308
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,990
I know it's going to be out
in a couple of days. Um,

309
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,420
evergreen is now firing a
whole bunch of professors,

310
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:53,730
which is exactly whatever
what all of us predicted,

311
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:58,440
basically because the donors have
just had enough. It's fascinating.

312
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,570
So it's hard to figure out where
does it come? Just cowardice.

313
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,870
Cowardice is the most powerful
force in human history, no doubt.

314
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,960
And I'm constantly amazed at just
how much cowardice is out there.

315
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,360
Uh, my wife's experience has
shown me that the, the, the,

316
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,030
the difficulty of getting people publicly
to support her work against Islamic

317
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:20,850
extremism is all about cowardice,

318
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,770
fear of being in any way drawn
into, into the, the real war,

319
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,390
the Jihad, uh, facing the death threats
that she has repeatedly had to face.

320
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:33,960
But it's not just cowardice. Uh,
there is a good deal of complicity.

321
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,790
Many university administrators
are themselves ideologically
on the left and feel

322
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:42,330
that they have a mission
to empower, uh, the,

323
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,040
the leftists in the
student body. Uh, and this,

324
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,030
I think a different thing
from, from Canada. So yeah,

325
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:52,810
I think,

326
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,810
I think this is a fascinating
moment in time because donors,

327
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,570
alumni look at what is going
on, uh, on university campuses,

328
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,080
as do people who have not had the
privilege of university education,

329
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:11,380
who see it all as complete
madness and ask the question,

330
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:15,400
what the hell is going on here? And I
think the more that question gets asked,

331
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:16,234
the better.

332
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,410
But we should not underestimate
the massive inertia in the system.

333
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,740
It is extremely hard. Even if you're a
university president, you say, right,

334
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,520
I'm going to clean house. It's really
hard to do because they're all tenured.

335
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,450
I mean, the faculty is tenured, it's
everywhere. You know what I mean?

336
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,920
Like we don't find, oh well, you know,

337
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:35,260
in the northeast it's a little
bit better than, you know,

338
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,660
just even geographically, we
just don't even see that. Yes,

339
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:41,470
there are bastions of freedom. I've
heard University of Chicago or you know,

340
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:43,270
like a couple of places
are a little bit better,

341
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:45,580
but how do you think it
actually spread that way?

342
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,660
That it wasn't just here and there and
there's a theory that universities are

343
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:52,870
always left wing, but that's
not true of, for example,

344
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:56,230
if you had been in Germany in the 1920s,
uh,

345
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,190
the universities were
bastions of conservatism, uh,

346
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,040
an extreme and indeed extreme
right wing nationalism,

347
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:07,300
which is one reason that universities
very quickly went over to the Nazi regime

348
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:08,440
when Hitler came to power.

349
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,790
So there's no golden rule
that says universities have
to be left wing Oxford and

350
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:17,020
Cambridge, ah, in the 18th century
works extraordinary reactionary,

351
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,040
uh, fundamentally religious institutions
and deeply Tory with a few exceptions in

352
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:26,480
there in the politics. So
there's no rule rule here. Uh,

353
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,680
I think the best explanation I can
offer you is a process of generational

354
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:37,411
capture of education institutions dating
from the 1960s universities in let's

355
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:43,180
take the elite universities,
the Ivy League universities in the 1950s.

356
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:47,240
We're already seen as being liberal.
Um,

357
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,320
and if you were a kind of
McCarthy leaning Republican,

358
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,340
you already knew that Harvard was
likely full of fellow travelers,

359
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,100
um,
and a covert commies.

360
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,710
But the real shift I think came later.

361
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,030
I think it came with the antiwar
protests of the late sixties and early

362
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,510
seventies.

363
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,510
The more radical baby boomers who were
protesting in the campuses and 68 s into

364
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:13,960
the early seventies,
uh,

365
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:18,840
grew up to become professors
nested around. Uh,

366
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,440
and I think that generation,

367
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,120
which was essentially formed at
the time of the antiwar protests,

368
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,140
successfully replicated itself.
They were very,

369
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:34,141
very good at replicating themselves by
creating graduate students in their own

370
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,700
image and then making
sure that those graduates,

371
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:40,900
students got jobs and the
right was nowhere. So you are,

372
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:45,650
you are out there writing books,
doing research and figuring, well,

373
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,390
all right,
they're doing that.

374
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:51,670
And maybe in the long run on my
heroes at Oxford and Cambridge who,

375
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,760
who wrote great books and
we're also politically active
people like Norman stone

376
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:01,280
or Roger Scruton who did
much of the thinking that uh,

377
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,910
that accompanied that
tourism in the 1980s.

378
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,550
What they did not do well was academic
politics. They were poor at that. Uh,

379
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,400
they were poor at succession planning.
And that is,

380
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:16,580
I think the best explanation I can
offer for the fact that in nearly all

381
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,920
universities in North
America and in Europe,

382
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,190
90% plus of faculty members are
Liberals or progressives if not outright

383
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:26,420
Marxists.
All right.

384
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:29,630
So with some of the historical
context of how this all happened,

385
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,010
I know you are enthused about this new
network idea and because it's come around

386
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,083
the right way,

387
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,530
do you think there's a gatekeeping
responsibility for whoever is involved in

388
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:39,741
this?

389
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:44,741
This seems to be one of the hot button
issues with this thing are who can be in

390
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:50,150
this whatever it is. What are the
ideas that cannot be on the inside? Uh,

391
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,730
I see it coming much more than that.

392
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,220
We have to watch out for ideas
on the right than on the left.

393
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:59,360
That seems to be the way it's being
framed, at least from where I sit. Um,

394
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,810
how would you do that in a, in a proper
network monitoring out two kinds of,

395
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,200
of of networks,
open access networks.

396
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,360
Let's take the example of Facebook
where you can just join up and open a

397
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:15,650
Facebook account. You can even
do it as a fake human being. Um,

398
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,500
and then there are the
restricted access networks, uh,

399
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,750
extreme cases. The
secret societies of, uh,

400
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,380
of the 18th and 19th century don't
really have many analogs today cause it's

401
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:31,120
hard to do anything secret in secrecy,
barely exists any,

402
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,800
any more in the age of,
of wikileaks.

403
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,600
So you have to I think decide whether
to be an open or closed or restricted

404
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:41,960
access network and the minute you
are restricted access network,

405
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,390
somebody is making the decisions about
who joins that then ends up being the,

406
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,510
the membership committee and then
you were just a club. Really.

407
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,660
I don't think that's an option in,
in our time.

408
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,070
I think an open access networks,
the only real way to go, um,

409
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,960
and you must accept that if the, uh, if
the intellectual dot Webb is, is real,

410
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,230
that it's an open access network that
won't necessarily connect you to everybody

411
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,530
that you want to be connected to and
may connect you to people that you

412
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,570
positively don't want to be connected to.

413
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,100
This has been a central
problem I think of, uh,

414
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,950
being on the political
right for a long time.

415
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,990
I can remember in the 1980s when
people said to me, well, Neil,

416
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,720
you're a conservative.
And I would say, well,

417
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,090
I'm actually not a member
of the Conservative Party.

418
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,840
I think of myself as a classical liberal.
They would say, oh, but nevertheless,

419
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:38,630
when I look at all the things you say,
you're a conservative.

420
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,220
And then I would think,
what does that mean?

421
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:43,130
That I have to have
dinner with the likes of,

422
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,430
I would think of various egregious
conservative members of parliament. Um,

423
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,990
and it was as if you would be associated
with those people even if you never had

424
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,560
dinner with them. And it's the same
problem now except that it's, it's,

425
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:00,910
it's worse now because the way in
which the left seeks to discredit it,

426
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,800
uh,

427
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,490
you and Jordan Peterson and probably
me as well at another number,

428
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,400
your show is to say scared man.
I mean 15 blinds say,

429
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,180
look at the People Paul,

430
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,340
who are connected to these people who
quote these people or who read their

431
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,460
books, um, that there they are over there,

432
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:26,030
but terrible alt right. And you
know, when you say, all right, the,

433
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,510
the audience is supposed to start
booing and hissing and you know,

434
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,080
Steve Bannon is supposed to appear in
a black robe with the Saife, you know,

435
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,950
I am deaf.

436
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,810
So I think that the problem is I think
in escapable there will be a constant

437
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:43,810
effort on the left to say that uh,

438
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,820
the intellectual dark web is just
some kind of a facade in front of an,

439
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,620
a hideous outright,

440
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,540
which is composed of remember
racists Islamophobes homophobes.

441
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,350
Um, and that will be the
culture wars next. Yeah,

442
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,500
I mean that was straight works.

443
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:03,820
We have a strange amount of gay people
and Muslim people and yeah, absolutely.

444
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,440
But there you go. Otherwise Brown people
in every other type of thing is self,

445
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,310
the self hating phenomenon.
The left is low, long

446
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:16,110
known. How to say that it is
absolutely typical of the wicked,

447
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,490
right? That they should have
lewd into that to the side,

448
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,690
uh, self hating and then you just fill
in the blank. Self hating Muslims,

449
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:27,480
self hating gays.
That's how this works.

450
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,030
You remember they lost all the arguments.

451
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,380
All they've got left is
reputational smearing man.

452
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,390
We've got to fight in front of us. Huh.
You know, I, I have lost sleep about this.

453
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:44,220
Not only because people
threatened my wife's life.

454
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:49,221
That's the real war that the war
against the Islamic extremists is no,

455
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,100
is no mere culture wards and actual war.

456
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,560
I've also lost sleep about the Maya
culture war at the prospect of,

457
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,770
of the reputational attacks.
It's,

458
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:07,250
it's never pleasant to be
attacked as I was recently,

459
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,450
uh, in effect for being
a, I guess a sexist,

460
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,890
racist or a racist sexist,

461
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:17,080
because I'd organize a conference
at which all the speakers, uh,

462
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,470
where white men,

463
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,710
because the women I invited
couldn't come. And, uh,

464
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,410
that was a private conference,
wasn't supposed to.

465
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:33,210
It wasn't even as a kind of
informal discussion about
how we could take the idea

466
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:38,211
of applied history and make history more
relevant to some of the debates that go

467
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,640
on. I think a lot of what has done in
academic history these days is not really

468
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:44,110
relevant to anything terribly much,

469
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:50,010
but this event was a rather crudely
exposed in the New York Times and the

470
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:52,360
Washington Post,
uh,

471
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,810
the pictures of the speakers
were published as if the
mugshots as it appeared in

472
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:04,270
the New York Times. And the implication
was that I must be a terrible racist,

473
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:07,510
sexist, or sexist racist for
having organized such a conference.

474
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,560
I did lose sleep about that. Uh, and I,

475
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:17,950
I think that part of the
culture war is really,

476
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,290
is really odious because it is,

477
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,350
it is calculated to discredit
the targeted individuals.

478
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,570
And it is,

479
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,760
it's bad faith on the part of the
people who launched those attacks.

480
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,900
So what,
in my view,

481
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,370
what's happening with some of those gated
institutions when the newspapers that

482
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:42,030
used to be objective, you know, look,

483
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,340
Barry wrote this piece in the New York
Times that I think was a pretty fair

484
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:48,190
piece. It was even somewhat critical
of me, and I'm not above criticism,

485
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:51,010
so I'm certainly okay with that.
But then just a week later,

486
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:55,930
we see this awful piece about Jordan
and enforced monogamy and it's just

487
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:57,970
nonsense. I mean, it's just
nonsense. And you know,

488
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm on tour with him right now and he
keeps explaining why that's course he

489
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:03,700
doesn't want anyone to be forced
to do anything and all that.

490
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,510
He's talking about marriage in
effect. Um, and, and Eric Weinstein,

491
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:11,440
our friend found two other references in
the history of the New York Times where

492
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:14,380
they talked about enforcement argument
and they were both positive relative to

493
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:17,590
progressive ideals. So it's like
they flip everything on its head.

494
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:18,910
But what do you think happened there?
I mean,

495
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:22,480
you're giving me a pretty good layout
of what's happened at the academic side,

496
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,010
but on the media side and those,
those gates, what is going on?

497
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,920
I spent a lot of my life doing
journalism because, um, I didn't have,

498
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,560
uh, any, uh, inherited money.

499
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:38,700
And being an academic in Britain in
the 1980s and nineties wasn't terribly

500
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,670
lucrative.
So I kept body and soul together.

501
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,150
Even from my graduate years writing for
newspapers and newspapers have had their

502
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:53,751
own transformation in the
course of my adult life.

503
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,680
Uh, and part of that sister economics,
as we all know, the business model,

504
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:01,950
which essentially revolved around
advertising has been an isolated by the

505
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:03,570
combination of Google and Facebook.

506
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,910
And these institutions are in some measure
in in desperation trying to reinvent

507
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:13,911
themselves for the Internet age and
everybody's in pursuit of clickbait,

508
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,930
even the gray lady, even the most
illustrious of, of newspapers.

509
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:21,180
And I think that's one explanation.

510
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,130
The other explanation is
that an institution like the
New York Times has its own

511
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,270
university, like character behaves
a little bit like university,

512
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,380
but the most self important newspapers
if you go to them are rather like

513
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,000
colleges.
And it's also true of the Financial Times,

514
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,560
which is that like a kind of Cambridge
college that sort of ended up by mistake

515
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:47,540
in London. And so they have some of
the same dynamics as, as universities.

516
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,470
And I think that's especially true of the
New York Times is also true of the BBC

517
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:55,410
incidentally. So institutions
like the times and the BBC, uh,

518
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,990
think of themselves as
being liberal bastions.

519
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,700
But for them, liberalism is truth. Uh,
it's the same problem at Harvard has,

520
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:09,530
if you've, if your motto is Veritas,
but you translate that into liberalism,

521
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,740
then by definition conservatives
and must be untruth.

522
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,790
And so I think there's a tendency and
it's there and in the New York Times

523
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,150
periodically to lash out against anyone
like Jordan Peterson who dissents from

524
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,020
liberal orthodoxy.
Remember,

525
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:29,120
part of what we're dealing here with is
a kind of quasar religious phenomenon.

526
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,660
The dogmas of the left have become more
and more religious in their quality as

527
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:41,411
they have been unmuted from that
fundamental economic rationality,

528
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:46,460
which was at the heart of Marxism,
when that all went down in flames in 1989,

529
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:48,860
the left decamped to the realm of culture.

530
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,130
And as it did that increasingly
to con the form of a cult.

531
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,250
And let me illustrate what I mean.

532
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,730
Cults define themselves partly by a belief
in a lot of things that are slightly

533
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:04,520
weird. In order to be in a cult,
you have to have some weird beliefs.

534
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,140
And one good example of a weird belief
is that sexuality is entirely constructed

535
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:13,790
socially and is not biologically rooted
and you can actually have any gender you

536
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:17,600
like and there are actually
multiple genders. Now that's absurd,

537
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,260
but to believe it has become a kind of
tests of your orthodoxy and on one sees

538
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:32,021
this at meetings are in academia in
which people introduce themselves by name

539
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,310
and by their preferred pronouns.
Now, when this first happened to me,

540
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:40,880
my immediate reaction was introduced
myself and say that my preferred pronouns

541
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:41,714
were it.

542
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,540
I restrain myself because I realized that
my sense of humor forged as it was in

543
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:51,380
Scotland in the 1970s is now almost
entirely politically incorrect.

544
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,830
And anything that I consider funny,
we'll get me into trouble.

545
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,530
But that has gone on in the media too.

546
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,620
And the other thing that's happened is
that the polarization which characterizes

547
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:07,901
a network society is now very visibly
there in the realm of newspapers and and

548
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,520
cable television.

549
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,660
One thing that we all got wrong about
the internet because we hadn't really

550
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:18,590
thought much about network science was
that we just assumed that if everybody

551
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:20,570
was connected,
everything would be awesome.

552
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,630
And that was the kind of mantra of
Silicon Valley for about 20 years.

553
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,130
But no network science tells you
that if you build a social network,

554
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,420
even quite a small one,

555
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,800
there will be something called homophily
because birds of a feather flock

556
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:38,801
together on bet you already
that the intellectual dark
web has two clusters that

557
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,460
are somewhat separate from one another.

558
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,030
I sent it happening right now immediately
and that's what happened in the media.

559
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,710
So as society became more
polarized politically,

560
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:52,330
so too did the media,
I think that's an,

561
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,480
that is one of the defining
characteristics of our age
that the polarization or

562
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:02,250
if you like self segregation that we see
online is translated into almost every

563
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:06,990
realm of life. Can there be any positives
out of that, out of that self selection

564
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,910
into finding groups that you're more
in common with that for at least for a

565
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:12,260
certain period of time?

566
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:16,400
There's some goodness there because you
can really sort of get into your ideas

567
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:19,820
enough to maybe leave the group
then and take those ideas out.

568
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,930
I think if you are in what
ever you want to call it,

569
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,400
the echo chamber or the filter bubble,

570
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:30,401
if you are in a cluster that cuts you
off from a contrary ideas you're lost.

571
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah.

572
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,990
What was fun about being in a network
of right leaning undergraduates in early

573
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:44,020
1980s Oxford was we're in constant
combat with the left-leaning Marxist.

574
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:49,870
There was still real Marxist is
then and we were far from cutoff,

575
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,660
constantly engaging with them and the
soggies Social Democrats in in the middle

576
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,650
and that was what made it interesting.

577
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,250
What I see happening in the networked
age is that people can retreat into a

578
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,510
realm of confirmation bias where they
hear only things that are similar to the

579
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:13,430
things they liked yesterday and the
algorithms are the key here where you are,

580
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,920
whether it's youtube or
on Facebook or on Twitter,

581
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:19,760
you are essentially going to be
fed more of what you already liked.

582
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,490
That's deeply intellectually unhealthy.

583
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,400
Just as a university
cannot be a university.

584
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:29,900
If everybody agrees about
first ideological principles
because how can you have

585
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:31,550
critical thinking in that environment?

586
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,440
So it's unhealthy for any
intellectual network to be Autarkic.

587
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,620
So the one thing the intellectual dark
web must not do is cut itself off from

588
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,690
other networks, including the
ones that hate us. I mean,

589
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:51,290
we have to be in an argument and we have
to have our minds constantly open to

590
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,840
the possibility that we're
wrong about some things.

591
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,260
And that's what I see more or less
disappearing from public life.

592
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,070
I recognize this at one
time, uh, when I was in, in,

593
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,440
in mortal combat with Paul
Krugman, the economist, uh,

594
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,930
turn journalists and realize that Koopman
could never admit that he'd ever been

595
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:11,300
wrong. And even when it was
obvious that he had been,

596
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,270
because he is part of this rezone,

597
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,320
Dettra was always being right
about everything. Did you have

598
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,590
to see the day that the article came out,

599
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:22,320
the original intellectual
dark web article by Barry?

600
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:25,650
The day that that came out that Paul
Krugman tweeted it and he tweeted this

601
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:29,070
thing about how we're also oppressed, you
know, just mocking everybody basically.

602
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,460
And then a bunch of us responded
to them and I of course,

603
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:35,890
retweeted it and invited him on the show.
I said, I'd be happy to discuss this,

604
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:39,340
you, and it gets a couple
of thousand retweets, but of
course, no response. Right.

605
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,910
And that you're right. That's what
we have to make sure we don't become.

606
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,700
But I think there's a,
uh,

607
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,480
there's a human trait that would sort
of make you want to retreat because it's

608
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:54,481
exhausting it having your motives attack
than your humanity attacked and lies

609
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:58,810
and smears and all the things that I
don't see anyone on this side doing.

610
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,123
I don't,

611
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,910
and that's an so it's an exhausting
fight because we're fading to different

612
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,980
battles. Yes. I'm supposedly the same
point. And they're symmetrical war. Yeah.

613
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,350
The moment in the sense that we haven't
recognized that in the culture war.

614
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,030
The only thing that works is
reputational destruction. I think we,

615
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,610
we are guaranteed sleepless nights.
Remember,

616
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:22,820
there's also the phenomenon of
guilty until proven innocent,

617
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,070
which is insidious and means that if
the reputational hit is bad enough,

618
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,960
uh, there may be no, uh, there
may be no recovery from it.

619
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,260
I was very struck by the speed with
which reputations were destroyed. Uh,

620
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,940
in the, the me two
movements, uh, most, uh,

621
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,270
very indolent phase.
Uh,

622
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:50,350
and a characteristic feature of the
process seemed to be that that men were

623
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:55,471
essentially guilty until proven
innocent and crimes were conflated with,

624
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,260
uh,

625
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:02,260
quite clearly non criminal behavior
in ways that were deeply troubling.

626
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,430
Uh, to my eyes, the false
accusation is of course the,

627
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,800
the ultimate nightmare of anybody
in this world at this time.

628
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,280
Because if you're falsely
accused, uh, well,

629
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:21,281
your reputation can be gone in 24
hours and that that has entered,

630
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,680
introduced into our lives something that
hasn't really existed since medieval

631
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:28,300
times.
Uh,

632
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,200
the feeling that we are at the mercy of
a wheel of fortune that can arbitrarily

633
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:37,400
turn against us and
dashes are over Turner's.

634
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,290
I think this makes the
culture war, uh, uh,

635
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:46,550
deeply troubling thing to be a part of.
And Mo,

636
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,230
most sensible, normal people say, God,

637
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,700
I want a quiet life.
Get me out of here. Uh,

638
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,000
and never involve me in any of this.

639
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,750
Get me off Twitter.
Get me off Facebook.

640
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,380
Never let my name appear
in the New York Times.

641
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,900
Never let me appear on a,

642
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,290
on a show like this because
it's just too dangerous. Uh,

643
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,410
I own need to say one thing that can be
taken out of context and represented as

644
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:21,650
heresy or hate speech
as heresy is now called,

645
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:23,630
cause that's what we now call heresy.

646
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,960
And I will be subjected to potentially
a weeks of vilification and maybe worse,

647
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,460
maybe the vilification will actually lead
me to lose my job at people are right

648
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:35,780
to be fearful of that.
