00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.420
Now we have "Melody Time," which is so similar to "Make Mine Music" that actually, I'm sort of wondering why they didn't just call it "Make Mine Music 2."

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.260
I mean, it's almost identical.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.460
Different variations of songs, most of them modern, sung by modern singers, a little bit of poetry thrown in, and even some straightforward stories.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.420
It's pretty much the exact same thing.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.120
And just like "Make Mine Music," this one works pretty good, too.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.380
You do have your straightforward narratives, some of them more forgettable than others,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.960
but you also have your selections of straightforward music, and you know, sometimes even straightforward poetry.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.820
The "Poem As Lovely As a Tree" [inaudible] is especially nice.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.520
It's just the Disney animators drawing what they hear as the poem is read,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.960
with some nice soothing music thrown over it.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.300
It works pretty well.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.900
There's also a really cool section called "Bumble Boogie," which reminds me a lot of the "Pink Elephant" sequence.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.160
It's just a bee flying around to a whacked-out version of "Flight of the Bumblebee" as the music is literally trying to destroy him.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.460
It's really chaotic, at least with some fun imagery.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.800
- [trumpets blare in tune with lively music]

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.880
- [piano playing]

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.140
- [trumpets come in while piano crescendos]

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
-The one that probably stands out the most is the "Johnny Appleseed" one.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.980
When I was a kid, I really liked it.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.460
When I was a teenager, I got a little bit more cynical and started making fun of it.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.500
Now that I'm older, I actually find myself really liking it again.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.580
It's got some real heavy atmosphere, some real heavy visuals.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.340
And some of those backgrounds are just incredible.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.700
Yeah, it's still a little corny, and I do make fun of it sometimes, but it still holds up.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.160
It's the size and scope that they give something that seems so relatively simple, and yet they show that it took so much dedication.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.860
That image of the apple trees becoming the clouds, that's one of the most surreal things I've ever seen.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.480
I remember, it even stayed in my mind as a little kid, and it really, really is gripping.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.960
In fact, it's so good, it probably could have been its own movie.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.360
I'm sort of wondering why they tucked it away in here.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.160
- [singing] "The Lord is good to me, and so I thank the Lord

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.600
"For givin' me the things I need

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.780
"The sun and rain and an apple seed,
Yes, He's been good to me."

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.480
-Funny bit of trivia: when I was a little kid in Catholic school, they actually had this as the prayer we said before "Grace."

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.720
Isn't that weird.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.440
And they told us not to sing it, too.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.480
How is that possible?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.520
You can't say these words without singing it.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520
It can't be done.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.040
We did it anyway, and I'm sure God knew we were thankful for the grub.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.960
And then the last segment they end on is "Pecos Bill, sung through a lot of folk and country music.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.320
This is also fun, too, and really creative, but again, why did they end the film on this?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.620
I mean, it's funny, it's enjoyable, and it's catchy, but do--did you SEE the Appleseed one?

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.480
I mean, that was far superior!

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.320
"Pecos Bill" just ends on a--go--I don't even know what note; I'm not sure if it's sad, I'm not sure if it's happy,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.800
it's just--kind of odd.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.340
Like I said, I don't have a problem with it; I just don't know why they closed on it.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.000
But either way, "Melody Time" has some really good shorts in it, as well some good music and really great animation.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.260
The atmosphere is really heavy in this one.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.960
Again, maybe not "Fantasia"-heavy, but there are points where it hits that traditional Disney charm that only Disney can have.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.220
And they recreate it quite well here.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.060
"Melody Time is definitely one to check out.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.460
- [singing] "The Lord is good to me!"

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.840
- *vocalizing*
