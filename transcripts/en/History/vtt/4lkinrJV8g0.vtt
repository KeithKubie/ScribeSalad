00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.800
- The winner of Alone season 5:

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.630
Come on in, Sam.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.730
Say hello to your buddy, Britt.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.370
- Hey, Britt.
- Hey.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.170
Good to see you, man.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.470
Hug.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.470
It's been a minute.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.300
Yep.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.200
You look good, man.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.470
So what do you think?

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.200
Guys, you're buddies.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.270
It's OK.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.370
You know, we weren't sure.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.600
We wanted to make sure
how the relationship

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.300
is here, with you guys
battling it out to the end.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.630
It's actually pretty good.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.070
Our wives are close.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.670
Our families are planning
on getting closer.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.930
I'd like to meet his kids.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.470
He hasn't met my kids yet,
but our wives are buddies

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.530
and, you know, we actually
developed a relationship

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.230
throughout the course of this.
- That's really neat.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.400
Well, we were talking about
family and motivation,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.230
things like that, Sam, and--

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.500
similar, right?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.800
Because you both are dads,
and you're both husbands.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.000
I mean, you left when you
had a one week old at home.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.070
You already had a 2
and 1/2 year old son.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.970
Just how difficult was
that for you, with the pull

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.300
of family at home?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.200
It was extremely difficult.
But when it came down to it,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.070
I thought about them
when I was out there,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.730
and honestly, I was
thinking, you know,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
if I tap any minute now,
I'm going to go home,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.730
and they're going to say,
we're so proud of you.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.900
We're so happy that
you did what you did.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.530
And that's the kind of people
you want to try hard for.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.730
So that was my motivation
the entire time,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.200
and I know that was a huge part
of why Britt did so incredibly

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.300
well this season, as well.
- Yeah.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.270
There's no question about it.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.330
Did you have any
idea that maybe--

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.800
it would be you two
down at the end?

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.270
Did you have any thought
process of who else

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.600
was out there when
you were there?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.070
It's actually really weird,
because I was also thinking

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.230
about Britt the whole time.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.730
And we had had some good
talks before the show,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.170
and he just seemed so
motivated, and so ready

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.800
to take on the challenge that I
did actually expect it to be--

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.300
to be Britt, to a lot of--

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.530
you know, to a big extent.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.730
So what would you say to
Sam, sitting next to him

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.730
right now, after this
whole experience?

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.130
I'd say he's a tough SOB.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.530
Because I know how
hard it got out there,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.500
I know how cold
it got out there,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.000
and if anybody was
out there like,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.470
suffering as much as I was, then
I gotta take my hat off to him.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.470
He did a great job.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.730
How about you to Britt?

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.970
Well, you always think,
like, who is this crazy person

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.870
who's out there with me still?
- Yep.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.800
But proud of them, and I
think he did an awesome job.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
And it was fun to watch.
