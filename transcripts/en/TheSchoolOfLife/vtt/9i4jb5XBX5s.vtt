00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.740
Thomas Hobbes was a 17th century English Philosopher.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.520
Who is on hand to guide us through one of the thorniest issues of politics.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.200
To what extent should we patiently obey rulers, especially those who are not very good

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.640
and to what extent should we start revolutions and depose governments, in search of a better world.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.520
Hobbes's thinking is inseparable from one major event that began when he was 64 years old

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.620
and was to mark him so deeply, it colored all his subsequent thinking.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.880
Remarkably he died when he was 91

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.280
and so everything his remembered for today he wrote after the age of 60.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.700
This event was the English civil war.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.420
A vicious, divisive, costly and murderous conflict that raged across England for almost a decade

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.280
and pitted the forces of king against parliament, leading to the death of some  200 000 people on both sides.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.800
Hobbes, was by nature a deeply peaceful and cautious man.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.120
He hated violence of all kinds.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.160
A disposition that had begun at the age of 4

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.100
when his own father, a clergyman was disgraced and abandoned his wife and family

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.300
after he got into a fight with another vicar on the steps of his parish church in a village in Wiltshire.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.640
The work for which we chiefly remember Hobbes - "Leviathan"

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.140
was published in 1651.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.740
It is the most definitive, persuasive and eloquent statement ever produced

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.020
as thy why one should obey government authority.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.920
Even of a very imperfect kind in order to avoid the risk of chaos and bloodshed.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.360
To understand the background of Hobbes's conservatism.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.460
It helps to realize that across the western Europe in the 17th century,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.460
political theorists were beginning to ask with a new directness, on what basis subjects should obey their rulers.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.980
For centuries, way back into the Middle Ages there'd been a standard answer to this:

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.160
contained in a theory called: "the divine right of kings."

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.740
This was a blunt, simple but highly effective theory, stating that it was none other than god

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.520
who had pointed all kings and that one should obey these monarchs for one clear reason.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.160
Because god said so and he would send you to hell if you didn't agree.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.200
But this was no longer proving quite so persuasive to many thoughtful people

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.400
who argued that the rule ultimately lay not with kings but with ordinary people who gave kings power

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.800
and therefore should only expect to take orders from kings so long as ,but only so long, as things were working out quite well for them.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.900
This was known as "the social contract" theory of government.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.160
Hobbes could see that the divine right of kings theory

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.680
was nonsense and what more was going to be increasingly unpersuasive as religious observance declined.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.240
He himself was privately an atheist.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.980
At the same time Hobbes was deeply scared of the possible consequences of "the social contract theory."

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.260
Which could encourage people to depose rules whenever they felt a little unhappy with their lot.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.200
Hobbes had received a firsthand of the beheading of the King Charles I

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.280
on the scaffold in front of the banqueting house of the palace of Whitehall in 1649

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.280
And his intellectual labors were directed at making sure that such ghastly primitive scenes would never be repeated.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.900
So, in "Leviathan" Hobbes puts forward

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.040
an ingenious argument that tries to marry up social contract theory

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.740
with the defence of total obedience and submission to traditional authority.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.300
The way he did this was to take his readers back in time to a period he called "the state of nature".

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.360
Before there were kings of any kind

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.040
and to get them to think about how governments,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.040
would have arisen, in the first place.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.600
Key to Hobbes's argument was, that the state of nature would not have been a pretty place

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.780
because humans left to own devices

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.980
without the central authority to keep them in awe

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.980
would quickly have descended into

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.040
squabbling, infighting and intolerable bickering

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.640
It would be a little like the English civil War

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.720
but with people in bearskin bashing each other around with flint tools.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.640
In Hobbes's famous formulation, life in a state of nature would have been nasty, brutish and short.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.020
As a result out of fear and dread of chaos, people were led to form a governments.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.880
They had done this willingly as social contract theorists maintained.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.500
But also under considerable compulsion:

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.440
fleeing in to the arms of strong authority,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.000
which they, therefore Hobbes argued, had a subsequent duty to keep obeying.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.760
With only a few rights to complain if they didn't like it.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.960
The only right the people might have to protest about absolute ruler or Leviathan as Hobbes called him.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.380
Was if he directly threatened to kill them.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:58.680
However, if the ruler merely stifled  opposition, imposed onerous taxes, crippled the economy and locked up dissidents willy-nilly

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.540
this was absolutely no reason to take to the streets and demand a change of government.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.000
As Hobbes wrote

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.220
He admitted that a ruler might come along with an inclination to do wicked deeds.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.600
But the people would still have a duty to obey this person as:

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.960
But these inconvenience is anyway the fault of the people, not the sovereign because

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.760
as Hobbes adds

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.900
if men could rule themselves they would be no need at all of common coercive power.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.780
As he went on:

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.940
Hobbes's theory was dark, cautious and not especially hopeful about government.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.980
In a more optimistic moments we want him to be wrong.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.680
But it seems, Hobbes's name will always be relevant and fresh again.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.260
When revolutions, motivated by a search for liberty go horribly awry

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.120
Hobbes maintained in the preface to Leviathan that he had written the book
