00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,680
Great. You're listening to radio,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,440
the podcast from w.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,420
C. N. N. P. R. Hello everyone.
This is radio lab, the podcast.

4
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,530
I'm Jad Abumrad and I am Robert
Krulwich and Jed sick. Yes. Here,

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,970
but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't
explain to you the situation to you,

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,170
the podcast Listener,

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,360
r n there's been some confusion
here among our our podcasts,

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,850
which is exactly what's going
on in the last five podcasts.

9
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:36,360
You've listened to completely
produced hour long programs. Yes.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,530
That's why we began radio lab as
a radio show, our long programs,

11
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:43,560
which we work very, very hard on. Yeah,
I mean I think of us as having two.

12
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,270
We have radio labs for the radio,

13
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:47,820
which are hour long programs and you've
just heard a bunch of those and then we

14
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:51,450
have radio labs just for you sign up.

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,860
Those are called the podcast and we
could do stuff on the podcasts that are a

16
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:59,160
little less formal and not that were,
there'll be formed on the radio,

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,720
but it's just a looser form so we can
come short length shorter or longer or

18
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:05,610
longer. Yeah, yeah, that's
true. That's true. We've ran,

19
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:09,240
we ran conversations between you and
various smarty pants that have run pretty,

20
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,900
really wrong and have been, have
been great or close to forever.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,970
But the point is, this is now the
beginning of a podcast, so this is not,

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,000
and if you're wondering where
to find us on the radio,

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,840
the issue there is that we're on the
radio at different times all over America.

24
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:28,250
So you have to ask your local
station when they run radio labs,

25
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:30,120
sometimes in the morning,
sometimes in the evening,

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,110
but the podcast is anytime
you choose. That's right.

27
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,270
And starting with this podcast,
this post season five podcast, uh,

28
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:44,170
I want to read to you Mr Kroll,
uh, the second paragraph of a, uh,

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,110
uh, an article that was recently
in the New York Times. Okay.

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,370
Have you heard about this?
Uh, this fellow Brock,

31
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,530
I know about the New York Times. Oh
Bro, yes, I heard him too. Okay. Well,

32
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,790
new researchers have documented,

33
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,940
I'm quoting here what
they call an Obama effect,

34
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,140
showing that a performance gap between
African Americans and whites on a 20

35
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:04,830
question test administered
before Mr Obama's nomination,

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,950
all but disappeared when
the exam was administered,

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,480
after his acceptance speech and again
after the presidential election.

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,310
So to back up, that means it translated
into normal English. Yes. Go ahead.

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,390
That um,

40
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,410
some researchers decided to give a 20
question test to a bunch of people.

41
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,720
They were young people and
older people do just that.

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,640
You're going to take a
test. It's a GRE test.

43
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:29,640
It's a verbal test that you take to go
to graduate school before they take the

44
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,470
test, they have to list
their race. Yes, they do.

45
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,690
So you put down your race
and then you take the test.

46
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:37,050
Now the first time they administered
the test was sometime last year before

47
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:42,020
Barack Obama was a big deal.
Yes. And blacks performed poorly.

48
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,930
Poorer than whites. Yes. Eight poorly.

49
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,960
So whites on average at that point
answer 12 questions that have 20 correct.

50
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,070
And black subjects answered
only 8.5 on average out of 20.

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,530
So that's a significant difference.
Or that was a small sample.

52
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:59,980
Then they gave the exact same 20
question test [inaudible] gres again, the

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,980
verbal to a group of people after Barack
Obama had become the nominee of the

54
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,790
Democratic Party, had given an acceptance
speech in, in Denver, Colorado,

55
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,280
and was a pretty famous
and important guy. Yes.

56
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,570
And then they give it yet again after
Barack Obama had been elected president of

57
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,870
the United States. So there's, there's
these multiple of test takings.

58
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:24,871
And what they noticed was after Barack
Obama had become fabulous blacks taking

59
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,194
the test,

60
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,910
scored about the same as whites
before Barack Obama had been fabulous,

61
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,280
blacks performed more
poorly. And there's a,

62
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,120
there's a longstanding reason
for the previous performance,

63
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,110
but the new performance

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,120
that's very interesting. Pretty
stunning. But I mean we should say,

65
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:45,410
but as by way of caveat to that,
this isn't really preliminary study,

66
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:48,530
it's not been peer reviewed.
You guys haven't looked it over.

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,410
Not a huge number of
subjects in the study,

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,020
but there was a last very intriguing yes.

69
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:58,910
And there is actually precedent for
this, uh, for this, um, way of thinking.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,470
The precedence goes back to a psychology
professor named Claude Steele.

71
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,820
I got a job offer.

72
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:09,530
This is in the 80s at the University of
Michigan and it was part psychology and

73
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:13,550
part to administer a minority
student program there. And um,

74
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,380
in the process I saw data that surprised
me when he saw was a troubling trend.

75
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,020
Two kids would enter Michigan,
one was black, one was white.

76
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:27,820
They come in at the exact same
level, same skills, same sat scores.

77
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,520
So theoretically they should do
the same when they get to Michigan.

78
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,930
But without fail or almost
without fail, after one semester,

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,980
the black kid was winding up with lower
grades. How much lower? Pretty, pretty,

80
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,370
um, pretty dramatic. At least
two thirds of a letter. Grades,

81
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,870
meaning if the white kid got an a,

82
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,730
the black kid who should be getting an a
too is instead getting a B or a B plus,

83
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:52,030
that's significant. That's significant.
That's significant. And he also,

84
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,481
by the way,

85
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:56,330
saw this performance gap between
women and men when it came to match.

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,090
At the same time,

87
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,010
same degree in advanced math
courses, it was comparable.

88
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,560
I learned this as a national phenomenon.

89
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,340
If I was to walk into almost any
college class in the United States,

90
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,580
I'd have a very high probability
of finding exactly that

91
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,440
[inaudible]

92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,090
what could explain these differences.

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,200
There was something there that people
didn't understand and that we certainly

94
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:22,920
didn't understand till he figured he
would start with the woman in math issue.

95
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,110
He brought a bunch of women
in and a bunch of men,

96
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,110
what brought them into the
laboratory one at a time,

97
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,280
gave them a half an hour section of the
graduate record exam you take if you're

98
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:36,810
a math major, very, very
difficult math, and sure enough,

99
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,890
the woman who had all the same credentials
coming into that situation performed

100
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,270
dramatically worse than the men.

101
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,470
Worse as in it'd be a couple
hundred points on an sat testing.

102
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,933
It was a big effect.

103
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,480
So Claude Steele thought,
all right, step one complete.

104
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:53,200
I've got a lab situation that
resembles the real world. Good.

105
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,900
Now the next step is to
tweak things a little bit.

106
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:57,010
See if I can mess around with it.

107
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,140
Nope.

108
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,470
Normally in these situations,

109
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,120
the test giver has got a little white
lab coat on and he brings in a big stack

110
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:11,350
of cellophane wrapped tests.
He puts a clock on the table.

111
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,110
That's all. It's all you know.

112
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,530
It's like that's it's gonna
intimidate almost anybody.

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,540
Maybe that's what's happening. He
thought, what if I took away the clock,

114
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,960
took away the coat and most importantly
right before the test I had the test

115
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:30,250
giver. Instead of saying the normal,

116
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,250
I'm going to give you
a test pre test thing.

117
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:35,680
Maybe instead say something like this.

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,270
You may have heard that a women
don't do as well as men on difficult

119
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:42,520
standardized math test.
You may have heard that,

120
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,250
but that is not true for
this particular test.

121
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,960
This particular test does not show
gender differences. Never has never will.

122
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,140
He wondered if maybe saying that simple
sentence before giving the test would

123
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,160
have an effect

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,600
and sure enough,

125
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,660
I wouldn't be here if their performance
didn't go up and go up to match that of

126
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:06,600
the equally skilled men, that
performance gap totally vanished.

127
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,080
She look at this thing, so we
raced and did it very quickly.

128
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,330
The same kind of an experiment
with African Americans.

129
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,530
They're the pretest
disclaimer went like this

130
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,850
is an instrument that we use to study
problem solving and it is not diagnostic

131
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,040
of individuals intellectual ability.

132
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,560
In other words, this is not a test
of your intelligence. I repeat,

133
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:28,210
not an IQ test,

134
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:31,570
so just do the best you can with
that simple disclaimer at the start.

135
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,590
Same kind of an effect.

136
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,380
The black students and the
white students were now equal.

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,960
Just recently a Ryan Brown and
Eric Day did a clever treatment.

138
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,291
They,

139
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:49,910
there is an IQ test which is nonverbal
called the advanced progressive matrices

140
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,150
has figures, very abstract.

141
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,490
It got lines crossing that you
have to match and so on. X,

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,800
it's essentially pattern match diamonds
with dots and totally visual and so they

143
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,590
can represent that test
as as it is as an IQ test.

144
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,220
It's in fact seen as the gold standard
of IQ test because it's cool culture

145
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,880
free. There's no math, there's no reading
because it doesn't involve language.

146
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,510
Or You could represent the exact
same test as a puzzle puzzle. Puzzle.

147
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,170
Meaning you can give an IQ test to a
bunch of kids and the blacks will perform

148
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:22,730
worse. But if you give that same test,
lose the word test, lose the word IQ.

149
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,990
You just call it a puzzle.

150
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,500
The black participants suddenly jump
up in their performance. Basically,

151
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,660
we got a reversal. When you
represent represented as a puzzle,

152
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,500
blacks perform as well as white.
They did. Yeah. That's all it takes.

153
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,420
Just change a few words.

154
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:41,790
[inaudible].

155
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,540
In fact, there's even
better research on this, uh,

156
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,110
by a guy named Jeff Stone at University
of Arizona who's shown this with golfing

157
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,460
tasks where he's had black and
white golfers just putt. Wait,

158
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,980
so this hightest can eat. We're
talking about eating. Well,

159
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,340
think about, think about what it takes
to putt effectively. Are you a golfer?

160
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,710
No. Ryan's not either. So he doesn't
know what he's talking. That's right.

161
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:03,740
So I'm going to make this
up. You have to constantly,

162
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:07,800
what we did was we got a miniature golf
situation where each hole changed and

163
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,140
people had to work around
obstacles. This is Jeff Stone.

164
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:13,890
He runs the social psychology of sports
lab at the University of Arizona.

165
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,610
And here's what he did. He tested his
black and white putters in two scenarios.

166
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:21,660
Scenario one by using the
word intelligence when we
told them it was a measure

167
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,860
of sports intelligence,

168
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,360
black participants did about four
strokes worse than white participants,

169
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,080
but when he changed it took out the word
intelligence and framed it instead as a

170
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:35,570
test of your natural athletic
ability there naturally,

171
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,200
the results totally flipped, flipped,

172
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,760
and we had now whites
performance significantly worse
than blacks by about four

173
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:46,650
strokes. If you look at the recent a
u s open that was played in San Diego,

174
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,813
tiger woods and [inaudible],

175
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,750
a meeting went four days, 18 holes.

176
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,180
They went to an 18 hole
playoff on Monday. Yes,

177
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,700
and still tied. Sudden death. We go on

178
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,010
tiger finally won it on
the first playoff hole.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,860
Tiger Woods. When's the third us
open championship by one stroke.

180
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,610
So when you talk about four
strokes, that's a huge difference.

181
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,920
All right, so here's my question.
Stereotypes are powerful. Okay,

182
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:24,160
that makes sense now, but in terms
of understanding how this works,

183
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,740
can you make this tactile for me,

184
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:31,630
like if the stereotype it's having all
these effects is like a thing like a,

185
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,940
like a little Gremlin that bites,

186
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,270
like when in the test taking process
does it actually like do it's damage.

187
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,440
That's going to be way open to debate.

188
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,280
What does seem to be clear from the data
according to Eric Day and Ryan Brown

189
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:46,114
and Claude Steel,

190
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,530
is that the Gremlin only seems to appear
totally when the test is sufficiently

191
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:52,360
hard. If the test is easy,

192
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,480
that's important to point out
a these effects don't happen.

193
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,420
It's not that the Gremlin is not
there. Well, he walks in with you,

194
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,450
but he doesn't speak necessarily
until things get challenging.

195
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,690
As soon as the test gets difficult,
that's where the voices kick in,

196
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,630
which means that for most of the tests
everybody's doing about the same.

197
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,630
It's only at problem number 17 the
one about co-signs and factorials and

198
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:15,130
whatever where things start to go wrong,

199
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:17,380
and at least that's the
theory at that problem.

200
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,620
The black student starts to stiffen
up a little bit. That's right,

201
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,170
and Claude Steele's measured this.
Their blood pressure's elevated,

202
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:25,060
their short term memory is impaired.

203
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:28,840
It's that flicker of frustration through
their body that wakes up the Gremlin

204
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:32,050
who starts to whisper in their ear,
I don't know if you can do this.

205
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,110
Oh Shit is what they say about us.
True. They don't think you can do it.

206
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,810
All the usual stuff, and even if
the student doesn't believe it,

207
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:39,610
which is likely so you
don't have to believe it.

208
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,320
That's the kind of insidious thing here.

209
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,920
Just the fact that he has now
this extra bit of mental chatter,

210
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,390
that little guy whispering, well,

211
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:50,620
it's a distraction and that makes their
performance go down just a little bit.

212
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,980
Hold. This dialogue is keeping from being

213
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,220
a hundred percent focused on the task at
hand, which is solving these problems.

214
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:58,930
Who the real subtle

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
power of a stereotype isn't that it
prevents you from doing the thing you want

216
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:02,834
to do.

217
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,850
It distracts you for just a beat
from doing the thing you want to do.

218
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,500
And that may be all the difference.

219
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,860
Oh, so we're almost done with this
particular podcast, but before we go,

220
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,140
I think we should have the letters
section, which I'll do like this

221
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,320
[inaudible] letters, they get letters.
So we have a this letter Jad Abumrad yes.

222
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,610
A number of people have wondered who
we listened to our diagnosis show.

223
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,710
For those of you who haven't
listened to the diagnosis show,

224
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,720
you'll have to listen to it
to understand this question,

225
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:49,830
but they're very curious what
happened to patient x who was, um,

226
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,260
had pancreatic cancer in the show. Yeah.

227
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,930
We never quite explained to his
fate what he's, or the outcome.

228
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,450
Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's actually a
really good question. Um, patient x, uh,

229
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,430
had his entire pancreas removed
and um, many years later,

230
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:07,580
his is doing fine. He's still alive. Uh,

231
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:11,480
although the pancreas being a very
important organ, uh, when he was removed,

232
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:16,190
he became a diabetic. So it's a pretty
radical radical surgery, but it's,

233
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,840
you know, arguably saved his life.

234
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,610
Okay. The next question

235
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,230
[inaudible] this comes from your father
and your mother. Yeah, this is good.

236
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:30,170
What is wrong with you is
essentially what they're saying.

237
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,010
And I like to join them in that. For
those of you who remember the show, uh,

238
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,540
was a choice when you did this [inaudible]
suddenly in the middle of the show

239
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,620
and for no reason at the
end of a segment, uh,

240
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,280
Jed used a term of opprobrium to IX.

241
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,600
He used the name that is
normally associated with
female dogs and just simply

242
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,410
call the audience [inaudible]
you just called. Okay.

243
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,250
Bitches and then like all hell

244
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,400
broke loose. Yeah. And
I thought at the time,

245
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,840
what it's true you should
eat. It's, it's true.

246
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,060
You should go on record as
being a dissenter from the
beginning. You were like,

247
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,710
why did you, why would you do that?
Okay. So here's the thing. Um, uh,

248
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,950
some people found, many
people found it funny,

249
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,340
many people did not find it
funny. And I sincerely apologize.

250
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,430
The people who didn't you
look, I'm in my thirties. Okay.

251
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:19,820
I grew up watching MTV, it's
uh, you know, I, you know,

252
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,140
you got with your friends
and you're like, all right,

253
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,880
but she was ready to go
out to dinner a little.

254
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,920
Still actually say that it's
a term of endearment. Oh,

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
it just popped out during one of
the sessions. Do you remember this?

256
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,600
It was really nice. 1,000 takes
really insulting and stupid,

257
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:36,560
but no know you didn't find it. This,
this generation card thing on me. So like,

258
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:40,460
can I get like, I get scared.
Yeah. Right. All right.

259
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,990
So I see that's what all the young
people are doing. You know what I mean?

260
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,480
I got so many people come and say, what's
wrong with him? Why did you do that?

261
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:52,481
And a lot of them were your age or do
I say it like 19 2021 so I think you're

262
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:58,220
exactly right. I think it's generational,
but it doesn't even matter at this at,

263
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:02,060
at honestly. I, I, if I could do
it again, I would take it back.

264
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,960
No offense, no offense meant, I
mean, where it came from, from me.

265
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,350
And I think people who are
my age, they, you know, it,

266
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,910
it wasn't an attempt to be have, it's
just something that happened in the booth.

267
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,100
It was funny. And so we left it in.

268
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:17,420
We probably shouldn't have come here cause
my parents will not let me forget it.

269
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,320
They're always like, at dinner they're
like, can you pass the salt bitch?

270
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,650
What do you think of the chicken roast?

271
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,340
All right mom. I get it and
get it. There's such good care.

272
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,150
Anyhow, I guess we should
go. Good. All right,

273
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:40,750
so radio lab is funded in part
by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

274
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,350
the corporation for public broadcasting
and the national science foundation also

275
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:45,370
by nurse Nestle,

276
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,420
who will try to get back to bed and
totally into sleep as soon as possible.

277
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,140
Right. I'm Jeddah boomers and this
leads, like I said, I don't know why.

278
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:56,770
I never know what you're going to
say. No, I don't. I really don't.

279
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,450
I'm Jad Abumrad I remember crawling, I
guess catch up with you in two weeks.
