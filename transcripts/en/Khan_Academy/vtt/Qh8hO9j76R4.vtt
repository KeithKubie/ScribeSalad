00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
- [Instructor] In this video,
I want to tackle an entire

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.210
AP macroeconomics free
response exercise with you.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.030
Assume that the economy of Country X has

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.380
an actual unemployment rate of 7%,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.730
a natural rate of unemployment of 5%,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.110
and an inflation rate of 3%.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.990
Using the numerical values given above,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.820
draw a correctly labeled
graph of the short-run

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.580
and long-run Phillips curves.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.550
Label the current short-run
equilibrium as point B.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.440
Plot the numerical values
above on the graph.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.660
So pause this video if
you are inspired to do so,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.930
but I will now work through it.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.370
So remember, Phillips
curves show the relationship

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.810
or the theoretical relationship

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.200
between the unemployment
rate and the inflation rate.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.353
So I'm gonna do the inflation rate

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.570
in the vertical axis which is typical.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.980
And then on the horizontal axis,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.290
I am going to do my unemployment rate.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.290
So this is going to be my

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:01.609
unemployment rate

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.160
which is going to be a percentage.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.560
Now we want to graph the short-run

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.070
and long-run Phillips curves.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.290
Let's do the long-run first
because we've seen before

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.930
the long-run just sets
our unemployment rate

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.760
at the natural rate of unemployment,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.040
and it isn't related
to our inflation rate.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.820
It'll just be a vertical line.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.950
And so it'll be a vertical
line at our natural rate

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.230
of unemployment which is 5%.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.610
So maybe it looks just like this.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.230
So I could call that our
long-run Phillips curve,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.357
and it's going to be right there at 5%.

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:38.710
And now I have to do the
short-run Phillips curve,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.100
and that will show a relationship

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.190
between inflation rate and unemployment.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.930
And just think about what's going on.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.870
If you have low rate of unemployment,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.610
especially if it's below your
natural rate of unemployment,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.560
well then there's a lot
of demand for people.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.480
And so people say, hey,
if you want me to work,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.970
you gotta pay me a little bit more,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.750
and so that could just lead
to a higher inflation rate.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.800
And then if a lot of
people are unemployed,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.010
they might be willing to work for less

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.980
or they might have less
money in their pocket

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.850
with which to drive up the
prices, and so you will have

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.720
this inverse relationship right over here.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.200
So this is the short-run Phillips curve,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.570
which is downward sloping.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.500
And then they say,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.700
label the short-run
equilibrium as point B.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.870
So let's say this is
point B right over here.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.110
And they say the short-run
equilibrium we have

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.181
an unemployment rate of 7%
and an inflation rate of 3%.

00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:34.930
So our unemployment rate
right over here is 7%,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.690
and our inflation rate
right over here is 3%.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.350
All right, let's do the next section.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.620
Assume that the government of Country X

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.150
takes no policy action
to reduce unemployment.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.840
In the long run, which of the
following shift to the right,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.130
shift to the left, or remain the same?

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.750
So here they're saying short-run

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.300
aggregate supply curve, explain.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.660
So here it's kinda tricky
'cause you might be thinking

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.290
they're asking about what you just drew.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.900
But here they're talking
about aggregate supply.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.990
So let me draw a graph to
even help to visualize this.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.600
So if we're talking about aggregate demand

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.410
and aggregate supply,

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.730
our vertical axis is going
to be our price level,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.100
I'll just call that PL,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.100
and our horizontal axis that
is going to be our real GDP.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.340
So this is real GDP
right over here, G-D-P.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.480
Now you're just going to
have a long-run supply curve

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.110
which is vertical.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.280
That's just the full employment
output for our country.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.920
So that's the long-run aggregate supply.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.760
But what about the short-run
aggregate supply curve?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.940
Well, that's going to be upward sloping.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.180
If price levels are low,
people might not be willing

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.580
to output a lot, and if
price levels are high,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.160
people will output more.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.000
So our short-run aggregate supply

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.320
would look like that.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.110
I'll call that sub one,
since we're gonna think

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.090
about how it shifts,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.490
and then aggregate demand
would look something like this.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.410
Let me draw it like that.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.170
And notice, our equilibrium
point right over here,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.770
let me call that aggregate
demand right over here.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.870
Let's call that Y sub one,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.530
and we are at price level sub one.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.670
I drew it to the left

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.250
of the long-run aggregate supply curve.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.830
I drew it to the left of
the full employment output

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.790
because we are dealing
with a recession here.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.300
Our unemployment rate is higher

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.910
than the natural level of unemployment.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.230
So if our actual
unemployment rate is higher

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.130
than natural rate of
unemployment, what will happen

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.540
to the short-run aggregate supply?

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.020
So one way to think about
it, at a given price level,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.460
because there's people out
there looking for a job,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.480
you might be able to get more output.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.030
Or for a given amount of
output, it might cost less

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.220
because there's just people out there

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.770
competing for that work.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.020
And so you would have your
short-run aggregate supply curve

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.820
shift to the right, short-run
aggregate supply sub two.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.210
And then your equilibrium
price level would go down,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.490
price level sub two would go down.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.900
So we could say because

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.583
of high unemployment,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.940
that could apply wage pressure.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.630
We could say wages come down

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.040
which would shift

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.300
the short-run aggregate supply curve

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.410
to the right.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.150
And there's a couple of
ways to think about that.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.930
You would have more output

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.460
at a given price level.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.670
You could also think at
a given output level,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.070
you would have a lower price level,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.430
at a given price level.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.120
Part two, long-run Phillips curve,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.400
so that's this vertical
line right over here.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.070
And the thing to appreciate
is the long-run Phillips curve

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.210
or the long-run aggregate supply curve,

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.440
these don't change unless
something structurally changes

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.170
in the economy, unless the economy changes

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.920
in some very fundamental way,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.960
maybe a change in education
levels, change in population,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.210
or change in technology.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.183
And so here we would say
it just remains the same.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.160
All right, we have more parts here.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.067
Now let's go to part (c).

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.990
Identify a fiscal policy
action that could be used

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.030
to reduce the unemployment
rate in the short run.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.280
So you have to be very careful here.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.080
They're saying a fiscal policy action,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.280
not a monetary policy.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.020
If you said hey, we would
change the federal funds rate

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.720
or we would increase the money supply

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.650
or decrease the money supply,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.460
those would be monetary actions.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.430
We care about a fiscal policy action.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.130
And this would be in
relation to lowering taxes

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.320
or raising taxes or increasing

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.490
or decreasing government spending.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.217
Well, if we want to reduce
the unemployment rate,

00:07:04.217 --> 00:07:05.780
one way to do the that would be

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.750
to shift aggregate demand to the right.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.210
And one way to do that,
would be to put more money

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.260
in people's pockets,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.457
and one way to do that,
is to have a tax cut.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.570
Draw a correctly labeled
graph of aggregate demand

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.700
and short-run aggregate
supply, and show the impact

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.850
on the equilibrium
price level and real GDP

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.180
of the fiscal policy action
identified in part (c).

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.120
All right, let me draw that.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.930
So this is going to be so that we have

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.970
our price level axis up here,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.820
and we just drew something
very similar to this, real GDP.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.400
And now let's draw our
short-run aggregate supply

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.850
which we have seen before.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.770
That would be upward sloping,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.610
as the price level increases
or the economy might be willing

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.260
to output more, so that's
short-run aggregate supply.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.190
And then let's draw an
aggregate demand curve.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.270
So let's call that AD sub one.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.440
And then you have the equilibrium output,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.060
let's call that Y sub one.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:16.060
And you have your equilibrium
price level, PL sub one.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.220
And now if you have a
tax cut, that would shift

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.400
aggregate demand to the right.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.030
At any given price level,
people are gonna want more.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.900
They're gonna demand more

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.310
'cause now they have more
money in their pockets,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.090
and so it's going to shift to the right.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.220
So I'll do a aggregate demand sub two.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.330
And now we have a different
equilibrium real GDP,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.100
so that is going to be Y sub two.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.610
And it happens, and then we
have price level sub two.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.570
So you see our price level goes up

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.250
and our aggregate output, our GDP,

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.033
our real GDP, goes up as well.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.500
Based on the change in real
GDP identified in part (d),

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.530
will the supply of Country X's currency

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.350
in the foreign exchange market increase,

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.913
decrease, or remain the same, explain?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.100
The way I think about it is if
you have real GDP increasing,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.410
you're in a situation where you just have

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.700
more economic activity, the
national income has gone up.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.110
And if national income has
gone up, people are gonna do

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.260
a lot more of everything
including buying imports.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.650
And to buy imports, they would
have to increase the supply

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.270
of their currency in exchange markets

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.620
because they want to convert
it into foreign currencies

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.793
to buy those imports, and
so this will increase.

00:09:32.358 --> 00:09:35.403
And we could say, because national income

00:09:40.982 --> 00:09:41.982
has gone up,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:52.233
people will buy more imports,

00:09:56.895 --> 00:09:59.980
so the supply

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.480
of Country X's currency

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.430
for exchange will go up.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.580
Currency X's currency

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.310
for exchange

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.460
will go up.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.760
All right, part (f).

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.850
Based on your answer
to part (e) and assume

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.900
a flexible exchange rate system,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.030
will Country X's currency
appreciate, depreciate,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.100
or remain the same in the
foreign exchange market?

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.930
Well, if you hold all else equal,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.590
but you increase the supply of something,

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.930
well, then the price of
it is going to go down.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.760
If the demand for it stays constant,

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.900
but you increase the supply,

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.970
and that's what we just
talked about in part (e),

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.980
well, then the price is going to go down.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.030
And if we're talking about
the price of a currency

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.520
and we say it's going
down, we would say that

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.990
that currency is depreciating,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.153
so it would depreciate, and we're done.
