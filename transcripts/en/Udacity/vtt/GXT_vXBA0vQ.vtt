00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.370
So far, we've only considered the bivariant relationship between

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.750
price and carat weight. But there's much more to

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.140
this data set and I'd like to give it

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.840
a proper introduction. The diamonds data set ships with ggplot2

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.270
and contains the prices and the specs for more

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.090
than 50,000 diamonds collected in 2008 from diamondsc.info. Now,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.550
analyzing this data is particularly useful. Because diamonds are

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.660
unique in a way that just isn't true of most

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.330
manufacture products that we're used to buying. You can't

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.910
just plug in the model number and just look up

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.380
the price. Though the diamonds data set is full

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.840
of prices and fairly esoteric certification ratings. Hidden in the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.220
data are reflections of how a legendary marketing campaign

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.570
permeated and was subsumed by our culture. Hints about how

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.870
different social strata responded and how the diamond market

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.290
functions today as a result. The story starts in 1870.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.800
When many tons of diamonds were discovered in South

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.960
Africa near the Orange River. Until then the diamond

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.360
market had been small, only a few pounds of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.090
diamonds were mined each year from India and Brazil. At

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.280
the time, there was no use for diamonds outside

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.610
of jewelry, so price depended only on scarce supply. Hence,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.460
the project's investors formed the De Beers Cartel in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.700
1888, to try to control the global price of diamonds.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.590
By most accounts, this has been the most

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.590
successful cartel in history. But World War I and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.830
the Great Depression saw diamond sales plummet. In 1938,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.600
the De Beers Cartel contacted Philadelphia ad agency N.W.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.240
Ayer and Son to inquire whether, quote, The use

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.620
of propaganda in various forms Might help jump start

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.940
diamond sales in the U.S.. Which looked like the

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.440
only potentially viable market for diamonds at the time.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.770
Surveys showed, however, that among couples contemplating marriage, diamonds

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.490
were low on the list of priorities. A luxury

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.214
for the rich, money down the drain. Frances Gerety

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.418
took on the DeBeers account at N.W. Ayer and

00:01:56.418 --> 00:01:59.600
Son. And work towards the company's goal to quote,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.320
create a situation in which every couple contemplating marriage

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.700
feels the need to acquire a diamond engagement rings.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.830
A few years later, she would coin a famous slogan.
