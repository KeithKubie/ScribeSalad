00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.770
The idea was that this was going to be
the Bell Labs

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.120
memo that never was. It would never be
released,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.550
so said the lawyers, because it was too
"sensitive".

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.500
For 33 years this was

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.029
all that we had and I suppose, in modern
parlance, it became a sort of

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.090
"Reverse Engineering Jailbreak" as you
might say

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.599
Many of you know -

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.269
far better than I do already - about the
two big heroes of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.690
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. There's
a third person we're going to bring in today,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.270
and the one, if you like, at Bell
Labs, that I know really, really well, for

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.770
more than

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.090
thirty years now. That of course is Brian
Kernighan

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.149
and I think, if only from this book here,

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.750
those of you who haven't heard of him may
suddenly say " Oh! yes".  

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.520
Probably the third best known person in
the UNIX firmament

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.140
after Dennis and Ken. One of the suspects
you'll recognize straight away is me;

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.470
the one on the far right is my colleague
Steve, who features later on in this story

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.659
and the person in the middle there, the
bearded gentleman,

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.240
is Brian - Brian Kernighan. That's taken
about three years ago when we visited

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.020
Brian and it's in a coffee shop just off
the main campus of Princeton University.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.180
When you looked through the Version 7 UNIX manual

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.990
the thing that really struck you was that
at Bell Labs. they not only

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.530
could afford PDP11s, VAXs and all sorts of stuff

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.689
but they could afford typesetters.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.040
It's hard to realise nowadays what that meant.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.530
Laser printers had not been invented.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.590
At best, if you were lucky, you could get a good

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.799
- if you like - dot-matrix printer effect,
but actually getting

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.049
Times Roman, Courier, Zapf Chancery,

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.049
Helvetica, Arial, whatever turns you on. No -

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.880
that was not in the compass of normal
mortals because it cost a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.759
heck of a lot of money. So what we're going to
take a look at today

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.020
is how and why Bell Labs. had typesetters,
what they did with them

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.450
and how they really were instrumental

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.270
in making typesetting democratic for the
rest of us.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.410
It was very early work but it was
massively influential

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.650
and one of the people who led the charge on
that - because he did a lot of the work himself

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.190
and he was kind of, informally, the leader

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.330
of the typesetting software efforts at
Bell Labs, was

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
Brian - Brian Kernighan. 
Bell Labs' choice of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.459
third-generation typesetter would "only" cost

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.349
fifty thousand dollars, in 1979 money,

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.459
which is just horrendous to think of.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.860
By comparison you could easily buy a house - 
you could easily buy a house for 50,000 dollars

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.709
- and a really very good one I would think. 
They looked

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.050
long and hard at what was available and decided

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.340
that they would go with Mergenthaler

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.540
and this machine - UK designed - was called

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.700
the Linotronic 202. This was there

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.860
one step before laser printers came on
the scene.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.010
Naked Mini, two floppy-disk drives, 
control console,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.690
paper tape. Here is a board

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.390
from the Naked Mini, and it shows you,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.580
very definitely, how solidly

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.040
"minicomputer" the computational
facilities were.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.640
And there's all of the boards that
comprise the Naked Mini,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.069
receptor cassette, fed from bromide paper

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.250
at the back. Hidden under there a hi-res

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.780
cathode-ray tube, 972 dots to the inch,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.970
and shaped a bit like a letterbox in
many ways.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.360
You exposed the bromide paper

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.670
in bands. And when you finish doing the
current band

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.569
you mechanically move the bromide away
from it. At huge cost, from either

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.879
Linotype or some other supplier, you
bought a bromide

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.989
or film processor. You took along your cassette,

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.590
you fed it in to the end of this thing,
which had three separate tanks

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.860
smelly developer,  ugh!,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.019
yes I can smell it even now, wash water

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.480
in the middle, after the developing was
done of the image,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.109
and then, of course, fixer at the end. 
And the fixer smelled the worst of all -

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.970
a sort of faintly acidic smell about it.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.150
Then it came out at the end - it probably
had another wash at the end

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.660
and then it went through a dryer or you hung 
it up to dry.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.020
And then finally you got your beautiful
bromide output, which you could

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.840
slice up and make it into page-sized slices

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.650
What you then did with it was, if you
just wanted to send

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.970
a proof of what you'd typeset

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.199
out to all your friends, there were of 
course Xerox and other photocopiers around.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.220
You could photocopy the bromide output

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.479
but if you wanted really high quality

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.870
and you were doing a long print run what 
you would have to do, at this generation,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.729
was to send your photographic output
off to a plate maker

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.199
that would convert your photograph into

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.690
an offset-printer metal plate. The idea is

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.930
you have a plate on a cylindrical drum
which rolls round and round at

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.070
very high speed and can print off tens
of thousands of copies of

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.720
things like newspapers or whatever. 
So that's

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.259
basically the technology behind

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.870
third-generation, cathode-ray tube driven,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.840
typesetters . And, as far as Bell Labs
was concerned, it just changed everything

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.210
because with the ability

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.039
to be imaging onto a cathode-ray tube

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.080
you could not just have the ability to
use preset

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.639
fonts, like in early generations, y'know
letter S's

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.310
magnified to various sizes - you'd  got all of
that - but you'd have the ability to draw lines.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.810
You could do primitive line graphics

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.870
and certainly Brian and others at Bell
Labs really

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.569
really wanted to do that. They could see
the potential straight away.

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.360
But in terms of getting the full value out
of this, what they, naively perhaps, thought

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.199
shouldn't be too much trouble, was to ask
Mergenthaler, very nicely,

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:20.039
if they would let them have the spec. for
how the digital fonts were held on

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.460
floppy disks.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.810
"Why?" said Mergenthaler. "Because we want to
create our own" they said.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.860
Well, I gather the roof fell in.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.050
Total, total, total disbelief. "Why would
you want to do that -

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.330
this isn't a machine for amateurs!" 
One example

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.430
of the fonts that they wanted was a set of

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.979
chess pieces. This is the time to bring
in one of our other heroes

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.979
Ken Thompson, already mentioned in the
previous UNIX video.

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.270
He was part of Brian's team for commissioning

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.979
the 202 typesetter. It was led by Brian
himself, of course,

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:59.349
and crucially they also had a hardware
man called Joe Condon - a

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:02.500
very talented hardware engineer. Some
of you will know

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.130
that Joe Condon and Ken Thompson were famous,
just before this era,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.509
mid-seventies, for creating the Belle
chess machine.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:12.690
Ken was there as a sort of ultimate software
guru, who was

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.030
mad keen to create his own chess font and also

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.380
very happy to get deep into the Linotron -
as deep as was needed.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.919
Merganthaler just said "I'm sorry
gentlemen, it's a flat 'no'.

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.210
we are NOT going to reveal to you how our
fonts are done.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.750
Yeah, Yeah, we thoroughly accept you are Bell
Labs, y'know, you have enough

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.830
hassle from anti-trust legislation; we
know you are not gonna set yourself up

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.990
as rivals,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.289
you're not gonna become just a font shop
and, y'know,

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.000
do cheaper fonts than us. We know. We accept it."
But nevertheless

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.289
there was a feeling - rightly, I think - 
in Mergenthaler

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:51.580
that this was like opening Pandora's Box.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.680
Even though these three talented chaps
at Bell Labs

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.979
were quite prepared to sign every
non-disclosure agreement

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:02.330
going, the answer was firmly 'no',

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.250
absolutely 'no'. So

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.009
they basically said: "Well, we're going to do it anyway"

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:13.550
and I suppose, in modern parlance, it
became a sort of "Reverse Engineering

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.830
Jailbreak", as you might say.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.800
The wisdom from Mergenthaler was: "You'll 
never do it; our fonts are 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.330
not deliberately encrypted, but they are 
so compressed

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.949
and so compact, and in such such an obscure
format, you will not succeed

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:32.849
in deciphering how we do it, or why we do it".

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:36.550
To which, I think, Brian probably muttered
under his breath "What you don't know is

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.979
I've got a secret weapon

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:41.310
and it's not a piece of hardware - it's
called Ken Thompson".

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.850
It took Ken, with some help from Brian - who always

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.890
underplays his own role in this - 
basically between two and three weeks

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.200
to get the overall idea of how it all worked.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.910
It took about six weeks for total
knowledge but that included

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.760
complete knowledge of exactly what the
resolution was of that CRT,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.300
the timings - everything. You just wouldn't have

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.430
wanted a more talented team to prove that this

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.800
could be done. They created their own
fonts. Ken did his chess font - there

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.850
were no chess fonts available at this time. 
There's hundreds of them now.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.920
In an email he sent to me, he said: "Well, I just
wanted to do something really quickly

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.060
because I wanted to publish books and I
wanted a proper chess font".

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.959
Hermann Zapf's Palatino - but there is

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:30.100
Ken Thompson's chess font in action. The
whole of this book

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.310
all done on the Linotype 202.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:37.890
So that is one of the rationales for
wanting to be able to do your own fonts.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.560
Brian and I have traditionally referred to
this work, that he did

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.740
as The Vacation Project, right, because it
was in the vacation period

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.310
in the middle of 1979 that they spent their
six weeks

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:54.630
reverse engineering the 202. But when it
came to the turn of 1980

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.230
Brian was absolutely adamant that he
wanted to write a memo

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.570
about - not the fine details of how it had
been done - but just the

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.480
overall picture saying "We did it - this is
what we can now do,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.190
isn't it wonderful?" Not in any way to be
anti-Mergenthaler

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.440
although their [Bell Labs'] version of the 
202 was very, very unreliable

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.899
as you be able to read in this memo.
We'll try and set up some

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:22.810
Web pointers for you as, part of this
video, so you can read it for yourself.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.440
But he just wanted to tell the story.
Mergenthaler got wind of it and

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.430
basically said "No, absolutely no!" - got in
touch with Bell Labs.' lawyers

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.730
and - to cut a long story short - it 
was suppressed.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.240
The idea was that this was going to be
the Bell Labs

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.930
memo that never was - it would never be released,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.170
so said the lawyers, because it was 
too "sensitive".

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.390
But it was, with hindsight, a real pointer

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.100
to the future, when fonts would become commonplace

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.880
within the laser printer era, and so on.
For 33

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.209
years this was all that we had as

00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:03.450
the hard-copy evidence

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:08.279
of the technical memorandum. The thing I'm
kicking myself for now is that I didn't

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:12.769
actually keep any bromide. I've got lots of other
bits and pieces here,

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:17.180
I've got font books for the ... supplied with the

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.600
Linotype 202 but I didn't actually keep

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.180
any proper bromide and nor, it would
seem, did Brian

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.600
because here - this isn't the bromide,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.779
it's an nth-order photocopy of

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:36.170
the bromide - off the 202 - and you can see
what happened. Every photocopying process

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.300
adds so many percent to the apparent
boldness. Bits have got chopped off and

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.339
truncated off the bottom -

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:46.600
filing marks here.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.220
However, as you turn over you can begin
to see

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.510
just what was turning them on about the

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.180
abilities of the 202. For the first time
using Brian's 'pic'

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.800
pre-processor they could draw a line diagram

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.370
of how it worked on the 202, look, 
cathode-ray tube

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.470
sixteen-bit Naked Mini driving it ...
floppy disk ... character definitions on

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.820
... integrated line diagram output.
Not stuff that you had to have drawn by an

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.670
artist and pasted in

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.200
and made a plate of, or whatever, afterwards.
The governing

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.889
organization, if you like, for what's left of
Bell Labs is now called Alcatel-Lucent.

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:28.230
So, I suggested to Brian and a good
mutual friend, Chuck Bigelow,

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.540
typographer, said: "Yeah!, yeah! you guys ought
to do this".

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.839
I said "Why don't we ask the powers that be for

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:39.000
permission - it's not sensitive any more
33 years after the event.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.990
Please can we recreate the Vacation Memo,"

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.990
as we came to call it. The really big plus point 
of course

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:52.519
was that it was typeset in this typesetter
version of that original 'runoff' program - 

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:57.639
'troff' - the typesetter version of 'roff'.
Troff can be equipped with macros to

00:12:57.639 --> 00:13:00.399
help you do the layout, and all this sort 
of thing.

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:04.060
Anyway, to my amazement, I have got a
more authentic,

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:10.050
and ancient, set of super-duper 'troff'
macros for doing Bell Labs Memos

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.750
than even Brian had, so we were able with
a fair bit of effort

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.910
to recreate the memo at the sort of quality

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.360
that would certainly have been obtainable 
from the 202,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.329
if only we'd hung onto the bromides, yeah?
But we didn't!

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:30.279
However, this of course has all been done
via PostScript and PDF and

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:34.720
modern technologies. But we're trying as hard
as we possibly can

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.579
to still retain the look and feel of
what it would have looked like,

00:13:38.579 --> 00:13:42.420
at best quality, coming off the Linotronic 202.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.970
One of the best ways to show what we're
up against and whether we succeeded or

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.339
not is to show an A-B comparison.

00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:52.839
Here is the original memo - not as a
bromide as it should have been -

00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:56.930
but as a sort of nth-order photocopy 
of it. First of all

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.760
finished off properly at the bottom
don't forget we didn't have the appearance

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.230
of this - we didn't save the bromide -

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.329
But what we did have was the 'troff' 
source code.

00:14:09.329 --> 00:14:13.829
Brian had saved that, thank heavens. We
would have been struggling without that

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:17.600
although, in the end, we could have
rebuilt it with optical character recognition

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.930
and all that,  but he'd saved the 'troff'.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.350
So, instead of running 'troff' through a back
end to the 202

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.160
we now run'troff' through another back-end 
out to PostScript and PDF.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.560
So here we go - nice and clean. No ink

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.260
bleed - straight off a good quality 
laser printer ...

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.550
the Bell Labs logo revived as a font character

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.010
all over again, and even shrunk down.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.820
It says here: "The most obvious special
character we use is the Bell System logo"

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.480
I'm jumping ahead now. The thing that
Brian was trying to get across in this memo

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.930
was this:  in this era you mustn't imagine

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.220
that the 202 and its characters were
able to do

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.860
splines and arcs and complex curves - no
they couldn't.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.079
I mean, quite apart from anything else - there
wasn't the processor power

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:07.889
to be able to do the computer graphics necessary 
to turn those

00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:11.550
into dots on the CRT fast enough.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:16.389
No, what you had to do was to simplify
and make all your characters be lots and

00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:18.100
lots of small

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.519
line segments. so these diagrams here, as
you can see, I've put little arrows on -

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:26.519
not really part to the character - just to
emphasize to you this is where each line

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.329
segment begins and ends.

00:15:28.329 --> 00:15:32.139
So, that Helvetica font letter 'e' is a bunch

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:36.589
of straight lines. And there were severe 
limits on how many you could have,

00:15:36.589 --> 00:15:39.649
at most, of straight lines in any one
character.

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:44.149
But it worked well enough, so long as you
didn't take your character size above

00:15:44.149 --> 00:15:45.269
about an inch,

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:48.600
at most, and then you began to be
able to see

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.170
the straight-line approximations. The Naked
Mini was going flat out, and even then it could

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.680
just about cope with characters done

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.070
as lots of straight lines. It  certainly
could not cope with

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:04.459
arcs and splines. OK - so let's just
summarize the two big challenges that we

00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:05.130
faced in

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.740
recreating this vacation memo. Fonts
like Times Roman

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.079
Helvetica, Courier - if they're there -
are no problem.

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:18.079
They existed on the 202 but they've been
brought forward into the PostScript and TrueType,

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:22.050
modern fonts era. Those are easy to get hold of

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.130
The harder bit, here, was what we had to
recreate

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.709
because they just didn't exist except on
the 202.

00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:33.779
The first and most obvious is Ken's chess
font, so starting from first principles again

00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:37.889
I created a few shapes using Brian's 'pic'

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:41.509
program and handed them over to my
colleague Steve, whose photograph

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:46.130
you've already seen - Steve Bagley. We also
discovered, by the by, in doing this

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.709
that Ken Thompson, faced with the problems
of fonts on the 202,

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:54.550
where individual characters shouldn't get
too complex -

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:58.509
you'll never guess how he did something like

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:02.660
a pawn here, on a shaded black background.
The overall character would have been

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.810
too complicated

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.439
so what he did was he created extra
characters which was

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:10.589
the cut-out shape at the back, partly
shaded,

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:15.339
and then dropped the pawn shape on top
of them as a zero-width character. So it's

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.350
a superposition.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.449
We were authentic - we did that in our replica

00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:22.630
The other thing which caused me many
sleepless nights is that

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.980
the Linotron font for doing

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.450
program printouts - 'Courier' if you like -

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.110
was called Printout. Heaven knows why
Linotype, 

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.470
Merganthaler, didn't just do Courier but
they didn't.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.360
Next thing to do is to phone up the Font
Shop in Cheltenham and say:

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.650
"Printout, on the 202? It's been turned
into PostScript hasn't it?

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.860
By somebody? For some reason?". "Er, no", comes back the 

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.220
reply, "It was 202 only. We never converted that one."

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.450
So we decided to recreate it.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.970
In conjunction with my friend, Chuck Bigelow,
type designer,

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.220
we had a look at this Printout font in the

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:06.309
Linotype font book. Chuck took one look at
that and he said: "That's come

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:11.770
from a variable-width typewriter
font - something like Excelsior

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.600
but they've  hacked it about to make it 
a fixed-pitch font like Courier".

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.610
And he's quite right. If you look at the
tiny details you can see it's Excelsior

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.390
messed about with. So with a sinking heart

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.490
I started off with Excelsior. I spent - I'm
not exaggerating -

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.210
120 hours chopping stems

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.270
chopping down serifs, resizing, placing

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.960
in fixed-width character positions, trying all
the kern-pairs I could, to get them to

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.289
look right.

00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:43.830
It's not bad.  I'm still not happy with it 
at all.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.280
But it was a revelation to me as to
just how

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.809
incredibly labour-intensive type design is.

00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:54.830
But for the sake of authenticity, and
when you look inside the vacation memo you

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.490
will see,

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.580
Brian wrote a heartfelt letter to Mergenthaler

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.140
about the lack of reliability of
their 202. And he wrote it in

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.520
the Printout font, so I wanted it to 
look right.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.880
So, that just about summarizes, I think, the

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.020
big two challenges that we had to overcome

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.080
and I think we've now just about completely
succeeded.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.880
It's like restoring pictures. You don't want
to over-restore.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.220
You want to use exactly the original materials

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:33.440
and do it just right. But overall I'm
pretty happy - I don't think we did too badly.
