( intro music )

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.675
Jer Thorp:<i> What we are trying
 to do with this expedition</i>

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.677
<i> is to produce threads
 that can lead from</i>

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:14.681
<i> this untouched wilderness
 out into the public.</i>

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.949
<i> And those threads can
 be grasped by anybody,</i>

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.619
<i> anybody who wants to find a
 connection to this place.</i>

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.356
( applause )

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:28.127
Steve: Visible from space the
Okavango Delta was voted in as

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:32.665
our planet's 1000th UNESCO World
Heritage Site in June last year.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.200 line:0%
Now this was a long
overdue accolade for

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.637 line:0%
a wilderness beyond comparison.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.739 line:0%
The jewel of the Kalahari.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.242
<i> Every year we
 haul ourselves across</i>

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.544
<i> the Okavango Delta in
 Northern Botswana.</i>

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:49.515
<i> These 350 kilometer,
 18 day expeditions</i>

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.651
<i> take us across a
 living wilderness.</i>

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.720
<i>It is considered to be the most
valuable wetland on our planet.</i>

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.755
<i> The most valuable
 protected wetland.</i>

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.157
<i> The Okavango Delta is home to</i>

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:01.461
<i>the largest remaining population
 of elephants on our planet.</i>

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.597
<i> The native population there
 is around 150,000 elephant.</i>

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.099
<i> That's over half
 of the elephants</i>

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.500
<i> remaining on the
 African continent.</i>

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.303
<i> We lose 100 elephants</i>

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.804
<i> every single day
 on the continent.</i>

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:15.642
<i> That's every 15 minutes an
elephant is shot for its ivory.</i>

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:19.611
<i> The lions. Over 2000 lions are
 found in the Okavango Delta.</i>

00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:20.713
<i> Many people don't know it but</i>

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:24.216
<i>we are more likely to lose lions
 in Africa than elephants.</i>

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:26.452
<i> This is the super pride,
 this is the Matata pride</i>

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.087
<i> means problem animals.</i>

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.856
<i> That is Bob Marley
 on the side there,</i>

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.025
<i> he's got a dreadlock
 coming out of his chin,</i>

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.393
<i> great Sphinx of a lion.</i>

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.261
Him and his four brothers
rule the largest pride

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.930
in the Okavango
and I know them well.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.200
<i> The Kalahari leopard. It's the
 largest leopard in Africa.</i>

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.169
<i> Keystone populations of hyena.</i>

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:46.038
<i> Rhino find sanctuary
 in the Okavango Delta.</i>

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:48.474
<i> Buffalo, the great herds
 still exist there.</i>

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.676
<i> Fifty thousand buffalo
 in that system.</i>

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:53.312
<i> Cheetah, wild dog...</i>

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.414
If we lose this system
in its current state,

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.016
the Okavango Delta
and its catchment,

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.385
we will lose these
species in that region.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.920
And that is their heartland.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.057
It is our call to action to
look north to the source

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.292
<i> into the catchment in Angola,
 a country that</i>

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.995
<i> has remained closed
 to us for many, many years.</i>

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.564
<i> Thirty years of civil war were
 fought up in that catchment.</i>

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.766
We are taking four Ba'yei
river Bushmen with us,

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.701
to go down that river.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:17.871
That's going to happen
in two months' time.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:21.040
Now this is in Angola.
Angola is

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.408
a unique country in
Southern Africa.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.177
It is now the second
largest oil producer.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.613
It is booming between seven
and 22 percent growth rate,

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:28.781
every single year.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.249
<i> This is the skyline of Luanda.</i>

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.885
<i> Five years ago there was not
 one tall building in Luanda.</i>

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:34.753
<i> Now there are many.</i>

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.656
<i> Now you look here into the
 catchment and you wonder why</i>

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.391
<i> it has remained untouched.</i>

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.394
It has remained the largest

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:42.728
undeveloped river catchment
on Earth.

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:44.697
The only river that is
longer without dams

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.699
is the Yukon in Canada.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.169
The largest land battles in
Africa since World War Two

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.005
were fought in this catchment.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.807
The densest minefields,
land minefields in Africa

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.442
are in this catchment.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.379
<i> This is one of the remotest
 places in Southern Africa.</i>

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.981
<i> This is the source
 of the Okavango.</i>

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:05.084
<i> This is where we are going to
 launch our expedition from.</i>

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.486
Now, two years ago
we identified this site,

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:09.088
there was no signs of roads,

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:12.024
there was no signs of any
kind of deforestation.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:14.994
This has happened since then,
it's happening every single day.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:17.797
Angola is being torn apart,
the clock is ticking.

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:20.566
We have two or three years to
achieve what we want to achieve.

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:22.801
That is new national
parks, game reserves

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:25.004
wildlife management
areas, wildlife corridors,

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.573
all the way up that river.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.274
We are working with the
Governor of that province

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.243
who really wants
to see this happen.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.844
He is one of the most
powerful people in Angola

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.147
and is going to drive
this process for us.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.547
There is hope.

00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:40.686
<i> This is Khobono Mank'etu.
 He is my friend and mentor.</i>

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.889
<i> He is a Ba'yei river bushman.</i>

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.759
<i> The Ba'yei arrived in the late
 1700's into the Okavango Delta</i>

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.028
<i> with a revolutionary
 new technology.</i>

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:53.632
<i> The mokoro, an 18-foot dug out
canoe that would forever change</i>

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:56.835
<i> our human experience in
 that remote wilderness.</i>

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.605
<i> It was the first time that
 human beings actually accessed</i>

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.707
<i> the central wilderness
 was these guys.</i>

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.476
<i>So, the Ba'yei have taught us to</i>

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:07.947
<i> pull ourselves safely in these
channels, to avoid the wildlife</i>

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.716
<i> to drink the waters
 of the Okavango.</i>

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:12.050
<i> The mother Okavango that
 gives them everything.</i>

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.153
<i> From the day we start
 to the day we end</i>

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.121
<i> you can drink it any
 time from the water.</i>

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.890
<i> That is how pure
 this system is.</i>

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.860
<i> We harvest fish, smoke it
 in the traditional way.</i>

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.829
<i> We live off water lilies,
 the rhizomes and the seeds</i>

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.364
<i> and the pollinated flowers.</i>

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.266
<i> We listen to the swororo.</i>

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:30.002
<i> That is the music
 of that wilderness.</i>

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:32.471
<i> They teach you how to interact
 with the animals.</i>

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.973
<i> This is an elephant,
 I'm just saying</i>

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.375
<i> "I'm unarmed, I'm not
 big, I'm just unarmed</i>

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.644
<i> I'm holding nothing
 and I'm passing."</i>

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:40.680
<i> To avoid the hippos.</i>

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.349
<i> It's a grumpy animal,
 very much misunderstood.</i>

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.253
<i>But if you give them the space,
 they're not going to harm you.</i>

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:51.023
<i> Crocodiles, now
 you have these...</i>

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:53.058
<i> sometimes the water is
 murky, sometimes it's clear.</i>

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:55.294
<i> You often see them under you.</i>

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:57.129
<i> This is probably a
 three meter crocodile.</i>

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.732
<i> This one here is a
 15 foot Nile crocodile.</i>

00:05:00.732 --> 00:05:03.302
<i> It's about 20 yards
 ahead of us.</i>

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:05.104
<i> I'm putting pressure
 on it to try and move it
 down the channel.</i>

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.139
<i> It's feeling claustrophobic,
 it now thinks that</i>

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.942
<i> we're another crocodile
 so it's wheeling around at us.</i>

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:12.912
<i> "It's coming around,
 it's coming around."</i>

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:15.748
<i> Now I can tell you your heart
is pumping as this is happening.</i>

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.416
<i> There is nothing I can
 do to avoid this animal</i>

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:18.785
<i> so I've pulled off to the side</i>

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.586
<i> I've told the television
 presenter in the front</i>

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:23.522
<i>to hold the paddle, just I meant
 for him to barricade himself</i>

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:25.191
<i>he ended up hitting the animal.</i>

00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:30.797
<i> Look at this approach.</i>

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:33.866
( man screaming )

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.469
But that's the reality
of this place.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.638
You're not in control
of anything around you.

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:41.173
You have to surrender
yourself to probability,

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:43.743
surrender yourself
to the wilderness.

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:47.547
Now it was in 2012, the
last day of that expedition

00:05:49.047 --> 00:05:51.517
<i> coming down the main
 channel, the Boro,</i>

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:54.320
<i> fifty kilometers in one day,
 pulling as hard as we can.</i>

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:57.089
And to be honest all I
was thinking about was

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.024
"burger and beer,
burger and a beer."

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:00.092
( audience laughter )

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:02.895
After 18 days of eating
water lilies and fish.

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:06.631
There were two Swana kids
on the bank

00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:09.602
and they shouted out to us...

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.670
"Lakuah, lakuah, lakuah."

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:14.106
That means
white people, foreigners.

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:16.576
The oldest Ba'yei with us

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.677
Mr. K'etu-k'etu,

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:22.315
father of Khobono Mank'etu,
my friend and mentor,

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:25.751
he shouted back at those,
those kids on the bank.

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:29.254
He said,
"Hauna makua, Ba'yei hei'lah"

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.493
which means there are no
foreigners here, only Ba'yei.

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.730
It is something that I wanted
to hear my entire life

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.166
to be considered as
something or someone that was

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.668
good for that wilderness,
for the mother Okavango.

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:48.240
But as Ba'yei we enter that
wilderness barefoot, unarmed

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.978
with minimal food rations
and very few possessions.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.580
<i> But as digital Bushmen.</i>

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.882
<i> In this new age of
 exploration we come with</i>

00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:59.352
<i> hundreds of pounds of
 batteries and solar panels</i>

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.688
<i> tablet computers, cameras, all
the paraphernalia of technology</i>

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:06.626
<i> we need to share these
 experiences with the world.</i>

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:10.796
To do the science we need to do,
to measure impacts in the future

00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:13.299
to understand exactly the
way this wilderness is now

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.534
before it is disturbed by
developments upstream.

00:07:15.534 --> 00:07:18.104
And they are coming, we're
seeing it every day in Angola.

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.874
<i> This is the magic of
 National Geographic...</i>

00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:23.943
<i> the Explorer program.</i>

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.211
<i> I was fortunate enough
 to meet these three men</i>

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:27.479
<i> Jer, who is going
 to be speaking now,</i>

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:30.316
<i> Gregg Treinish in the back
 and Shah Selbe.</i>

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:34.887
They are going to change the
future of the Okavango Delta

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:38.090
and the river that supplies
it for future generations.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.494
It is a powerful thing that
came about because of this.

00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:44.296 line:0%
<i> Now Jer has taken us from</i>

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:48.467 line:0%
<i> live blogging to
 live data expeditions.</i>

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:52.071
<i> What you're seeing here is all
of us in the central wilderness.</i>

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.641
<i> You've got Jer is there,
 Chris, Steve and GB.</i>

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.076
<i> We are on an island,
 we're just about to leave.</i>

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.978
<i> It's eight o'clock and
 we're on the channel.</i>

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:01.680
<i> What you're seeing popping up
around us are what we're seeing.</i>

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.815
<i> There is a short delay
 in our satellite link</i>

00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:07.353
<i> but this is literally in real
 time, that's real people,</i>

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:10.255

 trying to affect change,</i>

00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:11.791
<i> trying to explore it.</i>

00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:14.326
<i> Photographs will pop up and</i>

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:16.428
<i> this system advances
 every single year.</i>

00:08:16.428 --> 00:08:17.429
<i> We're very excited to see</i>

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:20.166
<i> what Jer achieves this year
 when he joins us.</i>

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:24.804
Shah took us from little
strips and pieces of paper

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:27.173
<i> writing down the water
 quality as we go down</i>

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.175
<i> to environmental
 sensor platforms.</i>

00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:33.245
<i> Solar powered that can sit
 out there autonomously</i>

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:36.515
<i> and send via cellular,
 via satellite, via Wi-Fi,</i>

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:38.417
<i> a whole bunch of parameters
 of water quality.</i>

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:42.254
We're gonna expand that network
to hundreds of these platforms

00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:43.389
throughout the Okavango Delta.

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:46.892
As Shah puts it we're gonna be
measuring the literal heartbeat

00:08:46.892 --> 00:08:49.962
of that wilderness in real time
for the world to see.

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:52.898
The whole world will be privy
to the impacts when they come.

00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:56.001
And we'll explain that to people
as it... as it arrives.

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:58.804
<i> Gregg. Gregg is
 trying to figure out</i>

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.540
<i> how to bring life
 to this network.</i>

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.142
<i> We need people to
 connect the dots.</i>

00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:06.212
<i> So, he's looking at ways of
 safely getting volunteers</i>

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.380
<i> in there, to go and
 maintain these platforms</i>

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.581
<i> as we see them go down.</i>

00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:10.882
We are talking about
elephants and hippos

00:09:10.882 --> 00:09:12.117
and things trudging over them.

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:13.652
That kind of thing is gonna
happen and we're gonna need

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:16.055
Gregg's volunteers
to help us with that.

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.290 line:0%
<i> We did a Hangout
 in the last expedition.</i>

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.260
<i>We arrived literally 20 minutes
 before we went live.</i>

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.861
<i> This is one of the
 remotest locations</i>

00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:24.329
<i> but a wonderful
 experience and on cue,</i>

00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:28.033
an elephant walked directly
behind us at the end of it.

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:30.536
It was about the third last
day of the expedition.

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.871
We were at Eagle Island and

00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:36.108
I got past this,
this big, grumpy old hippo.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.843
He goes under the reeds,
I pull off and

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:40.412
another guy is quite far behind,
Jer is with him.

00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:42.982
And this angry hippo comes,
like two more angry hippos,

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.451
now there's three of them,
I am watching this go on

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:49.021
and these things, literally
tusks out in front of Jer

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.824
slapping those
go under his mokoro

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.292
I turn around to
pull away from this

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:54.593
'cause I don't want
to get into trouble.

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:58.598
In my mind I see Jer just being
enveloped by a wave of hippo.

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:01.700
<i> Something like that</i>

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.869
<i> but he captured
 that in the data.</i>

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.672
He is able to share
that through the data.

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:09.641
And I'm excited
to see that now.

00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:11.644
( applause )
