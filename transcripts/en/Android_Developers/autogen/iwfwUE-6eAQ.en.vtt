00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480
 
 

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.360
 
alright want to hit up the next question

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:21.370
 
 

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.800
 
like one the unkind fed they've got a

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:23.810
like one the unkind fed they've got a
 

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.960
like one the unkind fed they've got a
question here it says it's developing

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:25.970
question here it says it's developing
 

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.780
question here it says it's developing
for the latest API level will make my

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:28.790
for the latest API level will make my
 

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.390
for the latest API level will make my
appt run on all Android devices safe 13

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400
appt run on all Android devices safe 13
 

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.550
appt run on all Android devices safe 13
or 12 so I'm going to interpret that and

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:36.560
or 12 so I'm going to interpret that and
 

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.530
or 12 so I'm going to interpret that and
I think there's two things you can say

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:38.540
I think there's two things you can say
 

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.090
I think there's two things you can say
when you say developing to the list API

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:40.100
when you say developing to the list API
 

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.260
when you say developing to the list API
level you need to be bearing in mind

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:41.270
level you need to be bearing in mind
 

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.320
level you need to be bearing in mind
there's the API level you're building

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:44.330
there's the API level you're building
 

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.760
there's the API level you're building
against so you know that's the version

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:45.770
against so you know that's the version
 

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.360
against so you know that's the version
of the SDK or linking at build time and

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:49.370
of the SDK or linking at build time and
 

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.370
of the SDK or linking at build time and
then there's also the attribute in your

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:51.380
then there's also the attribute in your
 

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.370
then there's also the attribute in your
manifest for target API level so those

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:54.380
manifest for target API level so those
 

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.390
manifest for target API level so those
two things can differ bug you put them

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400
two things can differ bug you put them
 

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.790
two things can differ bug you put them
the same so I would say that you always

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:00.800
the same so I would say that you always
 

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.440
the same so I would say that you always
want to set both of those to build

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:02.450
want to set both of those to build
 

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.820
want to set both of those to build
against and to target to the latest

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:03.830
against and to target to the latest
 

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.980
against and to target to the latest
version of the Android release to

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:05.990
version of the Android release to
 

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:07.660
version of the Android release to
achieve that you know about a new tested

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:07.670
achieve that you know about a new tested
 

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.900
achieve that you know about a new tested
application on and then you can set a

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:10.910
application on and then you can set a
 

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.140
application on and then you can set a
different min SDK and which is the

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:14.150
different min SDK and which is the
 

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.580
different min SDK and which is the
minimum version of Android which will

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:15.590
minimum version of Android which will
 

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.190
minimum version of Android which will
run so by setting those two things that

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200
run so by setting those two things that
 

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.440
run so by setting those two things that
defines the level of the devices that

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:20.450
defines the level of the devices that
 

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.770
defines the level of the devices that
you app will run on so you need to be

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:23.780
you app will run on so you need to be
 

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.090
you app will run on so you need to be
aware when sitting differently basic

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:25.100
aware when sitting differently basic
 

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.500

the code lab section is one about
 

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.250
the code lab section is one about
building backward compatible Android

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:42.260
building backward compatible Android
 

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.890
building backward compatible Android
apps and from there you'll be able to

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:44.900
apps and from there you'll be able to
 

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.220
apps and from there you'll be able to
find my slides and a code lab be able to

find my slides and a code lab be able to
 

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.800
find my slides and a code lab be able to
work through so hopefully that answers a

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:54.950
question I would just reinforce on that
 

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.250
question I would just reinforce on that
that your your target API level is not

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.260
that your your target API level is not
 

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.800
that your your target API level is not
the maximum that your app will run on

00:24:59.800 --> 00:24:59.810
the maximum that your app will run on
 

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.680
the maximum that your app will run on
it's simply the maximum whose features

it's simply the maximum whose features
 

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.840
it's simply the maximum whose features

and then your min SDK to the lowest
you'll support it's also probably worth

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:25.100
you'll support it's also probably worth
 

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.560

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.829
a portrait device and when you hold it
in portrait then that that lower button

00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839
in portrait then that that lower button
 

00:35:48.839 --> 00:35:51.120
in portrait then that that lower button
actually is volume down but when you

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:51.130
actually is volume down but when you
 

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.220
actually is volume down but when you
turn it landscape hitting that button on

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:53.230
turn it landscape hitting that button on
 

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.470
turn it landscape hitting that button on
the right makes that makes the volume

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480
the right makes that makes the volume
 

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.920
the right makes that makes the volume
bar go to the lab so so my thought is

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:58.930
bar go to the lab so so my thought is
 

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.630
bar go to the lab so so my thought is
that it's intended to be a landscape

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640
that it's intended to be a landscape
 

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.249
that it's intended to be a landscape
device and that's not remapping the

00:36:02.249 --> 00:36:02.259
device and that's not remapping the
 

00:36:02.259 --> 00:36:03.569
device and that's not remapping the
sense of the buttons when you change the

00:36:03.569 --> 00:36:03.579
sense of the buttons when you change the
 

00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:06.299
sense of the buttons when you change the
orientation of the device I think it

00:36:06.299 --> 00:36:06.309
orientation of the device I think it
 

00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:07.859
orientation of the device I think it
should remap the sense of the buttons as

00:36:07.859 --> 00:36:07.869
should remap the sense of the buttons as
 

00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:11.099
should remap the sense of the buttons as
you change orientation but I don't know

00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:11.109
you change orientation but I don't know
 

00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:12.900
you change orientation but I don't know
that that's mandated by the platform or
