00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.080
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the outside of the workshop, we've got another random experiment today

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.380
We're trying and this one is brought to us by youtuber elite fusion Z who asks

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.020
What does liquid nitrogen do inside of the backyard foundry Elite fusion Z? We think this is a great idea?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.439
Well let's let the furnace heat up for a few minutes, and then let's open it up and once it's really good

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.259
And hot we'll pour in some liquid nitrogen and see what happens

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.500
Our furnace is getting nice

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.260
And hot I have a thermos full of liquid nitrogen and this metal cup that I'm going to use as sort of an intermediary

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.460
I'm gonna try a few different things first

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.060
I'm just gonna pour some liquid nitrogen from the cup down into the foundry

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.619
And then I'm gonna see what happens if I pour our liquid nitrogen into the cup and then carefully lower the whole cup full of

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.500
Liquid nitrogen down into the foundry as well. Let's see the difference quick note. I want to apologize for any background noise

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.399
There's some construction going on and you might be hearing some of the sounds from that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.499
Alright a cup of boiling roiling liquid nitrogen well

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.640
Here goes nothing. I think it's just gonna make a lot of vapor

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.729
But I admit I don't know for sure

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.979
three two one

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.189
Huh

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.810
Check this out

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.199
So that bottom just turned black

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.119
And I think that's just because it cooled it down so much that it lost all its glow

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.549
Let's just pour a little bit more on and see if the same thing happens

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.538
So it just dissipates, but it definitely cooled that down enough that it lost its orange glow for a second

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
It doesn't take a ton either

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.659
So it definitely did something it cooled down the board. That's at the bottom of our furnace

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.689
But overall it wasn't very eventful

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.208
It just splashes in it dissipates very quickly

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.369
But it's so hot that you don't even see any of the vapors that you normally see rising off of liquid, nitrogen

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:09.559
Let's see what happens if we just put our whole cup full of liquid nitrogen down inside the furnace

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.119
All right, I'm gonna have to be pretty quick about this because otherwise it's gonna start burning my hand

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.789
But there we go three two one

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.940
That is some very actively boiling like no it's still cooling it down on the bottom

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.050
He's just the nitrogen vapors, and you can't see nearly as much flame

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.830
So I think the nitrogen vapor is filling up the furnace a little bit, and it's really subdue it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.530
Mostly is just boiling away

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.810
Nitrogen is running pretty low

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.940
That cup has some very very hot parts and some very very cold parts on it

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.940
That's interesting because you know the bottom of that cup is still freezing cold

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.090
Even though the edges of the cup are now glowing orange

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.399
I think it's a steel cup so it should be fine, but hmm. It's a pretty thin walled steel

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.189
I'm amazed that any liquid nitrogen is still in there. That's very impressive to me that it's lasted this long

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.209
looks like we're just about out and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.510
Gone, oh

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.639
And that is one hot cup and I'm just gonna splash some liquid nitrogen on it and see what happens

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.550
Well

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.739
I guess

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.359
From the point of view of liquid nitrogen this cup has always been super hot

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.899
I don't know. It's several hundred degrees hotter right now, though

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.429
No even the bottom of the cup is burning hot

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.679
once again not terribly remarkable the liquid nitrogen in the cup in the furnace it boiled faster than normal and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.650
It did darken a little bit the bottom of this furnace

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.530
So it was clearly doing something there weren't as many flames as visible, but overall not a huge effect from liquid

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.309
Nitrogen in the furnace. There's a couple other variations. I want to try first

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.160
Let's see what happens if we have a cup of water in the furnace and we pour some liquid nitrogen down into that cup

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.739
All right, this is a cup of regular tap water

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.389
So that our furnace we get a little bit of that same darkening effect, just not nearly as much as with the liquid, nitrogen

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.600
Now we'll have to see how accurately I can pour using tongs and a metal cup from about a foot up

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.019
We'll try and pour this liquid nitrogen down into that cup of water

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.870
liquid nitrogen pouring into water

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.419
three two one

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.169
Well it certainly did something

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.668
There's still just a little bit of it on the surface of the water that water

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.259
At least part of it is boiling hot already that is the fastest I've ever boiled water right there

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.810
It's pretty nuts

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.819
Let's try it again

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.120
That does look pretty cool I

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.350
Think the biggest effect is that it?

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.109
Splashed a lot of the water out of the cup and that landed on the inside of the furnace

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.679
Well there you have it liquid nitrogen into the furnace not super exciting liquid nitrogen in a cup in the furnace

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.600
also, not super exciting

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.520
liquid nitrogen into water

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.660
In the furnace more exciting the water heated up very quickly and so I was pouring liquid nitrogen into boiling water

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.429
Surrounded by a ton of heat we did get a big plume of vapor coming off because of that

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.250
But it still wasn't anything that was really amazing so I think we need to scale this up to something a little bit more

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.669
Volatile we've tried freezing gasoline in liquid nitrogen before so now let's take a cup of liquid, nitrogen

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.689
Pour some gasoline into it till it freezes solid and then lower the whole thing liquid nitrogen and frozen gasoline

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.660
Down into our foundry see what that does I'm just gonna pour it from this cup into the liquid, nitrogen

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.579
Very thick white vapor comes off of that

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.379
Want a fair amount of frozen gasoline in there

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.859
This is gonna be a little bit of a set and run because the frozen gasoline does tend to be pretty volatile

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.860
So we'll see how this goes

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.878
The liquid nitrogen is still covering the frozen gasoline

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.289
So we might have to wait for a little bit of it to boil off before the gasoline ignites

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.840
Here we go

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.669
Well there's little specs igniting in the air

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.359
above the vapor of the liquid nitrogen this little kind of looks like fireflies or fairy lights or something oh

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.910
There we go

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.200
Hey now we have sort of a fire tornado and a furnace I

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.080
Think at this point. It's just burning a cup full of gasoline

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.020
Which is fun?

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.630
There's still some boiling going on on the surface

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.610
I don't know if any of that's liquid, nitrogen or if that's just pure gasoline in the cup at this point

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.689
That's a lot of thick black smoke. I'm gonna try putting the lid back on

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.720
What didn't help it at all

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.580
Fill the propane it's still gonna keep burning coz there's you know a cup of gasoline in there, but?

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.879
Yeah, still just boiling in there

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.640
It's now out

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.369
There is our cup that was full of liquid nitrogen and gasoline and now it's full of nothing

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.859
Well there you have it liquid nitrogen in a furnace not terribly reactive until you add gasoline of course

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.810
And then it goes about as you expect

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.830
It's kind of just like lighting a cup of gasoline on fire and a furnace which is pretty fun

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.390
I will push shouldn't have to say this

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.439
But don't try this at home partly because it's unsafe to burn cups low gasoline

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.200
But more so because it's really kind of a waste of liquid, nitrogen

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.060
There are a lot of more entertaining things that can be done with liquid nitrogen rather than pouring them into a furnace

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.410
