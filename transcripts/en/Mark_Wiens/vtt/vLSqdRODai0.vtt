00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.192
- [Mark] Coming to Mumbai for the food,

00:00:02.192 --> 00:00:05.419
one of the things I was
looking forward to eating most

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.419
is known as Bombay Duck.

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:13.715
(energetic music)

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:17.337
Good morning everyone it's Mark Wiens

00:00:17.337 --> 00:00:21.470
with Migrationology.com in Mumbai, India.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.604
On the spur of the moment
Ying and I have decided

00:00:23.604 --> 00:00:27.187
to take the boat to
Elephanta Caves, which,

00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:31.560
we catch the boat from
the Gateway of India.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.968
And the reason we've just
decided to go right now

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:37.271
all of a sudden is
because it's Friday today,

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.703
and I think it will be perhaps

00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:42.571
a little bit less busy
than on the weekends.

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.452
[Man Speaking In Foreign Language]

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:46.361
- 180 each.

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:47.999
[Mark] 180 each.
[Man] Yeah, both ways.

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:48.937
[Mark] Oh, luxury class.

00:00:48.937 --> 00:00:51.327
[Man] Luxury. No economy,
economy is closed this monsoon.

00:00:51.327 --> 00:00:52.459
[Mark] Official ticket? Okay.

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:54.737
[Man] Yes.
[Mark And Ying Laugh]

00:00:54.737 --> 00:00:57.070
[Man] Come, I will show you.

00:01:00.974 --> 00:01:03.512
[Mark] Hello. Oh, 10 Rupee.

00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:05.080
Thank you.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.663
(upbeat music)

00:01:13.463 --> 00:01:16.074
We couldn't have timed it more perfectly,

00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:17.188
although we didn't plan it.

00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:19.412
But we arrived to the Gateway of India,

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:22.507
and then we immediately
bought our tickets,

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:24.940
they cost 180 Rupees.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.259
And then the boat was about to depart

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.616
so we jumped right on the boat.

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:33.199
(techno music)

00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:38.697
The boat is a little bit
rocky, but not too bad.

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:42.006
We are cruising along and this boat ride

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:43.489
should take about an hour.

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:46.251
You can just see the entire skyline

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.956
just stretching across the coast.

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:50.516
Or just part of the skyline, actually.

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:52.217
But luckily today is not...

00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:55.300
It's cloudy but it hasn't rained yet.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.342
(techno music)

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:17.130
[Man Speaks Foreign Language]
[Mark] Thank you.

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.590
It's really windy today, but
the weather is beautiful.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.825
It's really cool.

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.408
(Bollywood inspired music)

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:31.294
It was probably about a 15 minute walk

00:02:31.294 --> 00:02:33.885
from the pier to the site,

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:36.083
and you have to walk up
this flight of stairs.

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:39.371
And because they have these
blue tarps that are covering,

00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:41.519
and there are lots of souvenir stalls,

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.839
it just makes it so humid inside of there.

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.553
Keeps all the moisture inside.

00:02:45.553 --> 00:02:49.379
So that was about a 15 minute
walk, we have now entered.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.899
The price for entrance...

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.565
I think the price has gone up a bit

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.261
since the last time I checked,

00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.672
but it is 500 Rupees
for foreigner entrance

00:02:57.672 --> 00:02:59.841
and we are here now.

00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:03.623
This is the start of the Elephanta Caves.

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:05.496
And down there is where we started from.

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:07.746
That's the pier down there.

00:03:09.537 --> 00:03:13.022
The original name for
the caves is Gharapuri,

00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:15.396
and it consists of seven different temples

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:16.790
which are within caves,

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.491
which were built between the
5th and the 6th centuries.

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.185
So this is the first cave,

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:26.066
and I think this is one of the main caves.

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:28.835
Actually, it doesn't even look
this big from the outside,

00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:30.914
but when you get in here it's huge.

00:03:30.914 --> 00:03:33.369
Just with giant columns.

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:37.536
Oh, I just definitely got a
whiff of bat dung, I think.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.465
And there are sculptures.

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:43.462
But this is like a...

00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:47.061
This reminds me a lot of
Egypt and the Hypostyle Halls,

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:49.478
and just these giant columns.

00:03:50.703 --> 00:03:53.620
[Man singing In A Foreign Language]

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.226
[Mark] Wow. Yeah the echo.

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:03.893
[Man And Mark Singing
In A Foreign Language]

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:07.919
[Mark] Wow. Very nice.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.559
Thank you.

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:11.970
Some of the statues and the sculptures

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.617
have deteriorated a little bit,

00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:16.018
but it's still just amazing.

00:04:16.018 --> 00:04:19.112
And it's much bigger than
I thought it would be.

00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:21.452
We spent about an hour walking
around the temple complex.

00:04:21.452 --> 00:04:22.744
It was very interesting.

00:04:22.744 --> 00:04:24.684
Definitely cave number one was

00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:26.653
the most impressive and the biggest,

00:04:26.653 --> 00:04:29.536
and I think that's the main cave

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:32.786
that is the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.623
- Salt, lemon?

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:40.623
[Mark] Salt, yes please.

00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:48.803
We made it back down towards the coast

00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:53.418
and I decided to get a hot,
fresh piece of grilled corn.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.406
And then when she took it off
the fire then she added on

00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:58.956
I think it's just like a salt, chili,

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:01.373
lime juice garnish seasoning.

00:05:02.474 --> 00:05:03.859
And it's nice and hot.

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:06.996
When I was a kid growing
up especially in Kenya

00:05:06.996 --> 00:05:10.078
I would always eat
roasted corn as my snack,

00:05:10.078 --> 00:05:12.995
so this brings back great memories.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.892
Yeah.

00:05:20.342 --> 00:05:22.240
The corn is a little bit creamy,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.574
kind of like milky, and then...

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.423
Yeah you gotta love that black
char from the fire roasted.

00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:29.589
And the seasoning is very light,

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:30.709
just a little bit of salt

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:34.376
and a little bit of
sourness from that lime.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.400
Corn drumstick.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.630
I think some of the...

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.108
I think some of the corn just
sprayed out and hit the lens.

00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:45.440
Can you see that Ying?

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.004
Thank you, thank you.

[Mark] Namaste.

00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:52.390
I'm really glad that we decided to come

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.135
on the first boat and on Friday,

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:56.871
because it was really, really quiet.

00:05:56.871 --> 00:05:59.684
But as we are leaving there
was another boat that came

00:05:59.684 --> 00:06:03.193
and lots and lots of people
are starting to come.

00:06:03.193 --> 00:06:06.776

- We are back to the symphony

00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:30.655
of honking horns back in the city.

00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:33.350
It didn't rain the entire
time we went to the island,

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.492
but as soon as we got back to Mumbai,

00:06:35.492 --> 00:06:38.817
jumped in a taxi and it started raining.

00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:42.400
(Bollywood inspired music)

00:06:56.741 --> 00:06:59.623
Oh I can smell that aroma.

00:06:59.623 --> 00:07:00.456
For two people?

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:02.646
[Man] AC? You want AC?

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:03.604
[Mark] No AC is okay.

00:07:03.604 --> 00:07:04.683
[Man] No AC.

00:07:04.683 --> 00:07:05.765
[Man] Which country?

00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:07.298
[Mark] From Thailand.
[Ying] Thailand.

00:07:07.298 --> 00:07:08.318
[Mark] And America.

00:07:08.318 --> 00:07:09.585
[Man] And the U.S.

00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:10.502
[Mark] Yes.

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:18.277
[Mark] Bombil Fry Thali, one. And...

00:07:18.277 --> 00:07:20.908
That was a little bit
of an intense taxi ride,

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:22.658
I think that took about 45 minutes

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:25.496
and traffic was not so good.

00:07:25.496 --> 00:07:28.074
But I am happy that we
made it to this restaurant.

00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:30.895
This restaurant is called
Gomantak Boarding House,

00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:32.939
and they ... oh I think
the food has just arrived.

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:33.772
Okay.

00:07:39.132 --> 00:07:40.632
Which one is that?

00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:49.743
Thank you.

00:07:49.743 --> 00:07:51.758
They have both an AC and a non-AC,

00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:55.233
but we got some seats here
in the non-AC section.

00:07:55.233 --> 00:07:57.742
It's just a packed environment,

00:07:57.742 --> 00:08:00.992
and I don't have a lot of moving space,

00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:04.210
but this is my kind of a restaurant.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.344
Coming to Mumbai for the food,

00:08:06.344 --> 00:08:10.044
one of the things I was
looking forward to eating most

00:08:10.044 --> 00:08:12.279
is known as Bombay Duck.

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.204
And it's actually...

00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:15.082
Although it's called duck,

00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:17.814
it's actually a lizard
fish which is fried.

00:08:17.814 --> 00:08:20.777
And it's kind of curly in shape.

00:08:20.777 --> 00:08:22.472
And then I got the whole Thali,

00:08:22.472 --> 00:08:24.643
so it comes with a number
of different side dishes,

00:08:24.643 --> 00:08:27.412
including rice and, I
think these are chapatis,

00:08:27.412 --> 00:08:30.653
and then some chutneys and curries.

00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:33.055
I'm going to try the Bombil fry first.

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:36.230
And you can see these are like
little curly sides of a fish.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.149
I think it's just the
filet side of the fish.

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:40.441
And then it is coated
in some kind of coating,

00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:41.614
and then deep fried.

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:42.935
That is extremely tender.

00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:45.435
That just, like, flicks apart.

00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:52.428
Wow, that's good.

00:08:53.341 --> 00:08:57.091
That is salty, and really, really crispy.

00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:59.907
It has that crispiness that...

00:08:59.907 --> 00:09:02.850
I'm not sure if it's cornstarch?

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.931
But it almost has a...

00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:08.098
It has a more crispy texture
than a flour-based batter.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.510
I'm going to take my rice though,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.843
and put it on to my platter.

00:09:15.363 --> 00:09:17.373
I'll start with a little bit of it first.

00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:21.137
And then I think this one is
some kind of a curry sauce.

00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:24.054
I will add some of this to my rice.

00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:29.006
Oh there's some chunky
spices in there as well.

00:09:29.006 --> 00:09:30.806
And I'm really curious, I have no idea

00:09:30.806 --> 00:09:34.022
what this pink colored sauce is.

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:36.588
Let me add a little bit of that.

00:09:36.588 --> 00:09:38.005
A pink dish.

00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:41.422
Okay, I'll take that piece of Bombil fish

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.867
and mix it into that rice.

00:09:53.951 --> 00:09:55.009
That's amazing.

00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:56.356
I'll break a piece of the fish,

00:09:56.356 --> 00:09:59.106
and let me dip it into the curry.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.003
That is awesome.

00:10:09.258 --> 00:10:11.378
It's all about that fish, though.

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:15.263
And actually the curry
sauce, it's mild in taste.

00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:16.633
In addition to the Bombay duck,

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:17.765
I also got some ...

00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:19.396
This is a Pomfret masala.

00:10:19.396 --> 00:10:21.774
So it's just a little pomfret.

00:10:21.774 --> 00:10:25.941
Actually, maybe I'll put this
whole head onto my plate.

00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:28.984
Add some more sauce.

00:10:28.984 --> 00:10:30.818
And I think this is the head right here,

00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:34.985
that's the mouth, so most of
the meat is over on this side.

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:45.041
It has a little bit of
a sour flavor to it.

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:48.208
And then the fish is very soft, and...

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.493
Again the curry is kind of mild in taste,

00:10:54.493 --> 00:10:57.069
but it is extremely good.

00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:59.819
And the curry is not oily either.

00:11:00.945 --> 00:11:02.862
This is just fantastic.

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:06.373
And mixed with the rice and
some of that curry sauce,

00:11:06.373 --> 00:11:07.456
it's amazing.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.258
You can see little very,
very fine, fine bones.

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:19.425
They're almost like hair
fine, and you can eat them.

00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:24.364
We also got a type of
chicken curry here as well.

00:11:25.767 --> 00:11:28.343
I'll put this down, and let me eat this

00:11:28.343 --> 00:11:30.426
with some of the chapati.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.347
I think that's part of
the drumstick, possibly?

00:11:43.657 --> 00:11:45.574
Oh that's a bone shard.

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:53.641
The chicken curry is amazing.

00:11:53.641 --> 00:11:55.092
I think it has a really...

00:11:55.092 --> 00:11:59.460
I think I can taste
some cinnamon in there.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.418
And definitely just an
incredible blend of spices.

00:12:02.418 --> 00:12:05.205
And I'm really not sure
what this pink one is,

00:12:05.205 --> 00:12:08.456
but the owner here told me that it is...

00:12:08.456 --> 00:12:11.812
I think it's called co-mani,
com-pa-nee, or something.

00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:14.479
It's very liquid-y, it's watery.

00:12:19.002 --> 00:12:22.404
Oh wow. When I had it with my rice

00:12:22.404 --> 00:12:23.362
I couldn't really taste it

00:12:23.362 --> 00:12:24.597
because it's not a very strong flavor,

00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:26.930
but it has kind of a sour...

00:12:28.501 --> 00:12:30.284
It's a little bit sour.

00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:33.368
I don't know, it's almost
like yogurt-y tasting.

00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:35.874
I think I was eating the pink liquid

00:12:35.874 --> 00:12:37.586
all wrong this whole time,

00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:39.904
because now that I notice
other people eating it

00:12:39.904 --> 00:12:41.588
they kind of leave it to the end

00:12:41.588 --> 00:12:43.794
and then just drink it
at the end of their meal.

00:12:43.794 --> 00:12:45.454
Kind of like...

00:12:45.454 --> 00:12:49.621
Maybe it's like a digestive
or something like that.

00:12:53.868 --> 00:12:55.296
So then you drink it at
the end of their meal

00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:56.794
and it's really soothing.

00:12:56.794 --> 00:13:00.142
It does, it tastes like yogurt but water.

00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:02.140
It tastes like yogurt water.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.845
I'm really not sure exactly what it is,

00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:05.595
but it's really good.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.164
It kind of feels like I'm getting

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:12.414
my probiotics in with this pink liquid.

00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:19.184
Final step of the meal is mouth freshener.

00:13:19.184 --> 00:13:21.017
Put this into my hand.

00:13:24.902 --> 00:13:26.735
It is very licorice-y.

00:13:28.831 --> 00:13:33.705
That just completely takes
away all my onion breath.

00:13:33.705 --> 00:13:35.586
Thank you very much, thank you very much.

00:13:35.586 --> 00:13:38.688
Now as my first time
to ever eat Bombil fry,

00:13:38.688 --> 00:13:40.837
which is also known as Bombay duck,

00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:43.058
and that was delicious.

00:13:43.058 --> 00:13:45.103
All of the food was good, but definitely

00:13:45.103 --> 00:13:47.111
the Bombil fry was my favorite.

00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:51.536
It's such a wonderful fish,
such an oily, delicious fish,

00:13:51.536 --> 00:13:55.703
and then so crispy, how they
battered it and fried it.

00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:01.653
Hello sir, can we go to Kirti College?

00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:02.855
[Cab Driver] Kirti College?

00:14:02.855 --> 00:14:06.301
[Mark] Do you know Ashok Vada Pav?

00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:09.884
(Bollywood inspired music)

00:14:15.276 --> 00:14:17.695
This place is called Ashok Vada Pav,

00:14:17.695 --> 00:14:21.862
and it is one of the most
important street foods in Mumbai.

00:14:26.816 --> 00:14:29.372
I'm just watching them
make the Vada Pav now,

00:14:29.372 --> 00:14:30.736
and what they do is they take...

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:32.948
It's a mashed potato mixture,

00:14:32.948 --> 00:14:34.670
and you make it into a little ball.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.585
And then it goes into a batter,

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:38.688
and then into the oil to deep fry.

00:14:38.688 --> 00:14:42.757
And then that goes into
a fluffy little bun.

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.492
Then all the chutneys go inside,

00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:47.825
plus those little extra batter crispies.

00:14:55.066 --> 00:14:58.233
I'm going to grab a couple of chilies.

00:15:01.118 --> 00:15:02.285
Alright, cool.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.309
This is an overflowing plate.

00:15:06.309 --> 00:15:10.485
This is beautiful, you can
smell the aroma of the chutneys.

00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:13.735
This is definitely the most overflowing

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:18.514
with just everything vegetarian burger

00:15:18.514 --> 00:15:19.872
that I've ever seen.

00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:22.955
It is a little bread bun, and then inside

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:25.388
that's the main deep fried patty in there.

00:15:25.388 --> 00:15:27.471
Then there are a couple
of different chutneys,

00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:30.473
and then just overflowing
with little crispy bits.

00:15:30.473 --> 00:15:31.863
And I grabbed a couple of chilies as well

00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:32.960
to go on the side.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.261
And it's fully vegetarian.

00:15:34.261 --> 00:15:37.146
It's sometimes called the
vegetarian Mumbai burger,

00:15:37.146 --> 00:15:39.500
or just the...Yeah.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.250
It is a very common street food,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.647
but this is the deluxe version of it.

00:15:43.647 --> 00:15:45.660
I'm not sure if this is a...

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.978
If you push this one down and then

00:15:46.978 --> 00:15:48.666
just kind of pick up the whole thing?

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:50.253
I think you do.

00:15:50.253 --> 00:15:51.512
What I see some people doing is

00:15:51.512 --> 00:15:53.353
you kind of gotta lift the
whole plate to your mouth,

00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:54.351
otherwise the little crispies

00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:57.184
might sprinkle all over the place.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.733
Oh wow.

00:16:11.448 --> 00:16:13.198
That is unbelievable.

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:20.225
That's like a starchy potato,
crispy patty on the inside.

00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:25.486
All wrapped within a soft, fluffy bun.

00:16:27.212 --> 00:16:31.281
But the real wow factor of this vada pav

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:33.754
are the different chutneys
that are involved.

00:16:33.754 --> 00:16:35.105
Oh wow.

00:16:35.105 --> 00:16:36.123
There's like a...

00:16:36.123 --> 00:16:38.790
It's like a salty, minty, spicy,

00:16:39.675 --> 00:16:43.842
just powerfully flavorful,
delicious, vegetarian sandwich.

00:16:46.098 --> 00:16:47.765
Oh it's really good.

00:16:55.442 --> 00:16:58.942
That is quite salty, but it's really good.

00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:01.750
Very nice.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.667
And now I gotta go in
for one of these chilies.

00:17:07.957 --> 00:17:08.790
Mm-mm.

00:17:11.026 --> 00:17:14.118
It's just a little bit
spicy, but it has like a...

00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:17.827
They're just slightly roasted
so they're kind of wilted,

00:17:17.827 --> 00:17:19.393
and kind of half cooked.

00:17:19.393 --> 00:17:21.897
Oh man, I could eat those like candy.

00:17:21.897 --> 00:17:23.314
That's delicious.

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:35.784
It's all about those chutneys
that make it so good.

00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:39.237
And they do have a little
bit of heat to them,

00:17:39.237 --> 00:17:40.558
that's for sure.

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:41.725
But they're...

00:17:42.618 --> 00:17:44.424
I love how they're roasted,

00:17:44.424 --> 00:17:47.260
so you just taste that
roasted, chili flavor to them.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.704
They're really good.

00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:50.753
If it wasn't for the fact

00:17:50.753 --> 00:17:53.358
that I just ate lunch 15 minutes ago,

00:17:53.358 --> 00:17:56.358
I would definitely have another one.

00:17:59.404 --> 00:18:01.661
He's making the fried chilies right now.

00:18:01.661 --> 00:18:03.494
They smell incredible.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.115
I will say that that was pretty salty.

00:18:12.115 --> 00:18:14.794
My mouth is completely salty

00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:15.969
and I'm really thirty right now,

00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:18.901
but that was really good, wow.

00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:20.387
I don't know if I've ever had a better

00:18:20.387 --> 00:18:23.021
vegetarian sandwich in my life.

00:18:23.021 --> 00:18:26.604
(Bollywood inspired music)

00:18:35.654 --> 00:18:38.154
Okay thank you very much, sir.

00:18:39.992 --> 00:18:40.940
Have a good day.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.031
We just arrived to a museum
which we're going to visit.

00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:45.317
And I think it's so busy because

00:18:45.317 --> 00:18:48.776
there's also a park and zoo here.

00:18:48.776 --> 00:18:51.746
This place is a little bit intense today.

00:18:51.746 --> 00:18:53.405
Okay I am in line right now.

00:18:53.405 --> 00:18:57.572
It is quite a pushy line,
but almost to the front.

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:01.378
One of those lines where you gotta

00:19:01.378 --> 00:19:03.019
throw your money to the ticket counter

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:05.015
to try and get your ticket,
but we got our tickets.

00:19:05.015 --> 00:19:08.087
It was 100 Rupees for entrance.

00:19:08.087 --> 00:19:10.819
The building itself is
incredible on the inside,

00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:13.967
especially the flooring,
and then also the staircase.

00:19:13.967 --> 00:19:15.359
I really liked the staircase,

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:19.215
along with the chandeliers and the tiles.

00:19:19.215 --> 00:19:21.835
That was a quick visit to the museum.

00:19:21.835 --> 00:19:23.694
Man it was just packed.

00:19:23.694 --> 00:19:26.379
A little bit chaotic,
but I'm glad we came.

00:19:26.379 --> 00:19:27.940
And actually, right as we...

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.308
We got here at the last minute,

00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:33.449
they literally closed
right as we were leaving.

00:19:33.449 --> 00:19:37.159
(car horns beeping)

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:40.742
(Bollywood inspired music)

00:19:46.632 --> 00:19:50.799
We are getting a great traffic
stop view of CST station.

00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:55.578
(Bollywood inspired music)

00:19:57.821 --> 00:19:59.964
From the museum we jumped into a taxi,

00:19:59.964 --> 00:20:02.223
and we drove back to the Colaba area

00:20:02.223 --> 00:20:03.525
which is where our hotel is.

00:20:03.525 --> 00:20:05.137
And we have come to dinner at a restaurant

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:07.109
called Bagdadi Restaurant.

00:20:07.109 --> 00:20:09.026
Palak paneer, and dhal.

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:14.682
Tandoori roti, one.

00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:19.719
This is... Oh, before I tell
you about this restaurant

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.490
I just have to say that that was

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.183
one of the more intense journeys in a taxi

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:28.444
that Ying and I have had in a long time.

00:20:28.444 --> 00:20:32.111
It is rush hour on a
Friday night in Mumbai.

00:20:33.612 --> 00:20:34.783
It was intense.

00:20:34.783 --> 00:20:38.081
We definitely almost hit ... Yeah.

00:20:38.081 --> 00:20:41.638
Probably just ... We
almost hit more things

00:20:41.638 --> 00:20:43.527
than you can count on your hands,

00:20:43.527 --> 00:20:47.582
and that's a very typical
taxi ride in Mumbai.

00:20:47.582 --> 00:20:50.429
But anyway, we're at a restaurant
called Bagdadi Restaurant.

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:52.862
Famous for serving Mughlai food,

00:20:52.862 --> 00:20:54.615
which is North Indian food,

00:20:54.615 --> 00:20:56.815
and this is just a classic
looking restaurant.

00:20:56.815 --> 00:20:59.514
They have some interesting
signs on the walls,

00:20:59.514 --> 00:21:02.851
and I'm already loving these straight up,

00:21:02.851 --> 00:21:05.351
90 degree, vertical backrests.

00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:08.139
[Server Speaking In A Foreign Language]

00:21:08.139 --> 00:21:09.472
[Mark] Oh, okay.

00:21:11.732 --> 00:21:14.133
All of the food has just arrived,

00:21:14.133 --> 00:21:17.633
and it looks very buttery and really good.

00:21:19.035 --> 00:21:19.935
Rip off a piece.

00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:24.102
It's still a challenge to
rip bread with one hand.

00:21:24.974 --> 00:21:27.528
The main dish that I came
to this restaurant to eat

00:21:27.528 --> 00:21:29.749
is the Chicken masala fry.

00:21:29.749 --> 00:21:30.582
And many ...

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.267
A few of you recommended
this dish here at Bagdadi,

00:21:33.267 --> 00:21:35.045
so thank you all for the recommendation.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:38.278
But it is an entire drumstick and thigh,

00:21:38.278 --> 00:21:41.634
which I think is coated
in some spice mixture

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:45.712
and then deep fried, and then
just covered in masala curry.

00:21:45.712 --> 00:21:48.674
This looks incredible,
but you can see definitely

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:52.391
that orange ghee, which is the butter

00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:56.824
which is probably heavily
used in this dish.

00:21:56.824 --> 00:22:00.094
And just really kind of scoop
up some of that masala curry.

00:22:00.094 --> 00:22:02.427
Just look how thick that is.

00:22:12.912 --> 00:22:13.745
Yeah.

00:22:14.755 --> 00:22:17.755
That is buttery, a little bit spicy,

00:22:18.739 --> 00:22:21.617
and what I can taste in
it, at least I think,

00:22:21.617 --> 00:22:24.267
which is different from
other masala that I've had,

00:22:24.267 --> 00:22:26.519
is it's very garlicky tasting.

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:28.303
And the curry sauce is kind of fluffy.

00:22:28.303 --> 00:22:32.111
It's almost like foamy, a little bit.

00:22:32.111 --> 00:22:33.694
But full of flavor.

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:39.800
The next dish I got is Palak paneer.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.538
And this is a spinach vegetable puree,

00:22:42.538 --> 00:22:43.904
and there are tomatoes in here,

00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:47.391
and then little cubes of
paneer, which is the cheese.

00:22:47.391 --> 00:22:49.620
And actually, this looks like...

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.810
Sometimes the palak is very,
very pureed completely,

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.071
but here you can almost
see the little leaves.

00:22:56.071 --> 00:22:57.794
And then there are some also,

00:22:57.794 --> 00:23:01.377
those might be bay
leaves in there as well.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.800
Oh that amount of butter and oil in there.

00:23:10.845 --> 00:23:15.268
In addition to the
wonderful spinach-y flavor,

00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:17.716
it has this wonderful, like, smokey,

00:23:17.716 --> 00:23:20.288
fire-roasted flavor to it as well.

00:23:20.288 --> 00:23:23.205
And then I also got a bowl of daal.

00:23:28.411 --> 00:23:29.244
Wonderful.

00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:33.195
You can really taste the...

00:23:33.195 --> 00:23:36.738
I'm not sure if it's
mustard seed in there or...

00:23:36.738 --> 00:23:39.464
Also there are whole cumin
seeds in there as well,

00:23:39.464 --> 00:23:40.898
which come in nicely.

00:23:40.898 --> 00:23:44.981
But that's just a relatively
plain, lentil puree.

00:23:46.476 --> 00:23:48.154
And it's... Yeah.

00:23:48.154 --> 00:23:50.243
I could eat daal, you gotta have daal.

00:23:50.243 --> 00:23:51.370
I love daal.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:55.239
This meal was not light
on the grease or butter,

00:23:55.239 --> 00:23:58.191
but it sure was well worth it.

00:23:58.191 --> 00:24:01.806
Really good flavor, and
this is just a classic

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:03.806
my kind of a restaurant.

00:24:06.035 --> 00:24:07.868
Yes, I love to travel.

00:24:08.946 --> 00:24:13.919
I'm travelling for eating.
For all of the good food.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.836
You like the food here?

00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:18.584
Yes?

00:24:18.584 --> 00:24:19.417
Okay good.

00:24:20.284 --> 00:24:23.448
Nice to meet you, very nice to meet you.

00:24:23.448 --> 00:24:25.494
From here we're just going
to walk back to the hotel.

00:24:25.494 --> 00:24:29.847
It's been a long but
another excellent day.

00:24:29.847 --> 00:24:33.151
There's so many things
that happen in one day

00:24:33.151 --> 00:24:34.811
when you are in India.

00:24:34.811 --> 00:24:36.448
Yeah, it's been another great day.

00:24:36.448 --> 00:24:38.564
