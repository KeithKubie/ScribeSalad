00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.440
We know that an
element is defined

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.350
by the number of protons it has.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.401
For example, potassium.

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.150
We look at the periodic
table of elements.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.700
And I have a snapshot of
it, of not the entire table

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.720
but part of it here.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.920
Potassium has 19 protons.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.360
And we could write it like this.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.818
And this is a little
bit redundant.

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:18.280
We know that if it's potassium
that atom has 19 protons.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.720
And we know if an
atom has 19 protons

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.260
it is going to be potassium.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.920
Now, we also know that not all
of the atoms of a given element

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.260
have the same
number of neutrons.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.340
And when we talk
about a given element,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.070
but we have different
numbers of neutrons

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.640
we call them isotopes
of that element.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.930
So for example,
potassium can come

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.980
in a form that has
exactly 20 neutrons.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.230
And we call that potassium-39.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.760
And 39, this mass
number, it's a count

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.710
of the 19 protons
plus 20 neutrons.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.780
And this is actually the most
common isotope of potassium.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.360
It accounts for, I'm
just rounding off,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.760
93.3% of the potassium that
you would find on Earth.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.040
Now, some of the other
isotopes of potassium.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.240
You also have potassium--
and once again writing

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.490
the K and the 19 are a
little bit redundant--

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.530
you also have potassium-41.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.460
So this would have 22 neutrons.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.580
22 plus 19 is 41.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.180
This accounts for about 6.7%
of the potassium on the planet.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.550
And then you have a
very scarce isotope

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.890
of potassium called
potassium-40.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.030
Potassium-40 clearly
has 21 neutrons.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.380
And it's very, very,
very, very scarce.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.010
It accounts for only 0.0117%
of all the potassium.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.590
But this is also the
isotope of potassium

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.350
that's interesting to us
from the point of view

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.490
of dating old, old rock, and
especially old volcanic rock.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.680
And as we'll see, when you
can date old volcanic rock

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.530
it allows you to date
other types of rock

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.810
or other types of fossils
that might be sandwiched

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.900
in between old volcanic rock.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.570
And so what's really interesting
about potassium-40 here

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.192
is that it has a half-life
of 1.25 billion years.

00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:17.400
So the good thing about
that, as opposed to something

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.950
like carbon-14, it can
be used to date really,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.520
really, really old things.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.160
And every 1.25
billion years-- let

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.660
me write it like this,
that's its half-life--

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.460
so 50% of any given
sample will have decayed.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.785
And 11% will have
decayed into argon-40.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.530
So argon is right over here.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.690
It has 18 protons.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.960
So when you think about
it decaying into argon-40,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.050
what you see is that
it lost a proton,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.060
but it has the same mass number.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.640
So one of the protons must of
somehow turned into a neutron.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.240
And it actually captures
one of the inner electrons,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.827
and then it emits
other things, and I

00:03:03.827 --> 00:03:05.660
won't go into all the
quantum physics of it,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.380
but it turns into argon-40.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.686
And 89% turn into calcium-40.

00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:15.060
And you see calcium on the
periodic table right over here

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.480
has 20 protons.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.760
So this is a situation
where one of the neutrons

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.287
turns into a proton.

00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:22.120
This is a situation
where one of the protons

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.710
turns into a neutron.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.640
And what's really
interesting to us

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.520
is this part right over here.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.170
Because what's cool about argon,
and we study this a little bit

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.150
in the chemistry playlist, it is
a noble gas, it is unreactive.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.230
And so when it is embedded
in something that's

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.310
in a liquid state it'll
kind of just bubble out.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.160
It's not bonded to
anything, and so it'll just

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.950
bubble out and just go
out into the atmosphere.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.990
So what's interesting
about this whole situation

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.950
is you can imagine what happens
during a volcanic eruption.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.410
Let me draw a volcano here.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.670
So let's say that
this is our volcano.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.160
And it erupts at some
time in the past.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.795
So it erupts, and you have
all of this lava flowing.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.070
That lava will contain some
amount of potassium-40.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.779
And actually, it'll
already contain

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.805
some amount of argon-40.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.410
But what's neat
about argon-40 is

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.600
that while it's lava, while it's
in this liquid state-- so let's

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.400
imagine this lava
right over here.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.890
It's a bunch of stuff
right over here.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.020
I'll do the potassium-40.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.600
And let me do it in a color
that I haven't used yet.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.010
I'll do the
potassium-40 in magenta.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.090
It'll have some
potassium-40 in it.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.090
I'm maybe over doing it.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.940
It's a very scarce isotope.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.040
But it'll have some
potassium-40 in it.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.280
And it might already have some
argon-40 in it just like that.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.187
But argon-40 is a noble gas.

00:05:03.187 --> 00:05:04.520
It's not going to bond anything.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.980
And while this lava
is in a liquid state

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.090
it's going to be
able to bubble out.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.420
It'll just float to the top.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.640
It has no bonds.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.687
And it'll just evaporate.

00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:15.770
I shouldn't say evaporate.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.720
It'll just bubble
out essentially,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.460
because it's not
bonded to anything,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.990
and it'll sort of just seep out
while we are in a liquid state.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.820
And what's really
interesting about that

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.778
is that when you have
these volcanic eruptions,

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:32.900
and because this argon-40
is seeping out, by the time

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.490
this lava has hardened
into volcanic rock--

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.230
and I'll do that volcanic
rock in a different color.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.910
By the time it has
hardened into volcanic rock

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.360
all of the argon-40
will be gone.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.960
It won't be there anymore.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.680
And so what's neat is, this
volcanic event, the fact

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.800
that this rock
has become liquid,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.600
it kind of resets the
amount of argon-40 there.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.310
So then you're only going to
be left with potassium-40 here.

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.280
And that's why the argon-40
is more interesting,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.317
because the calcium-40 won't
necessarily have seeped out.

00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:11.400
And there might have already
been calcium-40 here.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.775
So it won't
necessarily seep out.

00:06:12.775 --> 00:06:15.010
But the argon-40 will seep out.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.560
So it kind of resets it.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.275
The volcanic event resets
the amount of argon-40.

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.240
So right when the
event happened,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.580
you shouldn't have any argon-40
right when that lava actually

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.980
becomes solid.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.850
And so if you fast forward
to some future date,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.840
and if you look at the sample--
let me copy and paste it.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.980
So if you fast forward to
some future date, and you

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.542
see that there is some
argon-40 there, in that sample,

00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:54.350
you know this is
a volcanic rock.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.450
You know that it was due to
some previous volcanic event.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.675
You know that this argon-40 is
from the decayed potassium-40.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.190
And you know that it has decayed
since that volcanic event,

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.709
because if it was there before
it would have seeped out.

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:17.250
So the only way that this would
have been able to get trapped

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.760
is, while it was liquid
it would seep out,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.670
but once it's solid it can
get trapped inside the rock.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.560
And so you know the only
way this argon-40 can

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.920
exist there is by decay
from that potassium-40.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.720
So you can look at the ratio.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.170
So you know for every
one of these argon-40's,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.580
because only 11% of the decay
products are argon-40's,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.650
for every one of
those you must have

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.150
on the order of about nine
calcium-40's that also decayed.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.940
And so for every one of these
argon-40's you know that there

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.425
must have been 10
original potassium-40's.

00:07:56.425 --> 00:07:57.800
And so what you
can do is you can

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.840
look at the ratio of the
number of potassium-40's there

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.330
are today to the number
that there must have been,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.902
based on this evidence right
over here, to actually date it.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.360
And in the next
video I'll actually

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.140
go through the
mathematical calculation

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.111
to show you that you
can actually date it.

00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:12.610
And the reason this
is really useful

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.110
is, you can look
at those ratios.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.179
And volcanic eruptions
aren't happening every day,

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:20.720
but if you start looking over
millions and millions of years,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.220
on that time scale,
they're actually

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.520
happening reasonably frequent.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.040
And so let's dig in the ground.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.450
So let's say this is the
ground right over here.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.600
And you dig enough and you
see a volcanic eruption,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.115
you see some volcanic
rock right over there,

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:38.240
and then you dig even more.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.440
There's another layer of
volcanic rock right over there.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.850
So this is another
layer of volcanic rock.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.460
So they're all going to have a
certain amount of potassium-40

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.900
in it.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.420
This is going to have some
amount of potassium-40 in it.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.060
And then let's say this one
over here has more argon-40.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.411
This one has a little bit less.

00:09:00.411 --> 00:09:02.910
And using the math that we're
going to do in the next video,

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.790
let's say you're
able to say that this

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.820
is, using the half-life, and
using the ratio of argon-40

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.190
that's left, or using the
ratio of the potassium-40 left

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.200
to what you know was there
before, you say that this must

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.600
have solidified 100
million years ago, 100

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.090
million years
before the present.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.909
And you know that this layer
right over here solidified.

00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:27.700
Let's say, you know it
solidified about 150

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.220
million years
before the present.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.870
And let's say you feel pretty
good that this soil hasn't been

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.810
dug up and mixed or
anything like that.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.810
It looks like it's been
pretty untouched when

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.570
you look at these soil
samples right over here.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:45.040
And let's say you see
some fossils in here.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.070
Then, even though carbon-14
dating is kind of useless,

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.410
really, when you get
beyond 50,000 years,

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.170
you see these fossils in
between these two periods.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.670
It's a pretty good
indicator, if you

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.910
can assume that this soil hasn't
been dug around and mixed,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.710
that this fossil is
between 100 million and 150

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.680
million years old.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.120
This event happened.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.730
Then you have these
fossils got deposited.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.049
These animals died, or
they lived and they died.

00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:13.840
And then you had this
other volcanic event.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.690
So it allows you, even though
you're only directly dating

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.650
the volcanic rock,
it allows you,

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.430
when you look at the layers,
to relatively date things

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.000
in between those layer.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.140
So it isn't just about
dating volcanic rock.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.590
It allows us to date things
that are very, very, very old

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.530
and go way further back in time
than just carbon-14 dating.
