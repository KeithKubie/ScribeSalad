00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.940

notice that things are processing so in

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950
notice that things are processing so in
 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.310
notice that things are processing so in
that case I think the solution here is

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320
that case I think the solution here is
 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.650
that case I think the solution here is
actually not to use a progress dialog

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660
actually not to use a progress dialog
 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.560
actually not to use a progress dialog
and this I think it goes a little bit

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570
and this I think it goes a little bit
 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.150
and this I think it goes a little bit
beyond the problem you you're describing

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160
beyond the problem you you're describing

here I honestly think they're ugly I

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660
here I honestly think they're ugly I
 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.140
here I honestly think they're ugly I
think a much better solution is to try

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150
think a much better solution is to try
 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.449

would be after like that say 200

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400
would be after like that say 200
 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.369
would be after like that say 200
milliseconds at that point track your

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:05.379
milliseconds at that point track your
 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.309
milliseconds at that point track your
progress and say like fun 99% through

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319
progress and say like fun 99% through
 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.749
progress and say like fun 99% through
there's no point in putting up a

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759
there's no point in putting up a
 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.850
there's no point in putting up a
dialogue for a millisecond but if I'm

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860
dialogue for a millisecond but if I'm
 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.709
dialogue for a millisecond but if I'm
only ten percent of the way through it's

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:13.719
only ten percent of the way through it's
 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:15.119
only ten percent of the way through it's
going to be like I was sufficient length

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:15.129
going to be like I was sufficient length
 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:17.010
going to be like I was sufficient length
of the user going to see going to see or

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.020
of the user going to see going to see or
 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.990
of the user going to see going to see or
want to see the dialogue and at that

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000
want to see the dialogue and at that
 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.300
want to see the dialogue and at that
point put it up that is if you decide we

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310
point put it up that is if you decide we
 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.649
point put it up that is if you decide we
still want to go the mobile dialogue

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:22.659
still want to go the mobile dialogue
 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.320
still want to go the mobile dialogue
route in general I would agree with

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330
route in general I would agree with
 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.879
route in general I would agree with

team could post the written answers to

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:37.689
team could post the written answers to
 

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:40.200
team could post the written answers to
the questions asked in the moderator so

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.210
the questions asked in the moderator so
 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.700
the questions asked in the moderator so
that the people could quickly view all

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710
that the people could quickly view all
 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.579
that the people could quickly view all
the answers and even search to find the

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:44.589
the answers and even search to find the
 

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.429
the answers and even search to find the
answers as well that's an excellent

00:07:47.429 --> 00:07:47.439
answers as well that's an excellent
 

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:49.290
answers as well that's an excellent
suggestion so we're good on with that

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.300
suggestion so we're good on with that
 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.600
suggestion so we're good on with that
though is that means we have to go and

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:51.610
though is that means we have to go and
 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.939
though is that means we have to go and
re-watch the entire video afterwards so

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:53.949
re-watch the entire video afterwards so
 

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:56.279
re-watch the entire video afterwards so
I'm instead of spending an hour every

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:56.289
I'm instead of spending an hour every
 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:57.540
I'm instead of spending an hour every
week in here answering questions we're

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.550
week in here answering questions we're
 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.610
week in here answering questions we're
not spending two hours mination to Daryl

00:07:59.610 --> 00:07:59.620
not spending two hours mination to Daryl
 

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.040
not spending two hours mination to Daryl
prep time and that's time that we're not

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.050
prep time and that's time that we're not
 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.379
prep time and that's time that we're not
going and building other things so I

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:04.389
going and building other things so I
 

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:06.450
going and building other things so I
think we'll have to find a creative

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:06.460
think we'll have to find a creative
 

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.040
think we'll have to find a creative
solution to this if anybody there are

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.050
solution to this if anybody there are
 

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.540
solution to this if anybody there are
you out there watching live wants to

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:09.550
you out there watching live wants to
 

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.610
you out there watching live wants to
volunteer and be a scribe maybe that

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:11.620
volunteer and be a scribe maybe that
 

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.159
volunteer and be a scribe maybe that
would be a good idea but yeah I think

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:14.169
would be a good idea but yeah I think
 

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:16.619
would be a good idea but yeah I think
just having us go and post them is it's

00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:16.629
just having us go and post them is it's
 

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:18.869
just having us go and post them is it's
a great idea in theory in practice it's

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879
a great idea in theory in practice it's
 

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:21.119
a great idea in theory in practice it's
a little tough to pull off we do record

00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:21.129
a little tough to pull off we do record
 

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:22.649
a little tough to pull off we do record
them though right we did well we have

00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:22.659
them though right we did well we have
 

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:23.999
them though right we did well we have
the this whole stream is record to

00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:24.009
the this whole stream is record to
 

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:25.360
the this whole stream is record to
youtube so you can go through and

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.370
youtube so you can go through and
 

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.610
youtube so you can go through and
but yeah really there was something nice

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:27.620
but yeah really there was something nice
 

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.469
but yeah really there was something nice
about having text answers right yeah we

00:08:29.469 --> 00:08:29.479
about having text answers right yeah we
 

00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:33.070
about having text answers right yeah we
could tag the youtube video to at least

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080
could tag the youtube video to at least
 

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.110
could tag the youtube video to at least
give you some hint of the types of

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120
give you some hint of the types of
 

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.940
give you some hint of the types of
things that we've discussed on it that

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:36.950
things that we've discussed on it that
 

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.140
things that we've discussed on it that
goes back to the same problem that we

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.150
goes back to the same problem that we
 

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.190
goes back to the same problem that we
have to go and watch the stream again

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200
have to go and watch the stream again
 

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.110
have to go and watch the stream again
and then it becomes another hour now a

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120
and then it becomes another hour now a
 

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.790
and then it becomes another hour now a
little button we can push many jump to

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800
little button we can push many jump to
 

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.680
little button we can push many jump to
each next thing that inserted a marker

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:44.690
each next thing that inserted a marker
 

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.380
each next thing that inserted a marker
that would make it a lot quicker well

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:47.390
that would make it a lot quicker well
 

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.730
that would make it a lot quicker well
that will have to experiment right if we

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:48.740
that will have to experiment right if we
 

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.530
that will have to experiment right if we
can find a good solution easy but I hear

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:50.540
can find a good solution easy but I hear
 

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.510
can find a good solution easy but I hear
you I agree we I think we just need a

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:52.520
you I agree we I think we just need a
 

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.710
you I agree we I think we just need a
creative solution to make it quite right

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:53.720
creative solution to make it quite right
 

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.500
creative solution to make it quite right
yeah it probably won't be a direct

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:56.510
yeah it probably won't be a direct
 

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.690
yeah it probably won't be a direct
written transcript to everything because

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:58.700
written transcript to everything because
 

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.610
written transcript to everything because
first of all that would take a lot of

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:00.620
first of all that would take a lot of
 

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.560
first of all that would take a lot of
time and second of all not all of the

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:02.570
time and second of all not all of the
 

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.210
time and second of all not all of the
things that we say are really worth

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:04.220
things that we say are really worth
 

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.750
things that we say are really worth
writing down and sometimes our answer is

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760
writing down and sometimes our answer is
 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.850
writing down and sometimes our answer is
we don't have an answer or sometimes our

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:09.860
we don't have an answer or sometimes our
 

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.920
we don't have an answer or sometimes our
answer is we can't come and comment on

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:11.930
answer is we can't come and comment on
 

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.710
answer is we can't come and comment on
that so that's probably a very little

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720
that so that's probably a very little
 

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.570
that so that's probably a very little
used to write down but there's other

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:16.580
used to write down but there's other
 

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.130
used to write down but there's other
things that we could probably do that

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.140
things that we could probably do that
 

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.260
things that we could probably do that
would be useful so want to think about

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.270
would be useful so want to think about
 

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.700
would be useful so want to think about
it you could go and take our android

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:21.710
it you could go and take our android
 

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.269
it you could go and take our android
phones and just put it on on speech to

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279
phones and just put it on on speech to
 

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.530
phones and just put it on on speech to
text mode and just have it go and

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:26.540
text mode and just have it go and
 

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.150
text mode and just have it go and
transcribe everything for us live I

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160
transcribe everything for us live I
 

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.890
transcribe everything for us live I
think YouTube does that for you already

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:29.900
think YouTube does that for you already
 

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.320
think YouTube does that for you already
yeah you can do captions I'm not sure

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.330
yeah you can do captions I'm not sure
 

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.720
yeah you can do captions I'm not sure
how it all works yeah well usually ends

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:34.730
how it all works yeah well usually ends
 

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.940
how it all works yeah well usually ends
with rather hilarious results yeah

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:36.950
with rather hilarious results yeah
 

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.949
with rather hilarious results yeah

is it more effective to code blind and

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:23.009
is it more effective to code blind and
 

00:18:23.009 --> 00:18:24.799
is it more effective to code blind and
deal with any issues that pop up one by

the thing you have to watch out for is

00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:39.269
the thing you have to watch out for is
 

00:18:39.269 --> 00:18:41.930
the thing you have to watch out for is
not so much current or previous bugs

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940
not so much current or previous bugs

like that so but most important things

00:21:52.959 --> 00:21:52.969
like that so but most important things
 

00:21:52.969 --> 00:21:54.699

make sure that you do not have the

00:21:54.699 --> 00:21:54.709
make sure that you do not have the
 

00:21:54.709 --> 00:21:56.319
make sure that you do not have the
buttons of shame because we see that

00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:56.329
buttons of shame because we see that
 

00:21:56.329 --> 00:21:58.719
buttons of shame because we see that
again and again so if you don't know

00:21:58.719 --> 00:21:58.729
again and again so if you don't know
 

00:21:58.729 --> 00:22:01.440
again and again so if you don't know
what the button of shame is if you run a

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:01.450
what the button of shame is if you run a

not have a hardware menu button we make

00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:10.609
not have a hardware menu button we make

not have a hardware menu button we make
a software menu button appear and it's a

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:12.769
a software menu button appear and it's a
 

00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:15.729
a software menu button appear and it's a
rather jarring experience because if you

00:22:15.729 --> 00:22:15.739
rather jarring experience because if you
 

00:22:15.739 --> 00:22:17.139
rather jarring experience because if you
haven't used ice cream sandwich yet

00:22:17.139 --> 00:22:17.149
haven't used ice cream sandwich yet
 

00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:19.119
haven't used ice cream sandwich yet
you'd know that the menu button is

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:19.129
you'd know that the menu button is
 

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:21.879
you'd know that the menu button is

solving it in most cases is just as
 

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.719

what that means is basically your app

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:02.690
what that means is basically your app
 

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.690
what that means is basically your app
needs to run everywhere and if you don't

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:04.700

good view of the fixed number of rows of
 

00:23:13.879 --> 00:23:15.459
good view of the fixed number of rows of
equal height and have them fill the

00:23:15.459 --> 00:23:15.469

00:23:22.089 --> 00:23:22.099
occupy the rest of the parent layout I'd
 

00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:29.049
occupy the rest of the parent layout I'd
like to use adapters I'm just ring up

00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:29.059
like to use adapters I'm just ring up
 

00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:30.940

the question here except just right so

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:30.950
the question here except just right so
 

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.279
the question here except just right so
it's a column view and fixed number of

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:33.289
it's a column view and fixed number of
 

00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:36.459
it's a column view and fixed number of

with fixed number of rows of equal

00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:39.109
with fixed number of rows of equal
 

00:23:39.109 --> 00:23:40.690
with fixed number of rows of equal

the rest of the parent left I'm not sure
 

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:48.310
the rest of the parent left I'm not sure
what that means yeah

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320
what that means yeah
 

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.519
what that means yeah
I would just say um let's look at the

00:23:51.519 --> 00:23:51.529
I would just say um let's look at the
 

00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:53.110
I would just say um let's look at the
first question how can I have a great

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120
first question how can I have a great
 

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.360
first question how can I have a great
view the fixed number of rows of equal

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:55.370
view the fixed number of rows of equal
 

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.120
view the fixed number of rows of equal
height and have it so that they that

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:58.130
height and have it so that they that
 

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.740
height and have it so that they that
this set of rows fills the screen for a

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:02.750
this set of rows fills the screen for a
 

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.850
this set of rows fills the screen for a
number of rows whatever like four so I

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:06.860
number of rows whatever like four so I
 

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.269
number of rows whatever like four so I
think in that case it's just a matter of

00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279
think in that case it's just a matter of
 

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:12.430
think in that case it's just a matter of
you can set the grid view itself to go

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440
you can set the grid view itself to go
 

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.830
you can set the grid view itself to go
and fill parents but I assume you want

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840
and fill parents but I assume you want
 

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.060
and fill parents but I assume you want
to go and evenly arrange the rows or do

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.070
to go and evenly arrange the rows or do
 

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.049
to go and evenly arrange the rows or do
you want to go and have them have a

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:20.059
you want to go and have them have a
 

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:22.960
you want to go and have them have a
fixed height I assuming you want to go

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:22.970
fixed height I assuming you want to go
 

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.100
fixed height I assuming you want to go
and dynamically adjust them you know it

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:27.110
and dynamically adjust them you know it
 

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.299
and dynamically adjust them you know it
almost sounds into this is no list view

00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:31.309
almost sounds into this is no list view
 

00:24:31.309 --> 00:24:34.450
almost sounds into this is no list view
it's just a static grid view right so it

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:34.460
it's just a static grid view right so it
 

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.940
it's just a static grid view right so it
looks like using a doctor though so it's

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:36.950
looks like using a doctor though so it's
 

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.230
looks like using a doctor though so it's
got to be tied to a list view right I

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240
got to be tied to a list view right I
 

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.100
got to be tied to a list view right I
yeah I'm assuming that he's got rows of

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.110
yeah I'm assuming that he's got rows of

00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:48.409
equal that no matter what number of rows
 

00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:50.649
equal that no matter what number of rows
they are they should all be of the same

00:24:50.649 --> 00:24:50.659
they are they should all be of the same
 

00:24:50.659 --> 00:24:53.169
they are they should all be of the same
height and they should all you know

00:24:53.169 --> 00:24:53.179

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:24.830
at your stack of letting the stack
 

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.590
at your stack of letting the stack
overflow question I have a few views

that I have to place in a four by six

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:31.220
that I have to place in a four by six
 

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.070
that I have to place in a four by six
grid each of the view should have the

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.080
grid each of the view should have the
 

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.590
grid each of the view should have the
same width and the same height and fill

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600
same width and the same height and fill
 

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.869
same width and the same height and fill
the screen what I want to use this grid

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:37.879

that I can use a stretch mode in grid

00:25:42.399 --> 00:25:42.409
that I can use a stretch mode in grid
 

00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:44.470
that I can use a stretch mode in grid
view which sets equal with each of its

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480
view which sets equal with each of its
 

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.169
view which sets equal with each of its
children I want to also use it to set

00:25:47.169 --> 00:25:47.179
children I want to also use it to set
 

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:48.730

equal height and fill the screen

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:48.740
equal height and fill the screen
 

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.730
equal height and fill the screen
vertically can I achieve this by using

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:51.740
vertically can I achieve this by using
 

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.399
vertically can I achieve this by using
many of grid view or if not possible

00:25:54.399 --> 00:25:54.409
many of grid view or if not possible
 

00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:56.680
many of grid view or if not possible
then grid layout I'm looking for grid

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:56.690
then grid layout I'm looking for grid
 

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.539

layouts and using weights because I have

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:00.450
layouts and using weights because I have
 

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.930
layouts and using weights because I have
uses the grid items and i would love to

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:02.940
uses the grid items and i would love to
 

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.210
uses the grid items and i would love to
use adapters rather than coding for each

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220
use adapters rather than coding for each
 

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.840
use adapters rather than coding for each
element okay well first thing trying to

avoid using linear lab if you can you

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:10.530
avoid using linear lab if you can you
 

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:11.870
avoid using linear lab if you can you
can usually pull off the same thing with

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880
can usually pull off the same thing with
 

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.720
can usually pull off the same thing with
relative layout right better performance

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:13.730
relative layout right better performance
 

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.770
relative layout right better performance
now as far as the rest of your question

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:15.780
now as far as the rest of your question
 

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.970
now as far as the rest of your question
I'm going to be honest I actually don't

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980
I'm going to be honest I actually don't
 

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.330
I'm going to be honest I actually don't
know because this is not something that

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340
know because this is not something that
 

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.670

was on the air I totally asked him and

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240
was on the air I totally asked him and
 

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.760
was on the air I totally asked him and
he probably have the answer right at the

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:25.770
he probably have the answer right at the
 

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.400
he probably have the answer right at the
top of his head does anybody else in the

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:28.410
top of his head does anybody else in the
 

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.870
top of his head does anybody else in the
room happen to know how did it go and

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880
room happen to know how did it go and
 

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.230

pull us off the top of their head I

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240
pull us off the top of their head I
 

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.230
pull us off the top of their head I
would say that if you've got a fix grid

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240
would say that if you've got a fix grid
 

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.850
would say that if you've got a fix grid
with it where you know the number of

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860
with it where you know the number of
 

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.870
with it where you know the number of
rows and columns um i would use table

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880
rows and columns um i would use table
 

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.650
rows and columns um i would use table
layout myself yeah i don't click grid

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:45.660
layout myself yeah i don't click grid
 

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.020
layout myself yeah i don't click grid
layout is the right yeah cool ism well

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.030
layout is the right yeah cool ism well
 

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.010
layout is the right yeah cool ism well
except you said he wanted to use

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020
except you said he wanted to use
 

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.750
except you said he wanted to use
adapters I don't think you can with

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760
adapters I don't think you can with
 

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.970
adapters I don't think you can with
table layout that is probably why right

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980
table layout that is probably why right
 

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:58.400
table layout that is probably why right
he's working off this approach but i

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:58.410
he's working off this approach but i
 

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.340
he's working off this approach but i
don't i'm not experienced enough at

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:01.350
don't i'm not experienced enough at
 

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:08.600
don't i'm not experienced enough at
manipulating grid layout or to say or

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:08.610
manipulating grid layout or to say or
 

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:14.480
manipulating grid layout or to say or
grid view i mean ah yeah so I think my

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:14.490
grid view i mean ah yeah so I think my
 

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.950
grid view i mean ah yeah so I think my
guess is you probably gonna have to look

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960
guess is you probably gonna have to look
 

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.890
guess is you probably gonna have to look
at a different at a different approach

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900
at a different at a different approach
 

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.470
at a different at a different approach
to it doesn't seem to me like reveal

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480
to it doesn't seem to me like reveal
 

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.870
to it doesn't seem to me like reveal
lets you have that fine-grained control

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880
lets you have that fine-grained control
 

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.630
lets you have that fine-grained control
of I want the Rose to me you know this

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640
of I want the Rose to me you know this
 

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.850
of I want the Rose to me you know this
tall and only for that tall and you're

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860
tall and only for that tall and you're
 

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.260
tall and only for that tall and you're
gonna have to make dynamic adjustments

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.270
gonna have to make dynamic adjustments
 

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.880
gonna have to make dynamic adjustments
for that anyway because of screen sizes

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:31.890
for that anyway because of screen sizes
 

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.940
for that anyway because of screen sizes
because you can't assume a fixed screen

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:34.950
because you can't assume a fixed screen
 

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.390
because you can't assume a fixed screen
you know height for example so I'm not

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400
you know height for example so I'm not
 

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.790
you know height for example so I'm not
sure what you're trying to do is going

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:40.800
sure what you're trying to do is going
 

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.280
sure what you're trying to do is going
to fit that you might have to you know

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.290
to fit that you might have to you know
 

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.370
to fit that you might have to you know
except some amount of space above or

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380
except some amount of space above or
 

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.740
except some amount of space above or
below in order to deal with that now you

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:48.750
below in order to deal with that now you
 

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.880
below in order to deal with that now you
always could go and modify grid layout

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:51.890
always could go and modify grid layout
 

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.110
always could go and modify grid layout
yeah Gridley a good view they're both

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120
yeah Gridley a good view they're both
 

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.810
yeah Gridley a good view they're both
open source so you can either just go

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820
open source so you can either just go
 

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.160
open source so you can either just go
and subclass them if that gives you the

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.170
and subclass them if that gives you the
 

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.320
and subclass them if that gives you the
functionality you want or just go and

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:00.330
functionality you want or just go and
 

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.180
functionality you want or just go and
grab the source wholesale and go and

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:02.190
grab the source wholesale and go and
 

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.410
grab the source wholesale and go and
make your own copy that gives you the

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:03.420
make your own copy that gives you the
 

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.540
make your own copy that gives you the
behavior that you want so that's always

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:05.550
behavior that you want so that's always
 

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.049
behavior that you want so that's always
an option

00:28:07.049 --> 00:28:07.059
an option
 

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:09.289
an option
and might not be a bad one in this case

00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299
and might not be a bad one in this case
 

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:11.549
and might not be a bad one in this case
I'm just waiting for somebody to go and

00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559
I'm just waiting for somebody to go and
 

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:12.659
I'm just waiting for somebody to go and
hop on there and tell me I'm horribly

00:28:12.659 --> 00:28:12.669
hop on there and tell me I'm horribly
 

00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:15.539
hop on there and tell me I'm horribly
wrong here but might be the easy

00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:15.549
wrong here but might be the easy
 

00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:22.169
wrong here but might be the easy
solution okay um we can move on and I

00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:22.179
solution okay um we can move on and I
 

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:24.690
solution okay um we can move on and I
think there's a question here about the

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:24.700
think there's a question here about the
 

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.779
think there's a question here about the
fragment API in the fragment API is

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:27.789
fragment API in the fragment API is
 

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:29.850
fragment API in the fragment API is
there a difference between calling get

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:29.860
there a difference between calling get
 

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.119
there a difference between calling get
activity fine view by ID and get you

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:33.129
activity fine view by ID and get you
 

00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:35.850
activity fine view by ID and get you
find by ID is there a reason to use one

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:35.860
find by ID is there a reason to use one
 

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.980
find by ID is there a reason to use one
or the other ah get-get view fine bye as

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:40.990
or the other ah get-get view fine bye as
 

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.009
or the other ah get-get view fine bye as
in find my ID being called on a view yes

00:28:44.009 --> 00:28:44.019
in find my ID being called on a view yes
 

00:28:44.019 --> 00:28:47.100
in find my ID being called on a view yes
all right um yeah so if you do it on the

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:47.110
all right um yeah so if you do it on the
 

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.779
all right um yeah so if you do it on the
activity it'll be are all of these under

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:48.789
activity it'll be are all of these under
 

00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:50.369
activity it'll be are all of these under
that activity but if you call it on a

00:28:50.369 --> 00:28:50.379
that activity but if you call it on a
 

00:28:50.379 --> 00:28:52.590
that activity but if you call it on a
view then the search will be reduced to

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600
view then the search will be reduced to
 

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.549
view then the search will be reduced to
that view and it's children so if for

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559
that view and it's children so if for
 

00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:58.039
that view and it's children so if for
instance if you think of a list view and

00:28:58.039 --> 00:28:58.049
instance if you think of a list view and
 

00:28:58.049 --> 00:29:00.629
instance if you think of a list view and
you have a the name of you have the idea

00:29:00.629 --> 00:29:00.639
you have a the name of you have the idea
 

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:02.759
you have a the name of you have the idea
of a certain text field you call it on

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:02.769
of a certain text field you call it on
 

00:29:02.769 --> 00:29:04.080
of a certain text field you call it on
the list view and there's like 20 30

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:04.090
the list view and there's like 20 30
 

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.090
the list view and there's like 20 30
different possibilities for it but if

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:06.100
different possibilities for it but if
 

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.710
different possibilities for it but if
you call on a view that represents one

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720
you call on a view that represents one
 

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.600
you call on a view that represents one

question seems to be like how can i make

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:25.300
question seems to be like how can i make
 

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.090
question seems to be like how can i make
my appt me one of the suggested terms

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:27.100
my appt me one of the suggested terms
 

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.400
my appt me one of the suggested terms
and I think the standard answer to that

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:29.410
and I think the standard answer to that
 

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.320
and I think the standard answer to that
is make it as awesome as you possibly

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:31.330
is make it as awesome as you possibly
 

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.600
is make it as awesome as you possibly
can and that's the way to get it as a

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:33.610
can and that's the way to get it as a
 

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.090
can and that's the way to get it as a
search term so i think we'll close on

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:36.100
search term so i think we'll close on
 

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.770
search term so i think we'll close on
that one right okay let's move on oh go

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:40.780
that one right okay let's move on oh go
 

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:49.710
that one right okay let's move on oh go
ahead um the question is can i unlock

more locale go to unlocks locales yeah
 

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:03.690
more locale go to unlocks locales yeah
I'm not familiar with that app so my

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:03.700
I'm not familiar with that app so my
 

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.350
I'm not familiar with that app so my

it's not really designed for that so
yeah I'm kind of scratching my head

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:22.460
yeah I'm kind of scratching my head
 

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.970
yeah I'm kind of scratching my head
about how how this would be possible

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:24.980
about how how this would be possible
 

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.340
about how how this would be possible
because yet the intent shows up it

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:27.350

creates the Christie instance then it
goes away the intent is not persisting

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:32.420

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.359
who thought the exact same thing who
weren't that guy and then they will buy

00:40:14.359 --> 00:40:14.369
weren't that guy and then they will buy
 

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:17.930
weren't that guy and then they will buy
your app but that's that's the easiest

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940
your app but that's that's the easiest
 

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.010
your app but that's that's the easiest
way to do it yeah um I would add that if

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020
way to do it yeah um I would add that if
 

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.130
way to do it yeah um I would add that if
you're stuck for ideas for apps going on

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140
you're stuck for ideas for apps going on
 

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:29.660
you're stuck for ideas for apps going on
to google play store and look at some of

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:29.670
to google play store and look at some of
 

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:32.540
to google play store and look at some of
the apps that are there that that would

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:32.550
the apps that are there that that would
 

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.840
the apps that are there that that would
interest you and try to without you know

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:35.850
interest you and try to without you know
 

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.280
interest you and try to without you know
obviously you can't take a look at their

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:37.290
obviously you can't take a look at their
 

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.690
obviously you can't take a look at their
code without taking a look at

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700
code without taking a look at
 

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.940

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160
getting practice in implementing ideas
 

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:53.359
getting practice in implementing ideas
for apps and that's part of coming up

00:40:53.359 --> 00:40:53.369
for apps and that's part of coming up
 

00:40:53.369 --> 00:40:56.510
for apps and that's part of coming up
with app ideas is first of all being

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520
with app ideas is first of all being
 

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.180
with app ideas is first of all being
ready to tackle something quickly once

00:40:59.180 --> 00:40:59.190
ready to tackle something quickly once
 

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.849
ready to tackle something quickly once
you come up with the idea and then my

00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859
you come up with the idea and then my
 

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:04.700
you come up with the idea and then my
own feeling about coming up with ideas

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:04.710
own feeling about coming up with ideas
 

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.630
own feeling about coming up with ideas
for apps is to stop thinking about them

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640
for apps is to stop thinking about them
 

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.980
for apps is to stop thinking about them
usually you come up with good ideas when
