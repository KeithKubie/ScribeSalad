00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.269
so betrayal is a very tough thing and
 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.990
so betrayal is a very tough thing and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000
it's part of giving trust is the odds
 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.970
it's part of giving trust is the odds
are you will be betrayed at some point

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980
are you will be betrayed at some point
 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.789

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799
in time so so getting good at dealing
 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.710
in time so so getting good at dealing
with betrayal is a really important

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720
with betrayal is a really important

with betrayal is a really important
thing and I think it starts with

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349
thing and I think it starts with
 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.780
thing and I think it starts with
realizing that you have joint ventured

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790
realizing that you have joint ventured
 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.659
realizing that you have joint ventured
the betrayal you've had a part to do

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669
the betrayal you've had a part to do
 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.010
the betrayal you've had a part to do
with it it could be that you trusted

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020
with it it could be that you trusted
 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.389
with it it could be that you trusted
when you shouldn't have trusted you

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:27.399
when you shouldn't have trusted you
 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.040
when you shouldn't have trusted you
didn't think about whether the person

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050
didn't think about whether the person
 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.560
didn't think about whether the person
had high character was competent and had

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570
had high character was competent and had
 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.600
had high character was competent and had
the authority and therefore shame on you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610
the authority and therefore shame on you
 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.540
the authority and therefore shame on you
we don't like to take responsibility for

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550
we don't like to take responsibility for
 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.400
we don't like to take responsibility for
that but I think if you step back and

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410
that but I think if you step back and
 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.549
that but I think if you step back and
say how did I participate in this I

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559
say how did I participate in this I
 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.220
say how did I participate in this I
think that gives you insight and a sort

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230
think that gives you insight and a sort
 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.630
think that gives you insight and a sort
of the first ability to start

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640
of the first ability to start
 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.579
of the first ability to start
approaching it in a way that allows you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589
approaching it in a way that allows you
 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.349
approaching it in a way that allows you
to heal because that's really what you

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359
to heal because that's really what you
 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.029
to heal because that's really what you
want to do in a betrayal is you want to

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039
want to do in a betrayal is you want to
 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.040
want to do in a betrayal is you want to
heal as fast as you can

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050
heal as fast as you can
 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.439
heal as fast as you can
and so I think it really helps to do

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449
and so I think it really helps to do
 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.500
and so I think it really helps to do
that so anytime you're betrayed you feel

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510
that so anytime you're betrayed you feel
 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.930
that so anytime you're betrayed you feel
alone if you're like why me you have the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940
alone if you're like why me you have the
 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.290
alone if you're like why me you have the
poor Me's and you feel like you've been

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300
poor Me's and you feel like you've been
 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.850
poor Me's and you feel like you've been
attacked and it's all unfair and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860
attacked and it's all unfair and
 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.800
attacked and it's all unfair and
everything I think if you if you step

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810
everything I think if you if you step
 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.980
everything I think if you if you step
back and say everybody's been betrayed

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
back and say everybody's been betrayed
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.420
back and say everybody's been betrayed
everybody knows what this feels like

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430
everybody knows what this feels like
 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.150
everybody knows what this feels like
and people get over it and therefore I'm

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160
and people get over it and therefore I'm
 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.240
and people get over it and therefore I'm
not alone in this and I can learn from

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250
not alone in this and I can learn from
 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.690
not alone in this and I can learn from
other people and this too will pass so

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700
other people and this too will pass so
 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.340
other people and this too will pass so
sometimes when you're in the midst of it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350
sometimes when you're in the midst of it
 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.900
sometimes when you're in the midst of it
and you're dealing with it and it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910
and you're dealing with it and it's
 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.060
and you're dealing with it and it's
acute it feels like it's all you can

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070
acute it feels like it's all you can
 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.680
acute it feels like it's all you can
think about you wake up in the middle of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690
think about you wake up in the middle of
 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.030
think about you wake up in the middle of
the night it's the first thing on your

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040
the night it's the first thing on your
 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.240
the night it's the first thing on your
mind when you start your day it stays

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250
mind when you start your day it stays
 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.980
mind when you start your day it stays
with you throughout the day and you

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990
with you throughout the day and you
 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.500
with you throughout the day and you
start to marinate in it and I think it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510
start to marinate in it and I think it's
 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.390
start to marinate in it and I think it's
really helpful to step back and say this

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400
really helpful to step back and say this
 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.190
really helpful to step back and say this
has happened to other people before and

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200
has happened to other people before and
 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.010
has happened to other people before and
therefore I will get through this so

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020
therefore I will get through this so
 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.650
therefore I will get through this so
sometimes people betray us and it's not

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660
sometimes people betray us and it's not
 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.240
sometimes people betray us and it's not
that serious they didn't deliver a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250
that serious they didn't deliver a
 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.910
that serious they didn't deliver a
project on time or on budget or they

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920
project on time or on budget or they
 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.560
project on time or on budget or they
didn't get the report done right or they

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
didn't get the report done right or they
 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.840
didn't get the report done right or they
didn't double-check their spelling or

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
didn't double-check their spelling or
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.480
didn't double-check their spelling or
their all kinds of levels of betrayal

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490
their all kinds of levels of betrayal
 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.590
their all kinds of levels of betrayal
and some of them really are just fumbles

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600
and some of them really are just fumbles
 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.790
and some of them really are just fumbles
stumbles poor judgment or whatever

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800
stumbles poor judgment or whatever
 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.170
stumbles poor judgment or whatever
others are really very serious where

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180
others are really very serious where
 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.449
others are really very serious where
somebody has cheated you or told a lie

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459
somebody has cheated you or told a lie
 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.509
somebody has cheated you or told a lie
or spread gossip or something like that

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519
or spread gossip or something like that
 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.369
or spread gossip or something like that
so I think you have to you have to sort

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379
so I think you have to you have to sort
 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.950
so I think you have to you have to sort
of calibrate what is the nature of

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960
of calibrate what is the nature of
 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.050
of calibrate what is the nature of
this betrayal if it is one of the former

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060
this betrayal if it is one of the former
 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.880
this betrayal if it is one of the former
I think you can step in and say we need

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
I think you can step in and say we need
 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.380
I think you can step in and say we need
to come to an understanding so this

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390
to come to an understanding so this
 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120
to come to an understanding so this
doesn't happen again

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130
doesn't happen again
 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.010
doesn't happen again
many times it's really just a question

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020
many times it's really just a question
 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.350
many times it's really just a question
of get having clarity around things and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360
of get having clarity around things and
 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.810
of get having clarity around things and
the betrayal is overcome if it is

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820
the betrayal is overcome if it is
 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.000
the betrayal is overcome if it is
something more serious than that it may

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010
something more serious than that it may
 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.250
something more serious than that it may
take a whole lot more work and that work

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
take a whole lot more work and that work
 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.450
take a whole lot more work and that work
may not be worth it

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460
may not be worth it
 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.580
may not be worth it
in many cases it is not worth it if

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590
in many cases it is not worth it if
 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.260
in many cases it is not worth it if
somebody certain kinds of betrayal are

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
somebody certain kinds of betrayal are
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.610
somebody certain kinds of betrayal are
just not worth fixing so if you've been

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
just not worth fixing so if you've been
 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.820
just not worth fixing so if you've been
betrayed there are sometimes there are

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830
betrayed there are sometimes there are
 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.060
betrayed there are sometimes there are
elements for example if it's just bad

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070
elements for example if it's just bad
 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.610
elements for example if it's just bad
information or you can fix it quickly if

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620
information or you can fix it quickly if
 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.460
information or you can fix it quickly if
it's early on in somebody's career fix

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
it's early on in somebody's career fix
 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.240
it's early on in somebody's career fix
it quickly

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250
it quickly
 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.060
it quickly
don't let the betrayal Fester don't

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070
don't let the betrayal Fester don't
 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.740
don't let the betrayal Fester don't
allow it to go on deal with it

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
allow it to go on deal with it
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.230
allow it to go on deal with it
immediately so fix those kinds of things

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240
immediately so fix those kinds of things
 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.170
immediately so fix those kinds of things
quickly because otherwise they get worse

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180
quickly because otherwise they get worse
 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.750
quickly because otherwise they get worse
and they you may bury them for a while

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760
and they you may bury them for a while
 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.670
and they you may bury them for a while
only to see them raise their head in an

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
only to see them raise their head in an
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.030
only to see them raise their head in an
uglier form down the road so I think you

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040
uglier form down the road so I think you
 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.580
uglier form down the road so I think you
want to address even the beginnings of

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
want to address even the beginnings of
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.320
want to address even the beginnings of
something that feels like it might be a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330
something that feels like it might be a
 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.480
something that feels like it might be a
betrayal even one of these minor

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490
betrayal even one of these minor
 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.280
betrayal even one of these minor
betrayals so this idea about being

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
betrayals so this idea about being
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.390
betrayals so this idea about being
realistic about the potential for

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400
realistic about the potential for
 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.790
realistic about the potential for
recovery really comes into assessing the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800
recovery really comes into assessing the
 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.650
recovery really comes into assessing the
nature of the betrayal if it is a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660
nature of the betrayal if it is a
 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.270
nature of the betrayal if it is a
serious betrayal an infidelity something

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280
serious betrayal an infidelity something
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.010

the way that I've done that is I really

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539
the way that I've done that is I really
 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.119
the way that I've done that is I really
realize that when I'm starting to think

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129
realize that when I'm starting to think
 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.830
realize that when I'm starting to think
about the future and I'm no longer

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840
about the future and I'm no longer
 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.020
about the future and I'm no longer
waking up thinking about what happened

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030
waking up thinking about what happened
 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.909
waking up thinking about what happened
then I've actually that's a first step

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919
then I've actually that's a first step
 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.219
then I've actually that's a first step
towards forgiveness and so I think the

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229
towards forgiveness and so I think the
 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.469
towards forgiveness and so I think the
faster you can get to the future the

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479
faster you can get to the future the
 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.300
faster you can get to the future the
more likely you are to to be able to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310
more likely you are to to be able to
 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.790
more likely you are to to be able to
forgive and so I always encourage people

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800
forgive and so I always encourage people
 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.040
forgive and so I always encourage people
to get on to the next project at a young

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.950
to get on to the next project at a young

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.080
entrepreneur one time who'd had a
difficult experience and I said go put

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090
difficult experience and I said go put
 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.450
difficult experience and I said go put
some points on the board that's the only

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460
some points on the board that's the only
 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.369
some points on the board that's the only
way that you'll feel better is go score

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379
way that you'll feel better is go score
 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.969
way that you'll feel better is go score
some some baskets and I think it's the

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979
some some baskets and I think it's the
 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.699
some some baskets and I think it's the
same in betrayal
