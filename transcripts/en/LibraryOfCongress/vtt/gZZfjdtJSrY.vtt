00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.390
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deneb: It's lovely
to hear this buzz in the room

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.880
and the -- feel the excitement.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.670
So, good morning.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.970
Good morning everybody.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.180
And thank you all for coming
to this first ever symposium

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
on the Sasanian Empire, here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.960
Thank you Congressmen
Raskin for taking the time

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.000
from your very busy
schedule to be with us.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.330
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of the
African and Middle East Division.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.090
This division has organized
this conference here

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.300
in the Thomas Jefferson
building of the Library.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.750
And this symposium is
part of an annual series

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.990
that this division holds on
the ancient civilizations

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.640
of the Middle East that go
back many thousands of years.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.910
But let me first start by
introducing Mark Sweeney,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.290
the Associate Librarian of Library
Services who will welcome you

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.310
to the Library of Congress.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.290
Mark Sweeney begin his career at
the Library of Congress in 1987

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.130
in the Serial and Government
Publications Division.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.160
He then rose through the ranks
becoming unit supervisor,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.320
reference librarian, and reference
specialist, and eventually served

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.160
as head of the newspaper section.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.440
In July 2002, Mark began
coordinating the libraries work the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.180
Unites States Newspaper Program,
a cooperative national effort

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.730
to locate, catalogue, and preserve
microfilm newspapers published

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.620
in the United States from the
18th Century to the present.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.570
So, you can imagine
how many millions

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.690
of pages were preserved that way.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.260
The following year, he
was selected to be chief

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.140
of the Library's Preservation
and Reformatting Division.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.650
He then became Chief
of the Humanities

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.980
and Social Science Division.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.410
And in 2012 he became
Director of Preservation.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.740
Three years later in 2015, he
was appointed by the Librarian

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.710
of Congress as Associate
Librarian of Library Services.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.450
Mark Sweeney earned a Bachelor of
Arts degree from McGill University

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.130
on Montreal, Canada and a
Master's Degree in Library Science

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.890
from Catholic University.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.690
Mark Sweeney.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.830
[ Applause ]

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.050
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Good
morning, Congressman Raskin,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.850
distinguished guests, ladies
and gentlemen, I'm Mark Sweeney,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.860
Associate Librarian
for Library Services.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.010
It's my pleasure, on
behalf of Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.170
the Librarian of Congress,
to welcome you to the Library

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.560 position:56%
on the occasion of today's symposium

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.260
on the ligancy of the
Sasanian Empire.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.210
This symposium of the first one
ever held on the Sasanian Empire,

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.080
the last of the major ancient
pre-Islamic Persian empires.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.900
The Sasanian Empire extended
from the near east to central

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.150
and south Asian over a span
of more than 400 years.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.650
Furthermore, the empire
left a rich cultural legacy

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.380
that shaped the region and defined
elements of Iranian identity

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.960
that remain conspicuous
up to the present day.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.260
The holdings of the Library

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.540
of Congress include the world's
largest collection of books,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.430
monographs, serials, maps,
and many other materials

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.050
about the Sasanian period.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.850
Today you will find a selection
of these items from the collection

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.490
on display in the African and
Middle Eastern conference room here

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.010
in the Thomas Jefferson
building through those doors.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.910 position:56%
For their support of this symposium,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.410 position:56%
I wish to thank the Iranian American
Alumni of the Alborz High School

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.730
and their distinguished
representative, Mr. Yousef Javadi,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.090
and Mrs. Saghi MoJabal
who have worked with us

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.080
to develop the program
for this event.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.970
I also want to acknowledge the help
of the Persian Studies Department

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.500
at Princeton University and the
University of California Irvine,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.540 position:56%
which have assisted our section with
the organization of the conference.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.920
Thank you all for coming.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.960
I hope today's consideration
of the contours and the impact

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.360
of the Sasanian Empire will
be thoroughly provocative

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.660
and enlightening.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.960
Now it's my pleasure to introduce
the United States Congressman Jamie

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.350
Raskin of Maryland's 8th
Congressional District.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.150
Congressman.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.850
[ Applause ]

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.220
&gt;&gt; Jamie Raskin: Good
morning everybody.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.380
I just wanted to come by to
extend my greetings to all

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.680 position:56%
of the renowned [inaudible] and
historians and experts who have come

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.170
to assemble for this conference.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.150
And on the way over I had a call

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.540 position:56%
from my friend Sarusha Habi [assumed
spelling] -- who I see here --

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.200
who told me about these terrible
terror attacks that took place

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.980
in Tehran that we're just learning
about with many people killed.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.460
And so, I didn't want the moment
to pass without expressing sympathy

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.300
and solidarity with
the people of Tehran.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:48.210
But also, to say that the work
that you're engaged in today,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.830
and the work that many of you do

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.840
with your professional career is
the very opposite of terrorism,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.350
which is the destruction
of the past,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.810
and the present, and the future.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.420
And you guys are engaged in the
work of recovering what is great,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.710
and what is meaningful, and what
is salvable from the past in order

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.510
to make our lives clearer
today and in order

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.310
to make the future a better one.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.990
Always loved something I read from
William Faulkner who said that,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.240
"The past isn't dead,
it isn't even past."

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.480 position:56%
I think it was Cicero who said that,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.020
"Not to know what happened
before you were born is always

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.110
to remain a child."

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.920 position:56%
And so, the work that you're engaged
in of excavating, and rescuing,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.800
and resurrecting the greatness

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.810
of the Sasanian Empire is
actually essential work.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.170
And so, I salute you for it.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.730
I also need to apologize.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.680
One, because I have
absolutely nothing to contribute

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.360 position:56%
to your proceedings, and two because
I really should be here learning.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.910 position:56%
But three, I can't stay because I --

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.840
a meeting has been
called across the street

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.500
and I've got to go back to it.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.470
But I didn't want the moment to
pass by without welcoming you all

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.510
to Washington and thanking you
for doing what you're doing.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:25.000
[ Applause ]

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.840
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank
you Congregant Raskin.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.040
And now let me introduce Yousef
Javadi and also his wife,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.600
Saghi MoJabal, two people
who have been an inspiration

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.320
to us all here in this division.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.190
It was thanks to their
enthusiasm for this project

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.220
and their initiative to bring
together the Alborz U.S. alumni

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.040
to support this project, and thanks
to their own very generous support

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.610
that this event was made possible.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.580 position:56%
Saghi MoJabal was also the person
who worked tirelessly to raise funds

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.430
for our Persian book
exhibit, <i>A Thousand Years</i>

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.910
<i>of the Persian Book </i>,
which we'll never forget.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.110
But Yousef Javadi is a
co-founder of LTN Global

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.380
and its President and CEO.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.240
He's an accomplished
entrepreneur and executive leader

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.550
in both telecom services
and IP technology.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.990
Yousef Javadi brings over 25 years
of experience in starting, growing,

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.420
and running global businesses.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.680
So, you see, we do not
deal only with the past,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.030
but also dealing with the future.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:38.460
He has been President of
Nextone Communications,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.230
a privately held provider
of software products,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:46.040
as well as President of Sprint
International where he ran all

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.080
of Sprint's businesses, alliances,
and relationships outside

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.310
of the U.S. Under Mr.
Javadi's leadership

00:08:53.310 --> 00:09:00.720 position:56%
and direction Sprint built its next
generation global internet backbone.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.220 position:56%
Prior to that he has held other
important global executive positions

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.940
including head of the billion
dollar North American operations

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.580
of Primus Telecom, President
of a wireless messaging unit

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:21.190 position:56%
at GE Capital, and Vice-President of
Global Sales and Marketing at OTI,

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.880
a startup satellite company
that was sold to MCI.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.510
Mr. Javadi holds a BSC, a Bachelor
in Science, a Master's in Science

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:38.210
and Engineering from MIT, and an
MBA from Harvard Business School.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.780
So, he will now make some remarks.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.580
Mr. Javadi.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:50.270
[ Applause ]

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.570
&gt;&gt; Yousef Javadi: Good morning.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.090
I have the privilege to welcoming
you to this wonderful symposium

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:01.060
on behalf of the Labors High
School alumni in the United States.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.370
When the Library presented the
idea of this symposium to my wife

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.190
and I some months ago we
were extremely excited.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.630
We were excited because of
how strongly this institution

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.710
and this topic resonates
with us and our core values.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.420
Values that were developed
and embedded in us

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.090
through our maturing
years and especially,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.430
through our educational
upbringing in Iran.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.430
It reminded us of what we
were taught at school in Iran

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:35.210
and my alma mater, Alborz High
School, as a great example of that.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.270
And because of this
strong correlation,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.170
we felt that sponsoring
this event under the banner

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.260
of Alborz High School would
be particularly appropriate.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.270
We presented the idea to
Alborz alumni here in the U.S.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:54.200
who were quick to embrace it
and stepped up to support it.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.620
My alma mater, Alborz High School,
was founded nearly 144 years ago

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.410
in Tehran and is known as
one of the most prestigious

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.800
and rigorous high schools
is Iran and beyond.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.100
The goal of this school
was to produce graduates

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.410
who have the skills and education
to contribute to the betterment

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.930
of their communities and the
world in which they lived.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.860
Alborz's graduates include some

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.750
of the world's most renowned
thought leaders, entrepreneurs,

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.700
scientists, and academics.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.820 position:56%
Many of these graduates of my
generation reside in the U.S. today.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.590
However, the school is
continuing its work and tradition

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.890
in its place of founding.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:41.530
The events that the Library hosts
and in particular this symposium,

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.320
embody core values
that all Alborz's --

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.160
and I feel mostly Iranian
Americans -- share deeply.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.920
We want to encourage and support
educational programs which draw

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.970
on leading scholars
for the benefit of all.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.880
Two underlying themes of
today's gathering are fundamental

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.910
to all Alborz's.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.040
First, is the value of
education and higher learning.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.990
We feel the critical task of any
society and government is to focus

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.680
on and promote excellence
in education.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.400
Science and technology,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.120
and knowledge in general
are essential components

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.970
of advancement and innovation.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:34.050
As a result of our education,
we grew up to believe that facts

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.070
and knowledge rule supreme
and should be the key drivers

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.390
of how we live and work in society.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:46.080
Within this context, the
value and status of educators

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.790
and the educated is enormous.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.330
And the recognition they deserve
cannot be sufficiently underscored.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.190
We all owe a great
debt to our educators.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.250
Secondly, we have a deep
respect and appreciation

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.140 position:56%
for our ancient culture and history.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.510
As you know, Persian culture is
one of the oldest in the world,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.770
spanning over 2500 years.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.750
It is a culture that
has survived and thrived

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:18.810
over centuries despite many
challenges and disruptions.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.850
This culture is recognized for its
contribution to world literature

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.940
and art, sciences, religion,
and advanced thinking.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.670 position:56%
We are proud of the Persian identity
and relish to hear and learn

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.070
from the experts gathered
here today to discuss

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.950 position:56%
and reflect on this ancient culture.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.200
So, with that, I would like to
recognize my fellow Alborezes

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.250
who came together to
sponsor this event.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.270
Friends, thank you for keeping
our community alive and strong.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.620
This alum I group stands
ready to engage

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.530
in support similar
worthy undertakings.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.840
I would also like to recognize

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.280
and thank Congressman Jamie
Raskin for coming this morning.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.280
As an educator and an academic
Congressman Raskin understands the

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.070
value of education in
society's advancement.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.400
We're fortunate to have a
thoughtful representative

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.540
like him in The House.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.840
Thank you Congressman.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.630
I think he left already, but
I want to especially recognize

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.140
and thank the Library of Congress.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.350
Particularly, the African and
Eastern Division for their vision

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.340
and the effort in promoting
a better understanding

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.650
of world cultures and literature.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.960
Thank you Mary-Jane.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.260
Thank you Jirat [assumed spelling].

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.560
Jirat is here somewhere.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:41.500
In case you don't know, the Library
is home to an amazing collection

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.740
of thousands of Persian
books, dating centuries old.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.640
The Library has been very
generous in exhibiting some

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.340
of this collection including
the other treasures they own,

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.590
and I would encourage everyone
to take the time view and benefit

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.770
from this marvelous
historical artifacts.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.760
And finally, I want to thank the
scholars who have gathered here

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.320
to share their knowledge with us.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.560
It is exceptional to see such
a scholarly group in one place

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.760
and be able to learn and cultivate
our understanding and knowledge

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.900
of a history we all hold so dear.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.040
I thank them for being here.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.730
Welcome to everyone
and enjoy the day.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.530
Thank you.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:31.260

The Persian World reference
specialist in the African

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.090
and Middle Eastern Division.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.010
It was his vision,
his determination,

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.270
and his work for the
past seven months

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:58.890
that turned an idea, a
dream, into a reality.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:05.120

who are the co-conveners

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.070
This collaboration enabled
us to bring together

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.980
for one day only these
world-renowned scholars.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:45.910
They're here from all over the
U.S., Canada, and France to share

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.190
with us their knowledge and
their research on a civilization

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.170

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:59.060 position:56%

Both of the University of Maryland.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.730
And lest you should think that a
conference such as this is easy

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.640
to organize and requires
but little effort,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.490
just consider how many people
and divisions Hirad has worked

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.590
with to make this program happen.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.300

Michael Shiat [assumed spelling] in
Cataloguing found the latest book

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.410
from Iran and it just arrived,
and he immediately catalogued it

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.830
so that it could part

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:34.850
of the Sasanian display
that we have out there.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.640
We have [inaudible] who's
the Georgian specialist

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.440
and he brought a book from
his own collection at home

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.960
so that it could be
added to the display.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:51.780 position:56%
The Geography and Map Division found
this map here, which is out there,

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.150
on the Sasanian Empire
and pulled it.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.220
Found it among five million maps.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.030
One of the largest -- well
the largest collection

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.330
of maps in the world.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:05.390
But they found one on the
Sasanian's and they pulled it out,

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.130
they scanned it, they framed
it, and they gave it to us.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.640
Which is just wonderful.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.530
And we have to thank Cynthia
Smith [assumed spelling]

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.410

They film us and then eventually
make our programs available online

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.690
for the whole world to see.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.400
So what you're going to hear
today is then going to be webcast

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.380

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.610 position:56%
So, as they say, hold onto your

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.770 position:56%
Well it's going to be exciting road.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:09.830 position:56%
So, I'm going to moderate this panel
and the way it's going to be --

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:15.460
I know we all have the programs,
but we will introduce every speaker

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:22.770
and read from the bios here
because we're being webcast.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.130

Mary-Jane and Hirad who has
sent us probably 200 emails

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.870
and gotten as many.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.760
As the alumni of the Alborz
High School, Mr. Javadi

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.100
and your wonderful wife
for making this possible.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.100
Particularly happy on behalf of
the Dr. Samuel M. Jordan Center

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.390
for Persian Studies at UC Irvine,

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.900
who Dr. Jordan established
the Alborz High School

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.040 position:56%
which was then known as the American
College if I'm not mistaken.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.410
So, we have these very
interesting connections.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.590
I have not prepared a
lecture to read from,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.450
but rather in the 20
minutes that I'm allotted

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.740
to really tell you
what this paper will be

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.580
and I'm hoping these papers will
be published together in a volume.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.540
And I think this is quite pertinent

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:39.000
with what has happened
this morning --

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.500
or yesterday in Tehran
with the bombings.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.200 position:56%
Which I just talked to my mother and
father to make sure they're okay --

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.900
and is this idea of the Iranians,

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.140
regardless of its political
situation here today

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.410
in the 21st Century or in the 6th
Century, we imagine this place

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.510
as this imaginary garden where
everything is beautiful regardless

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.970
of its political situation.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.760
And what happens when
these walls come down?

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.910
Either it's mental or
it's physical wall.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:14.290 position:56%
But I have of course not coordinated
in any way, but that is what seems

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.120
to be quite pertinent today.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.810
And so, the Sasanian
King, Iranshahr,

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.280
and the walls of his garden.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.200
I am just going to
be quite audacious

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.500
with having [inaudible] here.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.480
No I can see from back here.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.060
I'll be just fine.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.360
I'm not going to read [inaudible].

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.930
But I actually like to start
actually with Yasna Feradeine,

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:48.390
one of these important hints of
Veratustra where there is a word

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.940
at work here called Frasha, which
means the act of ferresokarti,

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.380
to make this world wonderful.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.950
And if you just read
the first passage,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:02.130
and so we maybe will be those
who make this world perfect.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:09.390 position:56%
Now, the sense of this is Veratustra
is speaking of an end of time

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.780
when the world will become perfect.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.740
It's much more in its
spiritual sense

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.950
than a real physical
sense you might say.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:22.480
The key men in Persia
who ruled in the 6th

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.240
to the 4th Century B.C. also
used this term in a different way

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.740
in rather than this world.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.720
In the corporal real world.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.610
And they use it in
describing these gardens,

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.470
buildings that they construct
throughout the empire

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:46.440
where the word Frasha is again used
in its Old Persian terminology.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:52.010
Now, we know that in old Persian
and Median the term for paradox --

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.960
a walled garden -- where according

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.170
to Herodotus they were
everything that you could imagine.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.830
A -- all the trees, plants,
animals, running water.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:06.320
And this is the sense of paradise
that we get in the Christian sense.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.510
In Old Persian, it's Paradida.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:12.190
It's median form Paradaiza,
which gives us this Paradeisos

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.930
and paradise into English.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.380
And I would suggest
just as others have,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.570
this sense of a paradise does
transfer for this Iranian world

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.940
into the Christian world.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.530
And within this garden
also Greek sources tell us

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.240
that these Persian
kings liked to garden.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.550
I do gardening as well.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.350
I just heard that it's
really good for your health.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.660
That's the only exercise I do.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.930
And so, the king as a
Gardner of course is not --

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.410
perhaps doesn't start with the
Persians, but indeed we know

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.090
that Cyrus apparently
liked to do gardening

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.080
as well as other Persian kings.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.940
So, Cyrus of Pasargadae may be one
of these ideal places of paradises

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.950
that we may imagine, and the
image that you're seeing is sort

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.080
of an early couple
centuries ago drawings

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.390
of this Pasargadae
in a walled place.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.090
In a walled garden.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:15.170
Now, Darius is describing a
Susa and perhaps the garden

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:20.880
that he has created states that
by the grace of Ahuramazda,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.000
great perfection -- frasa
-- was planned at Susa.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.900
Great perfection -- Frasa
again -- was built by him.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.390
This is what I mean by sort
of physicality as opposed

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.530
to the mental idea of
perfection in the future.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:41.960
And this sense of perfection in a
garden is very much with us already

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.690
in the 6th Century B.C. Professor
Bruce Lincoln at University

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.530
of Chicago has already -- really,

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:52.090
I think brilliantly discussed
these matters in relation

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.110
to their Achaemenid one
in his book <i>Happiness</i>

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:58.130
<i>for Mankind </i>that came out in 2012.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:03.670
And so, for the key minutes we are
well documented and knowledgeable.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.170
I would like to take this
discussion a bit forward

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.450 position:56%
and bring it to the Sasanian Empire.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.480
Because things just don't
end in the 4th Century.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.040
Ideas and sort of mentalities
and beliefs continue.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.060
The idea of walled gardens.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.470
Of course, we first will look
at the hunting grounds --

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:28.160
what we get in Middle
Persian as Paliz or Pahriz.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.720
Which is a continuation of
this Paradida or Paradiza.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.370
It is aptly discussed --

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:39.630
not discussed but actually
seen for example

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.950
on the reliefs here in [inaudible].

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:48.150
You're seeing the king [inaudible],
the second in his hunting ground.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.550
And again, a place where
there's lots of animals,

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:55.560
there's music going on,
and -- oops sorry --

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.530
and the king is hunting plenty.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.950
So that idea still
continues with us.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:05.530
Now, what I would like
to contend is Iranshahr.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:10.770
The realm of the Iranians, which
is an idea created in terms

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:15.120
of a physical space by the
Sasanians for the first time.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.760
The land of Iranians
in the 3rd Century.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.500
Again, it is a conceptual
idea of an enclosed space.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.170
It has definite boundaries.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.490
It's just not an idea that
you find in the best --

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.600
the homeland of the Iranians.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:37.690
And this enclosed space, this
Iranshahr is imagined as a garden.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.720
And the king acts very
much as it's gardner.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.000
And this will bring us just
briefly to the idea of the theory

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.460
that are discussed today, a
gardening state where the king --

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.620
or the gardener is very cognoscente
of his garden and what's in it

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.390
and what should be taken out,
and what should be around it.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:03.350
And that is quite pertinent to
this idea of the king gardener.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:08.580
Now, just to give you some sense
of this really ideas of space --

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:13.400
enclosed space -- let me briefly
and rapidly go through some

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.890
of the epic mythological and
really sort of historical documents

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.750
on the boundaries of this
Iranshahr in the Sasanian Empire.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.270
I first start with this
Middle Persian text

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.660
that I did when I was much younger.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.530
About 15 years ago.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.050
I was audacious and
probably full of mistakes.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.920
Professor Azarnouche would probably
point those out to us later on.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.390
But the text discusses the
Eastern boundary of the Iranshahr.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:43.800
In the brilliant [inaudible] he
set the miraculous [inaudible] fire

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.390 position:56%
there and he struck his lands there,
and he sent a message to a series

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:52.350
of nomadic lords, probably
Turkic lords in the East.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.650
I don't name them.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.300
WE don't need to go over all

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.600
of the [inaudible], the
various [inaudible].

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.040
And he tells them, behold my lands.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.640
Whoever beholds the
movement of these lands is

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.120
like they have rushed
into Iranshahr.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.480
So, this at least seems to be one

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.710
of these demarcation boundaries
telling your opponent outside,

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.640
please do not even look
at this land shaking,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.720
and that means you
already come there.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.680
Now, other traditions -- if you're
Iranian or part of the Iranian

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.860
or the Persian world, you know
about the Iranshahr Arish.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:34.750
When the [inaudible], he comes out
as an Arasha who later on thanks

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.140
to [inaudible] we have
this beautiful story

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:41.200
of demarcating the boundary between
Iran and what is called Turin.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.670
And then agreement is set and
Arash is going to let out an arrow

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.550
and wherever it hits,
that is the boundary.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:54.010 position:56%
and you know he tells us God's
commands of the winds bear the arrow

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.670
as far as -- as the
region of Khorasan,

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.890
and it actually hits a place
close to the river Balkh.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.920
What is really the upmost

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.460
or the Eastern boundary
of Afghanistan today?

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.220
Now, more interestingly
in the recent discoveries

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.310
in Afghanistan among the
Bactrian Documents [inaudible]

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:15.830
with Professor Learner [assumed
spelling] has published we have an

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.520
ostandar of Kadagestan.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.870
And that is really the area
-- I don't know if this works,

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:27.280
but it's all the way to the Eastern
side of the map if you can see.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.100
Really again by the Oxus River.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:34.210
So, the Oxus and Balkh seem to have
been really the Eastern boundary

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:38.400
of this world that Eastern
most Sasanian rock relief,

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.490
which was again discovered in
Afghanistan by Frantz Grenet,

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:46.220
is close to where is the
Shapur Kabeye Zardosht.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.530
Inscription tells us that these are
really the Eastern most boundary.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:56.620
Now, on the Western side it seems
that Euphrates was the other river

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.670
that seems to have been
boundary of Iranshahr.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:05.170
In terms of Sasanian
activity visa vie the Romans,

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:10.160
we know that the Romans had built
a series of forts on the Euphrates

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.560
and in fact there were
wars going on.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.970
But if you just take the
words of Fergus Millar,

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.790
one of the imminent
Roman historians,

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:21.420
the idea that the Persians
were never really interesting

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.620
in establishing themselves beyond
the Euphrates is quite clear.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.360
They were predatory until the
war activities on both sides,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.230
but Euphrates seems to have
been that Western boundary

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.690
of a mental image and sort of
a boundary for the Sasanian's.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.000
If you look at Sasanian Mints,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000
again all the Western mints do
not really go beyond Euphrates.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.230
And here's our image of all of
these cities with possible mints.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.430
And again, it's the
west is the Euphrates

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:56.790
and that should also tell
us something in terms

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:01.030
of this Western mentality
of the Sasanian's.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:04.360
This idea is I think beautifully
captured in the preface

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.910
to the old Shahname, what is known
as a Shahname of Abu Mansuri.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.150
Where it says the boundaries
of Iranshahr --

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.520
this is 10th Century by the way --
of Iranshahr is from Amu Darya --

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.760 position:56%
Oxus to Forat -- Euphrates river and
these other regions are around it.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.890
And from these seven regions
Iranshahr is the greatest.

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:25.190
This is of course part of the sort

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:28.430
of imperial [inaudible]
propaganda of we're the best.

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.000
Which the Romans did
and the Chinese did.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.760
And anyone who had an empire
late antiquity tried to do.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.230
So, this is this idea of the
two rivers acting as a boundary.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:45.430
Now, Sasanians as gardeners,
they had to reclaim this land

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:51.000 position:56%
and the way they renamed cities gave
significance to each of the regions,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.230
provinces, and the cities.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.450
And of course, they
built walls around it.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:57.010
And this is what gardeners do.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.130
They till the land,
they reorganize it.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.100
And if you look at the province --

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.100
for example, I've given you
four -- of Media up north.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.780
Azerbaijan, northwest.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.670
Fars in southwest and
Sistan in the southeast.

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.740
All of these regions begin

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.820
to have significance
historically and religiously.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:20.160
Zoroaster's career in Sistan
he was born up North in Media.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.750
In Azerbaijan there's in
memorial fire at Shiz and so on.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.140
At Persepolis of course becomes
half the Jamshid Yima's throne.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:34.940
So, all of these places within this
boundary is given significance.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.530
Now as I mentioned,
you build a wall.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.810
And in fact, the Sasanians
build several walls.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:44.870
The most important one and I
think majestic one is the Barrier

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.290
of Alexander, [inaudible]
otherwise known

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.230
as [inaudible], but
also other walls.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:54.750
The last one is called [inaudible]
which means the Wall of the Arabs.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:59.530
And these walls were built to keep
people from the north and the south

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:00.930
to keep people from
the North and the South

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.480
or regulate their movement
you might say, in a way.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.910
And I had to put a picture
of myself, you know,

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.390
this is narcissism to some extent.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.710
But this is actually the
late I raja [inaudible] who I

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.690
like to remember took me on
this trip to see the walls.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.990
he said, where do you want to go?

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:19.290
[Inaudible].

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.590
I said, I want to see the walls.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.890
Okay, let's get on the Jeep and go.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.370
And we found -- and as you can
see the remnants of Saddi Iskandar

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:31.100
where the midevil Arabic text
[inaudible] also tells us it was

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.520
during the time of Postrave and
[inaudible] in the 6th Century

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.200
that this wall was built as an
obsticle against the Nomads.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.680
Now I may use the Turks
at that time,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.430
but could have been
the Huns much earlier.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:50.150 position:56%
And this wall of Iskandar -- Sadd-i
Iskandar or the Wall of Gorgan is --

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.400
goes from the Caspian
through the mountains.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.150
It's about 195 kilometers
long with 33 forts.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:59.920
It is indeed the longest
ancient wall in antiquity.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.620
We usually know about the Roman
walls and the Chinese walls.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:09.760
But in fact, the longest continuous
wall in antiquity is this Wall

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.170
of Gorgan, which was
meant to keep people --

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:16.450
and these are probably nomadic
people coming from the north

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.830
which have been recently
published by Nakedness, Sauer,

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.940
and several other scholars.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.860
On the west side of the Caspian
we have [inaudible], Darband Wall,

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:33.230
which was also 40 kilometers long
and it had seven gates and we find

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.820
so far there have been 35 middle
Persian inscriptions that need

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.500
to be reread again, but mostly --
or 31 of them rather than 25 seem

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.970
to have maybe belong to
the Aburbadagan amargar.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.180
The Accountant of Azerbaijan
who was visiting the wall

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.990
to make sure the wall was kept
up and the [inaudible] are paid.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.860
The IRS of the Sasanian
Empire was at work

00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.410
and you know you do
not kid with them.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:04.400
Again, we have lots of textual
sources for these walls.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.880
Again, all pointing to the time
of Hosrove I in the 6th Century.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.180
[Inaudible].

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.670
So, the Empire as a Garden.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:18.040
So, you built this wall, you
have this sort of physical space.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.340
So, who dwells in it?

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.640
Who should?

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.430
And who should stay
out of this paradise?

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.510 position:56%
And I think the Persian tiles from
much later on and the carpet itself.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:31.380 position:56%
The Persian carpets really sort of
bring forth this idea of a paradise.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.680
This garden.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.980
And that is part of
this part of this sort

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.500
of Persian heritage
of a Persian garden.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.800
Mimicking it.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.400
Even when the king sits on
a carpet within a garden.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.690
That again is part
of that tradition.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:47.080
Now, just to point out that
the Sasanians were interested

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.310
in gardening very early on,
there's a Manichaean text

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.500
from the 3rd Century that
I would like to mention.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.290 position:56%
If anybody took Parthenon Manichaean
I think you would have had

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.820
to read Mary Boyce Reader
where this section Mihr-Shah,

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.370 position:56%
who is the brother of kind of Shapur
the 1st and the 4th Century is

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:12.350
with Mani, and he's an unbeliever
going to Manichaean text.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:16.980
And King Mihr-Shah says to Mani,
in the paradise of which you speak,

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.900
is there a garden such as mine?

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:23.150
Again, the Persian king is boasting
as a gardener in the 3rd Century.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:27.050
And then Mani showed him the
Paradise of Light, a garden.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:31.080
With all kinds of things, and
other desirable sights there.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.460
Almost like the Herodotus
description of actually a paradise

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.760
in the [inaudible] period.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:45.400
And within this garden, in fact
it is imagined in textual sources

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.480
as a paradise, in a
paradisiacal state.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.280
And this should also remind us of
the investa and the story of Yima

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.580
in [inaudible] to where he creates
this beautiful sort of enclosure

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.530
where all the animals, all the
living beings, all that is good.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.300
Is enclosed there.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.380
And the Sasanians created this
idea of Erih, Iranianness,

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.680
and they gave values to it and
discussed it in the literature.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.340
And they said within this
Iranshahr there is order --

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.110
the order of the king
-- and there is beauty.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:20.770
And of course it's the King's
Justice that keeps this idea going.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.430
And that is a theme that we find
in Middle Eastern Literature.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:28.960
The idea of sort of a just
state and the Circle of Justice.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.650
Which has a much more ancient
tradition but certainly

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:36.270
in the early Islamic period it
borrows from the Sasanian times.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:39.690
Now, if there is this
beauty, justice, and order,

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:43.030
what happens with the "weeds"?

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.330
If you want to say that.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.900
And that brings us
I think to Mazdak.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:52.020
If you know about Iranian history,
Mazdak is one of these priests --

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.970
Zorastrin priests in the late-5th,

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:58.630
6th Century who makes certain
adjustments to Zoroastrian law,

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:02.480
which doesn't sit well with the
rest of the priestly I think group,

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:07.910
and the king uses him for
to make certain changes

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.850
and when Joseon comes
in eradicates him.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.960
And Shahnameh has this very
beautiful I think almost sort

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.170
of real image of what is going

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.470
on when the Mazdakites
are put to death.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.190
It's part of the Shahnameh
draft taken

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.140
from Dick Davis's [assumed
spelling] translation.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.140
This is Kasra of Joseon I.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:28.050
In Jiro's palace, there
was a garden.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.790
Again, a garden -- we can't
get away from this garden --

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:33.780
with the high walls around it.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.530
Pariesus. Again, we're
still with that image.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.880
It was dug up from the end to end

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.370
and Mazdak's followers
were planted there head

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:46.600
down with their feet
in the air like trees.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.780
So, you can see what the
gardener has done this time.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:53.230
He rather sorts of took the
weeds and put them in backwards.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.190
And the story goes that
he invites Mazdak --

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.970
he says, come and see
what you have planted.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.230
So again, this idea of
the king as the gardener.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.430
And you can see the
image from the Shahnameh

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:06.450
where the followers are sort of put
down is again, very much with us.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:10.050
Now, if you organize
inside, what about outside?

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:14.350
Well, the propaganda that is
given here is that the outside

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:19.010
where the nomads reside, the Huns,
the Bedouins, the Hephthalites,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.030
and the Turks are seen in
certain Middle Persian texts.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.790
Certainly apocalyptic texts as sort

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:28.650
of the demonic fishers [inaudible]
use for their coming [inaudible]

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:32.310
or to rush as demonic
nature but also

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.050
as they describe these
two legged wolves and so

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.350
on that we find in [inaudible].

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:40.930
He's very much given
specific sort of images

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:44.450
of these people who dwell outside.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.000
And this barrier, these
walls is supposed

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.620
to keep these people
from out -- from inside.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.050
Where outside there's disorder,
injustice, and it's quite barren.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.440
So, I've just taken an image of
the other side of the [inaudible]

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:04.760 position:56%
or the Sasanian wall where it is the
devilish space in a sense as opposed

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:09.180
to the order, the beautiful sort
of Zoroastrian orderly inside.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:16.020
And this again is part of the
Old Iranian Zoroastrian tradition

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.810
where we find in the
Avesta the Story of Jamshid

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:23.120
where he has built this
primordial paradise.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.150
And Yima built a Vara -- which is
[inaudible] the word wall in fact,

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:30.770
where placing everything
that is good in it.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:35.840 position:56%
And of course, outside is cold,
it's sort of full of death and evil.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.550
So again, this inside/outside
is very much with us.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.750
I would content that Khusro
I, the great Sicilian ruler

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:45.180
in the 6th Century created
this paradise imagery based

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.920
on this Avestan narrative as well.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.590
Whereas, Jamshid builds the
vary, Khusro builds the walls.

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:55.800
As Jamshid keeps the good people
inside and cold and death outside,

00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.030
Khusro keeps all that is good
inside and evil is rooted out

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.360
and there's a wall around it.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:08.330
That what a garden -- in a
gardening sense state really works.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:11.900
And to really conclude I
would just like Mr. Khusro

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.850
or King Khusro [inaudible]
at least from the Shanname,

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:21.780
tell us what he really thinks
of this odd Iranshahr as one

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.370
of his sort of speeches
left after --

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:27.240
before his death cited in
Khaleghi-Motlagh's edition.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.660
I hope I can read it from here.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.740
This is his speech.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:35.990
"Iran is like a lush spring
garden where roses ever bloom.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.990
The army and weapons
are the garden's walls

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:43.900
and the lances its wall of thorns.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.070
If the garden's walls" -- again,

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.780
I want you to see this devar
being continuously repeated --

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:53.940
"are pulled down, then there
would be no difference between it

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.300
and the wilderness beyond.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.430
Take care not to destroy its walls,

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:02.920
and not to dishearten
or weaken Iranians.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.230
If you do, then raiding
and pillaging will follow

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:10.470
and also the battle cries of
the riders and the din of war.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.910
Risk not the safety of the
Iranians wives, children,

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:16.520
and lands by bad policies
and plans."

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:22.040
I think that's something that
we could all sort of understand.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.840
Thank you very much.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:34.330
[ Applause ]

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.030
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deep: What
a perfect presentation

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:41.590
for springtime and gardens.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:46.430
So, our next speaker
is Stephen Rapp,

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.920
who will talk about
Caucasian late antiquity

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:55.060
between the Byzantine
and Iranian world.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.740
Dr. Stephen Rapp is Professor
of Eurasian and World History

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.960
at Sam Houston State University.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.310
He received his PhD from
the University of Michigan

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:13.020 position:56%
in Byzantine History with a focus on
Late Antiquity and Midevil Caucasia.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:17.050
His research investigates
cross-cultural

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:22.910
and cosmopolitan fabric of Caucasia
as well as the regions membership

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:26.540
and the overlapping
Romano Byzantine, Islamic,

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:29.080
and especially Iranian worlds.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:35.240
His latest monograph, the <i>Sasanian
World Through Georgian Eyes:</i>

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.390
<i>Caucasia and the Byzantine
Commonwealth</i>

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:45.290
<i>in Late Antique Georgian Literature</i>
was published by Ashgate in 2014.

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:50.510
Dr. Rapp has conducted
archival and field work

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:54.200
in all three publics of
post-soviet Caucasia.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:49:00.660
Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia,
as well as the Russian Federation

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:05.560
and in Turkey, Jordan,
Egypt, Ethiopia, and Yemen.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.940
Among his research fellowships are
awards from Fullbright [inaudible],

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:14.910
and the Social Science
Research Council.

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:19.510
So now, Dr. Rapp.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:25.750
[ Applause ]

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:31.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Rapp: First of all, I
would like to thank the organizers

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.440 position:56%
and sponsors of this splendid event.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.990
Thank you all for coming.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:40.170
The caucuses is the
stuff of legends.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:44.090
Jews, Christians, and Muslims
imagined its towering spires

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:48.190
as the resting place of Noah's
Ark after the great deluge.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:52.500
Humanity repopulated the
earth from this second Eden.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.490 position:56%
The Ancient Greeks regarded Caucasia

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:59.370
as an exotic nearly inaccessible
land at the edge of the world.

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.720
Jason and the Argonauts
peruse the Golden Fleece here.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.080
And Prometheus had
been chained to a rock

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.100
in the foreboding Caucuses
mountains as punishment

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.400
for stealing fire from Mt. Olympus.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.950
Caucasia's association with fire
is an old one thanks in part

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:20.640 position:56%
to the petroleum deposits literally
seeping to the ground in Azerbaijan.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.100
Some scholars have even
proposed Azerbaijan

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:28.040
as the primordial homeland
of Zoroastrianism.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.340
The isthmus between the Black

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:31.850
and Caspian seas is
simultaneously been regarded

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:35.250
as an exotic and hazardous place.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:39.780
Pre-Islamic Iranians envisioned
Caucasia as the habitat of demons

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.160
on the edge of the garden
we just heard about.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.120
The menacing north.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.270
The great monotheisms of North
Afro-Eurasia perpetuated this

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:52.390
northern dread in the apocalyptic
prophesy of Gog and Magog.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:56.940
Fierce uncivilized peoples whom at
the end of time Satan would unleash

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.410
from their confinement behind
the great wall of rock,

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:02.690
that is the Caucasus Mountains.

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.900
The raising of this wall
was subsequently credited

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.580
to the world conquer
Alexander the Great.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:13.040
Today, the Caucasus remains
the stuff of legends.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.600
In our part of the world it is a
region inspiring boundless wonder

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.420
and horrific peril.

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:22.360
It is conveniently far away from
the centers of Western Europe,

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.830
yet in a globalizing world
it is not so distant at all.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:28.210
From this tension proceeds one

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:31.660
of the most durable
modern images of Caucasia.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:35.570
It's location at the juncture
between East and West.

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:39.320
This binary notion of ordering the
world with its undue privileging

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.840
of the Euro-American experience
has been massively critiqued.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.780
As demonstrated by Edward
Said and numerous others,

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.260 position:56%
East and west are the living residue

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.240
of Europe's global
imperial colonial projects

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.030
of the 19th and 20th Centuries.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:58.270
While convenient, such
met geographical concepts

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.740
like East and West are slippery.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.170
They're saturated in
ideology and ethnocentrism

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:08.330
and they are inherently
a-historical.

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.840
Nevertheless, Caucasia is said

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:14.200
to routinely occupy a space
between East and West.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.640
This morning I would like
to illustrate the fallacy

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.140
of this stubborn projection
through written sources produced

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.210
in the three kingdoms of
Late Antique Caucasia.

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:28.110
Armenia Major, the Eastern Georgian
Realm of Chartley called <i>Hiberia</i>

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:32.920
<i>in Greco Roman Sources</i>
, and Caucasian Albania.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:38.300 position:56%
If we accept Late Antique Caucasia's
position in the interstitial space

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.200
between East and West then
it would have been located

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.830
between the Greco Roman
Mediterranean

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.990
on the one end and
Iran on the other.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:51.620 position:56%
But this is problematic in two ways.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.060
First, as a growing body of
scholarship is demonstrating --

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.320
some of which was produced
by the scholars sitting

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.080
in this very room today
-- the Greco Roman

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.470
and Iranian worlds were
far more than imperial

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.430
and civilizational competitors.

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:05.970
And they were not isolated

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:09.640
by definite static and
obvious boundaries.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.160
Instead, the two imperial
enterprises were tightly interwoven

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.040
into a transcontinental
social, cultural,

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.800
political, and economic web.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:22.660
What Peter Brown termed The
World of Late Antiquity.

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.080
Such ties even encompass
models of imperial power.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.200
A second problem was seen as
Caucasia as space between worlds is

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.340
that the isthmus has
been an enduring crucible

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:37.790
across cultural encounter
throughout its lengthy history.

00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:41.160
When investigated from a
cross-cultural vantage,

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.130
Caucasia emerges not as a
dangerous exotic periphery,

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:49.250
but as one of Afro-Eurasia's
most dynamic centers alongside

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:51.140
Central Asia.

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.350
Approached as deploying a stringent
East/West divide undercut the

00:53:55.350 --> 00:54:00.300
cross-cultural interplay that is
the propellant of Late Antiquity.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.960
There are two main assumptions
underpinning Caucasia's affiliation

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.440
with the West.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.540
Around the year 1800 the German
scholar Johann Blumenbach singled

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.080
out skulls from Caucasia
and Georgia in particular

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.190
as representing humanities
most important race.

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.610
Ever since the Europeans
identification

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:22.850
as principle modern members

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:27.500
of the so-called Caucasian race
has lessened the mental distance

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.630
between Europe and Caucasia.

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:33.680
The second assumption proceeds
from the early Christianization

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:38.790
of Southern Caucasia, archelogy
established Christianity's genuine

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:43.670
presence in Caucasia no
later than the 3rd Century.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.720
In the 4th Century
the Dynastic monarchs

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.420
of Caucasia's principle
realms Armenia Major,

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.500
Carley in Eastern Georgia,

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.300
and Albania all converted
to Christianity.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:58.720
By the 5th Century various strands
of Christianity were dominant

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.400
across the Caucasian isthmus.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.100
But at no point -- certainly
not in Late Antiquity --

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.970
were Christianity and Europe
perfectly coterminous.

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.950
Nevertheless, Caucasia's early
Christianization has been widely

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:19.010
interpreted as an immutable bade
of Caucasia's connection to Europe.

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:23.090
Both assumptions had been
retrojected to remote times.

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:26.720
And when I mean remote,
I mean a long time ago.

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.810
The extraordinary discovery at
the Mona see in Southern Georgia

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:34.110
of the oldest examples of Homo
erectus discovered outside

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:38.760 position:56%
of Africa are frequently
identified as the earliest Georgians

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.050
and as the very first Europeans.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:46.920 position:56%
But words like Georgian and European
had absolutely no historical meaning

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:50.140
1.8 million years ago.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.110 position:56%
But let us return to Late Antiquity.

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:56.690
There is no historical basis
to treat Christian and European

00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:00.010
as synonyms in Late
Antiquity from about the 2nd

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:03.200
through the 8th Centuries
A.D. Furthermore,

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.470
Christianization did not
necessarily entail integration

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:08.880
to the Romano/Byzantine universe.

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.830
What is frequently called
the Byzantine Commonwealth.

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:14.130
In the case of Caucasia,

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:17.310
Christianization certainly
enabled more robust bonds

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:21.220
with Constantinople and
the Byzantine world.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:24.470
But Caucasia's existing
sociocultural fabric --

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:27.170
one that had been woven
back in the Iron Age --

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:31.680
remained fundamentally unaltered
as a result of Christianization.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:37.580
And this social fabric belonged
principally to the Iranian world.

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:42.840
Thus, as Caucasia's indigenous
Zoroastrianism's were displaced

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:46.940
across the 5th and 6th
Centuries, many other Iranian

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:50.250
and Irenic were -- or if you
prefer Persianate aspects

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:53.820
of Caucasian society
remained intact.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:57.910
And did so throughout
the premodern era.

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:01.890
So, Caucasia was not so much
a space between the Iranian

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:05.120
and Romano Byzantine
worlds, an exotic frontier

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:10.050
between civilizations, nor was
it chiefly a passive bridge

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:11.690
spanning them.

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:17.030
Instead, starting under the Acumens
and through the early modern era,

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:21.370
Caucasia was an integral component
of the Iranian cultural world.

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:24.400
The broadest meaning of Iranshahr.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.700
This was a very big garden.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:30.190
It was very diverse and had
a lot of lovely flowers.

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.990
Caucasia was a dynamic
and contributing member

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:35.800
of the cross-cultural Iranian
commonwealth stretching

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.920
from Central Eurasia --
Central Asia to Anatolia,

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.540
and south to the Horn of Africa.

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:45.370 position:56%
Across the breadth of Late Antiquity
even after Christianization,

00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:47.680
Caucasia's peoples
were firmly embedded

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.660 position:56%
in the diverse Iranian commonwealth.

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:54.420
In Late Antiquity, the Iranian
and especially Irenic features

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:58.370
of Caucasian society
account for regional cohesion

00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:01.950
at least as much As Christianity.

00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:05.740
In any case, from its inception
Christianity fit itself

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.780
to an assortment of
sociocultural frameworks

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:11.460
but not just the Greco Roman.

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:14.900
In Caucasia, this framework
was the Iranian world.

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:18.550
Now so as to better
illustrate these points,

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:21.420
let's turn to some
contemporary voices.

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:22.760
I shall make reference this morning

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.390
to the following histiographical
narratives used

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:27.850
in Late Antique Caucasia.

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:31.710
First, the Armenian narrative
of King Khosrov's conversion,

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:36.030
the source attributed to the 5th
Century writer called Agat'angelos.

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:37.330
Another Armenian text,

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:42.270
the 5th Century <i>Buzandaran pat
mutiwnk </i>or <i>The Epic Histories </i>.

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:46.780
The composite history of the land
of Albania written in Armenian

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.450
and credited to Movses Dasxuranc'i.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:53.700
And two anonymous Georgian
histories;

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.280
<i>The Life of the Kings </i>and <i>The
Life of Vaxtang Gorgasali </i>.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.620
The received forms of both
of these text are based

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.710
on a lost Georgian source
from the 6th Century.

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:06.880
Now according to all of
these Caucasian sources,

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.940
the social landscape of Late
Antique Caucasia was characterized

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:14.900
by an Irenic pattern dominated
by Dynastic aristocratic houses

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.990
and a super aristocratic family
laying claim to royal status

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:21.100
and the possession of the Farat.

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.640
Royal glory.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.920
Significantly in Caucasia,
Bishops -- Christian Bishops,

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:31.600 position:56%
fit their ecclesiastical authority
not to Roman or Roman like provinces

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.620
and capitals -- which
did not exist here,

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:38.410
but to the prevailing
noble and royal estates.

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:43.400 position:56%
Early Bishops in Caucasia held their
post by hereditary right in harmony

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.660
with the social practice
of the Iranian world

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:49.140
and certainly not according
to Roman practice.

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.590
Thus, in Armenia the family
of Gregory the Illuminator,

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:55.680
the holy man who ensured
King Khosrov's baptism

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.560
in the 4th Century,
monopolized the position

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:03.040
of Chief Prelate of Armenia Major.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.030
The integration of
early Caucasian bishops

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:09.820
within Iranshahr was manifest
in numerous other ways.

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.710 position:56%
These Christian leaders were clothed

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:15.050
in the heroic vocabulary
of the Iranian epic.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.360
A tradition enjoying tremendous
popularity throughout Caucasia.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.240
The epic history thusly describes
mid-Century Yusik the first,

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.950 position:56%
grandson of Gregory the Illuminator.

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:30.720
And I quote, "Yusik
followed the apostolic ways

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.500
of his father Vrt'anes, and was a
son like unto his father's measure.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.890 position:56%
Altogether, in all things and in all
ways, he showed his angelic traits,

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:42.590
and accomplished everything
in accordance

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:45.400
with the grace granted
to him by God.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.660
He pastured the rational
Christian folk and admonished it

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:51.320
with evangelical precepts.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.340
For he was young in years -- manure
-- victorious, tall in stature,

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.230
with a face of wondrous beauty
and grace, so that no other

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:03.390
like him could be found
anywhere on earth.

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:07.250
Pure and resplendent in spirit,
he in no way concerned himself

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:10.960
with things here below, but
from the days of his youth,

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:16.390
like a valiant armored soldier of
Christ, like a heroic champion --

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:22.160
nahadog, he defied and threatened
with victory the invisible foe.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.920
He had no knowledge of partiality
or of the respect of persons,

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:31.260
but bore the world of the Holy
Spirit like a sword at his side.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.360
Yusik's Iranian presentation
is no aberration."

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.630
In the Armenian <i>Epic Histories </i>,
such imagery reaches a crescendo

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:44.660
in the panegyric of
[inaudible] the first.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:48.760
Narses was the great-great-grandson
of Gregory the Illuminator

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.670
and the son of the Armenia
[inaudible] princess Bando Shin.

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:56.770
An obvious transcription of the
Middle Raining word for Queen.

01:01:56.770 --> 01:01:59.470
Bishops like Yusik
and Narses were deemed

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:03.150
to be epic heroes of
the Iranian kind.

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:06.710
What's more, Narses
represents the biological fusion

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:09.450
of the powerful ecclesiastical
dynastic elite --

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:12.860
the Gregorites, and the
political rulers, the Arshakuni

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.060
or the Armenia Arsichids
in a Christianizing,

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:19.430
yet profoundly Irenic society.

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:22.530
As we would expect, Iranian

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:27.180
and Irenic heroic imagery is
also applied to Caucasian kings

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.610
and their champion warriors
called [inaudible] in Armenian

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:34.380
and [inaudible] in Georgian.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.040
Christianization did
not reverse this trend.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.980
Indeed, precisely as
result of Christianization,

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.130
the Irenic epic tradition was
reinvigorated in Caucasia.

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:48.110
Not only in Armenia, a
subject extensively studied

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:50.390 position:56%
by Nina Garsyona [assumed spelling].

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:53.380
Here let us consider the
history of Agat'angelos

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.840
which describes the conversion
of King Khosrov to Christianity.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.740
Agat'angelos Armenia text commences
with the Sasanian overthrow

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.040
of the parteon [inaudible].

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.780
At the time [inaudible]
Hosrove II ruled in Armenia.

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:13.670
He was the scion of the Aermenia
Arsicad or Arshakuni House

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:17.050
and was the father of
the future King Terdod.

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:20.220
The Armenian Hosrove was
determined to exact vengeance

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.820
for the Sasanian [inaudible]
in Iran.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:28.710
According to Agat'angelos, the
time of the Parthian kingdom came

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:33.870 position:56%
to an end when sovereignty was taken
away from Artawan son of Vatars

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:37.970
on his murder by Artasir
son of Sasan.

01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:41.040
The latter was a prince from the
Province of Stahr who had come

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.400
and united the forces of the
Persians; then they abandoned,

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.710
rejected, and disdained the
sovereignty of the Parthians

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:53.730
and happily chose the sovereignty
of Artasir son of Sasan.

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:58.300
Now the sad news -- and this
is what is called sad news

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.680
of the Parthians plight reached
the Aremenia [inaudible] king

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.770
and at the start of the
next year King Hosrove began

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:08.580
to raise forces and
assemble an army.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.080
He gathered the armies of the
Albanians and the Georgians,

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.750
opened the Gates of the Alans
and the [inaudible] of Cor,

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:18.890
and brought through the
army of the Huns in order

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:22.750
to attack Persian territory
and invade Asorestan as far

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.810
as the gates of Ctesiphon.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:26.790
He ravaged the whole country,

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:30.100
ruining the populous
cities and prosperous towns.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:34.910
He attempted to eradicate,
destroy completely, extirpate

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:39.440
and overthrow Persian
-- that is Sasanian --

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:43.520
kingdom, and aimed at
abolishing its institutions.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.450
At the same time, he made an oath
to seek vengeance with great rancor

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:50.270
for their loss of sovereignty.

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:54.830 position:56%
So as to emphasize the uncompromised
legitimacy of the Parthians

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:59.110
and the blatant theft of the
authority by the upstart Sasanians,

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:02.630
some variants of Agat'angelos
incorporate the Parthian romance

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:04.580
of Arthavan and Arthashir.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:09.730 position:56%
In Late Antiquity, the obsession
with dynastic honor and vengeance is

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:15.430
as much a hallmark of the Iranian
as it is of Caucasian society.

01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:17.870
Throughout Caucasia this was
bolstered by the prevalence

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:21.850
of royal families having
strong Parthian roots.

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:26.620 position:56%
A circumstance persisting long after
the ascendency of the Sasanians.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:30.170
Significantly dynasties descended
from Parthian [inaudible]

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:34.940 position:56%
and [inaudible] monopolized all
three throes of Caucasia at the time

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.570
of their Christianization
in the 4th Century.

01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:43.510
Earlier Armenian histiography
highlights the unqualified royal

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:50.290
legitimacy of the Armenian
Arshakuni's even

01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:54.190
when specific individuals
fell short in their duties.

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:57.490
All the while, it cast
Arshakuni kingship

01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:01.140
in the familiar terms
of the Iranian world.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.630
Following an Armenia led victory

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:10.020
of the Romans the [inaudible] II
reportedly acclaimed the Armenian

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.320
[inaudible] in this manner.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:16.070
"The king of Armenia with his
own might has been our champion

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:18.850
and he has performed a
deed of such valor --

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:23.980
[inaudible] that no one else
by any means may perform it.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.770
However, relations with
[inaudible], were soured

01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:29.620
and [inaudible] invaded Armenia.

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.210
In this tense atmosphere,

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:35.520
the Armenia <i>Epic Histories</i>
repeatedly established Arshakuni

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:39.050
validity through the
supposed actions and words

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:41.410
of the Sasanian's themselves.

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.090
Arshakuni burial sites
were especially targeted

01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:46.270
by Sasanian generals.

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:48.770
Now the sad thing of such sites
would have immortalized the

01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:53.050
Armenians, but in its
account of the Iranian defeat

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.600
in the central district of Ararat,

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.500
the <i>Epic Histories</i>
reveals another objective.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.640
And the Armenians put all of them
to the sword, and they took away

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.520
from them the bones
of their own kings

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.810 position:56%
that the Persians were carrying away
into captivity to the Persian realm.

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:12.860 position:56%
For they said, according to their
heathen beliefs: "This is the reason

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:15.930
that we are taking the bones of
the Armenian kings to our realm:

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:19.550
that the glory of the kings
and the fortune and valor

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:23.570
of this realm might go from
here with the bones of the kings

01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:26.550
and entire into our realm."

01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:30.810
Needless to say, these supernatural
attributes, P'ark, baxt,

01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:35.050
k'ajut iwn -- glory,
fortune, and valor are pillars

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:38.830
of kingship not just in
Armenia, but throughout Caucasia

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:42.890
and the entire Iranian world.

01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:46.760
Georgian sources apply
equivalent Irenic imagery

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.670
to both Zoroastrian
and Christian monarchs.

01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:55.900
The most striking Christian example
is Vakhtang I Gorgasali who ruled

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.400
at the turn of the
5th and 6th Centuries.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.550
The narrative anchor of
the text known as <i>The Life</i>

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:06.940
<i>of [inaudible] </i>is a series of
single combats waged by Vakhtang.

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:11.480
This Christian hero king worsted
in turn a Hazar named Tarkan,

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:17.250
an Alan named Bakatar, a Christian
Byzantine Logotheit named Poly

01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:21.380
Carpos and an unnamed
king of Sendia.

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:24.770
Although always taking pains
to credit his royal legitimacy

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:27.390
and physical prowess
to the Christian god,

01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:30.070
Vakhtang is never made to
enter into single combat

01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:33.030
against Zoroastrian Iranians.

01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:38.950
However, under Vakhtang's command,
were many loyal Iranian champions.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:42.580
The Irenic imagery enshrouding the
Christian Vakhtang is particularly

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.450 position:56%
evident in a squirmish with Bakatar.

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:47.810
A titian hailing from
Northern Caucasia,

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:50.550
the region known as Alania.

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:53.490
And this passage was
worth quoting in full.

01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:56.790
So, you get a sense of
this Iranian type imagery.

01:08:56.790 --> 01:09:02.650
"Baqat'ar was a giant, a goliat
I, and since the time he had begun

01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:06.800
to engage in combat no one had
been able to resist him in battle,

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.810
and he had killed all
of his adversaries.

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:13.320 position:56%
This Baqat'ar stood on the bank of
a river and shouted in a loud voice,

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.180
" Oh King Vaxtang, do not be
proud of your killing of Tarq'an.

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:21.550
He was not one of the giants and
therefore he was slain by a youth."

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:25.570
Then King Vaxtang replied
to Baqat'ar saying,

01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:28.160
"No only through my own
strength did I overcome T'arq'an,

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.360
but through the strength
of my Creator.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.540
For the power of Christ is with me,

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.070
and his honorable cross
is my armor."

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:37.970
He mounted his horse, which
was covered with chain armor,

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:43.080 position:56%
he took up his shield of tiger-skin,
which a sword could not cut.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.520
Baqat'ar crossed the river
and began to shoot arrows.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.720
By the sharpness of his eyes,
the keenness of his mind,

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.890
and the agility of his horse
Vaxtang avoided the arrows.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.230
On both sides, the
sounds of trumpets

01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:58.950
and drums rose from the troops.

01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:02.020
Baqat'ar was not able to
shoot more than two arrows

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.360
at Vaxtang's shield,
and he did not hit it.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:09.410
Then he shot another arrow at
Vaxtang's horse which penetrated.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:12.600
While his horse was falling
Vaxtang rushed on Baqat'ar,

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.480
brought his sword down
on his shoulders

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.490
and penetrated to his heart.

01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:18.660 position:56%
At that moment Vaxtang's horse fell.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:23.310
He quickly put out his hand
and grasped Baqat'ar's horse.

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:25.890
First, he fell to the
ground, worshipped God,

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.560
and blessed him even
more than before.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.490
Although we don't have
time to explore it today,

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:34.580
the potent Irenic imagery found

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:39.190
in Caucasian text has abundant
visual parallels as well.

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:42.060
Most notably is in
the spread wings motif

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:47.800
that has been specially
studied by Matteo Compareti.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.260
Now, as a conclusion, I would like
to offer a few words about tensions

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.850
between Parthian's and Sasanian's.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:57.210
It goes without saying
that the Sasanian regime

01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:02.060
in many ways depended upon
Parthian elements in Iran.

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:08.350
In Caucasia, where Caucasia
Parthian royalty remained in place,

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:12.600
heavy-handed Sasanian tactics
operated alongside measures

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.630
fostering mutual confidence
and corporative governance.

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:21.070
The history of Albania reports
that Shapur II made an effort

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:24.910
to identify subject peoples who
should be honored in his court.

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:28.650
The status of the Armenians
had come into doubt

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:31.960
and the [inaudible] presented
them with an ultimatum.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.790
Demonstrate through "an ancient
book Armenian noble status,

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:44.000
lest it tells us prized cushions be
conferred upon Audian aristocrats."

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.790
The Armenian thereafter
presented Sapur with a manuscript

01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:51.600
of Agat'angelos' history, which
the King of Kings "Commanded

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:57.200
to be translated into the Persian
language and script when he learned

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.400 position:56%
that it commenced with Artasir, his
own forefather, he rejoiced greatly,

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.850
and moved to tears he praised the
book and held it before his eyes."

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:09.790
Finding therein the figure
of seventeen cushions,

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:12.050
he began to arrange
accordingly the seats

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:14.150
of everyone at the royal table.

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:18.840
Now should this reflect a genuine
event we can only conjecture

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.660
about the version of Agat'angelos'
presented to the Sasanian empower,

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.910
the surviving Armenian
variant mentions Articshir only

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:30.710
in connection with the
subjugation of Parthian

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:34.950
and Parthius fall is
openly lamented here.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:38.730 position:56%
The Greek version of
Agat'angelos' uniquely preserves the

01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:44.090
aforementioned Parthian romance
expounding upon the last Parthian

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:46.760
[inaudible] Artivan and the
rise to power of Articshir.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.350
But it can hardly be termed
as a pro-Sasanian tract.

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:54.470
In light of the considerable
reworking of Agat'angelos' cycle

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:58.430
across Late Antiquity it would
not however been difficult

01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:01.300
for Armenian [inaudible]
to modify the narrative

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.220
so as to win Shapur's favor.

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:10.490
And so, if one looks beyond
the triumph of Christianity,

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:14.830
much of the surviving Agat'angelos'
tradition would have resonated

01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:18.530
with the Sasanian's and other
Iranians for that matter.

01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:21.010
For it repeated political
and social modes

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:23.710
that circulated throughout
the Iranian world,

01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:27.360
including the heartland
of Iran itself.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.670
And this I think is the ultimate
image of Late Antique Caucasia.

01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:36.060
Not as some hinge between
the mythical East and West,

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:40.820
but as a Christianizing Irenic
society firmly implanted

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.690
in the Iranian commonwealth.

01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:44.490
Thank you.

01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:56.200
[ Applause ]

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.710
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank you
very much, Professor Rapp.

01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:06.350
And now to the third panelist,
Dr. Khodadad Rezakhani,

01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:12.490
who's a historian of late
antiquity and global history.

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:19.650
He earned his PhD from UCLA in 2010
and is current a research associate

01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:25.070
at Princeton University researching
the economic history of Central

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:29.440
and Western Asia in the
6th and 7th Centuries.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.990
He's the author of <i>Reorienting
the Sasanian's: East Iran</i>

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:39.090
<i>and Late Antiquity</i>
that's published

01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:43.180
by Edenborough University
Press this year.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:49.400 position:56%
As well as a number of articles
relating to the late antique period.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.090
His translation commentary
was [inaudible]

01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:57.020
of the Anonymous Lake Chronicle
known as <i>The Chronicle</i>

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.530
<i>of Kozikstan </i>, was
recently published in Tehran.

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:06.510
So, Dr. Khodadad Rezakhani
[inaudible] join us.

01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:12.140
[ Applause ]

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.440
&gt;&gt; Khodadad Rezakhani:
Thank you very much.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.960
While it's particularly hard
following Stephen Rapp I'm in awe

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.550
of anybody who knows Georgian
even if they are Georgian,

01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:21.940
let alone not being there.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.760
And I don't have as much
interesting stuff as you do.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.400
Thank you very much again sir.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.100
Thank you very much also for
everybody who accepted the offer --

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:35.580
invitation to show up to this
event and including the audience,

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.190
and particularly to Hirad
[inaudible] for going

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:40.430
through so much trouble
in organizing this as well

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:43.260
as the Alborz alumni
for supporting it.

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.560
Thank you very much.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.560
As it happens when people work on
a rather limited geographical area,

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.810
things start being very close.

01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:56.970
So, both of the previous speakers
said things that are related

01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:58.440
to what I'm going to present.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.870
I'm going to actually talk about
those Barbarians, the early ones

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:05.440
that Touraj mentioned,
and one of my proposals is

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.670
like what Stephen mentioned,

01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:11.860
that these peripheral people
are not that peripheral.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.820 position:56%
And we are always thinking of them
as peripheral because we are looking

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:20.240
at from a particularly
hegemonic point of view.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.390
And my idea is generally
that they are not.

01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:24.480
That second point I
don't necessarily get to,

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.140
but I did get to the Barbarians.

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:30.220
This is how I go forward
and backwards.

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:35.210
So I start a narrative here, and
the point is that narrative itself.

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:38.220
As you can see there's
a dearth of maps.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.910
So, I have found a German one.

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:43.770
It doesn't matter, same empire.

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:48.960
The areas that I'm talking about
are the areas that on this map are

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.150
in a rather generous way are shown

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:56.450
by the off-orange color
on the peripheries.

01:16:56.450 --> 01:17:00.520
And what happens to them at
the end of the Sasanian period.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.340
And particularly what
happens on the area

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:09.590
that is facing the Arabian
region, the Arabian Desert.

01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:16.340
And specifically, the events
of the -- I would say the --

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.700
about the middle of the 7th
Century, which we all knows

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.930
as the Arab/Islamic
invasions which we now put

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:26.280
at the end of the Ancient Iran.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:30.800
Although that is -- seems to be
a very modern division that is

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.210 position:56%
of little use to historical inquiry.

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:38.430
But that is the watershed
that everybody refers to.

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:42.730
So, what happens that we
get to this from that?

01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:48.640
Particularly from -- to this map of
the Islamic Caliphate and the world

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.630
that gets -- the same world
that gets -- takes over --

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:56.370
gets taken over by the new system?

01:17:56.370 --> 01:18:04.850
Well, I'm going to give you the
only text slide that I have today.

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:07.790
This is sort of a calendar
of key events as I call it,

01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:10.730
of what is going on and the
things that I want to talk about.

01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:15.900
The events I'm obviously
talking about are down the list.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:21.710
So I'm talking about things such
as 636, the Battle of Qadisiyya

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:25.810
and Yarmuk at the same years,
642, the Battle of Nahavand,

01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:28.580
which is called the
Conquest of all Conquests.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:32.080
And of course 652, the death
of Yazdgird III, which is taken

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.690
as the effective end
of the Sasanian Empire,

01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:39.110 position:56%
although we should probably consider
it about 30 years earlier than that.

01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:40.710
And how do we end up there?

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:44.240
And my narrative starts
at the top of the slide.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.290
The 484 with the Death of Peroz
the Sasanian king in a battle

01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:50.590
against the Hephthalites.

01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:52.710
One of the Barbarians
mentioned over there,

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:54.450
which are not in their own opinion

01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:58.290
that Barbarian nor are
they outside the boundaries

01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:01.440
of Iranshahr as Touraj mentioned.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.640
Oxus to Euphrates is a
very useful way of thinking

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.260
about the Sasanian
Empire or the Arianshir

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:11.910
from their own particularly
ideological point of view,

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:15.300
but as I have mostly argued
in the book and I will try

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:19.930
to touch upon today, the
people over there do not think

01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:23.410
of themselves necessarily
as outside that boundary.

01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:27.740
My basic argumentation for
that, which I channeled to dwell

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:33.130
on too much today, is the fact that
they call themselves [inaudible]

01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:36.580
of the king calling
himself [inaudible].

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:38.570
The Kind of [inaudible].

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:43.190 position:56%
This [inaudible] is not the province
that you're thinking of today

01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:47.960
in East Iran, nor is
the Islamic [inaudible].

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:53.060
It is actually a Middle Persian
translation of the [inaudible]

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.790 position:56%
which means where the sun comes out.

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:58.640
The East. The King of the East.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.290
Of course there is a lot east

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:05.530
of what this people
consider themselves.

01:20:05.530 --> 01:20:06.830
[Inaudible] desert.

01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:08.130
And China, and well Japan,

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.520
and if you just go East
enough you get to California.

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.270
So they are not the
East of anywhere.

01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.570
But they are the East

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:17.420
of this Iranshahr they're
imagining themselves to be.

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.180
And that is one of the
main arguments they have,

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:24.420
that beyond the Oxus and
beyond things that we think

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:28.760
of as the boundaries of Iranshahr
people did consider themselves part

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.490
of this greater entity.

01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:35.760 position:56%
And as we see, it is beyond Oxus in
the early Islamic period where a lot

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.850
of this culture that we
recognize as a Persian culture

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:44.650
or what we recognize as even the
Persian language actually gets --

01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:45.950
matures up.

01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:48.610
So just think of the
fact that the first poets

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:52.260
of Persian language
lived beyond Oxus

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:55.010
through [inaudible] for example.

01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:57.210
So these are the people
who are actually

01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:00.330
between the Juxoraties
and the Euphrates.

01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:04.970
So the people around and beyond
these boundaries actually end

01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:09.630
up being the best caretakers of the
culture that we are thinking about.

01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:14.850
Now, this whole event
starts here in this period.

01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:18.540
I can't point to it, but as
you can see, the big blue blob

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.470
in the middle is called
the Hephthalites Empire.

01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:28.570
And the Hephthalites come to
existence a little before 484.

01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:33.500
That king [inaudible] Touraj was
mentioning establishes his lands is

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:38.980
probably a Sasanian reiteration
or maybe reinterpretation

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.230
of what is actually
happening during the time

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:44.790
of the famous Sasanian
King Baphomet IV.

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:49.640
Or Bahome [inaudible] the
one who hunts [inaudible],

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:56.110
who really establishes a
tower at the border and says

01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:58.740
that the other side is
your empire, your kingdom,

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.040
whatever you want to call it.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.340
The Hephthalites.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:02.650
And this side is my kingdom.

01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:05.490
So these Hephthalites however
are not very fond of that

01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:07.500
and neither is the Sasanian king.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.550
A series of squirmishes from
the 470's on finally results

01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:13.780
in a disaster for the Sasanians,

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:19.120
which is the death of
[inaudible] in 484.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:25.400
In a very carefully planned line
of defense by the Hephthalites.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:30.990
These Hephthalites are
the latest wave of what

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:38.040
in German the great
[inaudible] the Iranian Huns.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.750
I rather use the German one
because when you get to English,

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:43.050
to Huns, you think of Attila.

01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:46.850
I want people to not
think of Attila.

01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:51.650
So the Hephthalites
are of this group

01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:53.890
and they have formed
a Kingdome over there.

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:59.080
And in 484 when they managed to
kill [inaudible] they really become

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.870
for a good 20 years the people

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:06.520
who call the shots on
the Sasanian Empire.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.100
We have them in the
later Islamic sources as,

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:14.050
oh the Sasanian King comes and
he gets removed by his nobles

01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:16.270
and the other one comes,
and then the new one comes.

01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:19.110
But they all end up in
the Hephthalites court.

01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:23.380
Including [inaudible] son
Kevat [assumed spelling],

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:28.040
who he gets removed
supposedly and the accusation

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.920
of promoting masochism he
goes to the Hephthalites court

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.720
and then gets reinstalled.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:36.840
Not by saying that he was
wrong about the masochism --

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:40.830
if any of it existed -- but by
help of the Hephthalites army.

01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:45.460
In 498 he actually
takes his crown back.

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:50.390
And other than their political
allegiance Sasanians pay

01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:53.270
Hephthalites a lot of money.

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:55.580
Bob Schoff [assumed spelling]
should like these pictures.

01:23:55.580 --> 01:24:01.830
So the Hephthalites are actually
getting the coins of Peroz on top

01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:03.780
and making their own version of it.

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:07.560
As you can see, they don't really
care about inscriptions that much.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.260
They just copy the coins.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:15.020 position:56%
So, there's a lot of money going
from Iran, going from this Iranshahr

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:19.180
to the Hephthalites territories and
well they are very happy about it.

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.390
I think what happens here is

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:25.210
that this peripheral
power centrality ends

01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:31.190 position:56%
up forcing the Sasanians to
finally have their eyes on the West.

01:24:31.190 --> 01:24:33.610
Now, this might sound
strange to many of you.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:36.740
We usually know of the
Sasanians from Western sources.

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:43.290
We know of Sasanians through
Roman, and later Islamic sources.

01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:46.560
All of whom talk about the West
inside of the Sasanian Empire.

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.930
And it seems like the Sasanians
are a very Western oriented power.

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:54.120
In reality, when you
look at the sources,

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.130
Sasanians are quite
an Eastern power.

01:24:56.130 --> 01:25:00.870
Most of the preoccupation of
the Sasanians in the first half

01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:03.750
of their rule is their
Eastern borders.

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:06.020
The biggest campaigns
are in the East.

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.460
I'm not necessarily going to
stress the point too much,

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:10.290
but I think the fact that
they put their capital

01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:12.740
on the very West means
that's the place

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.140
that they felt the safest about.

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.490
They felt the unsafest in the East.

01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:20.640
That is my suggestion
of the whole thing.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.440
But starting in the
restoration of Kavat

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:30.620
in 498 this Western attention
becomes a major point

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:31.920
for the Sasanians.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.260
They have to take on the
Western borders more seriously

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.690
and by the way, extract any
resources from it they can.

01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:42.180
Because they owe Hephthalites
a lot of money

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.850
and they have already
paid quite a bit of it.

01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:48.740
So, from 502 you have the
start of a series of wars.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:51.870
It starts from a war
in 502 to 504 known

01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:55.130
in Roman sources as
the Anestasian Wars.

01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:57.440
And these are all of the wars.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.720
You can see the different lines
and they all continue until 628.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.670
So it's not a continuous war,
but on and off for the rest

01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:11.750
of the Sasanian reign you have a
series of wars between Sasanians

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.880
and Byzantines, often
at a standstill.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.940
Sometimes with upper hand for
the Sasanians and less often

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:23.440
for the Byzantines until
the Arabs/Muslims come.

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.810
And these wars continue and they
seem to generate a good amount

01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:31.440
of money, but also a
good amount of impetus

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.340
for reorganization of the empire.

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.730
This reorganization is
known as the Reforms.

01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:41.760
Attributed popularly to
Hosrove I, but less popularly

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.580
and probably more accurately
to Kavat,

01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:49.530
which results in a complete
revamping of the taxation system.

01:26:49.530 --> 01:26:53.170
As you say IRS is always
at the forefront

01:26:53.170 --> 01:26:55.080
of every change that we have.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:00.720
So the Sasanians change their
taxation system as well.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:07.390
There is a complete redoing of the
military system and less studied

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:13.350
and still underway, a complete
redoing of their social

01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:19.140
and known structure of the
Sasanian nobility particularly.

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:21.600
These things as I said,
are usually attributed

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.970
to the gentleman here, Shapur I.

01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:26.270
Obviously one of them is a coin.

01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:30.640
The other one is a famous relief
on the wall of the House of Justice

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.690
or the Hall of Justice in Tehran.

01:27:34.690 --> 01:27:37.460
[Inaudible] as I'm
sure most of you know,

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:41.250
is known as the [inaudible]
or then The Just.

01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:47.370
And is the example of justice
in the Sasanian period.

01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:55.070
And he is also continues all of
these wars and goes on to take

01:27:55.070 --> 01:28:01.800 position:56%
over most of the areas that had been
controlled by the Sasanians prior

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.790
to the start of the wars,
and slowly expands East.

01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:09.390
So going back to that map.

01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:13.270
In the West he runs a
series of conquests.

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:16.330
he is rather successful
gains the Byzantines.

01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:17.840
Not necessarily all the time,

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:21.990
but he does establish his Western
borders, including trade towns.

01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:27.700
And further in the East he finally
in about 670 -- is mean 570 --

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:33.080
we don't really have the date,
he with the help of the Western

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.050
or the [inaudible] manages
to destroy the Hephthalites.

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:38.350
So those Hephthalites for --

01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:41.280
who about 80 years ago
had determined the fate

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.130
of the Sasanian Empire
are now broken down

01:28:44.130 --> 01:28:47.500
and their territory is incorporated

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.160
into the territories
of the Sasanians.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.580
How effective that is and who takes

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.120
over what is a matter
of controversy.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.530 position:56%
But we do know that at least as sort

01:28:58.530 --> 01:29:01.520
of the central power
Hephthalites don't exist anymore.

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:04.710
They might exist in smaller
Hephthalites entities

01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:11.400
up to the coming of
the Muslim armies.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:15.540
In this -- oops, so
after this event,

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:24.340
the Sasanian Empire has formed
itself as an expanding power.

01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:27.650
It has secured its Western borders.

01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:32.900
It has now defeated its greatest
enemy in the West -- in the East.

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:40.460 position:56%
And has created this empire
divided into four military divisions

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.400
of [inaudible] in the East,
[inaudible] in the West,

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:46.770
Naruz's in the South, and
usually called [inaudible]

01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:48.920
or [inaudible] in the North.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:53.150
It has established a
good taxation system

01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:56.340
and it doesn't necessarily
seem to be very happy

01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:57.640
with the state of affairs.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.570
It still wants to expand.

01:29:59.570 --> 01:30:01.420
Particularly in the West.

01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:05.700
And that happens with
the succession --

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.490
troublesome succession
of Hosrove II.

01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:12.650
I didn't mention one of the kings
[inaudible], but it's pointless

01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:16.710
to go through his reign
at this time.

01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:21.100
Hosrove II in 590 becomes the king.

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:25.960
He's almost immediately
removed by one of his generals,

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:31.500
the famous [inaudible]
who initially has him flee

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.070
to the Byzantine Empire.

01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:38.410
The various and mostly
Roman and later Islamic --

01:30:38.410 --> 01:30:41.680
Midevil Islamic sources say
that he goes to Constantinople

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.720
and he marries the daughter
of the Roman empower.

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:47.060
Probably mythological.

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:51.260
he does go to Syria
though and he does get help

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:53.370
from Morris [assumed
spelling] the Roman emperor.

01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:58.790
Comes back -- this is the scene
from a midevil Persian manuscript

01:30:58.790 --> 01:31:05.190 position:56%
of [inaudible] on the left side of
the river fighting Hosrove's troops.

01:31:05.190 --> 01:31:06.740
So [inaudible] for a year rules.

01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:13.190
591 Hosrove comes back and
starts establishing himself.

01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:23.650
And shortly after that he seems
to find the perfect excuse to go

01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:26.000
on with his expansionist ideas.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.660
And his expansionist ideas
as I said, are the West.

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:32.160
So from 602 he starts his
campaigns in the West.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:38.050 position:56%
Now, the main motivation is that in
602 his Roman Patron Emperor Morris,

01:31:38.050 --> 01:31:44.050
the one who helped him
succeed, has been killed by one

01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:46.070
of his own nobles called
Focus [assumed spelling].

01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:51.620
And this gives enough
reason to Hosrove to want

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:55.970
to take revenge for Morris' death.

01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:59.670
So then from 602 he starts
conquering in the West.

01:31:59.670 --> 01:32:03.270
As you can see from the map, he
takes over very quickly the area

01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:06.070
of Anatolia, most of Syria.

01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:10.120
he goes down towards
Palestine and in a second phase

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:14.930
after 613 he starts
taking over Egypt as well.

01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:16.460
Now, why is this important?

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:21.860
Well other than the fact that it's
a very cool event, it is the fact

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:28.180
that he is taking over most of the
areas to the North of the lands

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:30.720
where Islam initially
comes to existence.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:37.930
Notice, time is 613 to 628;
621 is the date of Hedgra.

01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:41.680
So, when Mohamed is moving
from Mecca to Medina,

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:45.170
when the Islamic states
-- the first version of it

01:32:45.170 --> 01:32:52.730
in Medina is forming -- Sasanians
have taken over the passage

01:32:52.730 --> 01:32:57.010
that the Arabs have to the rest
of the world from the North.

01:32:57.010 --> 01:33:02.180
They are in Syria and they are
surrounding the Arabs on the North

01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:05.420
and even on the Northwest in Egypt.

01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:11.230
Now, this scene is the scene of
the defeat of Hosrove at the hand

01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:14.930
of Heraclius in [inaudible].

01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:20.950
And he gets in one of the
most interesting regicides

01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:22.250
in world history.

01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:24.790
He gets removed --
he's also put on trial.

01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:29.960
There is an official complaint
about him from the court.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.260
He answers it.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:33.190
He -- we have it in [inaudible],

01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:35.390
we have it in [inaudible],
we have it everywhere.

01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:38.290
And his defense is not
accepted and he sort

01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:41.880
of is executed/someone
is allowed to kill him.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.210
So they send someone to kill him.

01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:49.000
So in 628 Hosrove II is killed,
the Sasanian Empire falls

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.800
into a terrible state of
disarray and I would suggest

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.500
that this is the end
of the Sasanian Empire.

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.120
This is the end of the
Sasanian Dynasty for sure.

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.460 position:56%
What happens after this is really of
little significance and what comes

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:07.010
up after it is really an
internal dynastic fight.

01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:08.890
The empire is done for.

01:34:08.890 --> 01:34:12.880
The empire is -- the lands --
Iranshahr is going its own way.

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.720
And culturally and politically,
economically it is already

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.560
on the way to becoming what we
recognize as in the midevil period

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.070
as the land of the [inaudible],
the land of the forced,

01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:28.050
the land of the Persians.

01:34:28.050 --> 01:34:32.000
And -- but before we get there
we have to notice that the power

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.420
that comes to replace that --

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:40.470
as I said, the interestingly
yellow/beige area --

01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:44.830 position:56%
as I said in the North is surrounded
by the Sasanians in Syria.

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:47.870
But even earlier than that,
something I didn't mention --

01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:51.560
because I wanted it for dramatic
effect, is that the South side

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.850
of it is also surrounded
by the Sasanians.

01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:58.130
So Sasanians in the middle of the
6th Century had already managed

01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:02.690
to take over the [inaudible]
in the South of Arabia.

01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:05.170
So again, notice the
world in which the --

01:35:05.170 --> 01:35:09.900
in which Islamic state and
religion of Islam is coming

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:15.180
to existence is surrounded on all
sides pretty much by the Sasanians.

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.840 position:56%
It is a completely Sasanian context.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.410
And that is one of the
arguments I'm having --

01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:26.880
and I'm hoping to sort of drive
home is that in this context,

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:31.570
the Arab/Islamic conquest
is not a foreign invasion.

01:35:31.570 --> 01:35:35.930
It's sort of an internal upheaval

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:41.560
of within an empire they don't
necessarily directly control

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.830
[inaudible] although there
are signs that they are trying

01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:46.680
to control [inaudible]
particularly on the coast.

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.380
The Sasanians.

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:54.650
But the rest of the context of
Islam is within a Sasanian context.

01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:57.860
They are there where in every
side they look there is a

01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:59.180
Sasanian government.

01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:00.480
And they do actually.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.240
They look to their East,
the first place they go

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.940
in modern day Oman, and
there are Sasanians.

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.460
In the North there are Sasanians.

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:08.760
In the West there are Sasanians.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.350
In the South there are Sasanians.

01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:14.620
This is what actually
is how Islam comes

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:19.190
to exist in a Sasanian context.

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:23.150
So peripheries of this empire --
as I mentioned at the beginning,

01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:27.900
the peripheries of this
empire are now taking it over.

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:33.400 position:56%
First of all, the Hephthalites helps
bring it to its particular shape

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:38.530
as a Western empire and now a
Western/Southwestern power is

01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:44.150
finally taking it over and
managing to sort of destroy it.

01:36:44.150 --> 01:36:48.680
I'm not going to go any further
than that by just stopping there

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:52.030
in the sense of the arguments
that I'm trying to make.

01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:56.150
This is the core of
the Islamic conquest.

01:36:56.150 --> 01:36:59.160
I'm mentioning several
things quickly.

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.850
One is that notice that the first
centers of Islam end up being

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.930
in the Sasanian territories.

01:37:04.930 --> 01:37:08.730
The first time that the Islamic
system moves out of Arabia,

01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:12.590
it moves to Koufa, just
outside the walls of Hera

01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:15.370
which is a Sasanian
dependencies ruling

01:37:15.370 --> 01:37:19.670
over the Arab tribes of Southwest.

01:37:19.670 --> 01:37:24.220
Right? And when they move in
they move into Central Asia

01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:28.800
which is their last real
major conquest is 728,

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.520
the Conquest of Boharah.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:33.460
That is where it really stops.

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:36.890
Those territories of the
Barbarians of the East

01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:40.490
who initially contributed to the
destruction of the Sasanian is

01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:44.890
where also that the
peripheries of the South stop.

01:37:44.890 --> 01:37:49.210
So these peripheries finally
end up taking over the center

01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:51.310
and becoming really the center.

01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:54.160
So the power comes
from the Southwest.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.630
The power comes from the Arab side.

01:37:55.630 --> 01:37:58.870 position:56%
And as I mentioned at the beginning,
the culture ends up coming

01:37:58.870 --> 01:38:02.550 position:56%
from the Northeast from beyond Oxus.

01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:04.480
And I just put this beautiful coin

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:08.620
because I always find
it amazingly interesting

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:15.880
that this is a Sasanian style
coin with the crown of Hosrove II.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.220
Outside of it obviously has the
word [inaudible] written in Arabic,

01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:26.150 position:56%
but notice in front of the king's
face is a Middle Persian inscription

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:28.150
in the style of Sasanians
and instead

01:38:28.150 --> 01:38:31.020
of the Sasanian kings
name it says [inaudible].

01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:38.910
The thing that I want
to leave you with is

01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:44.400
that he's not writing
[inaudible] in Arabic.

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.700
He's writing [inaudible].

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:49.390
He's translating his name.

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:54.880
He's not calling himself
Yusif Ahangar.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.310
He's calling himself Joseph Smith.

01:38:57.310 --> 01:39:01.020
He has translated his
name into Middle Persian.

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:05.390
He is within this Iranshahr
context even from the beginning.

01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:07.190
Thank you very much.

01:39:07.190 --> 01:39:18.750
[ Applause ]

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.680
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
So he has left you --

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.230
Professor Rezakhani has
left you with a challenge

01:39:24.230 --> 01:39:29.100
and we have time unfortunately
for only two questions,

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:36.950 position:56%
after which we will take a break
and then resume with a second panel.

01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:38.410
So two questions.

01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:43.730
Please identify yourself
and ask one of the speakers.

01:39:43.730 --> 01:39:46.210
Okay, be brief and to the point.

01:39:46.210 --> 01:39:47.960
Yes?

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:50.460
&gt;&gt; Yes [inaudible].

01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:51.860
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Okay.

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:56.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Harry Haedgar [assumed spelling],
research and now retired government.

01:39:56.730 --> 01:40:00.010
Many of the experts have looked
at Sasanian coins over, you know,

01:40:00.010 --> 01:40:04.300
many many years and they still have
trouble deciphering the language

01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:07.660
supposedly on their
numismatic items.

01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:11.310
And I wondered if you
had any comments on that.

01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:14.480
Also, the standard -- the
Parthian standard was like a touch

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.590
of [inaudible] and their sort
of thick smaller coins whereas,

01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:23.270
Sasanian coinage is a
large flan and a thin coin.

01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:25.840
Any comments on that?

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:30.070 position:56%
It's an introduction of a new style
of coinage and the successor regimes

01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:33.740
with the Dirhams, the Arabs
Dirhams follow a similar pattern.

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:36.110
At least in shape and size.

01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:39.020
Is there any special
significance to this development?

01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:40.770
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank you.

01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:42.070
&gt;&gt; Khodadad Rezakhani: Can I admit

01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:43.970
that I didn't quite
understand the question

01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:45.600
because of the echo in the room?

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.900
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes.

01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:48.200
&gt;&gt; Khodadad Rezakhani: Could
I refer any specific --

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:53.760
in the interest of time -- specific
numismatic question first of all

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:57.410
to afterwards and then to Bob
Schoff who's better equipped

01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:59.240
to answer those questions than me.

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:03.280
About the language, the language
seems to be quite certain.

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:08.890
The Middle Persian written in front
of the face of the king so written

01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:13.630
in the generally well understood
[inaudible] writing tradition

01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:16.810
which includes a lot
of Aramaic logograms.

01:41:16.810 --> 01:41:18.110
So we can read it.

01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:19.410
And then the other one is Arabic.

01:41:19.410 --> 01:41:20.790
I don't think there's any
doubt about the language

01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:24.300
and I have not heard anybody
really doubting the language.

01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:27.320
It is doubtful how
you read [inaudible],

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:32.210
but I think that's how a
couple of us have jobs.

01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:36.270
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Okay, one more question.

01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:38.120
I think over there Hirad.

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.270
There. Yes?

01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:47.680
&gt;&gt; Question to Steve.

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.000
It's loud.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:58.280
In some of the early more
self-consciously Christian sources

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:06.950
in Georgian would you say some of
the reaching to the west is trying

01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:11.310
to get themselves away from Iran?

01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:17.220
You can talk about
[inaudible] or Gorgasali or any

01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:20.990
of those sorts of things.

01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:25.780
I know we've -- a disclaimer --
we've published things together.

01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:32.460
And we've talked about how
[inaudible] the conversion

01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:38.540
of Cartley has -- was partly
written against the Armenians

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:41.690
who had not accepted the
council of Chalcedon,

01:42:41.690 --> 01:42:45.800
but could also the entrance
of Constantine and Helena

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:53.520
into that source and interrelated
sources be a start of trying

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:58.150
to shade over the Iranian elements?

01:42:58.150 --> 01:42:59.900
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Okay, thank you.

01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:01.200
&gt;&gt; Khodadad Rezakhani: By the way,

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.500
this is Paul Crego
[assumed spelling] our

01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.590
Armenian/Georgian cataloguer.

01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:08.550
I owe him quite a bit of gratitude
for materials he's gotten for us.

01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:09.910
Go ahead.

01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:12.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Rapp: All right,
to give a short answer

01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:16.340 position:56%
to that really interesting set of
questions, I think one of the things

01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:18.790
that you're saying
is an important point

01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:20.970
that I really should have said
something about in my paper.

01:43:20.970 --> 01:43:23.330
If Late Antique Caucasia
is so [inaudible] part

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:27.540
of the Iranian world, why
do these places Christianize

01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.150
in the 4th Century at all?

01:43:29.150 --> 01:43:31.290
Why don't they stay Zoroastrian?

01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:35.450
And in part, there are
certainly non-Iranian elements

01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:36.840
in the caucuses.

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.590
Certainly the royal families
have deep Parthian roots,

01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:41.580
all Christianized in
the 4th Century.

01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:44.190
And I think that Christianization
is in part a way

01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:47.460
that they were setting themselves
apart from the Sasanians.

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:51.310
It was in part a political
decision to warm up to the Romans

01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:53.700
who were pretty distant
geographically.

01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:55.180
They had to deal more
with the Iranians.

01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:58.830
They were much closer just to the
South, but by choosing the route

01:43:58.830 --> 01:44:03.250 position:56%
of Christianity one, monotheism gave
them some powerful political tools

01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:04.550
in their arsenal.

01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:07.920
Also opened up problems of hearsay
within the faith in the 4th,

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:09.510
and 5th, and 6th Centuries.

01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:12.960
But certainly it's a way to
distinguish themselves even more

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.470
from the Sasanians to the South.

01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:18.870
And yes, the literatures that
develop in the caucuses all develop

01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:21.470
after the conversion
to Christianity.

01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:24.920
The script for Armenian,
Georgian, and Caucasian Albanian --

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:27.350
which has just recently
been deciphered --

01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:30.470
all were invented around
the year 400

01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:33.420
and all were connected
with Christianization.

01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:38.210
There are certainly some religious
text early on that really --

01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:40.750
the religious writers in
the caucuses are trying

01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:43.230
to deliberately remove
themselves from an Iranian context

01:44:43.230 --> 01:44:47.890 position:56%
and put themselves more deliberately
in a Roman or Byzantine context.

01:44:47.890 --> 01:44:49.190
And we get that.

01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:51.450
But part of the problem is
most of the text that we have

01:44:51.450 --> 01:44:54.420
in the caucuses are rewrites
of rewrites of rewrites.

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:57.330
They're highly edited,
just like in, you know,

01:44:57.330 --> 01:44:58.820
the same problem we have in Iran.

01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:01.810
We have -- putting
inscriptions aside,

01:45:01.810 --> 01:45:05.190
but the literary tradition we
have there's a lot of editing,

01:45:05.190 --> 01:45:07.320
and reediting, and deep
manuscript traditions.

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.260
Many of which are lost.

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.560
Same thing in the caucuses.

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.160
So what those earliest
Christian text actually look

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.240
like is a matter of some debate.

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:18.140
Although in some of my recent
publications I've been arguing

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:21.450
that there was a lost Georgian
history, an epic history

01:45:21.450 --> 01:45:23.130
that looked a lot like
the [inaudible].

01:45:23.130 --> 01:45:25.930
What eventually grew
into the Shanama

01:45:25.930 --> 01:45:28.920
in Iranian and Islamic world.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:30.800 position:56%
In Georgia that then became the base

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:33.330
of the surviving hypsographical
tradition.

01:45:33.330 --> 01:45:34.660
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Okay,
I'm going to take --

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:36.030
I'm going to make an exception.

01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:42.160
One more question, but
to Professor Daryaee.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:45.010
So that we --

01:45:45.010 --> 01:45:46.310
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:53.510
Exactly. So is it a question
for Professor Daryaee?

01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:56.150
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:45:56.150 --> 01:45:59.930
&gt;&gt; Touraj Daryaee: You
can ask me so I feel good.

01:45:59.930 --> 01:46:01.230
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good.

01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:02.530
So everybody has a --

01:46:02.530 --> 01:46:03.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:05.130
My name is Isan [assumed spelling].

01:46:05.130 --> 01:46:07.780
My question is, do we
have any idea about --

01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:12.620
I think both gentlemen talked
about the reforming the tax system.

01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:14.790 position:56%
Do we have any idea about the volume

01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:20.210
of the government revenues during
[inaudible], especially compared

01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:22.220
to the Byzantines and [inaudible].

01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.680
&gt;&gt; Touraj Daryaee: We have
reports of redacted reports

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:29.090
of redacted reports of
how much money was brought

01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:30.390
in from [inaudible].

01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:37.490
We get -- Nahordadbe and
so on give us reports.

01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:42.420
Now how reliable they are
it's tricky but I think

01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:46.220
at least we know how much in the
early Islamic period they're taxing

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:50.740
and [inaudible] writing it he's
giving some relevance visa vie how

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:54.030
much taxation is coming
in the Sasanian Empire.

01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:56.050
So that's what we have to go by.

01:46:56.050 --> 01:46:58.880
Of after the reforms, how
much was [inaudible] sort

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:01.180
of receiving after the reforms?

01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:06.400
So we do have again, reports
or redacted reports as he said.

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.120
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Okay,
so let's give them a hand.

01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:15.200
[ Applause ]

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.500
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Very happy to be here.

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.900
I'm Fatemeh Keshavarz, Professor of
Persian and Director of the School

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:25.910
of Languages, Literatures and
Cultures at University of Maryland.

01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:29.400
And my collaboration -- or our
collaboration with the Library

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.570
of Congress goes back
for many years now,

01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:35.810
and it's really a tremendous
privilege for us

01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:40.830
to have this connection
with Mary-Jane, with Hirad,

01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:43.230
with the whole team here.

01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:45.160
It has been really wonderful.

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:52.210
So thank you for this privilege
of chairing the panel today.

01:47:52.210 --> 01:47:56.460
We've had some wonderful
presentations reminding us

01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:01.700
that some ideas of periphery
and walls and keeping people

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:05.570
out is not so new after all.

01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:10.470 position:56%
And I'm sure that there will be some
interesting conversations also going

01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:15.480
on in the light of the current
panel, which is focusing on peoples

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.140 position:56%
and religions of the Sasanian realm.

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:28.010
Our first speaker today is Dr.
Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina who's

01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:32.630
currently a [inaudible]
Assistant Professor of Avestin

01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:36.280
and Palative languages in the
Department of Near Eastern --

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.580
or Near and Middle
Eastern Civilizations

01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:44.070
at the University of
Toronto in Canada.

01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:51.190
Professor Vevaina earned his
PhD in 2007 from the Department

01:48:51.190 --> 01:48:57.100 position:56%
of Near Eastern Languages and
Civilizations at Harvard University.

01:48:57.100 --> 01:49:05.770 position:56%
And soon after that in the year 2010
he was actually a national endowment

01:49:05.770 --> 01:49:10.890
-- a Fellow of the National
Endowment for the Humanities.

01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:15.240
He has taught courses
related to ancient

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:18.160
and the late antique
[inaudible] both

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:22.480
on the undergraduate
and graduate level.

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:27.890
Also related to Zoroastrianism.

01:49:27.890 --> 01:49:32.120 position:56%
And he's completing currently a book

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:40.040
on Zoroastrian scriptural
interpretations in late antiquity.

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:49.060 position:56%
So, with that in mind and his book
length project on Zoroastrian coming

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:54.700
out very soon we hope I'm
inviting Professor Vevaina to speak

01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:59.740
to us today about Zoroastrianism
and Manekism

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.660
in the Sasanian world and beyond.

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:05.510
Please welcome Professor Vevaina.

01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:07.310
Thank you.

01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:14.230
[ Applause ]

01:50:14.230 --> 01:50:16.960
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina:
So, before I begin I would

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:20.070
like to express my great honor
at being asked to speak here

01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:21.790
at the Library of Congress.

01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:25.150
All thanks to Touraj
Daryaee, Khodadad Rezakhani.

01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:28.910
I would also like to express
my gratitude to Hirad Dinavari,

01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:32.900
his technical staff, and the Alborz
High School alumni for allowing us

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:35.300
to gather here today
and showcase the value

01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:38.120
of scholarly work on
pre-modern Iran.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.790
The killing of the Prophet
Mani, the eponymous founder

01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:44.820
of the Manichaeism religion
in the 3rd Century was one

01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:47.460
of the most discussed
events in late antiquity.

01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:52.420
From being labeled a heretic,
lunatic, seducer, maniac,

01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:54.900
pseudo prophet, and
my personal favorite,

01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:59.020
a nimble-fingered thief do amene
[inaudible] sensitive treatment

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.740
of Mani in his novel
<i>The Gardens of Light </i>.

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:05.140
Mani's fascinating life and
gruesome death have long captured

01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:07.720
our imaginations.

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:10.940
As you can see the number one
on the projector, Ibn al-Nadim,

01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:14.000
the great Muslim scholar
of the 10th Century stated,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.180
Mani was put to death during
the reign of Bahram b. Sabur.

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:20.790
After he executed him he
suspended him in two pieces,

01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:24.450 position:56%
one half over a certain gate and
the other half over a different gate

01:51:24.450 --> 01:51:26.530
of the city of Junday sabur.

01:51:26.530 --> 01:51:29.340
These two places received the
designations 'the upper part

01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:31.800
of the Lord' and 'the
lower part of the Lord'.

01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:34.650
It is said that he has been
previously imprisoned by Sabur,

01:51:34.650 --> 01:51:37.750
but after Sabur died
Bahram feed him.

01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:39.650
It is also said that he
died while in prison,

01:51:39.650 --> 01:51:43.450
but there is no uncertainty
regarding his crucifixion.

01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:45.620
This highly evocative description

01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:49.100 position:56%
of Mani's ultimate demise
beautifully captures the dilemmas we

01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:51.530
scholars face while
studying the Sasanians.

01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:54.240
Since all of our narrative
historical sources

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:56.870
for Iranian religious
history were either written

01:51:56.870 --> 01:52:00.470
by the much later Muslim scholars
writing Arabic and Persian

01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:03.110
or we have to be content with the
histories and chronicles written

01:52:03.110 --> 01:52:06.820
by their traditional enemies,
the Romans and Byzantines.

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:12.370
Or Christian communities composed
of former Zoroastrians writing

01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:15.680
in Syriac and of course the
underappreciated sources Armenia

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.980
and Georgia.

01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:19.490
I might have left out
the Jewish sources.

01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:20.790
Apologies.

01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:23.450
What we do have in the way
of securely datable sources

01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:27.840
from the actual Sasanian period
are royal inscriptions and reliefs,

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:30.360
coins, seals, bullae, and papyri.

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.570 position:56%
All of which reflect forms of a rich

01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:35.280
and varied Zoroastrian
political theology.

01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.480
But that typically do not formally
explicate their own symbolism

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.870
in a self-reflective manner.

01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:45.150
What I would like to do today is
to show you how the hermeneutical

01:52:45.150 --> 01:52:47.860
or interpretive traditions
in Zoroastrian Middle Persia

01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:51.960 position:56%
or Palative literature are redacted
in the early Islamic period has much

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:54.080
to contribute to a
richer understanding

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.170
of Sasanian historiography.

01:52:56.170 --> 01:53:00.330
I will do so by showcasing how the
Manicheans writing in Parthian,

01:53:00.330 --> 01:53:02.780
the Zoroastrians producing
hermeneutical legal

01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:05.510
and polemical texts in
Palatian [inaudible],

01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:09.250
and the Islamic heraseyographers
writing in Arabic all made meaning

01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:12.530
of the death of Mani at
the hands of Behram I.

01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:17.410
In my opinion, no figure better
embodied the cosmopolitanism

01:53:17.410 --> 01:53:19.990
of the Sasanian world than Mani.

01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:23.880
As the founder of the world's first
truly universalizing religion,

01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:27.930
Mani claimed to be inheritor of
prophets like Jesus, the Buddha,

01:53:27.930 --> 01:53:31.690
and Zarathustra, all the while
joined from traditions associated

01:53:31.690 --> 01:53:35.830
with biblical patriarchs
such Seth, Noah, and Enoch.

01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:40.220
And apostles like Paul, upon
whom Mani modeled his church.

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:42.140
Echoing the title of my talk,

01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:46.920
let us begin by looking beyond
the Sasanian realm to the East.

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:50.970
As you can see in slide number
two in lines one through four,

01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:54.970 position:56%
in a Manichaean/Parthian text on the
death of Mani from the Turfan oasis

01:53:54.970 --> 01:54:00.310 position:56%
in Western China, we find references
to his [inaudible] or par nirvana.

01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:03.090
A Buddhist term signifying
a blessed state of death

01:54:03.090 --> 01:54:07.000
in which the deceased is freed from
the cycle of birth and rebirth.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.130
And I quote, "And he Mani
was unconscious and died.

01:54:11.130 --> 01:54:16.750
Such was the parinirvana of our
father, as this is written."

01:54:16.750 --> 01:54:21.580
The religious and cultural
cosmopolitanism

01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:25.420 position:56%
of this text is once again
showcased in lines seven through ten

01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:27.400
when the Manichaean's -- sorry --

01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.900
when the Manichaean's referred
to their Lord and Messiah

01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:33.650
as [inaudible] or crucifixion.

01:54:33.650 --> 01:54:38.930
And I quote, "When as we all know
as for when Jesus to the Messiah

01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:41.300
of us all, the Lord was crucified."

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.210 position:56%
Here in the text we find the
Manichaean's also drawing upon their

01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:46.110
inherited Christian symbolism.

01:54:46.110 --> 01:54:49.670
Thus equating Mani's death at the
hands of the Sasanians with that

01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:53.360
of a prophetic forerunner,
namely Jesus' ultimate sacrifice.

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.400
East truly meets West.

01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:00.490 position:56%
In Sasanian studies, Mani's death is
discussed most often in conjunction

01:55:00.490 --> 01:55:05.120 position:56%
with the Zorastrin imperial response
to ethnoreligious diversity found

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:07.600
in the contemporaneous
3rd Century reliefs

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.880
of the Zorastrin high
priest Caridier.

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:17.580
Who unabashedly states, "And Jews,
Buddhists, Hindus, Nazarenes,

01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:20.740
Christians, Baptists,
and Manichaean's/zandig

01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:23.490
within the realm were struck
down idols were destroyed,

01:55:23.490 --> 01:55:25.410
dwellings of the demons
were ruined and turned

01:55:25.410 --> 01:55:28.050
into thrones and seats
for the gods."

01:55:28.050 --> 01:55:30.390
This passage has been
discussed ad naseum,

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:31.940
especially since it is right here

01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:34.230
that we have the first
attestation of the term zandig.

01:55:34.230 --> 01:55:37.180
Later used by Muslims
for the Manichaean's.

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:42.430
What is far less well-known however
is the explicitly isogenic act

01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:47.020
of reading the death of Mani into
the gothos or forms of Zarathustra

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:50.030
in the hermeneutical tradition
in [inaudible] literature.

01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:53.310
The text in question is the
9th book of the Denkard,

01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:58.660
the largest extent Palative text,
estimated at some 170,000 words.

01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:01.890
Denkard book nine purports
to be a [inaudible] resume

01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:05.260
of a lost Palavey translation,
commentary or zand

01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:10.400 position:56%
of a putative [inaudible] commentary
or mask on the old evestan gothos.

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:15.250
Basically, we have stage one
from mid-second millennium BCE.

01:56:15.250 --> 01:56:21.890 position:56%
An stage four from the early 11th
Century C.E. some 2,500 years later.

01:56:21.890 --> 01:56:24.080
While the myriad issues
of textual transmission

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.220
and interpretive fidelity
are beyond our scope today,

01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:29.950
what should interest us is not
just the fact that the gothos

01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:33.290
from two millennia earlier were
read as having something to say

01:56:33.290 --> 01:56:35.960
about a major sociopolitical event,

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:38.840
rather it is the isogenical
technique of reading

01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:42.620
into the gothos here which
is particularly fascinating.

01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:49.060 position:56%
And the passage in Denkard 9 states,
and about the sign of Mani crippled

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:51.920
by the lie and the wicked
hearers -- niyosag --

01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.600
of his, and the beating which
came upon him from the Lord

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:57.040
of the Land -- presumably Behram I.

01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.100
And this too, he is wicked who
gives my world to the vengeful one,

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:04.540
Ahrimen, he will have raised
up the wound demon himself.

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:07.410
That is, he will have been
set in motion for the death

01:57:07.410 --> 01:57:09.600
of the world of the Righteous.

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:12.600
The text then goes on to
quote Mani as having boasted,

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:14.910
"I am better suited for the -- "

01:57:19.370 --> 01:57:21.670
"I am better suited
for the office of Rad

01:57:21.670 --> 01:57:23.500
and the office of the Dastwar.

01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:27.300
With the Denkard text consequently
critiquing Mani by stating,

01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:29.960
but that is not the
way Zarduxst did it.

01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.970
He -- Mani -- makes
men devour mutrisn."

01:57:32.970 --> 01:57:34.270
Something like filth.

01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:36.380
And he says to them, eternal life.

01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:38.550
That is, there is eternal
life from it for those

01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:41.370
who were made to devour mutrisn.

01:57:41.370 --> 01:57:44.730
Then they think, the
sacrifice the demons is best.

01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:48.410
Besides the rather opaque
traditional inter-significations

01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:51.610
used by the Zoroastrian
priests as weapons of polemic,

01:57:51.610 --> 01:57:53.150
how and why is Mani found

01:57:53.150 --> 01:57:55.760
in the gothic commentary
in the first place?

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.140 position:56%
What line, formula, word, or concept

01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:01.570
in the original sacred scriptures
motivates this isogenical

01:58:01.570 --> 01:58:03.450
textual practice?

01:58:03.450 --> 01:58:07.280
The second millennia BCE,
gothic [inaudible] base text

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.410
that triggers this radical
interpretation appears

01:58:10.410 --> 01:58:15.630
to be Yasna 46.7, which is part
of Zartrush [inaudible] complaint

01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:19.190
as he was facing persecution
and a lack of social acceptance.

01:58:19.190 --> 01:58:23.450
And I quote, "But whom do you
appoint as guardian for one

01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:26.960
such as me, O Mazda, when
the deceitful one tries

01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:29.900
to seize me in order to injure me."

01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:38.640 position:56%
And Zarathustra then adds in Yasna
46.8, if someone who places my herds

01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.880
through sin, may destruction not
reach me through his actions.

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:48.120
May it, in response, come upon him
for that hostility onto his body.

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:52.800
The gothic text here in line with
its epidictic genre of praise

01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:57.080
and blame poetry, that is
praise God and score evil,

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.790
suggests that the poet priest --

01:58:58.790 --> 01:59:01.500
presumably Zarathustra and
his priestly followers --

01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:05.520
will not be held liable for the
misdeeds of the wicked ones.

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:09.900
The late antique [inaudible]
to translation come commentary

01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:14.540
of these ancient Avestan
scriptures renders this as he --

01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:18.930
presumably Mani -- who gives my
world to that vengeful one --

01:59:18.930 --> 01:59:20.660
[inaudible] -- he gives
away property

01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:22.950
to the authority of the heretics.

01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:27.820 position:56%
here, the world or [inaudible], that
is modern [inaudible] is glossed

01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:31.930
by the concept of property or
[inaudible] and it is given away

01:59:31.930 --> 01:59:35.580
through the authority or power
of the heretics of ahlomoyan,

01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:39.560
understood in Denkard book nine to
be none other than the Manichaean's

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:43.470
who were notorious for their
renunciations of philosophy.

01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:48.240
And a little later in Pahlavi of
Yasna 46.8, we find it stated,

01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:51.240
to the bodies of the
heretics and the man --

01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:53.290
presumable Mani, the ruler comes.

01:59:53.290 --> 01:59:56.460
That is, he takes retribution
on them.

01:59:56.460 --> 02:00:00.060
What we have here is
truly fascinating.

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:03.570
Bronze Age references to moveable
property or herds and the lack

02:00:03.570 --> 02:00:08.190
of social acceptance of an archaic
priestly poet sacrificer are

02:00:08.190 --> 02:00:12.790
allegorically re-tasked in the late
antique and early Islamic contexts,

02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:17.370
and subsequently understood as a
scriptural proof or justification

02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:21.480
for two actual historical events
in the early Sasanian period.

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:24.730
One, the renunciation of
property by the Manichaeans,

02:00:24.730 --> 02:00:28.210
and the subsequent seizure of
their property by the Sasanians.

02:00:28.210 --> 02:00:34.630 position:56%
And two, the killing of Mani by
Bahram I in 274 C.E. For the seizure

02:00:34.630 --> 02:00:38.480
of Manichaean property, we can
once again look beyond the Sasanian

02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:43.550
world, this time to the West, to
legislation issued in 381 C.E.

02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:48.650
by the Roman Emperor Theodosius
in order to limit the philanthropy

02:00:48.650 --> 02:00:52.860
of Mani's hearers or auditories in
the -- for the benefit of the elect

02:00:52.860 --> 02:00:54.700
or electing of his church.

02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:59.430 position:56%
"If any Manichaean man or woman from
the day of the law enacted long ago,

02:00:59.430 --> 02:01:02.490
and originally by our parents,
has transmitted his own property

02:01:02.490 --> 02:01:06.120
to any person whatsoever, by
having made a will or under title

02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:09.790
of any liberality whatsoever,
or by form of donation,

02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:12.920
or if anyone of these persons
has been enriched by grant

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:16.340
of an inheritance entered
through any form whatsoever,

02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:18.150
since immediately from
the said persons

02:01:18.150 --> 02:01:22.510
under branded infamy's perpetual
stigma, we withdraw all capability

02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:25.970
of making a will and of
living under Roman law.

02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:29.170
And since we do not permit them to
have the power either of leaving

02:01:29.170 --> 02:01:33.540
or taking any inheritance, the
whole by an immediate investigation

02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:37.710
on the part of our treasury,
should be joined to its resources."

02:01:37.710 --> 02:01:41.640
Just as we see in the West, we
can look within the Sasanian world

02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:45.320
for confirmation of these property
seizures by turning our gaze back

02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:49.410 position:56%
to the [inaudible] resources, namely
the "Madayan I Hazar Dadestan,"

02:01:49.410 --> 02:01:54.020
or "Book of a Thousand Judgments,"
a Sasarnian era law code.

02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:59.990 position:56%
It explicitly discusses the seizure
of property due to heresy, zandigih,

02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:03.190
a term most often associated with
the Manichaeans, as we saw earlier

02:02:03.190 --> 02:02:04.680
in [inaudible] inscription.

02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:09.280
The "Madayan" states, "The property
of the sorcerer, jadug xwastag,

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.340
such as he has, when they firmly
establish his being a sorcerer,

02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:18.170
shall be held by the Rad," that
is the supreme priestly authority.

02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:21.230
In isolation, the passage I have
just cited is not absolutely

02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:23.870
probative, but the
"Madayan" then adds,

02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:27.250
"Heresy is sorcery,"
zandigih jadugih.

02:02:27.250 --> 02:02:31.830
And finally, it declaims, "Due
to practicing heresy," zandigih,

02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:34.210
"and following the
beliefs of the heretic,

02:02:34.210 --> 02:02:38.170
one's property is seized
for the treasury."

02:02:38.170 --> 02:02:40.500
So what do we have here in
terms of the relationship

02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:44.910
between Sasanian jurisprudence
administered largely by priests

02:02:44.910 --> 02:02:46.960
and the Zoroastrian
hermeneutical tradition,

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:49.670
also produced by the
priesthood, in a different sector

02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:51.200
of the knowledge economy?

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:53.740
From the perspectives of
the emic, or traditional,

02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:55.910
interpreters of a religious
tradition,

02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:57.850
in this case the [speaking
in foreign language],

02:02:57.850 --> 02:03:01.700
their only obligation was to
make meaning, produce theology,

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:04.840
by grappling with the profound
hermeneutical challenge

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:08.700
of constantly enlivening their
received past of archaic myth

02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:11.680
and ritual from the
[inaudible] world.

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:14.280
I would argue that they
did so assiduously,

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:18.170
using tradition-constituted
forms of allegoresis,

02:03:18.170 --> 02:03:21.030
what I colloquially call
Zoroastrian thought,

02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:25.500
to speak to their contemporary
social realities by expanding,

02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:28.870
not delimiting, the
spiritual and semantic range

02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:30.680
of scriptural understanding.

02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.120
For them, just as it was
for the rabbis, scripture,

02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:39.200
in this case the "Avesta," spoke
for an already-encoded all forms

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:42.430
of lived human experience
within human history

02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:46.130
and cosmic temporality,
including all future religious

02:03:46.130 --> 02:03:47.960
and political events.

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.010
The Manichaean challenge

02:03:50.010 --> 02:03:52.910
of an aggressively
inter-confessional nature was

02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:56.270
so threatening to the
Zoroastrian priesthood precisely

02:03:56.270 --> 02:04:00.320
because of Mani's promiscuous
borrowing form the theological

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:03.670
terms, concepts, and deities
from the native Iranian

02:04:03.670 --> 02:04:10.440
that is Zoroastrian tradition,
as when Mani says, "Fourth,

02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:12.910
this revelation of the
two principles/origins,

02:04:12.910 --> 02:04:16.680
and my living books/scriptures,
wisdom, and knowledge, are more

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:22.540
and better than those of the
religions of the ancients."

02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:27.490
The "Skand-gumanig Wizar," a tenth
century polemic on the sorcery,

02:04:27.490 --> 02:04:30.590
jadugih, of Manichaean
doctrine, written in Pazand --

02:04:30.590 --> 02:04:33.360
that is, Middle Persian
written in the Avestan alphabet,

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:35.640
with glosses added from
its Sanskrit version --

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:42.100
states, "I have completely
escaped the doubt, and errors,

02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:46.440
and deceptions, and evil of the
false doctrines, and especially

02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.760
from the greatest deceiver,
the worst teacher,

02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:53.180
the airhead Mani whose
false doctrine is sorcery,

02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:56.870
and whose religion, din, is
deceit, and whose teaching is evil,

02:04:56.870 --> 02:05:00.270
and whose custom is
spread in secret."

02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:05.370
One person's esotericism is
another person's occultism.

02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:09.050
Al-Mas udi, living in tenth
century Baghdad, the precise place

02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:14.010
where the [inaudible] was written
some 60 years later, tells us,

02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:18.010
"We report that Mani, the son
of Yazid, disciple of Qardun,

02:05:18.010 --> 02:05:21.340
came to Bahram and presented
to him the dualist doctrines.

02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:24.350
He cunningly accepted them until
he had gathered his missionaries,

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:27.420
who were dispersed across the
lands, those of his disciples

02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:30.040
who preached the dualist
doctrines to the people.

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:31.630
Then he," that's Bahram,
"killed him,

02:05:31.630 --> 02:05:33.960
and he killed the leaders
of his disciples.

02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:36.850
The word zindiqa was
created in the days of Mani,

02:05:36.850 --> 02:05:39.130
with whom the zanadiqa
are associated.

02:05:39.130 --> 02:05:43.740
And regarding this, when Zaradusht
the son of Asbiman, spitaman,

02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:45.650
whose genealogy we
have already mentioned,

02:05:45.650 --> 02:05:49.540 position:56%
brought to the Persians a book
called the "Bista," that's "Avesta,"

02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:52.690
"in the first language of the
Persians, he gave it a commentary,

02:05:52.690 --> 02:05:55.080
tafsir, called the "Zand."

02:05:55.080 --> 02:06:02.000
And he gave this commentary
a gloss called "Bazand",

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.740
Pazand, as we have said before.

02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.570
The "Zand" was an explanation

02:06:05.570 --> 02:06:08.910
for the esoteric/allegorical
interpretation, ta wil,

02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:10.820
of the ancient revelation.

02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:14.050
Whoever there was in their religion
who adduced anything in opposition

02:06:14.050 --> 02:06:16.600
to the revelation,
that is the "Bista,"

02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:20.700 position:56%
and who turned toward the
esoteric/allegorical interpretation,

02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:24.800
that is the "Zand," they would
say, "He is a zandi," referring

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.840
to the name of the interpretation,
which shows that he had moved

02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:30.430
from the exoteric meanings
of the revelation

02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:32.860
to the esoteric interpretation.

02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:35.410
And this is in contradiction
to the revelation.

02:06:35.410 --> 02:06:38.550
When the Arabs came, they took
this term from the Persians,

02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:42.450
and they pronounced it
zindiq and Arabized it."

02:06:42.450 --> 02:06:45.370
While many of us have read this
passage and others like it as part

02:06:45.370 --> 02:06:49.310
of the Manichaean/Zandi question
connected to Islamic heresiography,

02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:54.470
I believe al-Mas udi is also
giving us an eyewitness proof,

02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:58.040
through Islamic eyes, no doubt,
of the very contested process

02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:00.850
of allegoresis within
the Zoroastrian tradition

02:07:00.850 --> 02:07:02.910
that I have been discussing today.

02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:05.920
We have largely ignored the
knowledge production of the quote,

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:09.830
unquote Zoroastrian Zindiqs
because we, the philologists,

02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:12.350
as root etymological fetishizers,

02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:15.640
continue to perceive their
allegorical textual practices

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:17.550
to be bad philology.

02:07:17.550 --> 02:07:21.560
I would contend that allegoresis --
that is the expansion of meaning --

02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:24.330
as knowledge from the [speaking in
foreign language] religion, or Den,

02:07:24.330 --> 02:07:26.740
was used as a defense
of the idealized view

02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:30.050
of the Sasanian status
quo and can best be seen

02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:34.600
in another [inaudible] passage
on heresy in "Denkard Book III"

02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:36.790
in a chapter entitled, "The
Protection of the Knowledge

02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:40.700
of the Religion, Den, from the
Destruction of the Heretics."

02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:43.410
"And one is the discernment by
the enumerators and teachers

02:07:43.410 --> 02:07:46.570 position:56%
of the religion from which comes the
protection of the proper knowledge

02:07:46.570 --> 02:07:49.780
of the religion from the
destruction of the heretics.

02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.140
In a truthful manner,
through good authority,

02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:55.050
there will be the going
forth of the religion," Den,

02:07:55.050 --> 02:07:57.330
"and through the arrangement
of kingship, xwadayih,

02:07:57.330 --> 02:08:00.230
there will be the management
of the world."

02:08:00.230 --> 02:08:03.630
Here we see the deployment of
a Sasanian theological trope

02:08:03.630 --> 02:08:06.860 position:56%
and [inaudible] much better known
from [speaking in foreign language],

02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:10.650
an Islamic political theory, from
none other than al-Mas uri himself

02:08:10.650 --> 02:08:14.040
and others, who commonly site
the founder of the Sasanians,

02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:19.380
Ardashir I, as saying,
"Religion, Den, and kingship, mulk,

02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:22.250
are two brothers, and neither
can dispense with the other.

02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:23.970
Religion is the foundation
of kingship,

02:08:23.970 --> 02:08:25.980
and kingship protects religion.

02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:28.360
For whatever lacks a
foundation must perish,

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:31.630
and whatever lacks a
protector disappears."

02:08:31.630 --> 02:08:35.010
Mani and his followers'
cosmopolitanism threatened its

02:08:35.010 --> 02:08:38.320
highly idealized view of the
relationship between priestly

02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.730
and royal power in Sasanian Iran,

02:08:40.730 --> 02:08:44.600
so much so that the Sasanian
kings felt compelled to kill Mani,

02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:47.880
while the Zoroastrian priestly
counterparts felt equally compelled

02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:52.340
to mock and reject Mani's claims
to being a latter-day Zarathustra.

02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:56.260
And in doing so, ironically
enough, they immortalized him

02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:00.300 position:56%
as a persecuted prophet, and read
his ultimate device into the Gathas.

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:02.100
Thank you.

02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:09.300
[ Applause ]

02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:11.150
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Thank
you very much, Dr. Vevaina,

02:09:11.150 --> 02:09:18.680
for that beautifully crafted
discussion of interpretations

02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:21.290
and allegorical readings of texts,

02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:25.400
which again has very modern
echoes for all of us today.

02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:30.470
And the more we listen today, we
see how the borders we created

02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:36.950
between past and present are really
more imaginary than they exist.

02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:43.110
Also, thank you so much to Al
Borzean High School people here

02:09:43.110 --> 02:09:48.630
for brining -- can you imagine that
a high school established in Iran

02:09:48.630 --> 02:09:52.510
so long ago is bringing such
learned echoes to the Library

02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:54.700
of Congress and to all of us?

02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:56.000
That's wonderful.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.800
Thank you.

02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:02.090
[ Applause ]

02:10:02.090 --> 02:10:06.850
Thank you, and our next
distinguished speaker,

02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:12.390
Professor Scott McDonough, is an
Associate Professor of History

02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:18.900
at William Patterson
University in New Jersey.

02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:23.360
His research interests lie
in the social, institutional,

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:29.400
and religious history of
late Ancient West Asia,

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:34.280
especially pre-Islamic
Iran and Caucasia.

02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:40.170
He's currently working on a
monograph, the title of which is

02:10:40.170 --> 02:10:44.690
"Sasanian Iran, Power,
Patronage, and Piety."

02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:50.330
And the book is going
to appear in 2018.

02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:58.190
The title of Professor McDonough's
presentation today is "Queen Shirin

02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:03.220
and the Churches of the East,
Christianity in Sasanian Iran."

02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:05.460
Sounds to be very, very
interesting to listen to.

02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:09.510
Thank you, please welcome.

02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:16.060
[ Applause ]

02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:18.980
&gt;&gt; Scott McDonough: First, I, too,
would like to thank the organizers

02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:22.580
for inviting me here, to
all the presenters so far

02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:27.100
for their very stimulating talks,
and what I am sure will be a set

02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:31.130
of even more stimulating
papers in the afternoon.

02:11:31.130 --> 02:11:36.250
And in addition, I'd like to
thank all of you for coming out.

02:11:36.250 --> 02:11:39.460
Okay, let me see if I
know how to use this.

02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:45.960
Okay, shortly after his
restoration to the throne in 591,

02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:49.540
the Sasanian King Khosrow
II presented two remarkable

02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:53.080
benefactions to the shrine of
the Christian Saint Surgius

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:55.700
in Byzantine Sergiopolis.

02:11:55.700 --> 02:12:01.450
For the first, Khosrow restored
to the shrine a cross taken

02:12:01.450 --> 02:12:05.070 position:56%
in an earlier period of estrangement
between Byzantium and Iran

02:12:05.070 --> 02:12:08.550
and provided a second cross
inscribed with the king's thanks

02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:11.550
to the saint for aiding
in his removal

02:12:11.550 --> 02:12:14.770
of the usurper Bahram Chobin.

02:12:14.770 --> 02:12:18.930
The second gift contained
a number of things --

02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:24.290
a number of varied gifts and a
plate inscribed, "Not for the sight

02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:27.350
of men," giving the
king's thanks to the saint

02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:31.830
for helping his Christian
wife Shirin conceive a child.

02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:33.830
Kho row's devotion to the shrine

02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:38.090
of St. Sergius displays the complex
interconnections of faith, power,

02:12:38.090 --> 02:12:40.900
and legitimacy in the
late ancient world.

02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:44.610
Khosrow came to power in a coup
against his father, Hormizd IV,

02:12:44.610 --> 02:12:48.200
orchestrated by his uncles
from the aristocratic house

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:50.340
of the Ispahbudhan.

02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:54.700
Khosrow was then in turn deposed
by the Chief General of his empire,

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:59.280
Bahram Chobin, scion of another
of the empire's great families.

02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:02.930
Forced to flee to the protection
of the Byzantine Emperor Maurice,

02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:05.410
Khosrow's restoration to
the throne was supported

02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:08.600
by a foreign Christian ruler,
and more significantly,

02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:11.010
by his own Christian subjects.

02:13:11.010 --> 02:13:14.980
Khosrow's thank offerings to a
Christian military saint popular

02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:19.620 position:56%
in both Byzantine and Sasanian lands
emphasized the harmonious relations

02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:23.140
between Khosrow and the
Christians of the Sasanian East,

02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:27.810
and the prominent role of
his wife in shaping them.

02:13:27.810 --> 02:13:30.590
Shirin, paramount Queen of Khosrow,

02:13:30.590 --> 02:13:34.100 position:56%
is one of the best documented
figures of the late Sasanian period,

02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:38.370 position:56%
appearing in numerous accounts of
Greek -- in Greek, Armenian, Syriac,

02:13:38.370 --> 02:13:41.200
Arabic, Persian, and
other languages.

02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:44.960
Her central role in the poetry
of later Persian authors

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.280
such as Ferdowsi and
Nizami testifies

02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.820
to her continuing importance
in the mythologizing

02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:53.890
of the pre-Islamic
kings of Iranshahr.

02:13:53.890 --> 02:13:56.600
Yet as a Christian,
she appears especially

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:58.430 position:56%
in early historical accounts written

02:13:58.430 --> 02:14:01.170
within the empire's diverse
Christian communities,

02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:04.230
the East Syrian Church
of the East, West Syrian

02:14:04.230 --> 02:14:07.880
and Armenian miaphysite
Christian churches,

02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:10.420
Caucasian Albanian,
and Chalcedonian.

02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:13.810
Well, it can be difficult
to sort the myth

02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:17.290
from the late Sasanian
reality of Shirin.

02:14:17.290 --> 02:14:20.590
Here status as queen, courtier,
and Christian provides us

02:14:20.590 --> 02:14:22.920
with a fascinating window
into the complex place

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:25.510
of Christians in the Sasanian East.

02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:29.600
As a subordinate minority
population, as vital supporters

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:34.640
of Sasanian dynastic power, and as
a rapidly-expanding religious --

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:37.970
set of religious communities
locked in complex intra-

02:14:37.970 --> 02:14:41.030
and inter-confessional competition.

02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:45.230
The Sasanian world was home to
significant Christian populations

02:14:45.230 --> 02:14:48.070
at least as far back
as the third century.

02:14:48.070 --> 02:14:49.710
From the start, the
Christian communities

02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:53.570 position:56%
of the Sasanian Empire were diverse,
originating in distinct episodes

02:14:53.570 --> 02:14:58.650
of proselytization and sometimes
deportation, of culturally,

02:14:58.650 --> 02:15:02.470
geographically, and linguistically
disparate populations.

02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:05.520 position:56%
One of the more significant cultural
divides among Christians was the

02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.980
organization of churches
around urban communities

02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:10.340
in greater Mesopotamia
and Khuzestan,

02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:14.140
and around aristocratic families
and inherited priestly offices

02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:17.440
in the Armenian high lands, and
perhaps the Iranian Plateau.

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:20.790
We've already heard about
that from Steve's talk.

02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:24.140 position:56%
Thus, one might make an argument for
the existence of distinct lowland

02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:26.420
and highland churches
in Sasanian lands,

02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:30.280
the former serving largely
Aramean and Greek audiences,

02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:33.860
the latter encompassing
Iranians, Armenians, Iberians,

02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:35.270
and Caucasian Albanians,

02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:41.870
often lumped together
conceptually as Arians.

02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:45.080
The growth of the Sasanian Empire's
Christian communities did not go

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.750
unnoticed by the Sasanian kings

02:15:46.750 --> 02:15:49.480
and the Zoroastrian
elites of their empire.

02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:52.830
The third and fourth century saw
several episodes of persecutions

02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:58.440
by Zoroastrian priests and
supporters of the Sasanian dynasty.

02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:01.600
However, these generally arose in
periods of conflict between Iran

02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:04.730
and Christian Byzantium when
Sasanian Christians were seen

02:16:04.730 --> 02:16:08.290
as a sort of fifth column
for the empire to the west.

02:16:08.290 --> 02:16:11.580
However, as Zoroastrians tended
to view their faith as a marker

02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:16.070
of ethnicity, a characteristic
specifically of Arian peoples,

02:16:16.070 --> 02:16:18.820
the fiercest opposition to
Christianity arose from instances

02:16:18.820 --> 02:16:23.170
of Arian apostasy, particularly
in the kingdoms of Caucasia

02:16:23.170 --> 02:16:26.390
and among the aristocrats
of the Iranian Plateau.

02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:28.070
Nevertheless, efforts
to stem the spread

02:16:28.070 --> 02:16:31.180
of Christianity among Sasanian
subjects were piecemeal

02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:34.140
and ultimately futile,
for reasons which are kind

02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:36.410
of outside the scope of this paper.

02:16:36.410 --> 02:16:41.120
By the time of Shirin in the sixth
and seventh century, our sources,

02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:44.020
admittedly mostly Christian
and anecdotal,

02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:47.390
suggest that Christians made up an
absolute majority of the population

02:16:47.390 --> 02:16:50.830
of the empire's western
regions, Greater Caucasia,

02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:55.790
Greater Mesopotamia, and Shirin's
probable homeland, Khuzestan.

02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:57.490
By the early seventh century,

02:16:57.490 --> 02:17:01.340
the East Syrian Synotacon Orientali
[assumed spelling] documents an

02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:04.230
extensive network of
episcopacies stretching

02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:08.610
across the Sasanian
realm into Central Asia.

02:17:08.610 --> 02:17:11.710
Christian churches,
martyria, monasteries,

02:17:11.710 --> 02:17:16.820
and other holy sites came to
dot the Sasanian countryside.

02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:19.870
While few Sasanian Christian
sites have seen systematic modern

02:17:19.870 --> 02:17:23.780 position:56%
excavation, circuitous collection
of artifacts supports the impression

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:28.890
of an intensive Christianization
of the late Sasanian landscape.

02:17:28.890 --> 02:17:33.810
It is perhaps not surprising, then,
that the Sasanian kings sought

02:17:33.810 --> 02:17:37.890
to assert their authority over the
Christian's spiritual landscape

02:17:37.890 --> 02:17:39.530
of their empire.

02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:41.510
Earlier kings had been
somewhat uncomfortable

02:17:41.510 --> 02:17:44.240
with the direct support
of Christian shrines.

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:47.960
Indeed, in the fifth century
Yazdegerd I even allowed the

02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:52.040
Byzantine bishop Marutha of
Maipherqat to remove all the relics

02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.610
of Christians martyred in Sasanian
lands to his [inaudible] back home

02:17:55.610 --> 02:17:57.270
in the Byzantine Empire,

02:17:57.270 --> 02:18:00.070
which Marutha then
renamed Martyropolis,

02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:02.990
the city of the martyrs.

02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:05.750 position:56%
Yet with his Christian Queen Shirin,

02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:08.970
Khosrow became an enthusiastic
patron of Christian holy sites,

02:18:08.970 --> 02:18:11.030
churches, and monasteries.

02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:14.500
The Syriac "Life of the
Catholicos [inaudible]" notes

02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:18.940
that Shirin induced her husband
to build a monastery in Ctesiphon,

02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:22.930
while other sources describe the
construction and provisioning

02:18:22.930 --> 02:18:25.120
of the church and monastery
associated

02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:28.670
with the massive Sasanian
royal complex of Qasr-e Shirin.

02:18:28.670 --> 02:18:32.340
Oops, this one there.

02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:35.170
This presents a number
of interesting questions.

02:18:35.170 --> 02:18:39.560 position:56%
Was Shirin truly the inspiration for
royal patronage of Christian sites?

02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:43.120
Was Shirin a convenient front for
the king to support Christians

02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:45.740
without alienating
Zoroastrian nobles and priests?

02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:49.060
Do our Christian writers
intentionally overstate the

02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:52.910
influence of Shirin and
Christian power during the reign

02:18:52.910 --> 02:18:54.820
of Khosrow II?

02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:57.940
Whatever the specific
answers here, royal patronage

02:18:57.940 --> 02:19:01.650
of Christian holy sites served to
raise the profile of these places,

02:19:01.650 --> 02:19:03.740
strengthen the bonds
between Christian subjects

02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:07.320
and Sasanian king, and
assert royal authority

02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:10.690
over the Christian holy sites.

02:19:10.690 --> 02:19:12.570
Christian writers were, however,

02:19:12.570 --> 02:19:16.840
eager to emphasize the
limits of royal power.

02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:19.940
Take, for example, the account
in the Armenian [speaking

02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:23.250
in foreign language] in which
he describes Shirin's efforts

02:19:23.250 --> 02:19:29.230
to thwart Khosrow's transfer of
the bones of the prophet Daniel,

02:19:29.230 --> 02:19:32.070
portrayed in this image
as an Iranian aristocrat

02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:37.460
and also probably a eunuch,
from Shush to Khuzestan --

02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:41.880
Shush in Khuzestan into the
hands of the Byzantine emperor.

02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:44.820
The queen asked the people
of Shush to pray to Christ

02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:47.800
to thwart her husband's
efforts, and was rewarded

02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:49.670
with miraculous intervention

02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:51.710
when the prophet's bones
left the city gate,

02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:53.780
all of the city's springs dried up

02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:57.670
and the mules pulling the litter
refused to abandon the city.

02:19:57.670 --> 02:20:01.350
When Daniel returned to his
home, its springs gushed forth

02:20:01.350 --> 02:20:05.520
and the King of Kings and the
Byzantine emperor alike were forced

02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:08.280
to bow to the will of God.

02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:11.080
Curiously, though, in making
its point about the limits

02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:14.630
of royal power, the story
presents Shirin as a champion

02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:18.650
of a uniquely Sasanian
Christianity, opposed to foreigners

02:20:18.650 --> 02:20:21.930
who might steal divine
grace from Iranshahr,

02:20:21.930 --> 02:20:26.110
like Marutha who I've already
mentioned in the fifth century.

02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:28.750
Indeed, Sasanian kings and
their Christian subjects came

02:20:28.750 --> 02:20:32.700
to collaborate openly and directly
from the fifth century onward.

02:20:32.700 --> 02:20:35.480
Christians, being outside the
empire's traditional political

02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:38.930
elites, were potentially more
reliable supporters of the dynasty

02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:42.530
than the fiercely independent
great families of Iran.

02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:46.240
After convening a Christian
senate at Ctesiphon in 410,

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:49.390
the kings allowed Christians to
worship openly, and the Church

02:20:49.390 --> 02:20:54.820
of the East -- the Syrian Church of
the East was officially recognized

02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:57.870
as temporal authority
of the King of Kings.

02:20:57.870 --> 02:21:01.480
In return for tolerance,
Christian clerics, especially those

02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:05.750 position:56%
of this East Syrian Church, offered
their prayers for the king and acted

02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:09.980
as mediators between the King of
Kings and the Christian subjects.

02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:12.380
After this settlement, it
was increasingly common

02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:16.210
to see Christians in service to the
Sasanian dynasty, with the clergy

02:21:16.210 --> 02:21:18.360
of the Church of the
East even acting overtly,

02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:22.450
and sometimes covertly,
as agents as the king.

02:21:22.450 --> 02:21:25.670
While the Sasanian kings
remained resolutely Zoroastrian,

02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:29.670
Sasanian Christians increasingly
saw Iranshahr and its kings

02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:33.880
as instruments of God's will,
and also saw the submission

02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:37.680
of Zoroastrian elites and the king
to the Christian God and savior

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:41.070
as only a matter of
time, inevitable.

02:21:41.070 --> 02:21:43.580
Khosrow's marriage to a
Christian and Shirin's prominence

02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:47.930
at court fed this popular
perception of Christian triumph.

02:21:47.930 --> 02:21:50.590
We may see this in the
seventh century Armenian vision

02:21:50.590 --> 02:21:54.210
of the nativity where the
magi are clearly portrayed

02:21:54.210 --> 02:21:56.820
as Sasanian aristocrats
offering their submission

02:21:56.820 --> 02:22:00.410
to Christ and the virgin.

02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:04.650
Shirin, the queen of queens, served
as the pole star for constellations

02:22:04.650 --> 02:22:07.590
of Christian notables
at Khosrow II's court.

02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:11.100 position:56%
Christian physicians like the
queen's favorite, Gabriel of Sinjar,

02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:13.100 position:56%
attended to the king and his family.

02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:14.500
And many of the top financial

02:22:14.500 --> 02:22:17.140
and military officials
serving the dynasty,

02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:19.040
like the finance minister Yazdin

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:21.660
and the Armenian General Sinbad
Digortuni [assumed spelling],

02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:23.060
were Christians.

02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:26.580 position:56%
These Christian grandees advanced at
court with the enthusiastic support

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:31.160
of the queen and rewarded the
king with their loyal service.

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:34.150
Christian clergy and holy men
also found places at court

02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:36.350
under Shirin's sponsorship.

02:22:36.350 --> 02:22:39.710
For some, the queen
provided protection.

02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:41.620
The Armenian Catholicos
Viroi [assumed spelling],

02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:45.030
implicated in a revolt,
fled to the queen at court

02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:49.150
and was spared execution
as a present from the king.

02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:53.020
Viroi remained an honored prisoner
at court for the next 25 years,

02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:56.570
learning Persian, which we I think
would all agree is probably a much

02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:58.490
better fate than the
death, mutilation,

02:22:58.490 --> 02:23:02.260
or banishment suffered
by his other rebels.

02:23:02.260 --> 02:23:05.440
Shirin's favor at court could
establish a clergyman's power

02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:08.430 position:56%
and status in both church and state.

02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:12.170 position:56%
East Syrian sources describe how
Shirin introduced the Ascetic Bishop

02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:16.730
Sabrisho of Lashom to the
king, providing miraculous aid

02:23:16.730 --> 02:23:19.470
to the king during his civil
wars and acting as go-between

02:23:19.470 --> 02:23:20.770
with the Byzantine emperor.

02:23:20.770 --> 02:23:24.680 position:56%
Sabrisho became Shirin and Khosrow's
clear choice for Catholicos

02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:26.390
of the Church of the East.

02:23:26.390 --> 02:23:29.690
After securing his
election, Sabrisho served

02:23:29.690 --> 02:23:33.430
as the queen's confessor and an
important advisor to the king.

02:23:33.430 --> 02:23:35.790
Indeed, Sabrisho died on campaign,

02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:39.830
with Khosrow having helped
suppress a revolt in Nisibis.

02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:43.460 position:56%
Notably, though, the East
Syrian-Khuzestan Chronicle condemned

02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:47.840
Shirin for her role in elevating
Sabrisho's successor, her favorite,

02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:49.660
Gregory of Phrat, in place

02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:52.000
of her husband's preferred
candidate Gregory

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.420
of Kashgar, the Bishop of Nisibis.

02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:57.680
According to the story, she
tricked the assembled bishops

02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:00.970
because they both were named
Gregory, so she implied

02:24:00.970 --> 02:24:03.160
that her husband preferred
one Gregory

02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:05.320
over the other, and it was not.

02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:09.420 position:56%
Apparently, Khosrow furiously
thereafter ordered the newly-elected

02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:13.270
catholicos to ransom a bunch of
Christian books and pay him a sort

02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:17.850
of one-time payment to
get out of the doghouse.

02:24:17.850 --> 02:24:19.330 position:56%
Well, this story is a bit ludicrous.

02:24:19.330 --> 02:24:22.480
It's a little hard to imagine that
either bishops or king would be

02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:26.590
so easily swayed by the simple
fact of a coincidence of names.

02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:31.340
Khosrow did refuse
to allow the election

02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:37.030
of a new catholicos
after Gregory's death.

02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:39.630
And this brings us to a
sort of final point --

02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:41.170
or final section of the paper.

02:24:41.170 --> 02:24:44.640
While our sources attest to
Shirin's power in the empire

02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:47.270
and its churches, her actions
are often denigrated in some

02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:51.850
of our sources, most notably Syrian
ones like the Khuzestan Chronicle.

02:24:51.850 --> 02:24:54.560
While some of this was rooted
in contemporary opposition

02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:58.380
to female authority over matters
political and theological,

02:24:58.380 --> 02:24:59.980
it also reflects the intra-

02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:04.140 position:56%
and inter-communal debates among the
Christians of the Sasanian realm.

02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:08.740
From the 410 senate of Ctesiphon
to the time of Khosrow II,

02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:13.530
the East Syrian Church of the
East had served as something akin

02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:15.910
to an official state church.

02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:18.550
As we've seen, East Syrian
clergy proved willing

02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:21.150
to accommodate themselves
to royal power.

02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:23.720
However, their prominence
was increasingly challenged

02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:28.260
by a new Christian movement
within the empire who Shirin came

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:31.030
to become the champion of.

02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:33.660
Matters of theology
became increasingly central

02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:36.900
in defining Christian communities
by the sixth and seventh century.

02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:41.780 position:56%
In a politically-wise move, Sasanian
Christians largely rejected the

02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:47.850
two-nature Christology adopted
at the 451 counsel of Chalcedon

02:25:47.850 --> 02:25:52.170
as a Greek innovation imposed
by the Byzantine emperors.

02:25:52.170 --> 02:25:53.470
The most significant churches

02:25:53.470 --> 02:25:57.400
of late Sasanian Iranshahr adopted
either a distinct anti-king,

02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:00.770
two-natures Christology -- I
won't get into the details of this

02:26:00.770 --> 02:26:02.880
because it's horrifically
complicated --

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:08.360 position:56%
or an Alexandrian single-nature
Christology, which would be the sort

02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:12.100
of miaphysite West Syrian
and Armenian churches.

02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:16.190
In the sixth century, the sort of
up-and-coming miaphysite preachers,

02:26:16.190 --> 02:26:19.740
some of them who had been driven
out of the Byzantine Empire,

02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:22.900
made significant inroads
in Sasanian territories.

02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:24.200
Sasanian Christians --

02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:29.450
sorry, Armenian Christians taking
an anti-Chalcedonian stance

02:26:29.450 --> 02:26:33.430
at the Councils of [inaudible],
endorsed a miaphysite creed,

02:26:33.430 --> 02:26:36.810
while the enormously-influential
Assyrian fathers of Iberia,

02:26:36.810 --> 02:26:40.950 position:56%
now seen as paragons of Chalcedonian
orthodoxy in modern Georgia,

02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:44.100
probably spread miaphysite
teachings, too.

02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:46.470
The Syriac theological
school in the politically-

02:26:46.470 --> 02:26:51.000
and strategically-vital city
of Nisibis became a flash point

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.480
for debate and conflict between
duaphysite and miaphysite teachers.

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:57.320
Indeed, the breakup of that
school around the beginning

02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:00.450
of the seventh century must be seen
against this doctrinal conflict,

02:27:00.450 --> 02:27:03.290
as well as court politics.

02:27:03.290 --> 02:27:07.430
Indeed, miaphysites seem to
have had growing influence

02:27:07.430 --> 02:27:10.590
in the Sasanian court going
into the early seventh century.

02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:13.990
The Armenian church won
particular favor with Khosrow

02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:17.120
as Armenian generals and troops
supported him in his restoration

02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:20.450
to the throne, and his wars
with his rebellious uncles,

02:27:20.450 --> 02:27:24.790
and conflicts with the Turks on
the empire's eastern frontier.

02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:29.030
Culturally, the miaphysite Armenian
church's aristocratic orientation

02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:32.120 position:56%
was also a somewhat more comfortable
fit with the social dynamics

02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:35.500
of the Sasanian aristocracy.

02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:39.110
However, for many East Syrian
authors, the triumph of heresy

02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:42.110
at court was due entirely to Shirin

02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:45.920
and to her silver-tongued
serpent Gabriel of Sinjar.

02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:48.240
The physician Gabriel was a
particular favorite of Shirin's

02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:51.650
for helping the queen bear a
son, and was intensely involved

02:27:51.650 --> 02:27:53.920
in the politics of the
Church of the East.

02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.640
However, following his
excommunication from that church

02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:59.380
for bigamy, Gabriel
became a vocal advocate

02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:02.170
for the miaphysite
position at church.

02:28:02.170 --> 02:28:05.470
Gabriel's failed attempts to
promote a miaphysite to catholicos

02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:07.530
at the East Syrian
Church contributed

02:28:07.530 --> 02:28:12.350
to the office remaining
vacant for almost two decades.

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:15.390
Gabriel and the miaphysite theology
he endorsed enjoyed the queen's

02:28:15.390 --> 02:28:18.320
increasingly enthusiastic support.

02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:21.620
However, miaphysitism
really got its biggest boost

02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:27.800 position:56%
from the Sasanian conquest of much
of the Byzantine East where a number

02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:32.220
of disgruntled miaphysites lived,
and where Khosrow was happy

02:28:32.220 --> 02:28:37.680
to accommodate them by
appointing miaphysite bishops.

02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:41.500
This all comes together ultimately
at an instant that's described

02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:46.650
in a number of sources, sometimes
called the Senate of the Persians,

02:28:46.650 --> 02:28:49.500
which appears to have
been held sometime

02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:54.030
in the second decade
of the seventh century.

02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:57.490
At this senate there seems to
have been some sort of attempt

02:28:57.490 --> 02:29:01.540
to establish a state version
of Christianity centered

02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:03.740
around miaphysitism,
or at least to try

02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:06.120
and reconcile the various
doctrinal differences

02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:08.350
between the Christian factions.

02:29:08.350 --> 02:29:12.280
The Armenian [inaudible] describes
this senate as the Persians

02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:17.080
in some detail as a dispute between
the orthodox, for him miaphysites,

02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:19.070
which included the
queen, Gabriel of Sinjar,

02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:22.640
and other various West
Syrian and Armenian bishops.

02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:27.090
The East Syrian, Iran Catholicos
and his supporters on another side,

02:29:27.090 --> 02:29:31.830 position:56%
and various Greek supporters of the
Chalcedonian creed, along with Viroi

02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:34.290
who was hanging out at court.

02:29:34.290 --> 02:29:36.880
In [inaudible] telling,
Khosrow ordered the --

02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:42.210
also ordered the Jewish Chief
Rabbi, who showed up uninvited,

02:29:42.210 --> 02:29:45.620
unceremoniously expelled and
beaten from the conference

02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:48.780
for denying the divinity of Christ.

02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:52.610
But nevertheless, what seems
to be happening here is --

02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:55.090
you know, at least
across our sources,

02:29:55.090 --> 02:29:58.520
is that Khosrow was not entirely
prepared to sever his kind

02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:01.910
of traditional alliance with the
Church of the East, but was hoping

02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:04.530
to sort of harmonize the
Church of the East with a sort

02:30:04.530 --> 02:30:08.880
of growing miaphysite community who
were of vital strategic importance

02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:12.050
in the frontier regions
of the empire.

02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:16.180
Khosrow's capture of Jerusalem
and the true cross in 614,

02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:18.530
and the seeming inevitability
of his final victory

02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:21.250
over the Chalcedonian
emperors in Constantinople,

02:30:21.250 --> 02:30:23.060
made Khosrow a leading
candidate for --

02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:26.280
as legitimate earthly
king of all Christians.

02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:30.190
In this role, the king sought a
place above the fray, supporting

02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:33.450 position:56%
and controlling Christian
institutions even-handedly while his

02:30:33.450 --> 02:30:35.910
wife and Christian court
officials concerned themselves

02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:38.140
with the messy business
of engaging with

02:30:38.140 --> 02:30:41.000 position:56%
and managing the Christian minority.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.740 position:56%
In the end, though, Khosrow's
dreams of universal dominion failed.

02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:48.380
Although his Christian subjects had
proved among his most loyal allies,

02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:51.050
even in a conflict with
a Christian emperor,

02:30:51.050 --> 02:30:55.780
his highest courtiers abandoned
him when the tide of war turned.

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:59.190
Making common-cause with
his disinherited son,

02:30:59.190 --> 02:31:01.530
the nobles in the empire
deposed and killed the king.

02:31:01.530 --> 02:31:07.690
And then the -- Khosrow's son then
executed all the other male members

02:31:07.690 --> 02:31:10.020
of the dynasty, including
the sons of Shirin.

02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:14.010
As for Shirin, we have
two counts of her fate.

02:31:14.010 --> 02:31:20.530 position:56%
One has -- a Syrian source in Arabic
has her avenge the death of her son

02:31:20.530 --> 02:31:22.800
by poisoning Kavadh, the new king.

02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:27.970
In the "Shahnameh," she commits
suicide upon Khosrow's grave rather

02:31:27.970 --> 02:31:31.100
than being forced to marry his son.

02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:33.990 position:56%
But despite her fate, Shirin gives a
fascinating glimpse into the heights

02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:37.240
to which a Christian woman might
ascend in the Sasanian Empire,

02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:39.570
the manner in which
Christians and their --

02:31:39.570 --> 02:31:42.050
or Sasanians and their
Christian subjects were united

02:31:42.050 --> 02:31:45.450
and bound together by ties
of patronage and patriotism,

02:31:45.450 --> 02:31:46.900
and the centrality of Christians

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:50.080
in the late Sasanian world
in all their diversity.

02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:52.850
The enduring Churches of
the East would serve as one

02:31:52.850 --> 02:31:55.870
of the great legacies
of Sasanian Iranshahr.

02:31:55.870 --> 02:31:57.670
Thank you.

02:31:57.670 --> 02:32:03.710
[ Applause ]

02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:05.830
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Thank you
very much, Professor McDonough,

02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:11.240
for that fascinating account
of exchanges and interactions.

02:32:11.240 --> 02:32:14.940
Of course, being a scholar
of Persian literature,

02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:17.820
all the way through I was
thinking of the Shirin

02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:22.270
that [inaudible] introduced to
us, conveniently, of course,

02:32:22.270 --> 02:32:27.930
converted to Islam, even
though her Armenian origins are

02:32:27.930 --> 02:32:32.010
repeatedly explained.

02:32:32.010 --> 02:32:38.100
But the most fascinating part for
me is that as he ends that story,

02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:42.510
he tells us that this is
about nobody but Shirin.

02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:55.260
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:59.710
And then he takes that even one
step further and connects Shirin

02:32:59.710 --> 02:33:02.510
with his own wife, Ahfah
[assumed spelling].

02:33:02.510 --> 02:33:09.540
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:11.400
So Shirin is alive and well.

02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:15.200
And for those who don't speak
Persian, [inaudible] basically says

02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:21.490 position:56%
that this whole story is about
Shirin, and that lived a short life,

02:33:21.490 --> 02:33:24.840
and my wife reminded me
of that, and so I built

02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:27.640
that story on Shirin for you.

02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:33.310
So with that we look forward to the
last presentation of this panel,

02:33:33.310 --> 02:33:36.430
which will bring hopefully
for us more

02:33:36.430 --> 02:33:44.160
of a Jewish interaction
into the picture.

02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:48.140
And the presenter is
Professor Simcha Gross

02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:52.400
who is an Assistant Professor
of History of Late Antiquity

02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:57.740
or Antique Judaism at the
University of California, Irvine.

02:33:57.740 --> 02:34:00.820
So we have so far had
two illustrious speakers

02:34:00.820 --> 02:34:02.940
from that university.

02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:05.680
Dr. Gross got his PhD

02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:10.380
at Yale University Department
of Religious Studies.

02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:13.370
And his work is very much focused

02:34:13.370 --> 02:34:19.190
on creating and/or providing
an integrative account

02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:23.630
of the three elements of
Jews, serial Christians,

02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:28.480
and the larger Sasanian
Islamic Empire.

02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:33.740
So it's a very integrative reading
of that, which we will look forward

02:34:33.740 --> 02:34:39.570
to the presentation of
Dr. Gross's talk today.

02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:45.750
The title of it is "Kings or
Slaves, Babylonian Jewish Claims

02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:50.580
of Royal Genealogy in
Their Sasanian Context."

02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:53.510
Please welcome Professor Gross.

02:34:53.510 --> 02:35:01.730
[ Applause ]

02:35:01.730 --> 02:35:03.910
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: I'm in the
uncomfortable position of standing

02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:07.180
between Fatemeh's Persian
Poetry and lunch,

02:35:07.180 --> 02:35:12.560
so I'll try to get to the point.

02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.430
I want to thank the
organizers, sponsors,

02:35:16.430 --> 02:35:19.520
and all of you for attending.

02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:24.960
Am I up? As long as there
were Persian empires,

02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:26.420
there were Jews living in them.

02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:29.350
From the Achaemenids, through
the Sasanians, through the Shah,

02:35:29.350 --> 02:35:32.390
to the present day, Jews
have always been a fixture

02:35:32.390 --> 02:35:34.430
of Persian imperial rule.

02:35:34.430 --> 02:35:37.370
Yet of all the Persian empires,
arguably the most important

02:35:37.370 --> 02:35:39.800
for Jewish history was
the Sasanian Empire.

02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:41.470
The Jews who lived under
the Sasanian Empire,

02:35:41.470 --> 02:35:46.030
primarily in Sasanian Iraq --
so that's on the right-hand side

02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:48.240
of the map -- produced
the Babylonian Talmud,

02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:49.540
the crowning literary achievement

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:52.470
of Jewish Antiquity whose
production essentially coincided

02:35:52.470 --> 02:35:55.180
with nearly the entire
Sasanian period.

02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:58.030
The texts, rituals, and stories
that this community produced became

02:35:58.030 --> 02:35:59.780
and continue to be
normative for most Jews

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:01.080
around the world to this day.

02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:04.760
And yet only recently have
scholars turned their attention

02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:07.140
to the Sasanian context
of these Jews.

02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:09.890
These scholars have mostly shown
that Babylonian Jews were consumers

02:36:09.890 --> 02:36:13.410
of the rich range of
literatures, mythologies, stories,

02:36:13.410 --> 02:36:15.160
and even legal discussions
of the various groups

02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:17.860
that inhabited the Sasanian
Empire, including Zoroastrians,

02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:20.020
Syriac Christians,
Manichaeans, Mandaeans, and more.

02:36:20.020 --> 02:36:21.860
The richest example

02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:23.680
of this cross-cultural
exchange may be the hundreds

02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:25.300
of incantation bowls produced

02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:27.870
by these various groups
in Late Antiquity.

02:36:27.870 --> 02:36:31.910 position:56%
As you can see from the image above,
we have bowls inscribed in Mandaic,

02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:35.600
Syriac, and Jewish Babylonian
Aramaic, and even Middle Persian.

02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:38.160
These incantation bowls were
not only similar in form,

02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:41.720
they were oftentimes nearly
identical in their formula as well.

02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:43.020
These bowls show how the borders

02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:44.930
between these various
groups were far more porous

02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:47.430
than their texts would
often have us believe.

02:36:47.430 --> 02:36:50.850
Thus, a bowl written in Jewish
Babylonian Aramaic invokes

02:36:50.850 --> 02:36:54.110
Zoroastrian, Babylonian,
Christian, and Jewish mythology,

02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:57.470
as well as what appears to
be early Yazidi mythology.

02:36:57.470 --> 02:37:00.120
Together, the scholarly
textual studies as well

02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:01.420
as the increased publication

02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:03.760
of these incantation
bowls make it quite clear

02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:07.170
that Babylonian Jews had access to
other groups and their traditions.

02:37:07.170 --> 02:37:08.980
These studies have enriched
our understanding of the ways

02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:11.700
in which the various groups that
inhabited the same empire were

02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:13.310
at times in conversation
with one another.

02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:16.020 position:56%
They have also shown that these
groups can only be fully appreciated

02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:18.380
within their larger context.

02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:22.010
Today I want to move beyond these
moments of contact between groups

02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:23.640
and ask a broader question.

02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:28.020
In what ways were Babylonian
Jews Persianized or Sasanianized?

02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:29.750
In what ways did Babylonian
Jews interact

02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:31.680
with the Sasanian Empire
and its administration?

02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:35.280
In what ways did they accept,
reject, subvert, manipulate,

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:37.710
and otherwise negotiate the
norms and practices supported

02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:39.680
by their imperial context?

02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:42.120
A number of studies have
revealed the tip of the iceberg.

02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:44.490
For instance, Judith
Lerner, who's here today --

02:37:44.490 --> 02:37:46.820
sorry for calling you out --

02:37:46.820 --> 02:37:49.350
has shown how Jews and
Christians both used

02:37:49.350 --> 02:37:51.640
and subverted the imagery
on Sasanian seals.

02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:54.060
We've actually seen a number
of coins today that do this.

02:37:54.060 --> 02:38:00.650 position:56%
And so in this example on the left
you have the Zoroastrian fire priest

02:38:00.650 --> 02:38:02.580
-- or priest, rather,
with the fire alter.

02:38:02.580 --> 02:38:04.530
And on the right you seem to
have the binding of Isaac,

02:38:04.530 --> 02:38:06.830
even with the ram stuck
in the brush on the side.

02:38:06.830 --> 02:38:10.260
Other scholars have shown how
Sasanian imperial propaganda

02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:13.140
in the forms of inscriptions and
stories were known to and used

02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:15.680
by Jews and Syriac Christians in
their own literary productions.

02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:18.350
I want to offer a broader profile

02:38:18.350 --> 02:38:21.190
of what a single Jewish
household aspiring to a position

02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:24.020
as a Persian elite may have looked
like in the Sasanian Empire.

02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:25.710
We have the most evidence

02:38:25.710 --> 02:38:27.820
for one very important
Babylonian Jewish household

02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:29.890
that adopted elite Persian norms.

02:38:29.890 --> 02:38:32.810
The head of this family was known
as the Exilarch, the rosh galut

02:38:32.810 --> 02:38:35.320
in Hebrew, or reysh
galuta in Aramaic.

02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:37.060
And this title was
hereditary, passed on to one

02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:39.370
of his children upon
the Exilarch's death.

02:38:39.370 --> 02:38:41.460
The members of this family,
the children, sons-in-law,

02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:44.630
and their [inaudible] were all part
of the household of the Exilarch.

02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:47.270
Thankfully, the Exilarchy has
recently received a comprehensive

02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:51.130
study by Geoffrey Herman, to
which I am deeply indebted.

02:38:51.130 --> 02:38:53.720
Given that nearly all of our
surviving sources about Jews living

02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:56.260
in the Sasanian Empire during this
period are from texts composed

02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:59.000
by rabbis now embedded
in the Babylonian Talmud,

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.570
we only get a glimpse of the
Exilarch through the rabbis' eyes.

02:39:02.570 --> 02:39:05.060
The rabbis did not always have a
particularly flattering perspective

02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:07.530
of the Exilarch, but their
criticisms are quite revealing,

02:39:07.530 --> 02:39:09.790
precisely because they were
bothered by the Persianization

02:39:09.790 --> 02:39:12.000
of the Exilarch and his household.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.140
Moreover, alongside the Exilarch,

02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:16.300
they critique the other
similar elite Jewish households,

02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:18.620
revealing that the Exilarch was
not the only Jewish household

02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:20.720
to adopt elite Persian norms.

02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:23.520
To be sure, the bias of the
rabbis against the Exilarch

02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:26.280
and other Jewish families means we
have to be cautious when reading

02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:28.260
and evaluating their remarks.

02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:30.510
However, there is also a benefit
to the polemical character

02:39:30.510 --> 02:39:32.420
of their remarks, as
the [inaudible] position

02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:34.760
to the Exilarch reflects
the rabbi's own relationship

02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:37.210
to the Persian elite norms.

02:39:37.210 --> 02:39:39.290
The contrast between these
groups will give us insight

02:39:39.290 --> 02:39:41.840
into the different attitudes Jews
may have had toward Sasanian elite

02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:43.870
norms and provide us with
a more granular perspective

02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:47.550
of different Jewish
strata in Sasanian society.

02:39:47.550 --> 02:39:49.990
The rabbis have a sustained
critique of a member

02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:52.980
of the Exilarch's household, Rav
Nahman, in a single location.

02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:55.710
This critique is not unique,
but rather representative

02:39:55.710 --> 02:39:57.820
of larger themes concerning
the Exilarch found throughout

02:39:57.820 --> 02:39:59.120
rabbinic literature.

02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:03.340
In this story, a rabbi named Rav
Yehuda appears before the member

02:40:03.340 --> 02:40:07.100
of the household of the Exilarch
named, again, Rav Nahman.

02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:08.400
In their initial discussion,

02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:11.390
Rev Yehuda continuously critiques
Rav Nahman's grandiloquence.

02:40:11.390 --> 02:40:13.080
I'm going to be reading
from this now.

02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:16.940
"Said Rav Nahman of the Exilarch's
household to Rave Yehuda,

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:20.890
"Sit down on a karpita,""
which is some sort of a seat.

02:40:20.890 --> 02:40:24.250
"Rave Yehuda asked, "Is not safsal
as used by the Rabbis, or iztaba,

02:40:24.250 --> 02:40:28.130 position:56%
as commonly used, good enough?""
Meaning why are you using that word?

02:40:28.130 --> 02:40:32.190
There are so many other words
that we rabbis or common Jews use.

02:40:32.190 --> 02:40:35.370
"Rav Nahman continued, "Will
you partake of etronga,""

02:40:35.370 --> 02:40:37.690
which seems to be a citron.

02:40:37.690 --> 02:40:40.130
"Rav Yehuda replied,
"Thus did Samuel say,

02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:43.640
"He who says etronga is a
third puffed up with arrogance.

02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:45.510
Either Etrog, as it is
called by the rabbis,

02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:48.830
or etroga as it is
popularly called."

02:40:48.830 --> 02:40:51.920
"Will you drink anbaga,"
he asked him.

02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:54.680
"Are you then dissatisfied
with isparagus, as it is called

02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:57.930
by the rabbis, or anpak, as
it is popularly pronounced,"

02:40:57.930 --> 02:40:59.230
he reproved him."

02:40:59.230 --> 02:41:01.980
In each of these cases, Rav
Yehuda critiques Rav Nahman

02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:05.680
for using an arrogant or
haughty vocabulary word.

02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:08.720
If we pay attention, two of these
three words are Middle Persian,

02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.080
etronga and anbaga, and one
is Greek or Latin, karpita.

02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:14.710
According to this passage,
the member of --

02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:17.080
the members of the Exilarch's
household use different vocabulary

02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:18.570
than did the rabbis or common folk,

02:41:18.570 --> 02:41:21.520
and these words tended
to be Middle Persian.

02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:23.350
I only brought three examples
here, but there are a few others

02:41:23.350 --> 02:41:25.690
in the story used by Rav Nahman
that are also Middle Persian,

02:41:25.690 --> 02:41:27.880
and we'll see a few
of them as we go on.

02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:30.460
So for the moment it seems that
Rav Yehuda critiques Rav Nahman

02:41:30.460 --> 02:41:33.520
for using a highfalutin vocabulary
dominated by Middle Persian Words.

02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:38.210
The story continues by mocking
Rav Nahman's more liberal attitude

02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:40.020
toward women.

02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:44.250
""Let my daughter Donag come and
serve drink," Rav Nahman proposed.

02:41:44.250 --> 02:41:46.450
"Thus said Samuel,"
Rav Yehuda replied,

02:41:46.450 --> 02:41:47.860
"One must not make use of a woman."

02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:51.090
"But she is only a child,"
answered Rav Nahman.

02:41:51.090 --> 02:41:55.960
"Samuel distinctly said, "One must
make no use at all of a woman,

02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:57.840
whether adult or child,""
responded Rav Yehuda.

02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:01.960
"Will you send a greeting to my
wife Yalta," Rav Nahman suggested.

02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:03.700
"Thus said Samuel,"
Rav Yehuda replied,

02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:05.440
"to listen to a woman's
voice is indecent."

02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:08.700
"Is it possible through a
messenger," asked Rav Nahman.

02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:11.250
"Thus said Samuel, " Rave Yehuda
retorted, "One must not inquire

02:42:11.250 --> 02:42:12.870
after a woman's welfare."

02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:14.500
"Then by her husband,"
said Rav Nahman.

02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:17.680
"Thus said Samuel," said Rav
Yehuda, "One must not inquire

02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:20.120
after a woman's welfare at
all."" As you'll notice,

02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:23.280
Samuel can basically be made to
say whatever Rav Yehuda wants.

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:26.160
In round two of their exchange,
Rav Yehuda now critiques Rav Nahman

02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:27.460
for what he continues --

02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:30.490
what he considers to be Rav
Nahman's liberal approach to women.

02:42:30.490 --> 02:42:31.890 position:56%
Rav Yehuda essentially expects women

02:42:31.890 --> 02:42:35.100
to remain entirely out
of the sight of men.

02:42:35.100 --> 02:42:37.150
Rav Nahman's approach, however,
is once again in keeping

02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:41.200 position:56%
with what we can tell about Persian
attitudes toward women at this time.

02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:44.380 position:56%
In laws found in the approximately
seventh century [inaudible] of "Book

02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:47.760
of a Thousand Judgments," "Madayan
I Hazar I Dadestan," for example,

02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:50.630
women have the right to reject
marriages arranged by their father

02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:53.860
and are given other rights of
property and responsibility.

02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:56.270
The Sasanian attitude toward women
may also be gleaned from the fact

02:42:56.270 --> 02:42:58.140
that the goddess Anahid
was a central figure

02:42:58.140 --> 02:43:00.310
in the Sasanian pantheon.

02:43:00.310 --> 02:43:04.240 position:56%
Moreover, as noted by Yaakov Elman,
Rav Nahman's daughter's name, Donag,

02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:07.360
is in fact better pronounced
as Danog, the name of the wife

02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:10.480
and queen of the first king
of the Sasanian Empire.

02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:13.920
In fact, this name is itself
Persian and probably means follower

02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:16.020
of the Den, the Zoroastrian
way of life,

02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:19.010
a striking name for a Jewish woman.

02:43:19.010 --> 02:43:21.380 position:56%
The Exilarch's household was thus
known for its more liberal treatment

02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:23.540
of women, treatment that
conforms more closely

02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:25.140
to Persian than rabbinic norms.

02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:29.340 position:56%
The Exilarch and his household also
adopted other trappings of nobility.

02:43:29.340 --> 02:43:30.670
To give one example, the Exilarch

02:43:30.670 --> 02:43:31.970
and his household were
often depicted

02:43:31.970 --> 02:43:35.170
as traveling while
borne on golden thrones.

02:43:35.170 --> 02:43:37.240
Elsewhere in the Babylonian
Talmud, the Rav Nahman

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:39.900
of our story appears again,
this time on a golden throne.

02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:41.200
That's the story on the slide.

02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:46.300
In the Middle Persian source "Arda
Wiraz-namag," Arda Wiraz travels

02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:48.880
to the afterlife, in which
he sees, among other things,

02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:51.300
nobles seated on golden thrones.

02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:53.830
In fact, the Babylonian Talmud once
again uses a Middle Persian word

02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:55.430
to describe the throne,
the same word used

02:43:55.430 --> 02:43:56.730 position:56%
in "Arda Wiraz-namag," which is gah.

02:43:56.730 --> 02:44:00.020
This is just one example
of the elite regalia

02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:02.850
that the Exilarch seems
to have adopted.

02:44:02.850 --> 02:44:05.300
I would like to suggest
one more major way

02:44:05.300 --> 02:44:08.630 position:56%
in which the Exilarch adopted
certain aspects of Persian nobility.

02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:13.210
The most famous detail about the
Exilarch's household is its claim

02:44:13.210 --> 02:44:15.180
of genealogical descent
from King David.

02:44:15.180 --> 02:44:18.480 position:56%
For instance, there's a rabbinic
discussion in which it is determined

02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:19.850
that when the Torah
scroll is brought

02:44:19.850 --> 02:44:22.930
into public everyone
should follow behind it,

02:44:22.930 --> 02:44:24.870
thereby embodying the
figurative idea

02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:27.280
of following the Torah's
instructions.

02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:29.090
In response to this, a rabbi notes

02:44:29.090 --> 02:44:32.650
that in Babylonia the Torah is
actually brought to the Exilarch.

02:44:32.650 --> 02:44:33.950
He doesn't follow behind it.

02:44:33.950 --> 02:44:35.250
It is brought to him.

02:44:35.250 --> 02:44:37.080
And I'm quoting, "Everywhere
you say that one goes

02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:38.790
after the Torah scroll, but behold,

02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:41.290
there in Babylonia they bring
the Torah before the Exilarch!

02:44:41.290 --> 02:44:44.680
Rav Yose be-Rav Bun said, "In
that instance, since the seed

02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:47.800 position:56%
of David is embedded there, they act
for him accordance with the custom

02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:50.560
of his fathers."" The
equation of the Exilarch

02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:53.360
with King David is rather strong,
as the idea that the Torah comes

02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:56.430
to the Exilarch rather than
vice versa is based on laws

02:44:56.430 --> 02:45:01.200
about passing the Torah scroll to
the Jewish king when one exists.

02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:03.860
Overall, the rabbis did not
seem to particularly object

02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:05.600
to this genealogical claim.

02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:08.790 position:56%
However, they did object to a
similar claim made by another family

02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:10.970
of Babylonian Jewish elites.

02:45:10.970 --> 02:45:13.000
These Jews claimed descent
not from King David,

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:16.590
but from the Hasmonean kings.

02:45:16.590 --> 02:45:18.610
Thus in the very same
passage in which Rav Yehuda

02:45:18.610 --> 02:45:21.450
and Rav Nahman sparred, we
find the following exchange.

02:45:21.450 --> 02:45:25.580 position:56%
"A certain man from Nehardea entered
a butcher's shop in Pumbeditha

02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:27.880
and demanded, "Give me meat."

02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:30.230
"Wait until Rav Yehuda's attendant
takes his," was the reply,

02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:32.250
"and then we will serve you."

02:45:32.250 --> 02:45:34.880
"Who is Rav Yehuda," he exclaimed,
"to take precedence over me

02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:37.440
and be served before me?"" You're
all probably feeling the same way

02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:38.740
about lunch now.

02:45:38.740 --> 02:45:42.380 position:56%
"When they went and told Rav Yehuda,
he pronounced the ban against him.

02:45:42.380 --> 02:45:43.870
Said they to him, "He" --

02:45:43.870 --> 02:45:45.610
meaning the guy who
claims Hasmonean descent --

02:45:45.610 --> 02:45:47.610
"is wont to call people slaves."

02:45:47.610 --> 02:45:52.120 position:56%
Whereupon Rav Yehuda had him
proclaimed a slave, for Samuel said,

02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:56.600
"With his own blemish he
stigmatizes others as unfit."

02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:59.770
At this stage his opponent said to
Rav Yehuda, "You call me a slave,

02:45:59.770 --> 02:46:02.950
I who am descended from the
royal house of the Hasmoneans?"

02:46:02.950 --> 02:46:05.040
"Thus said Samuel," Rav Yehuda
retorted, "Whoever says,

02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:09.320
"I am descended from the house of
the Hasmoneans is a slave."" A man

02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:10.810
with a particular high estimation

02:46:10.810 --> 02:46:13.140
of himself approaches a
butcher and demands meat.

02:46:13.140 --> 02:46:14.970
The butcher, however,
refuses to sell the man meat

02:46:14.970 --> 02:46:17.620 position:56%
until Rav Yehuda's attendant comes
and takes the first choice of meats,

02:46:17.620 --> 02:46:18.970 position:56%
as a sign of respect for Rav Yehuda.

02:46:18.970 --> 02:46:21.730
The elite man questions how
Rav Yehuda could possibly take

02:46:21.730 --> 02:46:23.140
precedence over him.

02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:24.720
Over the course of the
conversation it is revealed

02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:27.270
that the man claims descent
from the Hasmoneans and,

02:46:27.270 --> 02:46:29.970
like a good patrician, goes around
calling other people slaves.

02:46:29.970 --> 02:46:33.620
Rav Yehuda declares instead that,
in fact, the man is a slave.

02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:36.390
We thus find two different
claims of royal descent

02:46:36.390 --> 02:46:39.550
by two clearly elite-posturing
figures, one from King David

02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:41.230
and one from the Hasmoneans.

02:46:41.230 --> 02:46:43.590
The evidence we have seen until
now suggests that we should --

02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:45.410
we had best look to the
Persian elite context

02:46:45.410 --> 02:46:47.390
to explain this phenomenon.

02:46:47.390 --> 02:46:50.800
And indeed, during the Sasanian
period, royal lineage was, in fact,

02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:52.790
a marker of elite status.

02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:55.400
Throughout this period, many of
the most important elite families,

02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:58.090
as well as kings in Armenia
and Georgia, claimed descent

02:46:58.090 --> 02:47:00.810
from the Arsacids, or
Pahlavi, or Parthian dynasty,

02:47:00.810 --> 02:47:03.100
the dynasty that ruled
before the Sasanians.

02:47:03.100 --> 02:47:07.300
And that's one text that claims it,
and that's a seal from someone --

02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:10.060
an elite who claimed this descent.

02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:12.700
Alongside these were other --
were the other great families,

02:47:12.700 --> 02:47:14.990
some of whom may also have
gone back to the Parthians,

02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:17.810
while others claim
different hoary ancestors.

02:47:17.810 --> 02:47:20.160
The Sasanians themselves
claimed royal descent,

02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:23.320
though the precise history
of this lineage is unclear.

02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:25.510
But by the beginning of the fifth
century, the Sasanians, too,

02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:29.010
adopted a number of strategies
to claim a hoary royal past,

02:47:29.010 --> 02:47:31.430
presumably in part due to
the importance of such claims

02:47:31.430 --> 02:47:32.730
in the Persian world more broadly.

02:47:32.730 --> 02:47:35.550
In this context, then,
it is hardly surprising

02:47:35.550 --> 02:47:38.350
that aspiring Jewish elites
would make parallel claims

02:47:38.350 --> 02:47:40.210
to royal descent.

02:47:40.210 --> 02:47:42.250
Whereas the Exilarch's claim
of genealogical descent

02:47:42.250 --> 02:47:45.280
from King David makes sense given
King David's generally-revered

02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:46.940
status in the Jewish tradition,

02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:51.010
the claim of the Hasmonean descent
is somewhat puzzling, as many Jews,

02:47:51.010 --> 02:47:52.320
and especially the rabbis,

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:55.380
were at the very least
ambivalent about Hasmonean rule.

02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:57.400
What motivated the man and
his family to claim descent

02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:59.560
from the Hasmoneans
in the first place?

02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:02.140
The answer may lie in the
fact that at the very end

02:48:02.140 --> 02:48:04.620
of the Hasmonean period,
the last king allied himself

02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:06.320
with the Parthians.

02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:08.200
Indeed, this was the
last Hasmonean king,

02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:11.370 position:56%
because despite Parthian assistance,
the Romans and their proxy,

02:48:11.370 --> 02:48:16.080 position:56%
King Herod, ultimately won, bringing
an end to the Hasmonean dynasty.

02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:18.750
I would, therefore, suggest that
some aspiring Jews opted for claims

02:48:18.750 --> 02:48:20.600
of descent from Jewish
kings who had a history

02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:23.950
of allying themselves
with Persian rulers.

02:48:23.950 --> 02:48:26.380
Moreover, in this context, the
habit of the Hasmonean descendent

02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:28.650
to call others slaves
makes more sense.

02:48:28.650 --> 02:48:30.830
A slave in Sasanian law
was the opposite of someone

02:48:30.830 --> 02:48:33.170
with untainted royal
genealogical descent.

02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:35.280
Slaves could be married off
at the whim of the owner,

02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:38.450
and the children were
then his slaves as well.

02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:39.750
Indeed, we find a striking source

02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:42.770
that discusses precisely how some
Iranians claiming Parthian descent

02:48:42.770 --> 02:48:44.220
were reduced to slaves.

02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:45.670
That's the source over there.

02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:50.460
Thus, the Exilarch, and presumably
other elite Jewish families

02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:53.370
like the Jew who claimed Hasmonean
descent, adopted a wide range

02:48:53.370 --> 02:48:55.430
of trappings of Persian nobility.

02:48:55.430 --> 02:48:56.810
They used specialized
Persian language,

02:48:56.810 --> 02:48:58.750
adopted Persian mores
regarding women,

02:48:58.750 --> 02:49:00.540 position:56%
and like their elite Sasanian peers,

02:49:00.540 --> 02:49:03.190
maintained royal genealogical
claims.

02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:04.490
Did it work?

02:49:04.490 --> 02:49:06.740
Were at least some of these
Jews successful in integrating

02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:08.850
into the Sasanian elite class?

02:49:08.850 --> 02:49:12.040 position:56%
In the case of the Exilarch, the
answer seems to be a definitive yes,

02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:14.540
as seen from the only non-rabbinic
source to mention the Exilarch,

02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:18.060
which was edited and translated
by our own Touraj Daryaee.

02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:21.640
And I'm reading here, "The city
of Susa and Sustar were built

02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:24.920
by Sisinduxt, the wife of
Yazdigird, the sun of Sabuhr,

02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:28.590
since she was the daughter of the
Exilarch, the King of the Jews,

02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:30.220
and also was the mother
of Wahram Gor."

02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:32.490
According to this source,

02:49:32.490 --> 02:49:36.180 position:56%
the Sasanian king Yazdgird I married
the daughter of the Jewish Exilarch.

02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:38.390
Like Danog, the daughter
of Rav Nahman,

02:49:38.390 --> 02:49:40.850
the daughter of the Exilarch
here receives a nice Persian name

02:49:40.850 --> 02:49:42.820
of Daughter of Susa.

02:49:42.820 --> 02:49:44.300
What's especially important here is

02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:47.730
that the Exilarch is identified
as the King of the Jews.

02:49:47.730 --> 02:49:50.640
This is not a mere expression, as
every other figure in this text

02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:54.900
who is called a shah refers to
a historical or mythical king.

02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:57.290
I would suggest that this claim --
that the claim of Davidic descent

02:49:57.290 --> 02:50:00.530
by the Exilarch was accepted by
the Sasanian royal household.

02:50:00.530 --> 02:50:01.830
This would also explain
how the daughter

02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:04.260
of the Exilarch was found
worthy to marry the king,

02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:07.420
as Sasanian kings only married
daughters of kings or noblemen.

02:50:07.420 --> 02:50:12.170
An example would be Shirin, as
Scott's presentation just showed.

02:50:12.170 --> 02:50:13.470
I end with the rabbis.

02:50:13.470 --> 02:50:16.990 position:56%
What do we make of rabbinic
disapproval of at least some aspects

02:50:16.990 --> 02:50:19.120
of these elite Jewish families?

02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:22.160
Some have suggested that this
shows a resistance by some rabbis

02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:24.210
to Persian norms in general.

02:50:24.210 --> 02:50:26.180
However, I think this is incorrect.

02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:28.680
Instead, I would argue that the
rabbis' disapproved of the Exilarch

02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:31.670 position:56%
and the purported Hasmonean
descendent because the latter strove

02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:34.870
to be part of elite Persian
society, whereas the rabbis strove

02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:37.320
to be elites in their
own local Jewish society.

02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:41.820
Thus, if we return to the story
of Rav Yehuda and Rav Nahman

02:50:41.820 --> 02:50:43.910
where Rav Yehuda critiqued Rav
Nahman for using Middle Persian

02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:46.970
and Greek words, we see that
the words Rav Yehuda preferred,

02:50:46.970 --> 02:50:49.660
the words he attributed to
the rabbis or common-folk,

02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:52.100
are themselves often
Persian and Greek words.

02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:54.830
And these are all the
highlighted words.

02:50:54.830 --> 02:50:58.380
However, there is an important
difference between these words.

02:50:58.380 --> 02:51:00.100
Rav Nahman's vocabulary
included terms

02:51:00.100 --> 02:51:02.490
that were relatively new
to the Sasanian period.

02:51:02.490 --> 02:51:03.870
Thus, they are either
Middle Persian words

02:51:03.870 --> 02:51:06.600
or Greek words never
attested before.

02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:08.680
By contrast, the words of
the rabbis or the words

02:51:08.680 --> 02:51:10.860
of the common-folk were
either Parthian or Greek words

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:13.520
that were introduced into Jewish
Aramaic in an earlier period.

02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:16.530
In linguistic parlance, this
is -- they were retentions.

02:51:16.530 --> 02:51:19.560 position:56%
In other words, the rabbis are not
opposed to Persian or Greek, per se.

02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:22.070
They are opposed to new
words and terminology

02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:26.390 position:56%
which they considered haughty,
apparently signs of Persian elitism.

02:51:26.390 --> 02:51:30.200
But this isn't opposition to
elite Persian norms as such.

02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:33.070
In fact, the Babylonian rabbis seem
to have modeled their own academies

02:51:33.070 --> 02:51:34.760 position:56%
after royal or elite Persian courts.

02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:38.810
For example, the Babylonian
academies were seated in rows just

02:51:38.810 --> 02:51:40.220
like the royal Persian court.

02:51:40.220 --> 02:51:44.040
And in the first section here
you see how a rabbi is demoted

02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:48.440
or promoted up the seven rows based
on how clever his questions are.

02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:52.230 position:56%
And the bottom, another rabbi who
he's asking questions to is promoted

02:51:52.230 --> 02:51:56.770 position:56%
and demoted with cushions, depending
on how good his answers are.

02:51:56.770 --> 02:52:00.960
So for example, the Babylonian
academies were seated in rows,

02:52:00.960 --> 02:52:03.900
just like the royal Persian court.

02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:06.270
Indeed, sitting in rows
seems to have been central

02:52:06.270 --> 02:52:08.090
to Persian imperial
culture for centuries,

02:52:08.090 --> 02:52:10.770
as Ancient Greek authors report
that Cyrus' court sat in rows,

02:52:10.770 --> 02:52:12.260 position:56%
and the Arsacids adopted this aspect

02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:15.040
of imperial Persian
culture themselves.

02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:18.190
Similarly, the prestigious
leading members of the academy sat

02:52:18.190 --> 02:52:20.380
on a number of cushions
that delineated their rank,

02:52:20.380 --> 02:52:21.680
also like the royal Persian court.

02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:25.330
Both the tows and the
cushions are standard aspects

02:52:25.330 --> 02:52:26.660
of Persian noble culture.

02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:29.540
In fact, if one thinks
about Rav Yehuda's encounter

02:52:29.540 --> 02:52:32.530
with the Hasmonean descendent,
their dispute did not simply arise

02:52:32.530 --> 02:52:35.270
because the Hasmonean
man acted as an elite,

02:52:35.270 --> 02:52:37.840
but precisely because the
Hasmonean man claimed superiority

02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:40.830
to Rav Yehuda's own privileged
position to choose his meats first.

02:52:40.830 --> 02:52:44.190
Rav Yehuda may have been less
opposed to elitism as such

02:52:44.190 --> 02:52:47.480
than to elitism that infringed
on his own privileges.

02:52:47.480 --> 02:52:49.460
Indeed, Rav Yehuda
calls the man a slave

02:52:49.460 --> 02:52:50.950
because the man called
others slaves,

02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:53.560
but by declaring the Hasmonean
descendent to be a slave,

02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:58.070
wouldn't Rav Yehuda be
committing the same offense?

02:52:58.070 --> 02:53:01.010 position:56%
Jews of all stripes were Persianized
and adopted the trappings

02:53:01.010 --> 02:53:02.660
of Persian culture and status.

02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:05.720
This is true of Jews throughout the
various Persian periods, as seen,

02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:07.770
for instance, by comparing
the architecture of Jewish

02:53:07.770 --> 02:53:10.360
and Muslim [inaudible]
shrines from the 18th century.

02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:12.660
But what exactly did
Persianization look like?

02:53:12.660 --> 02:53:15.830
And how exactly different Jews
adopt, reject, contest, co-op,

02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:18.490
and even contribute to Persian
culture and society changes

02:53:18.490 --> 02:53:22.270
with time, as does the
significance of Persianization.

02:53:22.270 --> 02:53:26.010
In the Sasanian period some
Jews, like the Exilarch,

02:53:26.010 --> 02:53:29.600 position:56%
strove to join elite Persian society
while others, like the rabbis,

02:53:29.600 --> 02:53:32.320
imagined their own academies
as elite courts and themselves

02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:34.360
as worthy of elite privileges.

02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:37.030
Persianization was not simply
something external to Jews,

02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:39.430
a set of cultural practices
they at times adopted

02:53:39.430 --> 02:53:41.320
and at other times rejected.

02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:44.760
Persianization inevitably affected
Jews living in the Sasanian period,

02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:46.890
their self-understanding,
aspirations, and more.

02:53:46.890 --> 02:53:50.310
It is my hope that future research
will help us appreciate how crucial

02:53:50.310 --> 02:53:53.080 position:56%
the Sasanian period was for these
Jews in particular and, as a result,

02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:54.700
for Jewish history more broadly.

02:53:54.700 --> 02:53:56.510
Thank you.

02:53:56.510 --> 02:54:03.750
[ Applause ]

02:54:03.750 --> 02:54:05.060
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Thank you all very much

02:54:05.060 --> 02:54:11.890 position:56%
for these three wonderfully complex
and colorful depictions of a society

02:54:11.890 --> 02:54:16.100
in which we see more and more
interaction and complexity.

02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:20.200
And thanks to the discipline
of all the speakers,

02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.830
we have a little time
for some questions.

02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:27.740
And I would encourage you to
please introduce yourselves

02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:32.460
and keep the questions as
short as you are able to so

02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:36.350
that we can reach more
people, please.

02:54:37.370 --> 02:54:39.730
There's one there.

02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:49.820
&gt;&gt; I'm Baron Bistakia
[assumed spelling]

02:54:49.820 --> 02:54:53.140
from the Zoroastrian community.

02:54:53.140 --> 02:54:56.380
On the west coast of India

02:54:56.380 --> 02:55:01.370
in [inaudible] we have
seen Christian crosses

02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:05.520
with [inaudible] writing,
and there is a group

02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:09.430
of Syrian Christians
who have settled there.

02:55:09.430 --> 02:55:15.400
And I'm wondering what led to that
migration of Syrian Christians

02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:21.680
to the west coast of
India from ancient times?

02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:28.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Scott McDonough: Well, so there's
certainly the claims that are made

02:55:28.010 --> 02:55:30.750
by those communities of
Christians that, you know,

02:55:30.750 --> 02:55:33.390
they're apostolic in origin.

02:55:33.390 --> 02:55:38.210
That, you know, they -- that one
of the apostles actually traveled

02:55:38.210 --> 02:55:40.280
to India and sort of
proselytized there,

02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:42.830
and that they date back to that.

02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:45.880
That's probably apocryphal.

02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:47.900
There have been some
thought about, you know,

02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:49.380
trade networks bringing
people there.

02:55:49.380 --> 02:55:53.290
And certainly the Church of
the East was very aggressive

02:55:53.290 --> 02:55:59.440
and proselytizing in
places quite far away from

02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:02.580
and outside of the Sasanian Empire.

02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:06.010
You know, there is a bishop
in Tibet in the eighth century

02:56:06.010 --> 02:56:07.460 position:56%
and a couple other places like that.

02:56:07.460 --> 02:56:08.760
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: And
an archive in China.

02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:10.060
&gt;&gt; Scott McDonough:
Yeah, yeah, certainly,

02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:13.960
and a number of monuments in China.

02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:17.140 position:56%
So you know, certainly there's trade
-- movement along trade routes.

02:56:17.140 --> 02:56:21.490
The Sasanians had political
interests in India from the time

02:56:21.490 --> 02:56:25.610
of Bahram [inaudible],
at least -- or earlier.

02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:29.770
And you know, then also with
the sort of conquest period,

02:56:29.770 --> 02:56:34.040 position:56%
I'm certain that just as Zoroastrian
communities came to settle in India

02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:35.420
as well, probably, you know,

02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:38.750
Iranian Christian communities
came alongside them.

02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:42.030
But that's just sort of
off the top of my head.

02:56:42.030 --> 02:56:46.510
I can probably make a
more [inaudible] comment

02:56:46.510 --> 02:56:49.410
if you want to chat.

02:56:49.410 --> 02:56:52.430
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Anyone else
want to answer that on the panel?

02:56:52.430 --> 02:56:53.730
Simcha? No?

02:56:53.730 --> 02:56:56.990
All right, any other questions?

02:56:56.990 --> 02:56:58.440
Anything on Zoroastrianism?

02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:00.350
On the Syriac Armenian churches?

02:57:00.350 --> 02:57:01.650
On Judaism?

02:57:01.650 --> 02:57:03.300
&gt;&gt; Quick question.

02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:04.600
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Okay.

02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:08.370
&gt;&gt; Is there a Middle --

02:57:08.370 --> 02:57:10.920
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Yes.

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:17.320
The question was is
there a Middle --

02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:18.880
&gt;&gt; I'm asking the philologist,

02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:20.180
the Middle Persian [speaking
in foreign language]?

02:57:20.180 --> 02:57:21.790
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina:
It's in Pazand, it's like --

02:57:21.790 --> 02:57:23.090
&gt;&gt; Pazand?

02:57:23.090 --> 02:57:24.390
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina: --

02:57:24.390 --> 02:57:26.550
it's like [speaking in foreign
language], something like that.

02:57:26.550 --> 02:57:29.990
&gt;&gt; Oh, skull, so something
actually without -- oh, okay.

02:57:29.990 --> 02:57:31.290
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw
Vevaina: Like --

02:57:31.290 --> 02:57:32.590
&gt;&gt; Numbskull?

02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:34.110
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina:
Numbskull, feather-head, something.

02:57:34.110 --> 02:57:35.410
Yeah.

02:57:35.410 --> 02:57:36.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:38.010
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Yeah.

02:57:38.010 --> 02:57:39.310
&gt;&gt; It's numbskull.

02:57:39.310 --> 02:57:40.610
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: All right,

02:57:40.610 --> 02:57:42.730
if there are no more
questions, there is lunch.

02:57:42.730 --> 02:57:45.130
But I -- oh, there is question.

02:57:45.130 --> 02:57:49.710
There is question, great, so here.

02:57:49.710 --> 02:57:52.490
&gt;&gt; I'm [inaudible], lately retired
from the Library of Congress.

02:57:52.490 --> 02:57:57.480
Question for Dr. Vevaina, what
accounts for the great study

02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:01.850
and influence of Mani,
despite his being, you know,

02:58:01.850 --> 02:58:04.370
killed by the Sasanians
as a heretic?

02:58:04.370 --> 02:58:06.780
His influence went far
and wide to Central Asia,

02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:09.320
and China, and even to the West.

02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:13.370
And there is present-day
scholarship on him as well.

02:58:13.370 --> 02:58:17.190
So what would you say is the
reason for this great influence?

02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:19.450
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw
Vevaina: Well, I think --

02:58:19.450 --> 02:58:22.740
so Mani does something
somewhat unprecedented.

02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:26.030
I mean, he really is
the first person

02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:30.300
to make a truly universalizing
claim about religion.

02:58:30.300 --> 02:58:32.810
And he says this in one of
the texts that I cited --

02:58:32.810 --> 02:58:34.740
I had in the PowerPoint there.

02:58:34.740 --> 02:58:38.270
Essentially, mine is not
one religion for one people

02:58:38.270 --> 02:58:40.510
or one ethnicity, it's
for all peoples,

02:58:40.510 --> 02:58:42.570
and it's in all these languages.

02:58:42.570 --> 02:58:45.990
And so you see Manichaean
materials produced both East

02:58:45.990 --> 02:58:48.360
and West, all over the place.

02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:52.180
The thing that made
Manichaeism both brilliant

02:58:52.180 --> 02:58:55.950
and efficient also was the seeds of
its destruction, which is that --

02:58:55.950 --> 02:58:59.540
and I mean this with no
pejorative -- it is a sort of a --

02:58:59.540 --> 02:59:03.240
it has a sort of parasitic aspect
in that in every environment

02:59:03.240 --> 02:59:08.010
where it goes, it takes on the
guise of the local vocabulary,

02:59:08.010 --> 02:59:10.030
the traditions, the ideas.

02:59:10.030 --> 02:59:15.790
So it would be super-efficient
in the sense that everyone feels

02:59:15.790 --> 02:59:19.990
that they get to see themselves
in their own prior identities.

02:59:19.990 --> 02:59:22.620
They don't actually feel like
they're necessarily switching

02:59:22.620 --> 02:59:26.280
to something else, as getting
a more refined message.

02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:29.980
But therein lies the problem,
because from the imperial

02:59:29.980 --> 02:59:34.200
and religious elites everywhere,
East and West, this will look

02:59:34.200 --> 02:59:39.010
like a highly virulent sort of
heresy and things like that.

02:59:39.010 --> 02:59:40.460
And it's really interesting that --

02:59:40.460 --> 02:59:43.030
I mean, except for the
[inaudible] Turks, I mean,

02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:48.850 position:56%
everywhere else they were persecuted
and never became a state religion.

02:59:48.850 --> 02:59:55.540
And the way that the vocabulary --
Manichaeism is a strange phenomenon

02:59:55.540 --> 03:00:00.920
because what we have is
examples in Coptic, in Greek,

03:00:00.920 --> 03:00:03.220
in Latin, [inaudible], Parthian.

03:00:03.220 --> 03:00:06.340
Interesting thing is that even the
Middle Persian and the Parthian,

03:00:06.340 --> 03:00:08.780
which could be -- which
should be pretty close,

03:00:08.780 --> 03:00:12.160
don't always have the
same Zoroastrian deities

03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:14.350
in the same slots in the system.

03:00:14.350 --> 03:00:17.210
It was really tailor-made

03:00:17.210 --> 03:00:20.330
for the environment, if
that makes any sense.

03:00:20.330 --> 03:00:22.880
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: So and just
to add to what Yuhan said,

03:00:22.880 --> 03:00:25.620
which is 100% correct, is Muhammed

03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:28.090
in some ways adopted the
same strategy but went

03:00:28.090 --> 03:00:29.640
about it a little bit differently.

03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:32.850
And so he also integrates Jewish
prophets, Christian prophets.

03:00:32.850 --> 03:00:34.270
It's -- well, he treats
them as Jewish prophets,

03:00:34.270 --> 03:00:37.480
Christian prophets -- into
his system, but I guess the --

03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:41.440
it never veered too far away
from the original message.

03:00:41.440 --> 03:00:43.220
Whereas, Mani explicitly makes --

03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:46.110
he is going after Iranian
traditions, Christian traditions.

03:00:46.110 --> 03:00:48.050 position:56%
He's integrating pretty consciously.

03:00:48.050 --> 03:00:50.950
And so later followers end up
integrating more, and more,

03:00:50.950 --> 03:00:53.320
and more, and it kind
of fizzles out.

03:00:54.740 --> 03:00:57.310
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina:
And he did extremely well

03:00:57.310 --> 03:00:59.220
in the early years
under the Sasanians,

03:00:59.220 --> 03:01:01.020
and he had royal patronage.

03:01:01.020 --> 03:01:02.500
I mean, there's also
the interesting question

03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:05.900
of why did the Sasanians
turn on him?

03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:08.460
And you know, it's --
probably the simple answer is

03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:11.560 position:56%
that the Zoroastrian priests were
like, "This is getting out of hand."

03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:12.860
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: I wonder

03:01:12.860 --> 03:01:18.460
if there is any real academic
discussion of all the attribution

03:01:18.460 --> 03:01:20.500
of all the artistic
size of his religion,

03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:23.470
and his paintings, and all that?

03:01:23.470 --> 03:01:24.890
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: His
pain book, you mean?

03:01:24.890 --> 03:01:26.390
He had -- he basically also --

03:01:26.390 --> 03:01:27.690
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Yes.

03:01:27.690 --> 03:01:28.990
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw
Vevaina: Painter.

03:01:28.990 --> 03:01:30.290
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: -- he created a --

03:01:30.290 --> 03:01:31.590
he was the first person
to put out comic books.

03:01:31.590 --> 03:01:33.190
So he put out comic books
to promote his religion.

03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:35.480
And in some ways, the
medium may have --

03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:38.660
we have similar images that
exist throughout the world.

03:01:38.660 --> 03:01:40.950
So we don't actually have the
original, but it seems to be

03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:43.350
that there's some sort
of consistent tradition

03:01:43.350 --> 03:01:46.850
about what these pictures would
have looked like, ranging really

03:01:46.850 --> 03:01:48.880
from the -- I shouldn't say
West and East anymore --

03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:52.700
from the Roman Empire through Asia.

03:01:52.700 --> 03:01:54.130 position:56%
And so that definitely would have --

03:01:54.130 --> 03:01:57.360
may have contributed to his initial
success and burst onto the scene.

03:01:57.360 --> 03:01:58.990
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina:
And if I could just add a small --

03:01:58.990 --> 03:02:00.290
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Sure.

03:02:00.290 --> 03:02:01.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina: One
of the interesting things it that,

03:02:01.850 --> 03:02:05.190
you know, Mani as part of
his prophetic biography says

03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:07.550
that he goes as a healer
and a doctor

03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:09.590
to India, and things like that.

03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:12.940
And for those of you from
South Asia, you have this --

03:02:12.940 --> 03:02:16.090
you hear these stories of Jesus
went to India, and his tomb was

03:02:16.090 --> 03:02:17.770 position:56%
in Kashmir, and all of these things.

03:02:17.770 --> 03:02:19.070
And --

03:02:19.070 --> 03:02:20.370
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: And Thomas.

03:02:20.370 --> 03:02:21.670
&gt;&gt; Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina: --

03:02:21.670 --> 03:02:24.590
many of these stories I personally
think are actually the Manichaean

03:02:24.590 --> 03:02:27.690
biography re-tasked for Jesus,

03:02:27.690 --> 03:02:29.910
because he's a latter-day
Jesus anyway.

03:02:29.910 --> 03:02:32.320
Makes perfect sense.

03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:33.830
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Yeah, also in Augustine's

03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:38.130
"Confessions" there is a lot of
reference to this fascination

03:02:38.130 --> 03:02:43.900
with Manichaeism in the early
stages, and then going back.

03:02:43.900 --> 03:02:47.920
But sorry -- other?

03:02:47.920 --> 03:02:49.440
Oh, yes. I'm sorry, go ahead.

03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:53.920
&gt;&gt; Scott McDonough: I was wondering
about what evidence we have

03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:57.630
for the status of the
Exilarch under the Parthians,

03:02:57.630 --> 03:03:01.830
particularly with the sort of
Parthian/Early Sasanian system

03:03:01.830 --> 03:03:04.880
of kind of subordinate
kings that kind

03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:06.640
of the Sasanians phase
out over time.

03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:09.670
I was just wondering if
you could comment on that?

03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:11.090
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: Yeah, so
this is a problem in general

03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:14.350
with Babylonian Judaism
that we -- our first --

03:03:14.350 --> 03:03:18.140
let's call it indigenous
source of Babylonian Jews,

03:03:18.140 --> 03:03:19.520
or any real extended source

03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:21.730
by Babylonian Jews is
the Babylonian Talmud.

03:03:21.730 --> 03:03:23.960 position:56%
Now just like we were talking about
with Middle Persian and Arabic texts

03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:26.160
that are kind of very late and
we have to figure out what --

03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:29.050
which one of these later texts
can we trust about earlier events?

03:03:29.050 --> 03:03:31.870
The Babylonian Talmud is
a let's call it sixth,

03:03:31.870 --> 03:03:35.080
seventh century text --
probably sixth century,

03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:36.950
which includes lots of sources.

03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:38.250
It makes up sources.

03:03:38.250 --> 03:03:41.050
So as was saw, Samuel did
not say any of the things

03:03:41.050 --> 03:03:45.770 position:56%
that Rav Yehuda attributed to him in
my lecture, but you can kind of --

03:03:45.770 --> 03:03:48.440
it was -- they were very malleable.

03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:53.260 position:56%
In terms of -- so we have no -- we
don't have anything to actually talk

03:03:53.260 --> 03:03:55.180
about the Parthian period --
Jews in the Parthian period.

03:03:55.180 --> 03:03:59.230 position:56%
Best thing we have is Josephus who
basically has two or three anecdotes

03:03:59.230 --> 03:04:03.070
about Jews in the East, and
then he kind of loses interest.

03:04:03.070 --> 03:04:05.040
Geoffrey Herman, who I
mentioned in the presentation,

03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:10.760
has recently argued that the
Exilarch comes into existence

03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:13.210
around the beginning
of the third century.

03:04:13.210 --> 03:04:14.790
So he kind of thinks
that it coincides

03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:16.500
with the rise of the Sasanians.

03:04:16.500 --> 03:04:20.210
Even if that's the case, I still
think that the Parthian context

03:04:20.210 --> 03:04:23.630
that you're talking about would
have to have played a role,

03:04:23.630 --> 03:04:25.550
because the Sasanians
didn't come on the stage

03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:27.070
and reform the administration
overnight.

03:04:27.070 --> 03:04:29.710
As we saw, it, you know, took until
the fifth, sixth century for things

03:04:29.710 --> 03:04:31.010
to really start changing.

03:04:31.010 --> 03:04:34.970
So I definitely think of them just
from a Parthian kind of context,

03:04:34.970 --> 03:04:38.170
even if it emerged slightly after
the Parthians went off the stage.

03:04:38.170 --> 03:04:39.860
&gt;&gt; Scott McDonough: I mean,
it's fascinating the parallel

03:04:39.860 --> 03:04:43.170
with Steve's talk, you know,
this kind of, you know,

03:04:43.170 --> 03:04:45.360
bring us a book that
shows who you are.

03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:47.400
We'll, we're, you know,
descended from David.

03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:48.700
Here's our book.

03:04:48.700 --> 03:04:50.720
Promote us to our proper
status as kings.

03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:52.270
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: That's
exactly right, yeah.

03:04:52.270 --> 03:04:57.220
&gt;&gt; Scott McDonough: That -- it's
interesting to see that kind

03:04:57.220 --> 03:05:01.300
of correspondence with what
we're seeing in Caucasia

03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:04.970
as well, that literature.

03:05:04.970 --> 03:05:06.270
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: All right,
let me take one more question,

03:05:06.270 --> 03:05:07.570
because I saw a hand up back there.

03:05:07.570 --> 03:05:08.870
Yes, please.

03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:10.170
Here, that lady over there.

03:05:10.170 --> 03:05:12.470
Thank you.

03:05:15.390 --> 03:05:16.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

03:05:16.690 --> 03:05:20.910
My question is for Simcha
Gross, I know from later history

03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:26.010
that the Babylonian Jewish
community also heavily Arabized.

03:05:26.010 --> 03:05:29.580
And I was wondering, during
the Sasanian time it seems

03:05:29.580 --> 03:05:32.900
like you made the claim that they
were starting to take on a lot

03:05:32.900 --> 03:05:36.790
of Persian and Sasanian traditions.

03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:40.320
Once the process of
Arabization started to happen,

03:05:40.320 --> 03:05:44.310
did they still retain that
sort of Persian identity?

03:05:44.310 --> 03:05:49.340
Or did they entirely integrate
into the Arab society, if you know?

03:05:49.340 --> 03:05:50.640
&gt;&gt; Simcha Gross: That's
a great question.

03:05:50.640 --> 03:05:54.580
In general -- and Khodadad was
talking about this a little bit.

03:05:54.580 --> 03:05:59.760
In general, the way eighth, ninth,
tenth century Arabic sources,

03:05:59.760 --> 03:06:02.260
and then the way we as
historians the last 200 years,

03:06:02.260 --> 03:06:05.880
maybe even longer, talk about the
Arab conquest is as a watershed.

03:06:05.880 --> 03:06:08.150
And so Arabs showed up, and
then everything changed.

03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:10.370
It -- Arabs were also Islamic.

03:06:10.370 --> 03:06:12.240
They were Muslim over
-- you know, right away.

03:06:12.240 --> 03:06:14.570
This was a coherent
body of tradition,

03:06:14.570 --> 03:06:17.850
and then they came around, and all
of the minorities kind of said,

03:06:17.850 --> 03:06:20.560
"Okay, I guess we'll have to
either kind of hide in our corners

03:06:20.560 --> 03:06:23.550
or do what you're doing,
which is Islam."

03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:26.040
When, in fact, we now
know that economics,

03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:32.960
administrative infrastructures,
and confessional groups kind

03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:36.540
of were unharmed, more or
less, didn't suffer some sort

03:06:36.540 --> 03:06:39.260
of serious change for at least
until the seventh century

03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:43.990
when you start seeing this kind of
conscious use of Islamic sources

03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:47.530
and Arabic as imperial propaganda.

03:06:47.530 --> 03:06:50.870
SO Jews certainly would not
have been affected, I think,

03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:52.880
in the seventh century
let's call it.

03:06:52.880 --> 03:06:57.970
And afterward they start -- in
general, Jewish texts are --

03:06:57.970 --> 03:07:00.000
most of the ones that
survive for historic --

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:03.080 position:56%
for the reasons that the rabbis are
-- still the community that are kind

03:07:03.080 --> 03:07:04.730
of followed are rabbinic sources.

03:07:04.730 --> 03:07:09.840
And as we saw, they kind of don't
like to admit foreign elements.

03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:13.400
So they'll do their best
to conceal their context,

03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:16.700
which is why it's very fun
and also very hard to kind

03:07:16.700 --> 03:07:18.400
of tease out that context.

03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:22.950
So you do see Islamic influence
and Arabic influence in form.

03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:28.050
So you know, very prominent ninth,
tenth century Jewish sources,

03:07:28.050 --> 03:07:32.970
I argue, are actually
clearly Jewishized --

03:07:32.970 --> 03:07:35.990
I guess is my new word
-- Arabic sources.

03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:38.680
So they're kind of writing
like an Arabic historian write,

03:07:38.680 --> 03:07:44.230
but in totally Jewish parlance,
Jewish language, Jewish history.

03:07:44.230 --> 03:07:47.110
And so if you did not read
through Arabic historiography,

03:07:47.110 --> 03:07:48.970
it would be very hard
for you to identify this.

03:07:48.970 --> 03:07:51.940
But once you do, it's kind of
like, "Oh, this is obviously that."

03:07:51.940 --> 03:07:53.490
Right, we've never seen
anything like this before,

03:07:53.490 --> 03:07:54.790
we see it in the ninth
century by Jews,

03:07:54.790 --> 03:07:57.880
obviously because Arabic
historiographers are doing this

03:07:57.880 --> 03:07:59.180
at this time.

03:07:59.180 --> 03:08:02.180
So the answer is absolutely you
see this kind of interaction,

03:08:02.180 --> 03:08:04.520
and you do see the kind of
influence, but you have to tease it

03:08:04.520 --> 03:08:07.320
out because oftentimes
it's kind of concealed.

03:08:07.320 --> 03:08:08.620
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Thank you.

03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:11.160
I'm sure there are other thoughts,

03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:15.540
and the speakers will be available
-- sorry for volunteering you --

03:08:15.540 --> 03:08:18.470
to interact with all of you.

03:08:18.470 --> 03:08:22.890
So I would invite you to
join lunch after, of course,

03:08:22.890 --> 03:08:33.130
thanking this very complex and
stimulating panel [applause].

03:08:33.130 --> 03:08:37.810
Also, I would like to remind you
that there will be a film shown.

03:08:37.810 --> 03:08:41.070
And [inaudible] would you like
to announce the place and the --

03:08:41.070 --> 03:08:42.740
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: I could
gladly tell you that.

03:08:42.740 --> 03:08:46.420
Thank you very much Fatemeh
[inaudible] for announcing.

03:08:46.420 --> 03:08:49.070
The film will be playing
while you get your food.

03:08:49.070 --> 03:08:52.420
It will start in about five
minutes, and it features

03:08:52.420 --> 03:08:55.600
out wonderful speaker
Touraj Daryaee himself.

03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:57.800
He will be talking
about the Sasanians.

03:08:57.800 --> 03:09:00.690
And the book display is there.

03:09:00.690 --> 03:09:04.980
I just ask please do not
take food to the display room

03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:06.940
after you've enjoyed your meal.

03:09:06.940 --> 03:09:10.100
You can look at the
display afterward,

03:09:10.100 --> 03:09:14.470
or after the third panel ends you
have a period in which you can go

03:09:14.470 --> 03:09:16.200
and look at the book
display as well.

03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:22.500
Last but not least, we have
fabulous Lebanese food for lunch,

03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:24.480
wonderful Middle Eastern cuisine.

03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:25.780
Enjoy, thank you.

03:09:25.780 --> 03:09:27.880
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: All
right, and the afternoon panel,

03:09:27.880 --> 03:09:29.620
of course, on art and culture.

03:09:29.620 --> 03:09:30.920
So we look forward to that.

03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:32.220
Thank you all.

03:09:32.220 --> 03:09:35.720
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: All
right, so I am going to start

03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:38.180
on the third panel, and hopefully

03:09:38.180 --> 03:09:42.830
in the next few minutes
Ida will also join us.

03:09:42.830 --> 03:09:48.120
First, though, I want to echo
exactly without repeating

03:09:48.120 --> 03:09:52.610
in detail all the names that
Mary-Jane announced earlier.

03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:55.940
Thank everyone that's worked
with me hand-in-glove.

03:09:55.940 --> 03:10:01.150
I was able to receive the blessings
of people in the Asian Division,

03:10:01.150 --> 03:10:06.620 position:56%
in the Law Division, Music Division,
as well as MBRS for the film

03:10:06.620 --> 03:10:10.660
that you saw earlier, the
Motion Picture Division.

03:10:10.660 --> 03:10:15.190
They all gave us materials
that we could put on display.

03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:17.380
Geography and Maps gave us atlases

03:10:17.380 --> 03:10:20.110
and this wonderful map
that you see behind you.

03:10:20.110 --> 03:10:23.470
The catalogers Paul Crego and
Michael Cheyet [assumed spelling],

03:10:23.470 --> 03:10:26.630
who helped us process
materials and get it ready.

03:10:26.630 --> 03:10:29.550
And most of all, our two conveners,

03:10:29.550 --> 03:10:34.130
Touraj Daryaee and
Khodadad Rezakhani.

03:10:34.130 --> 03:10:38.640
Going back to November at MESA
when I first approached Khodadad

03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:41.970
and I asked if a conference
or a symposium

03:10:41.970 --> 03:10:46.960
on the Sasanians would be something
that he would be interested in,

03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:48.990
he showed immediate
interest, and within a day

03:10:48.990 --> 03:10:51.340
or two we had already
talked to Touraj,

03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:53.700
and Touraj also was very happy.

03:10:53.700 --> 03:10:56.230
And then the issue of
funding came about.

03:10:56.230 --> 03:10:57.670
Now I was fortunate enough

03:10:57.670 --> 03:11:02.200
that my boss Mary-Jane had
given me the approval to look

03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:06.780
into a conference on the
Ancient Persian history.

03:11:06.780 --> 03:11:10.820
And once we had reached out
the [inaudible] and Mr. Javadi,

03:11:10.820 --> 03:11:15.750
as always, just as they supported
us with the Persian book exhibit,

03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:18.930
they were kind enough to
immediately embrace the idea.

03:11:18.930 --> 03:11:23.980
And on top of that, bring
in the Al Borz, you know,

03:11:23.980 --> 03:11:25.790
high school alumni as well.

03:11:25.790 --> 03:11:28.920
So again, I want to thank
all of you who are here.

03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:30.330
I want to thank every division

03:11:30.330 --> 03:11:33.180
that has taken part
in making this happen.

03:11:33.180 --> 03:11:36.020 position:56%
And I want to thank my own division.

03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:38.300
And Mary-Jane Deeb, of course.

03:11:38.300 --> 03:11:45.070 position:56%
And of course, Joan Weeks as well as
other colleagues like Ann Brenner.

03:11:45.070 --> 03:11:50.590
And I really want to point out here
that nothing that gets happened

03:11:50.590 --> 03:11:55.540
as a bureaucrat happens without
the guidance, and the help,

03:11:55.540 --> 03:11:58.600
and the approval of management.

03:11:58.600 --> 03:12:02.280 position:56%
Nothing that has happened here
would be possible without Mary-Jane.

03:12:02.280 --> 03:12:07.070
Mary-Jane Deeb, our Chief,
who you see right here,

03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:10.810
is the person who has
mentored, and helped me,

03:12:10.810 --> 03:12:13.740
and walked me through the process.

03:12:13.740 --> 03:12:17.680
She is a perfect person to
follow in her footsteps.

03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:21.320
She's done three of these
amazing programs prior to this,

03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:23.490
one on the ancient city of Tyre,

03:12:23.490 --> 03:12:27.250
on the legacy of the
Assyrian civilization.

03:12:27.250 --> 03:12:32.750
We had a wonderful program on
the Afghan Media Resource Center.

03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:37.070
Now this one I was able to do,
but I couldn't have done any of it

03:12:37.070 --> 03:12:40.720
without the help, the
backing, and the support,

03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:42.040
and mentorship of Mary-Jane.

03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:44.960
So if it's possible, I would
really appreciate a round

03:12:44.960 --> 03:12:47.120
of applause [applause].

03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:49.420
Thank you.

03:12:51.310 --> 03:12:52.610
Thank you.

03:12:52.610 --> 03:12:55.140
And I also wanted to thank
University of Maryland,

03:12:55.140 --> 03:13:00.230
Dr. Keshavarz and Ahmet Karamustafa
for being there with us all along

03:13:00.230 --> 03:13:04.540
with the Persian book exhibit,
the lecture series, and helping us

03:13:04.540 --> 03:13:08.820
with this lecture -- I
mean, seminar as well.

03:13:08.820 --> 03:13:11.370
They've always been
there as mentors.

03:13:11.370 --> 03:13:13.940
I've always been able to talk
to them and get their advice.

03:13:13.940 --> 03:13:18.860 position:56%
In the D.C. area they are the
Persian Studies Department to go to.

03:13:18.860 --> 03:13:20.240
So thank you very much.

03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:22.290
Thanks to everyone that's here.

03:13:22.290 --> 03:13:28.690
With that, I am going to start
with reading the bios of all

03:13:28.690 --> 03:13:30.000
of the wonderful speakers.

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:34.110
I have the honor of
having an all-woman panel.

03:13:34.110 --> 03:13:43.400 position:56%
And the gender balance [applause]
-- gender balance is very important,

03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:48.290
because we were having a lot of
male speakers in the previous two,

03:13:48.290 --> 03:13:51.180
essentially, panels
who were fantastic.

03:13:51.180 --> 03:13:54.240
So I am delighted that
everything has gone so well.

03:13:54.240 --> 03:13:58.300
And we had eloquent moderators,
Mary-Jane as well as Fatemeh,

03:13:58.300 --> 03:14:00.080
who did an amazing job as well.

03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:03.810
And last but not least, the
amazing Lebanese food you enjoyed,

03:14:03.810 --> 03:14:06.500
we have to thank the
caterers Occasions as well.

03:14:06.500 --> 03:14:10.550
I think that was quite befitting
of this gathering [applause].

03:14:10.550 --> 03:14:19.840
Our first speaker has come the
farthest, all the way from Paris.

03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:24.620
Dr. Samra Azarnouche
is Associate Professor

03:14:24.620 --> 03:14:33.250
at the Ecole Pratique des
Hautes Etudes in Paris

03:14:33.250 --> 03:14:36.840
where she teaches the
history of Zoroastrianism.

03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:41.380
Her research focuses on Late
Antiquity, Sasanian culture

03:14:41.380 --> 03:14:46.310
and religion, Iranian
mythology, and Persian literature.

03:14:46.310 --> 03:14:50.650
Among her publications are an
edition of Middle Persian texts

03:14:50.650 --> 03:15:00.830
on Sasanian reali "Khosrow
fils de Kawad et un page" 2013.

03:15:00.830 --> 03:15:02.130
How do you say that?

03:15:02.130 --> 03:15:05.360
Did I say it wrong?

03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:08.170
I'm sorry, French is
not my language.

03:15:08.170 --> 03:15:13.700
And several articles on
rituals, essentially --

03:15:13.700 --> 03:15:18.610
and various institutions, technical
vocabulary, and Zoroastrian myths.

03:15:18.610 --> 03:15:20.390
Long and short without
taking more time,

03:15:20.390 --> 03:15:23.350
I invite Dr. Azarnouche
to speak with you.

03:15:23.350 --> 03:15:25.510
Thank you.

03:15:25.510 --> 03:15:30.760
[ Applause ]

03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:34.070
&gt;&gt; Samra Azarnouche: Ladies
and gentlemen, before I start,

03:15:34.070 --> 03:15:37.500
I would like to thank the African
and Middle Eastern Division

03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:42.610
of the Library of Congress
for this wonderful event.

03:15:42.610 --> 03:15:46.190
Thank you to Hirad Dinavari
and [inaudible] Touraj Daryaee,

03:15:46.190 --> 03:15:49.960
and also Khodadad Rezakhani
for their kind invitation.

03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:52.050
It is my great pleasure to be here.

03:15:52.050 --> 03:15:58.240 position:56%
And I would say as an alumnae of the
Zoroastrian High School [inaudible],

03:15:58.240 --> 03:16:00.490
which is, as some of you
may know, historically

03:16:00.490 --> 03:16:03.790
and geographically connected
to the Al Borz High School,

03:16:03.790 --> 03:16:06.410 position:56%
I would like to give a warm greeting

03:16:06.410 --> 03:16:10.150
and a sisterly greeting
to Al Borz College.

03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:16.550
In this presentation, I would
like to present some aspects

03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:21.060
of the cultural life, literary,
and mythical narrations that seem

03:16:21.060 --> 03:16:25.400
to have played an essential role
in the imperial construction

03:16:25.400 --> 03:16:28.590
of the Late Sasanian period.

03:16:28.590 --> 03:16:30.760
I think I don't need to stress,

03:16:30.760 --> 03:16:34.840
especially after the illuminating
talks we had this morning,

03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:38.690
that the Sasanian society
experienced different ranges

03:16:38.690 --> 03:16:43.020
of the writing culture from
the memorial function of royal

03:16:43.020 --> 03:16:46.850
or aristocratic lapidary
inscriptions,

03:16:46.850 --> 03:16:50.470
up to the more practical, but
still specialized activities

03:16:50.470 --> 03:16:56.260
of the scribes in court and
provincial administrative networks.

03:16:56.260 --> 03:16:59.780
Besides, their vernacular
language, per se,

03:16:59.780 --> 03:17:03.210
equals as we say Middle
Persian or Pahlavi,

03:17:03.210 --> 03:17:06.780
seems to possess all the
features of a literary language.

03:17:06.780 --> 03:17:11.740
It has a simple morphology
but a remarkable flexibility

03:17:11.740 --> 03:17:17.990
and an internal dynamism that makes
word composition very productive.

03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:30.030 position:56%
Despite this rich and indispensable
tool for expression, our information

03:17:30.030 --> 03:17:33.580
about books in the Sasanian
period is very limited.

03:17:33.580 --> 03:17:36.840
Of course, we have no reason
to doubt that the compilation

03:17:36.840 --> 03:17:40.420 position:56%
and edition of the very famous
"Xwaday-Namag," the "Book of Kings,"

03:17:40.420 --> 03:17:42.940
that we know only by its
title and some outlines,

03:17:42.940 --> 03:17:47.160
were directly supervised by
the king or his chancellery.

03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:50.060
We also know that different
aspects of the courtly customs,

03:17:50.060 --> 03:17:53.890
like protocol of audience
and banqueting,

03:17:53.890 --> 03:17:58.060
were confined in special volumes
like "Ewen-Namag" or "Gah-Namag,"

03:17:58.060 --> 03:18:00.450
of which we know very little.

03:18:00.450 --> 03:18:05.700
If Sasanian didn't produce many
books, at least they liked them.

03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:09.770
They had, for instance, Indian
parables, Indian legends translated

03:18:09.770 --> 03:18:12.270
into Middle Persian as
the "Kalilag ud Dimnag"

03:18:12.270 --> 03:18:14.210
from the Sanskrit "Panchatantra."

03:18:14.210 --> 03:18:17.900
Or their -- the Sasanian
like to be offered ones.

03:18:17.900 --> 03:18:21.150
The prophet Mani wrote
"Shapuragan" for the King of Kings.

03:18:21.150 --> 03:18:25.570
And also Priscianus of Lydia,
one of the last Neoplatonists,

03:18:25.570 --> 03:18:29.700
who was forced to seek
asylum in the Sasanian court,

03:18:29.700 --> 03:18:35.230
offered his "Soluciones"
to Khosrow I.

03:18:35.230 --> 03:18:39.790
One field only seems to have
been reluctant for a while

03:18:39.790 --> 03:18:42.840
to the writing culture, probably
because it didn't need it,

03:18:42.840 --> 03:18:47.970
or it found idols scriptures, or
the act of writing undeserving

03:18:47.970 --> 03:18:52.540
of its own status, or perhaps
it considered writing prone

03:18:52.540 --> 03:18:54.500
to alteration, and therefore,

03:18:54.500 --> 03:18:58.120
not suitable for a
long-lasting tradition.

03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:00.710
I am, of course, pointing
to the sacred knowledge

03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:04.430
of Zoroastrian priests who
considered their own memory

03:19:04.430 --> 03:19:10.630
as the only worthy keeper of
the holy words of the "Avesta."

03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:14.060
Even if we agree with the
hypothesis that the translations

03:19:14.060 --> 03:19:16.940
and commentaries of the
"Avesta" could have been put

03:19:16.940 --> 03:19:20.170
down into writing before
the Sasanian period.

03:19:20.170 --> 03:19:23.180
For paleographical reasons
we are quite certain

03:19:23.180 --> 03:19:26.050
that it wasn't the case
for the "Avesta" itself.

03:19:26.050 --> 03:19:29.660
Most scholars agree that after many
centuries of oral transmission,

03:19:29.660 --> 03:19:32.830
the "Avesta" was written for the
first time in the second half

03:19:32.830 --> 03:19:35.060
of the sixth century
A.D. at the time

03:19:35.060 --> 03:19:39.080
of the Sasanian King Khosrow
I even though it continued

03:19:39.080 --> 03:19:42.450
to be taught orally, memorized,
and recited by priests,

03:19:42.450 --> 03:19:46.460
especially by ones involved
in the ritual activities

03:19:46.460 --> 03:19:49.200
or in the educational activities.

03:19:50.700 --> 03:19:53.670
Writing down the "Avesta"
didn't happen in one day.

03:19:53.670 --> 03:19:57.040
It needed a long process,
and priestly gatherings,

03:19:57.040 --> 03:19:59.920
priests who were experts
in the pronunciation

03:19:59.920 --> 03:20:03.170
of the liturgical hymns,
specialists of phonetics,

03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:06.960
and also of paleography because
they had to invent a new alphabet

03:20:06.960 --> 03:20:11.350 position:56%
in order to write down the holy text
as precisely as possible and turn it

03:20:11.350 --> 03:20:13.690
into a holy book, as
Jews, Christians,

03:20:13.690 --> 03:20:16.410
Manichaeans possessed
one long before them.

03:20:16.410 --> 03:20:20.350
This radical innovation --
let's say a revolution --

03:20:20.350 --> 03:20:23.540
in their religious tradition
was not well-welcomed --

03:20:23.540 --> 03:20:24.930
was not welcomed by all.

03:20:24.930 --> 03:20:29.210
But it probably stimulated

03:20:29.210 --> 03:20:33.440
and [inaudible] the status
of religious writing.

03:20:33.440 --> 03:20:36.680
The priestly class began
to have an easier access

03:20:36.680 --> 03:20:41.620 position:56%
to scientific knowledge, astrology,
medicine, geometry, botany, zoology.

03:20:41.620 --> 03:20:44.510
And they sometimes
incorporated their material

03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:46.780
into their religious writings.

03:20:46.780 --> 03:20:50.090
The scholar priest seems
to have a remarkable skill

03:20:50.090 --> 03:20:54.520
to describe the word from the
very beginning of the creation

03:20:54.520 --> 03:20:57.990
to the fresh-geared order
renovation at the end of time.

03:20:57.990 --> 03:21:02.330 position:56%
And scientific observation makes
their enumeration even more accurate

03:21:02.330 --> 03:21:04.590
and believable.

03:21:04.590 --> 03:21:07.300
By contacts with different
communities, for instance,

03:21:07.300 --> 03:21:10.190
in the milieu of the
Academy of Gondishapur,

03:21:10.190 --> 03:21:12.180
their writings were
surely influenced

03:21:12.180 --> 03:21:17.830
by the intellectual effervescence
of the late Sasanian period

03:21:17.830 --> 03:21:21.970
and beyond it in the court of the
Caliph of Baghdad, for instance,

03:21:21.970 --> 03:21:24.780
where the heads of the
Zoroastrian community were active

03:21:24.780 --> 03:21:26.400
up to the tenth century.

03:21:26.400 --> 03:21:32.010
Of this literary production,
only a restricted amount

03:21:32.010 --> 03:21:35.520
of text has been transmitted to us.

03:21:35.520 --> 03:21:37.500
That is what we call
the Pahlavi books,

03:21:37.500 --> 03:21:40.240
or Zoroastrian Middle Persian
text, that we know only

03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:46.690
from medieval manuscripts, the
oldest preserved one dated to 1322.

03:21:46.690 --> 03:21:49.580
Despite important efforts
of generational scholars

03:21:49.580 --> 03:21:52.390
and some colleagues
here in this room,

03:21:52.390 --> 03:21:56.270
this Middle Persian literature
remains incompletely edited

03:21:56.270 --> 03:21:57.800
or commented on.

03:21:57.800 --> 03:21:59.580
The question we may ask is

03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:05.580
to what extent does this corpus
inform us about the Sasanians?

03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:09.350
How a corpus postdated to
this period and written

03:22:09.350 --> 03:22:13.580
by Zoroastrian priests for
Zoroastrian priests may be relevant

03:22:13.580 --> 03:22:16.360
as a source of Sasanian time?

03:22:16.360 --> 03:22:20.750
On this last point, the French
Iranist Philippe Gignoux,

03:22:20.750 --> 03:22:23.990
who devoted many of his works
to the Middle Persian documents

03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:27.100
and Sasanian history,
claimed in the last '70s

03:22:27.100 --> 03:22:30.840
that this text must be
seen as secondary sources,

03:22:30.840 --> 03:22:32.610
and because of their
chronology, they my less --

03:22:32.610 --> 03:22:36.020
they are less important
than coins and seals.

03:22:36.020 --> 03:22:40.240
More recently, another outstanding
historian, Albert de Jong,

03:22:40.240 --> 03:22:43.730
argued that we have no reliable
techniques and no methods

03:22:43.730 --> 03:22:45.400
to separate Sasanian material

03:22:45.400 --> 03:22:48.230
from post-Sasanian
material and Pahlavi books.

03:22:48.230 --> 03:22:53.860
And he also notes that the
authors of this text are, I quote,

03:22:53.860 --> 03:22:58.880
"remarkably free from nostalgia and
remarkably diffident in the memory

03:22:58.880 --> 03:23:02.630
of the Sasanians, who are by no
means generally seen as heroes

03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:04.890
of the religion," end of quote.

03:23:04.890 --> 03:23:11.880 position:56%
I think that some of this
assessment might need to be amended,

03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:15.940
though I myself admit and deplore
the lack of coherent methodology

03:23:15.940 --> 03:23:18.090
and reliable techniques used to --

03:23:18.090 --> 03:23:21.730
so far regarding the
chronology of this text.

03:23:21.730 --> 03:23:24.670
At this point I would like
to suggest not a technique --

03:23:24.670 --> 03:23:28.140
I have none -- but
rather a new perspective

03:23:28.140 --> 03:23:30.380
to analyze some Middle
Persian narrations

03:23:30.380 --> 03:23:32.780
that could provide
essential elements not only

03:23:32.780 --> 03:23:35.480
to the understanding of
interconnection between narration

03:23:35.480 --> 03:23:38.830
and political propaganda
in the late Sasanian time,

03:23:38.830 --> 03:23:42.370
but also to re-evaluate the
place of the Sasanian king

03:23:42.370 --> 03:23:45.080
within the Zoroastrian
myth ideology.

03:23:45.080 --> 03:23:55.520 position:56%
Let me begin with a case that I know
the best, as updated the edition

03:23:55.520 --> 03:23:57.760
of this narration in 2013.

03:23:57.760 --> 03:24:01.140
This is a dialogue between Khosrow
I [speaking in foreign language]

03:24:01.140 --> 03:24:06.580
and a page -- a young aristocrat.

03:24:06.580 --> 03:24:12.440
This dialogical form involving
Khosrow I and a knowledgeable man,

03:24:12.440 --> 03:24:16.710
whoever he might be, was a very
common genre in this period.

03:24:16.710 --> 03:24:19.990
We have the Latin translation
of the Neoplatonist Christian

03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:23.900
and his answers to King Khosrow
that I mentioned earlier,

03:24:23.900 --> 03:24:28.210
or even a late Arabic
parallels it in [speaking

03:24:28.210 --> 03:24:30.600
in foreign language]
of the ninth century.

03:24:30.600 --> 03:24:38.520
Here is the frame story of the
"Husraw I Kawadan Ud Radag,"

03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:39.920
this Middle Persian text.

03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:41.390
The plot is extremely simple.

03:24:41.390 --> 03:24:44.810
I hope you can read the screen,
otherwise I can read it for you.

03:24:44.810 --> 03:24:49.090
"A young aristocrat has
been deprived from his rank

03:24:49.090 --> 03:24:51.450
and has lost his fortune.

03:24:51.450 --> 03:24:56.610 position:56%
He requests a hearing, stands before
the king," and this gesture imposed

03:24:56.610 --> 03:25:00.840
by the protocol, as we see in
this detail of a silver dish,

03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:05.490
where the king does not wear
the same crown as Khosrow I,

03:25:05.490 --> 03:25:07.550
but it is Khosrow anyway.

03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:11.130 position:56%
And the page tried to gain the favor
and the protection of the king.

03:25:11.130 --> 03:25:15.980
For achieving that, he describes
in detail his education,

03:25:15.980 --> 03:25:20.140
which fits exactly the standards
of aristocratic Sasanian military

03:25:20.140 --> 03:25:24.820
and intellectual training,
including religious education,

03:25:24.820 --> 03:25:27.220
astrological knowledge,
and also training

03:25:27.220 --> 03:25:31.150
in games like chess and polo.

03:25:31.150 --> 03:25:35.520
Then beings the questioning.

03:25:35.520 --> 03:25:38.960
The king wants to know what
is the best of everything

03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:46.220
in the servant's eye, including
food, wine, music, perfumes,

03:25:46.220 --> 03:25:49.980
women, horses, and so on.

03:25:49.980 --> 03:25:55.390
The answer gives rise to a long
enumeration of the realia of the --

03:25:55.390 --> 03:25:59.740 position:56%
and the material culture of Sasanian
Iran and the courtier protocol.

03:25:59.740 --> 03:26:05.790
When some place names are
mentioned, as it is the case

03:26:05.790 --> 03:26:10.850 position:56%
with the great varieties for the
most excellent wines, we can observe

03:26:10.850 --> 03:26:13.750
that these regions are, in
fact, included in the border

03:26:13.750 --> 03:26:16.550
of the Sasanian realm at
the time of Khosrow I.

03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:20.920
This detail shows that the
period of the composition

03:26:20.920 --> 03:26:25.880
of the text is very likely to
be the period of his reign.

03:26:25.880 --> 03:26:27.460
And this is -- that is
-- that it was not --

03:26:27.460 --> 03:26:30.980
the story was not attributed
to him retrospectively,

03:26:30.980 --> 03:26:33.080
as it was presumably assumed.

03:26:33.080 --> 03:26:41.230
But this is not the only result of
reliable techniques of observation.

03:26:41.230 --> 03:26:46.370
The king is satisfied by the
answer of the young page,

03:26:46.370 --> 03:26:50.800
and he bestows a high military
title of the marzban on him.

03:26:50.800 --> 03:26:53.440
Then the page finds
himself in situations

03:26:53.440 --> 03:26:54.740
where he has to prove his courage.

03:26:54.740 --> 03:26:59.510
He captures dangerous lions, and
he has to prove also his chastity.

03:26:59.510 --> 03:27:01.880
And when he passes these
ordeals, the king decides

03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:03.430
to keep him at the court.

03:27:03.430 --> 03:27:05.220
End of the story.

03:27:05.220 --> 03:27:10.320
Now what is the moral of the social
ascension of an anonymous servant?

03:27:10.320 --> 03:27:14.030
What could be significance for
the audience of the sixth century?

03:27:14.030 --> 03:27:20.230
It seems to be that behind this
naive court story hides a strong

03:27:20.230 --> 03:27:21.530
political propaganda.

03:27:21.530 --> 03:27:27.500
This Middle Persian Text only makes
sense if we consider the context

03:27:27.500 --> 03:27:30.920
of internal policy according
to which it was composed.

03:27:30.920 --> 03:27:34.990
Khosrow I, at the beginning of his
reign, had to face the consequences

03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:37.430
of a socioeconomic
crisis that started

03:27:37.430 --> 03:27:40.620
in the time of his father Kavadh.

03:27:40.620 --> 03:27:44.110
Khodadad mentioned the
story this morning.

03:27:44.110 --> 03:27:48.900
Kavadh actually supported a
religious leader called Mazdak

03:27:48.900 --> 03:27:52.070
because he found Mazdakism
a useful instrument

03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:54.930
for undermining the
power of the clergy.

03:27:54.930 --> 03:27:57.810
The Mazdak movement might have
attracted the lower classes

03:27:57.810 --> 03:28:01.510
of the society.

03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:05.390 position:56%
I don't have time to go into details
about the social and moral doctrine,

03:28:05.390 --> 03:28:10.590
but from the Zoroastrian point
of view it was seen not only

03:28:10.590 --> 03:28:15.900
as a dangerous heresy, but
also as an economic disaster

03:28:15.900 --> 03:28:18.330
that would explain why
the story of the --

03:28:18.330 --> 03:28:21.080
in this story, the page
has lost his fortune

03:28:21.080 --> 03:28:23.980
and turns to the court for help.

03:28:23.980 --> 03:28:29.400
Here as well as in other stories,
Khosrow I took the occasion

03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:33.210
of presenting himself as the
champion of anti-Mazdakism.

03:28:33.210 --> 03:28:38.580
In fact, Khosrow I is very
well-known for his reforms.

03:28:38.580 --> 03:28:41.980
He actually continued to
[inaudible] economic reforms

03:28:41.980 --> 03:28:45.640
that his father initiated,
and a better control

03:28:45.640 --> 03:28:49.980
over the agricultural production,
and a taxes levy required

03:28:49.980 --> 03:28:53.450
to rebalance the social forces.

03:28:53.450 --> 03:28:57.670
The power of the great noble
houses needed to be reduced,

03:28:57.670 --> 03:29:03.010
and instead the king favored
the small land-holding gentry.

03:29:03.010 --> 03:29:07.520 position:56%
It is clear to me that the depiction
of the politically-correct figure

03:29:07.520 --> 03:29:11.410
of the young page in this story
echoes the increased confidence

03:29:11.410 --> 03:29:15.740 position:56%
of the king toward the lesser
nobility, here presented as a victim

03:29:15.740 --> 03:29:20.310
of Mazdak economic project,
or its alleged communism.

03:29:20.310 --> 03:29:22.900
And this story is,
therefore, better understood

03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:31.850 position:56%
in the social reconstruction context
of the post-Mazdakite crisis.

03:29:31.850 --> 03:29:37.040
Allow me now to present another
brief example of the depiction

03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:40.520
of the Sasanian king as
a hero of the religion,

03:29:40.520 --> 03:29:44.450
as I don't find Middle Persian
Zoroastrian literature particularly

03:29:44.450 --> 03:29:46.950
diffident to the memory
of the kings.

03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:50.010
Quite on the contrary,
it keeps telling us

03:29:50.010 --> 03:29:52.950
that the Zoroastrian
tradition has been transmitted

03:29:52.950 --> 03:29:56.960
from immemorial times
along with Iranian kings,

03:29:56.960 --> 03:29:59.660
and especially thanks
to the Sasanian kings.

03:29:59.660 --> 03:30:02.610
Not all of them, of course,
but at least three or four

03:30:02.610 --> 03:30:04.330
of the most important ones.

03:30:04.330 --> 03:30:08.600
I don't want to bother you
with the details of the text,

03:30:08.600 --> 03:30:12.980
and this sketch will surely be
enough to illustrate the case.

03:30:12.980 --> 03:30:17.010
This is what we find -- this
chart is what we find in --

03:30:17.010 --> 03:30:21.880
or we can reconstruct after
many Middle Persian texts,

03:30:21.880 --> 03:30:25.590
especially the "Denkard
IV," an Arabic text based

03:30:25.590 --> 03:30:29.030
on earlier Middle Persian texts.

03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:33.280
The genealogical table
of the Iranian royalty

03:30:33.280 --> 03:30:38.630
in which the Sasanians
present themselves as the heirs

03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:45.830
of the legendary Kayanid dynasty,
here represented by Wishtasp.

03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:49.950
This legacy is not a mere
historical resonance,

03:30:49.950 --> 03:30:52.980
nor an intellectual construct.

03:30:52.980 --> 03:30:58.000
It has to be sustained by
tangible elements and facts.

03:30:58.000 --> 03:31:01.460
This transmission process
could apply to many things,

03:31:01.460 --> 03:31:05.380
the empire itself might be
handed down through generations,

03:31:05.380 --> 03:31:07.820
or the [speaking in foreign
language], the royal glory.

03:31:07.820 --> 03:31:12.450
But I choose to show you the myth

03:31:12.450 --> 03:31:14.600
of the transmission of
the holy scriptures.

03:31:14.600 --> 03:31:18.780
As you can see here, if you live
in the sixth century and you want

03:31:18.780 --> 03:31:22.040
to write a good story,
before you post it

03:31:22.040 --> 03:31:25.140
on the sixth century
Facebook, which is, of course,

03:31:25.140 --> 03:31:28.070
the network of the
mythical narrations

03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:31.960
that were spread throughout
the priestly schools,

03:31:31.960 --> 03:31:35.600
or the festive gatherings,
or whatever.

03:31:35.600 --> 03:31:39.520
But your story has to
meet established criteria

03:31:39.520 --> 03:31:44.230
of the Zoroastrian mythology to
be considered as a good story.

03:31:44.230 --> 03:31:46.240
Here is some of this criteria.

03:31:46.240 --> 03:31:50.070
The story has to fit the general
picture of the mythical chronology,

03:31:50.070 --> 03:31:56.620
the scheme of the succession of
millennia with different periods,

03:31:56.620 --> 03:31:59.370
dynasties, and reigns, and so on.

03:31:59.370 --> 03:32:05.060
The second criteria is the presence
of three characters, the hero --

03:32:05.060 --> 03:32:10.790
here a king -- the sage or the
wise man, most of the time a magus,

03:32:10.790 --> 03:32:15.930
and a common enemy [inaudible]
tied to Iran and its religion.

03:32:15.930 --> 03:32:20.130
You also need something that links
the generation one to the other.

03:32:20.130 --> 03:32:23.490
According to this version of the
myth, the transmitted element

03:32:23.490 --> 03:32:27.330
from the Kayanid to
Sasanian was the "Avesta,"

03:32:27.330 --> 03:32:33.920 position:56%
not as the liturgical recitation nor
as the vague notion named the Den,

03:32:33.920 --> 03:32:39.600
but as a real object,
as a book handed down,

03:32:39.600 --> 03:32:41.970
after self-vicissitudes,
of course --

03:32:41.970 --> 03:32:45.640
Alexandre was there --
to the Sasanian kings.

03:32:45.640 --> 03:32:50.270
And each of them has contributed
to its edition, copying,

03:32:50.270 --> 03:32:51.880
reassembling, and completing.

03:32:51.880 --> 03:32:58.860
When you want to legitimize
the existence of something,

03:32:58.860 --> 03:33:02.630
basically you only need to
say that it was here before.

03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:04.170
"My ancestors gave it to me,

03:33:04.170 --> 03:33:08.140
so there is no reason
to doubt about it."

03:33:08.140 --> 03:33:14.030
This raises another question, why
does the author of this text need

03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:20.010
to legitimize the existence
of the "Avesta" as a book?

03:33:20.010 --> 03:33:23.080
The answer is clear, it
wasn't a book before it.

03:33:23.080 --> 03:33:29.830
It seems to me that this narration
is only meant to place Khosrow I

03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:35.070
at the end of this line as
the legitimate depository

03:33:35.070 --> 03:33:38.330
and heroic savior of the holy book,

03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:41.290
which has accumulated all
the knowledge of the time

03:33:41.290 --> 03:33:44.960
and has become the epitome
of the scions of the Iranian

03:33:44.960 --> 03:33:51.320
and non-Iranian world, and that it
has a distinctive shape of a codex

03:33:51.320 --> 03:33:55.250
or a book, [speaking in foreign
language] in Middle Persian.

03:33:55.250 --> 03:33:58.230
This holistic and cosmic
aspect of the

03:33:58.230 --> 03:34:00.520
"Avesta" truly reminds the holistic

03:34:00.520 --> 03:34:03.970
and cosmic aspect of
the king himself.

03:34:03.970 --> 03:34:09.750
I hope these two tiny examples
were enough to demonstrate

03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:13.630
that the Middle Persian literature
has not yet said its last word

03:34:13.630 --> 03:34:17.660
about the Sasanian kings,
and that it is not surprising

03:34:17.660 --> 03:34:22.530
that profound historical and social
transformations have left a trace

03:34:22.530 --> 03:34:26.500
into the highly-conservative and
faithfully-transmitted tradition,

03:34:26.500 --> 03:34:30.640
if we are inclined of using new
techniques to look for them.

03:34:30.640 --> 03:34:32.440
Thank you.

03:34:32.440 --> 03:34:42.640
[ Applause ]

03:34:42.640 --> 03:34:45.890
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank you, Dr.
Azarnouche for a wonderful talk.

03:34:45.890 --> 03:34:51.070
I am now going to introduce our
second speaker, Dr. Judith Lerner

03:34:51.070 --> 03:34:55.700 position:56%
who is an art historian specializing
in the history and visual culture

03:34:55.700 --> 03:34:59.010
of Iran and Central
Asia from the Achaemenid

03:34:59.010 --> 03:35:01.450
to the early Islamic periods.

03:35:01.450 --> 03:35:05.960
She is especially interested
in and has published widely

03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:12.290
on the glyptic art of Iran, Bactria
and Sogdiana; the art and culture

03:35:12.290 --> 03:35:17.840
of the Silk Road, specifically
that of the Sogdians

03:35:17.840 --> 03:35:22.750
and other Central Asians who
lived in China; and the artistic

03:35:22.750 --> 03:35:28.410
and political uses of Iran's
pre-Islamic visual past in the 19th

03:35:28.410 --> 03:35:29.790
and early 20th centuries.

03:35:29.790 --> 03:35:34.560
A Research Associate at
the Institute for the Study

03:35:34.560 --> 03:35:39.390
of the Ancient World, she is
a co-editor for the "Journal

03:35:39.390 --> 03:35:43.160 position:56%
of Inner Asian Art and Archaeology."

03:35:43.160 --> 03:35:49.070
She has a MA degree
from Columbia University

03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:52.320
and a PhD from Harvard University.

03:35:52.320 --> 03:35:53.620
Thank you very much.

03:35:53.620 --> 03:35:57.510
Let's have Dr. Lerner
give us her talk.

03:35:57.510 --> 03:36:05.080
[ Applause ]

03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:06.380
&gt;&gt; Judith Lerner.

03:36:06.380 --> 03:36:07.680
Thank you very much, Hirad.

03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:09.150
And thank you all for coming.

03:36:09.150 --> 03:36:11.190
And thanks to all the people

03:36:11.190 --> 03:36:17.340
who have made this fascinating
gathering possible today.

03:36:17.340 --> 03:36:20.770
I am particularly grateful
for this opportunity to talk

03:36:20.770 --> 03:36:26.760
about an important aspect of the
art created under the Qajar dynasty

03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:32.190
that ruled Persia from the late
18th to the early 20th century.

03:36:32.190 --> 03:36:35.800
This is the art of
carving into living rock,

03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:41.530
that is a large boulder or, more
typically, a cliff or mountainside,

03:36:41.530 --> 03:36:45.560 position:56%
of monumental images in high relief.

03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:47.680
This form of visual art is one

03:36:47.680 --> 03:36:51.420
of several artistic
innovations of the Qajar period.

03:36:51.420 --> 03:36:58.890 position:56%
It seems to have been the brainchild
of -- let's see if this works --

03:36:58.890 --> 03:37:04.970
of Fath-Ali Shah, the
second Qajar ruler.

03:37:04.970 --> 03:37:07.770
Although, in his extensive
use of it,

03:37:07.770 --> 03:37:13.130
he was actually revisiting
an artistic medium that began

03:37:13.130 --> 03:37:16.260
in very ancient, pre-Islamic times.

03:37:16.260 --> 03:37:20.860
And I'm sure many of you are
familiar with the Qajars,

03:37:20.860 --> 03:37:23.040
and particularly Fath-Ali Shah.

03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:26.730
And this is a particularly
wonderful -- he was rather vain,

03:37:26.730 --> 03:37:28.730
as you could probably
tell from his pose.

03:37:28.730 --> 03:37:31.010
He imitates Napoleon, in fact.

03:37:31.010 --> 03:37:35.150
But he has this long, luxurious
black beard that was described

03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:37.460
as very shiny and glistening.

03:37:37.460 --> 03:37:39.490
And he was quite a clothes horse.

03:37:39.490 --> 03:37:45.160
And you will -- I will refer
to that briefly later on.

03:37:47.770 --> 03:37:52.790
The very earliest rock relief
carving we know of are four reliefs

03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:55.510
in Western Iran carved
around the beginning

03:37:55.510 --> 03:38:00.390
of the second millennium B.C.E.
by the rulers of Lullubi,

03:38:00.390 --> 03:38:04.280
a mountainous kingdom in the
region, in which they proclaim

03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:07.390
and show the victories
over their enemies.

03:38:07.390 --> 03:38:13.410
You are just -- you're looking
at one of them, Anubanini,

03:38:13.410 --> 03:38:16.600
and you see him trampling
on the body

03:38:16.600 --> 03:38:19.700
of his most important
defeated enemy.

03:38:19.700 --> 03:38:23.900
And facing him is the goddess
Ishtar, whom he acknowledges

03:38:23.900 --> 03:38:25.920
as helping him, being on his side

03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:30.470
so he could have his --
achieve this victory.

03:38:33.410 --> 03:38:40.740
This monumental means of glorifying
royal power inspired 25 centuries

03:38:40.740 --> 03:38:44.690
later the Achaemenid
Darius the Great

03:38:44.690 --> 03:38:47.290
to commemorate his
military victories

03:38:47.290 --> 03:38:52.360
on a mountainside not
too far away at Bisitun.

03:38:52.360 --> 03:38:56.680
Succeeding Elamitian,
Parthian, and Sasanian monarchs,

03:38:56.680 --> 03:38:58.090
continued this tradition

03:38:58.090 --> 03:39:02.980
of immortalizing their
kingship and military triumphs.

03:39:02.980 --> 03:39:08.070
Rock relief sculpture reached its
apogee under the Sasanian kings,

03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:11.330
especially those of the
third and fourth centuries,

03:39:11.330 --> 03:39:18.540
in particular Ardashir I,
and you see him in the --

03:39:18.540 --> 03:39:22.130
at the top receiving his
investiture, his right to rule,

03:39:22.130 --> 03:39:30.330
from Ahura Mazda; Shapur
I, the second one, that --

03:39:30.330 --> 03:39:32.440
who also receives his investiture

03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:41.460
from the great god Ahura
Mazda; and Shapurs II and III.

03:39:41.460 --> 03:39:45.640
I also show you two reliefs
made for the last important king

03:39:45.640 --> 03:39:50.910
of the dynasty, Khosrow II, in
the larger grotto at Taq-e Bustan

03:39:50.910 --> 03:39:58.850 position:56%
in Kermanshah, the same province as
the reliefs of Anubanini and Darius.

03:39:58.850 --> 03:40:03.570
For the Sasanians, rock relief
was a major artistic medium

03:40:03.570 --> 03:40:08.280
in which they expressed imperial
ideas about divine investiture,

03:40:08.280 --> 03:40:13.780
legitimacy, royal succession,
and sheer military might.

03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:18.880
Rock reliefs attributable to the
Sasanian period total nearly 40,

03:40:18.880 --> 03:40:24.650
and 34 of them can be identified
with specific Sasanian kings.

03:40:24.650 --> 03:40:27.920
With the exception of one
relief in Afghanistan,

03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:35.890 position:56%
which Touraj showed you earlier in
the morning, all are in Iran proper.

03:40:35.890 --> 03:40:39.220
Most date to the third
and fourth centuries.

03:40:39.220 --> 03:40:44.890
Significantly, almost all of them
are located in Fars province,

03:40:44.890 --> 03:40:47.090
which was the geographical
foundation

03:40:47.090 --> 03:40:51.680
of not only the Sasanian dynasty,
but that of the Achaemenid.

03:40:51.680 --> 03:40:55.640
With the fall of the
Sasanians, monumental sculpture

03:40:55.640 --> 03:40:58.500
from living rock was
all but abandoned,

03:40:58.500 --> 03:41:02.490
although successive Islamic
dynasties such as the Buyid,

03:41:02.490 --> 03:41:07.230
the Mongols, and the Safavids
left many inscriptions carved

03:41:07.230 --> 03:41:13.690 position:56%
into living rock, none continued the
art of monumental relief sculpture.

03:41:13.690 --> 03:41:19.700 position:56%
To be sure, the major pictorial,
and especially the figurative themes

03:41:19.700 --> 03:41:24.350
of pre-Islamic Iran, specifically
those that had been employed

03:41:24.350 --> 03:41:29.890
by the Sasanians, "Razm o
Basim," Fighting and Feasting,

03:41:29.890 --> 03:41:35.870 position:56%
along with the hunt and enthronement
scenes continued to be depicted

03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:41.260
in painting, metalwork, ceramics,
and textiles as you see here

03:41:41.260 --> 03:41:45.780
in examples from Islamic times.

03:41:45.780 --> 03:41:49.880
But it was only in the
reign of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar

03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:53.660
that figurative monumental
rock carving was again made.

03:41:53.660 --> 03:41:58.410
In this talk, I'll survey
most of the Qajar reliefs,

03:41:58.410 --> 03:42:01.640
showing their debt to
those of the Sasanians.

03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:05.780
I'll suggest why Fath-Ali
Shah revived this ancient art,

03:42:05.780 --> 03:42:10.400
and end by contrasting the use of
Sasanian models in the first part

03:42:10.400 --> 03:42:16.310
of the 19th century with the
change in the scale, iconography,

03:42:16.310 --> 03:42:19.600
and even medium of relief
carving that prevailed

03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:22.090
in the second part of the century.

03:42:22.090 --> 03:42:26.870
And I shall briefly
suggest a reason why.

03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:32.360
Of the eight reliefs known
from the Qajar period,

03:42:32.360 --> 03:42:34.930
seven can be attributed
to Fath-Ali Shah

03:42:34.930 --> 03:42:37.090
or to one of his numerous progeny.

03:42:37.090 --> 03:42:40.600
The eighth was ordered
in the late 19th century

03:42:40.600 --> 03:42:46.110
by Fath-Ali Shah's great
grandson Nasr al-Din Shah.

03:42:47.210 --> 03:42:51.550
I'm showing you one of the
earlies of Fath-Ali Shah's relief,

03:42:51.550 --> 03:42:55.560
which is found in Northern
Iran in the mountainous region

03:42:55.560 --> 03:42:59.080
of Firuzkuh northeast of
Teheran, and I'm sure many

03:42:59.080 --> 03:43:04.650
in this room have hiked up
there, maybe in their youth,

03:43:04.650 --> 03:43:08.490
and perhaps have seen the relief.

03:43:08.490 --> 03:43:14.270
These mountains, which separate
Firuzkuh from the Mazandaran plain,

03:43:14.270 --> 03:43:17.450
were the main summer
quarters of the Qajar tribe,

03:43:17.450 --> 03:43:20.160
providing rich hunting
grounds for the court.

03:43:20.160 --> 03:43:23.530
And Fath-Ali Shah had
a hunting lodge there.

03:43:23.530 --> 03:43:27.850
It was also there in 1808 or 1817,

03:43:27.850 --> 03:43:32.490
depending upon how the
accompanying inscription is read,

03:43:32.490 --> 03:43:38.110
that he commemorated his
exploits in this relief.

03:43:38.110 --> 03:43:42.500
Filling the frame are not only
just the Shah and his prey --

03:43:42.500 --> 03:43:48.760
I'm sorry -- and his prey, but 18
of his many sons in attendance.

03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:51.050
I believe he had about 63 sons,

03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:54.260
and they never counted
all his daughters.

03:43:56.330 --> 03:44:00.430
The relief may commemorate
a particular hunt while also

03:44:00.430 --> 03:44:04.180
reproducing, on a grand scale,
paintings of hunting scenes

03:44:04.180 --> 03:44:07.370
that were popular with
the shah and his court.

03:44:07.370 --> 03:44:09.680
And you're looking at
an example of a painting

03:44:09.680 --> 03:44:14.210
on lacquer showing
Fath-Ali Shah hunting.

03:44:14.210 --> 03:44:21.190
His -- again, his black beard
just in the wind behind him.

03:44:21.190 --> 03:44:26.240
The subject matter harks back
to ancient Iranian images,

03:44:26.240 --> 03:44:28.060
in particular the density

03:44:28.060 --> 03:44:31.850
of the composition recalls
the monumental hunting reliefs

03:44:31.850 --> 03:44:38.080
in Khosrow II's iwan at
Taq-e Bustan, as well as,

03:44:38.080 --> 03:44:42.460
as you can see above, this
late Sasanian hunting plate

03:44:42.460 --> 03:44:46.560
on which the king pursues
a number of different game.

03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:55.830
It was at Taq-e Bustan
sometime between 1821 and 1828

03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:58.290
that a courtier had
carved this relief

03:44:58.290 --> 03:45:02.520
to memorialize Mohammad
Ali Mirza Dowlat-Shah,

03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:04.400
one of Fath-Ali Shah's sons,

03:45:04.400 --> 03:45:09.190
and Governor of Kermanshah
who had died in 1821.

03:45:09.190 --> 03:45:14.200
And so in the upper left you
see him attended by his sons

03:45:14.200 --> 03:45:19.190
and chief eunuch, ensconced on
a high-back throne, his posture

03:45:19.190 --> 03:45:22.720
and physiognomy very much
like that of his father

03:45:22.720 --> 03:45:29.210
who in numerous paintings sits
on a similar chair throne.

03:45:29.210 --> 03:45:34.000
The relief was placed above the
gray panel showing Khosrow II's

03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:35.530
boar hung.

03:45:35.530 --> 03:45:39.960
Its placement at the same height of
the figure of Khosrow on the rear

03:45:39.960 --> 03:45:44.670
of the grotto, on this rear wall,
has prompted Prudence Harper

03:45:44.670 --> 03:45:51.240
to observe that "The Sasanian King
of Kings is reduced to functioning

03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:55.770 position:56%
as Mohammad Ali Mirza's doorkeeper."

03:45:55.770 --> 03:45:58.510
It's a very nice conceit.

03:46:00.010 --> 03:46:04.460
Moving south to Shiraz, the
capital of Farz province,

03:46:04.460 --> 03:46:10.060
we find this imposing image
created between 1823 and 1825,

03:46:10.060 --> 03:46:12.370
when it was mentioned
by a British traveler

03:46:12.370 --> 03:46:15.750
as having recently been completed.

03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:21.270
Unfortunately, it is greatly
eroded over the years.

03:46:21.270 --> 03:46:30.840
It's unprotected, and when I
last saw it about 10 years ago,

03:46:30.840 --> 03:46:35.260
it had been -- people had
taken potshots at it --

03:46:35.260 --> 03:46:38.910
at the heads, as you can see.

03:46:38.910 --> 03:46:43.410
But I hope you can make out
the rigidly frontal figure

03:46:43.410 --> 03:46:49.100
of Fath-Ali Shah, flanked by two
standing also frontal figures.

03:46:49.100 --> 03:46:54.310 position:56%
Set high in the Tangeh Allahu Akbar,
the traditional entry into Shiraz

03:46:54.310 --> 03:46:59.380
from the north, the relief lacks
an identifying inscription,

03:46:59.380 --> 03:47:03.660
but the enthroned monarch
is clearly Fath-Ali Shah,

03:47:03.660 --> 03:47:07.030
recognized by his luxuriant beard,

03:47:07.030 --> 03:47:10.180
which had been originally
painted black, but in fact,

03:47:10.180 --> 03:47:14.410
I should say that all the reliefs
were painted, Qajar reliefs,

03:47:14.410 --> 03:47:20.610
as well as Sasanian reliefs,
as well as Achaemenid reliefs,

03:47:21.820 --> 03:47:28.080
and quite garishly I must say,
very shocking to our eyes.

03:47:28.080 --> 03:47:29.830
We're not used to this.

03:47:29.830 --> 03:47:33.720
Anyway, Fath-Ali Shah is
flanked by his heir apparent,

03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:38.340
Abbas Mirza to your
right, and to your left,

03:47:38.340 --> 03:47:43.190
Abbas Mirza's son Mohammad Mirza

03:47:43.190 --> 03:47:49.490
who in 1834 succeeded Fath-Ali
Shah as Mohammad Shah Qajar.

03:47:49.490 --> 03:47:52.150
Fath-Ali Shad kneels
on the Takht-e Marmar,

03:47:52.150 --> 03:47:54.670
the famous marble throne
upon which he

03:47:54.670 --> 03:47:57.830
and successive monarchs
were crowned.

03:47:57.830 --> 03:48:01.300
Framing the scene are the
twisted marble columns

03:48:01.300 --> 03:48:06.790 position:56%
that the first Qajar ruler,
Fath-Ali Shah's uncle Agha Mohammad,

03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:13.420
carted off to Teheran from Karim
Khan Zand's palace in Shiraz

03:48:13.420 --> 03:48:19.180
when he defeated the Zand dynasty
and gained the Persian throne.

03:48:19.180 --> 03:48:23.870
These furnishing indicate that
the scent takes place in Teheran.

03:48:23.870 --> 03:48:27.560 position:56%
And as I've previously written about
the relief, I believe it was carved

03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:30.590
on the orders of Fath-Ali Shah
to demonstrate to the people

03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:34.490
of Farz the correct
succession to the throne.

03:48:34.490 --> 03:48:39.390
It became necessary to do this in
1822 after the Shah heard rumors

03:48:39.390 --> 03:48:45.290
that two of his other sons, Hassan
Ali Mirza, Governor of Khorasan,

03:48:45.290 --> 03:48:48.170 position:56%
and Hossein Ali Mirza, Farman Farma,

03:48:48.170 --> 03:48:51.960
Governor of Shiraz,
were planning a revolt.

03:48:51.960 --> 03:48:55.090
Hassan Ali Mirza resigned
his governorship,

03:48:55.090 --> 03:49:00.540
but Hossein Ali Mirza did not
and continued to rule in Shiraz.

03:49:00.540 --> 03:49:06.310 position:56%
The frontal hieratic pose of the
Shah, flanked by his intended heirs,

03:49:06.310 --> 03:49:13.490
recalls the enthronement relief
of the Sasanian ruler Bahram II

03:49:13.490 --> 03:49:17.710
at Sarab Bahram, which
is not far from Saharz

03:49:17.710 --> 03:49:21.590
and surely must have
served as an inspiration.

03:49:24.130 --> 03:49:30.100
I show you two more reliefs
dated to the early 1830s,

03:49:30.100 --> 03:49:33.110 position:56%
Fath-Ali Shah's last decade of rule.

03:49:33.110 --> 03:49:36.070
Both were carved at
Rayy, south of Teheran.

03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:41.350
And this one on a boulder
at Kuh-e Sorsorreh shows him

03:49:41.350 --> 03:49:46.370
with long beard flying as he spears
a lion, a more active portrayal

03:49:46.370 --> 03:49:49.630
than the usual static enthronement.

03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:53.850
It's possible that this daring-do
was inspired by the Sasanian relief

03:49:53.850 --> 03:49:56.940
that had originally been
carved on the boulder,

03:49:56.940 --> 03:50:00.230
which probably depicted Shapur I.

03:50:00.230 --> 03:50:02.960
And you see it here
in this drawing made

03:50:02.960 --> 03:50:05.380
by Cerulean Usli [assumed
spelling] during his stay

03:50:05.380 --> 03:50:08.760
in Persia from 1811 to 1812.

03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:12.400
It's likely that the
Qajar shah's appropriation

03:50:12.400 --> 03:50:19.670
of this ancient relief added to the
power and prestige of his image.

03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:24.620
Fath-Ali Shah's last relief
at Rayy is this enthronement

03:50:24.620 --> 03:50:29.970
at Cheshmeh Ali, carved three
years before his death in 1834.

03:50:29.970 --> 03:50:35.970
And again, for nostalgia's
sake, in the upper left some

03:50:35.970 --> 03:50:39.740
of you might remember it was
a fine place to picnicking,

03:50:39.740 --> 03:50:44.010
and people washed their
carpets at the spring.

03:50:44.010 --> 03:50:46.530
It's a very old slide.

03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:55.070 position:56%
The relief reprises the central
portion of a much earlier well-known

03:50:55.070 --> 03:50:58.400
and much-copied life-sized
wall painting made

03:50:58.400 --> 03:51:01.570
by Abdullah Khan 20 years earlier

03:51:01.570 --> 03:51:05.940
for the Negaristan
palace outside of Teheran.

03:51:05.940 --> 03:51:10.170 position:56%
Its subject is an imaginary New
Year reception at the Persian court.

03:51:10.170 --> 03:51:15.520
The enthroned shah is flanked by
his sons and retainers as well

03:51:15.520 --> 03:51:17.650
as by all the foreign envoys

03:51:17.650 --> 03:51:21.860
and ambassadors he had
received on different occasions.

03:51:21.860 --> 03:51:28.360
Its composition echoes the great
reliefs of Shapur and that of --

03:51:28.360 --> 03:51:33.100
I don't think it moved -- sorry.

03:51:36.810 --> 03:51:40.790
Yes, sorry, I have left
out a slide, but it's okay.

03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:49.820 position:56%
Anyway, it echoes the great reliefs
of Shapur I and the one of Shapur II

03:51:49.820 --> 03:51:57.380 position:56%
at Bishapur, which display images
of and submission of subject peoples

03:51:57.380 --> 03:52:01.480
from all parts of the
Sasanian empire.

03:52:01.480 --> 03:52:06.620
In the Negaristan painting and
at Cheshmeh Ali, representatives

03:52:06.620 --> 03:52:09.640
of Britain, France, India, Arabia,

03:52:09.640 --> 03:52:14.030
and the Ottoman Empire pay their
respects to the Qajar Shah.

03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:19.450
But this is purely symbolic, as
they never all actually converged

03:52:19.450 --> 03:52:23.370 position:56%
on the Qajar court at a single time.

03:52:23.370 --> 03:52:28.270
If the image of foreigners
coming to pay respect

03:52:28.270 --> 03:52:34.230
to the Persian shah reminds you of
the Great Procession at Persepolis

03:52:34.230 --> 03:52:39.430 position:56%
to which -- in which all the subject
nations bring gifts or tribute

03:52:39.430 --> 03:52:45.450
to the American King of Kings,
I'd give you an A for effort,

03:52:45.450 --> 03:52:48.430
but otherwise you would be wrong.

03:52:48.430 --> 03:52:53.770
And that's because the
enthroned figure of Darius

03:52:53.770 --> 03:52:57.670
and his Crown Prince Xerxes
had occupied the center

03:52:57.670 --> 03:53:01.220
of the composition on the
northern and eastern staircases

03:53:01.220 --> 03:53:05.520
of the Apadana, but the
Qajars never saw them,

03:53:05.520 --> 03:53:10.540
as those panels had been
replaced by Darius' son Xerxes

03:53:10.540 --> 03:53:14.120
with an inscriptional
panel flanked by guards.

03:53:14.120 --> 03:53:17.590 position:56%
And you see that in the lower slide.

03:53:17.590 --> 03:53:19.810
And this, of course,
is what we see today.

03:53:19.810 --> 03:53:24.520
The -- in the center is the
drawing of one of the two panels.

03:53:24.520 --> 03:53:31.780 position:56%
And you will see them because they
were found during proper excavations

03:53:31.780 --> 03:53:33.840
of Persepolis in the
treasury building.

03:53:33.840 --> 03:53:37.440
So they had been removed by
the heir who really didn't want

03:53:37.440 --> 03:53:42.440
to show himself as being
subservient to his father.

03:53:42.440 --> 03:53:48.090
At least that is what
we have accepted.

03:53:48.090 --> 03:53:51.750
So this is what we see today.

03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:55.540
However, the grandeur
of the entire procession

03:53:55.540 --> 03:54:01.990
on the eastern stairway became
visible only in the 1930s

03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:06.400
with the scientific
excavation of Persepolis.

03:54:06.400 --> 03:54:09.890
And this is really what
the Qajars would have seen,

03:54:09.890 --> 03:54:16.710 position:56%
and even into the early 20th century
this is what Persepolis looked like.

03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:21.850
And what was exposed, which was the
northern staircase of the Apadana,

03:54:21.850 --> 03:54:27.400
was in a ruinous state
and had also been looted.

03:54:27.400 --> 03:54:33.190
Many reliefs that now
grace some of our museums

03:54:33.190 --> 03:54:36.810
around the world came from there.

03:54:36.810 --> 03:54:40.430
In short, Fath-Ali Shah and
his artists were not inspired

03:54:40.430 --> 03:54:42.720
by these Achaemenid reliefs.

03:54:42.720 --> 03:54:45.510
Rather, the image of the
enthroned ruler flanked

03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:49.020
by courtiers was a topos
of Persian painting.

03:54:49.020 --> 03:54:53.260
And as you've seen, one that
harks back to Sasanian rule.

03:54:53.260 --> 03:54:56.620
Before Fath-Ali Shah
assumed the Qajar throne,

03:54:56.620 --> 03:54:59.890
he had served Agha
Mohammad Shah as Governor

03:54:59.890 --> 03:55:03.680
of Farz province with
his seat in Shiraz.

03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:07.040
As you saw on the map at
the beginning of my talk,

03:55:07.040 --> 03:55:11.680
Farz is home to a trove
of Sasanian reliefs.

03:55:11.680 --> 03:55:16.820
Of the surviving 40, 28
are in Farz province,

03:55:16.820 --> 03:55:19.810
and most are not far from Shiraz.

03:55:19.810 --> 03:55:24.910
Truly their imposing scale and
courtly imagery of enthronement

03:55:24.910 --> 03:55:32.490 position:56%
and jousting inspired the young Baba
Khan, as Fath-Ali Shah was known,

03:55:32.490 --> 03:55:40.100
while his uncle Agha
Mohammad ruled in Persia.

03:55:40.100 --> 03:55:41.900
As I hope I've demonstrated,

03:55:41.900 --> 03:55:45.670
rock relief carving flourished
during Fath-Ali Shah's reign,

03:55:45.670 --> 03:55:47.650
and only with his reign.

03:55:47.650 --> 03:55:51.790
With his death in 1834, this
art form came to an end,

03:55:51.790 --> 03:55:55.930
except for a one-time revival
under Nasr al-Din Shah,

03:55:55.930 --> 03:55:58.570 position:56%
which is what you're looking at now.

03:55:58.570 --> 03:56:04.660
Bearing the date of 1878 is this
monumental relief commemorating the

03:56:04.660 --> 03:56:08.910 position:56%
reconstruction of a road through the
Haraz River Valley in Mazandaran.

03:56:08.910 --> 03:56:11.660
That's in the north.

03:56:11.660 --> 03:56:16.670
In the center you see the Shah on
horseback flanked by courtiers,

03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:20.760
one of which is his Minister
for Public Works, and another,

03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:24.900
the second from the right -- I'm
sorry, I don't have a pointer --

03:56:24.900 --> 03:56:27.950
is his favorite court photographer,

03:56:27.950 --> 03:56:32.090
Aga Riza Aqa Spash-e
[assumed spelling].

03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:36.610
Please notice the extreme fidelity
in the rendering of the Shah,

03:56:36.610 --> 03:56:39.390
his courtiers, and his horse.

03:56:39.390 --> 03:56:43.190
This is due to a great
familiarity with photography,

03:56:43.190 --> 03:56:48.410
for Nasr al-Din Shah was himself an
avid and accomplished photographer

03:56:48.410 --> 03:56:52.420
and advanced the use of
this art throughout Persia.

03:56:52.420 --> 03:56:56.710
Also notable in this relief is how
the figures are organized in space

03:56:56.710 --> 03:57:00.550
and the use of different
heights of relief to crate depth.

03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:05.210 position:56%
This helps to suggest a kind of
perspective that is alien to ancient

03:57:05.210 --> 03:57:08.680
and traditional Persian
art, but is characteristic

03:57:08.680 --> 03:57:11.500
of this late Qajar period.

03:57:11.500 --> 03:57:15.550
An increased interest in
and resulting influence

03:57:15.550 --> 03:57:19.730
of the West impacted
strongly on Qajar art,

03:57:19.730 --> 03:57:23.870
as did the so-called
realism of photography.

03:57:23.870 --> 03:57:27.080
Thus, in the relief
we see a new take

03:57:27.080 --> 03:57:32.220
on the hierarchic courtly
mode of the ruler enthroned.

03:57:32.220 --> 03:57:40.160
And it's interesting to contrast
the two, the Sasanian Bahran II one

03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:44.840
and Fath-Ali Shah's
enthronement scene in Shiraz.

03:57:44.840 --> 03:57:51.430 position:56%
Interestingly, in this time of the
Haraz Road relief and Qajar interest

03:57:51.430 --> 03:57:55.680 position:56%
in photography, a different kind of
relief sculpture was being developed

03:57:55.680 --> 03:57:58.800
in Iran, specifically
in Farz province.

03:57:58.800 --> 03:58:07.390
Beginning in the 1860s, a number of
grand houses in Shiraz were built

03:58:07.390 --> 03:58:10.930
and embellished with stone
relief sculptures as well

03:58:10.930 --> 03:58:14.310
as plaster carvings
and ceramic tiles

03:58:14.310 --> 03:58:16.740
that copy Achaemenid sculpture,

03:58:16.740 --> 03:58:20.070
specifically the reliefs
from Persepolis.

03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:24.920
There's time to show you
examples from one of --

03:58:24.920 --> 03:58:27.540
only one of these houses.

03:58:27.540 --> 03:58:33.350
It is the Narengestan, built
sometime between 1879 and 1885.

03:58:33.350 --> 03:58:40.550
And no doubt some of you here have
visited it either because you lived

03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:46.250
in Shiraz or you visited Shiraz,
and maybe you grew up in Shiraz.

03:58:46.250 --> 03:58:49.570
I know that one person
in the audience here has.

03:58:49.570 --> 03:58:54.200
What prompted this
interest in Achaemenid,

03:58:54.200 --> 03:58:57.520
specifically Persepolitan imagery?

03:58:57.520 --> 03:59:02.620
Centuries of Persian Islamic art
had reverberated with faint echoes

03:59:02.620 --> 03:59:06.200
of the art developed
under Cyrus and Darius.

03:59:06.200 --> 03:59:09.180
And these reverberations had
been channeled through the filter

03:59:09.180 --> 03:59:12.440
of Sasanian artistic convention.

03:59:12.440 --> 03:59:14.990
I've already treated this
issue in several articles

03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:17.420
that focus on its various aspects.

03:59:17.420 --> 03:59:20.920
In the time remaining, suffice
it to say that knowledge

03:59:20.920 --> 03:59:25.080
of Persia's pre-Islamic
past had virtually been lost

03:59:25.080 --> 03:59:27.900
to the Persians themselves.

03:59:27.900 --> 03:59:31.380
The epic national history,
the "Shahnameh,"

03:59:31.380 --> 03:59:34.470
treats only the major
Sasanian rulers,

03:59:34.470 --> 03:59:40.010
the events of their reign only
vaguely remembered or romanticized.

03:59:40.010 --> 03:59:43.890
The Achaemenid dynasty
was even more obscure.

03:59:43.890 --> 03:59:47.850
In fact, it was virtually unknown.

03:59:47.850 --> 03:59:54.110
The "Shahnameh" mentions only the
last Achaeminic king, Darius III,

03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:59.390
but only as a foil for the
conquering and heroic Iskandar,

03:59:59.390 --> 04:00:03.280
Alexander the Great, who
is the legitimate ruler.

04:00:03.280 --> 04:00:09.950
But an important event occurred
in 1846 with the publication

04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:15.810 position:56%
by the military officer linguist and
diplomat, Henry Creswicke Rawlinson,

04:00:15.810 --> 04:00:17.960
of his reading of the
Old Persian text

04:00:17.960 --> 04:00:21.130
of Darius' inscription at Behistun.

04:00:21.130 --> 04:00:25.080
This introduced to mid-19th
century Persians the voice

04:00:25.080 --> 04:00:30.420
of a great Persian ruler of
an actual and far more ancient

04:00:30.420 --> 04:00:34.570
and powerful Persia than
hitherto they had known.

04:00:34.570 --> 04:00:39.750 position:56%
Through Darius' own words which
were translated into modern Persian,

04:00:39.750 --> 04:00:46.440 position:56%
almost immediately, Persians learned
about the first great Persian Empire

04:00:46.440 --> 04:00:50.220
that for its time,
rivaled that of any

04:00:50.220 --> 04:00:54.400
of the European powers
past or current.

04:00:54.400 --> 04:00:57.850
At a time when Persia had to
stave off Russian, British,

04:00:57.850 --> 04:01:00.360
and French attempts
to bring the country

04:01:00.360 --> 04:01:03.720
into their respective
spheres of influence,

04:01:03.720 --> 04:01:07.610
this knowledge became a source
of national pride and fed

04:01:07.610 --> 04:01:09.500
into the growing interest
on the part

04:01:09.500 --> 04:01:13.770
of many Persian intellectuals
in nation building.

04:01:13.770 --> 04:01:18.230
Thus interest turned to such
Achaemenid sites as Pasargadae

04:01:18.230 --> 04:01:22.260
and to the tombs of the
Achaemenid kings at Naqsh-e Rustam

04:01:22.260 --> 04:01:28.210 position:56%
but most particular to Persepolis
or Parsa, hitherto known to Persians

04:01:28.210 --> 04:01:32.370
from early Islamic times as
Sad Stun, "Hundred Columns" --

04:01:32.370 --> 04:01:37.210
chihil minara "Forty Minarets" --
or as it is still called today,

04:01:37.210 --> 04:01:40.790
Takht-e Jamshid for
Throne of Jamshid.

04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:44.130
[Inaudible] must have been aware
of Persepolis but we have --

04:01:44.130 --> 04:01:46.140
he would have considered
it the creation

04:01:46.140 --> 04:01:49.150
of mythological or
supernatural beings.

04:01:49.150 --> 04:01:50.820
Its carvings unfamiliar

04:01:50.820 --> 04:01:54.470
and unidentifiable
and hence meaningless.

04:01:54.470 --> 04:01:58.740
In contrast, he would have
recognized in the reliefs

04:01:58.740 --> 04:02:02.340
of the [Inaudible] the traditional
privileges and duties of kingship,

04:02:02.340 --> 04:02:06.290
enthronement, homage,
fighting and the hunt,

04:02:06.290 --> 04:02:09.510
all produced on a monumental scale,

04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:12.640
worthy models for this
[inaudible] monarch.

04:02:12.640 --> 04:02:14.440
Thank you.

04:02:14.440 --> 04:02:23.040
[ Applause ]

04:02:23.040 --> 04:02:24.870
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Thank you very much.

04:02:24.870 --> 04:02:27.340
And we do have someone
from Shiraz here,

04:02:27.340 --> 04:02:30.500
Dr. Fatemeh Keshavarz
is from Shiraz.

04:02:30.500 --> 04:02:33.230
So one of our speakers, exactly.

04:02:33.230 --> 04:02:36.430
Last but not least from
University of Maryland,

04:02:36.430 --> 04:02:42.060
I would like to introduce
Dr. Ida Meftahi.

04:02:42.060 --> 04:02:47.750
She currently holds a Visiting
Assistantship Professorship

04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:52.180
in Contemporary Iranian Culture
and Society at the Roshan Institute

04:02:52.180 --> 04:02:55.440
for Persian Studies,
University of Maryland.

04:02:55.440 --> 04:02:59.200
She completed her doctoral
studies at the University

04:02:59.200 --> 04:03:04.080
of Toronto's Department of Near
and Middle Eastern Civilizations

04:03:04.080 --> 04:03:09.730
and was the postdoctoral fellow
at the Institute for the Arts

04:03:09.730 --> 04:03:13.480
and Humanities at Pennsylvania
State University.

04:03:13.480 --> 04:03:17.980
Her first book, <i>Gender
and Dance in Modern Iran,</i>

04:03:17.980 --> 04:03:23.840
<i>Biopolitics on Stage</i>
was released in May 2016.

04:03:23.840 --> 04:03:26.840
In addition to teaching
interdisciplinary courses

04:03:26.840 --> 04:03:31.900
on Modern Iran, she is the director
of Lalehzar Digital Project,

04:03:31.900 --> 04:03:36.830
a component of the Roshan
Initiative for Digital Humanities,

04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:42.270
as well as faculty
adviser for Roshangar,

04:03:42.270 --> 04:03:46.320
Roshan Undergraduate
Journal for Persian Studies.

04:03:46.320 --> 04:03:47.620
Thank you, Ida.

04:03:47.620 --> 04:03:49.220
It's great to have you here again.

04:03:49.220 --> 04:03:53.270
She gave us a wonderful talk on her
book and now we have her talking

04:03:53.270 --> 04:03:58.340
about dance and Sasanian bringing
the Sasanian Realm to the present

04:03:58.340 --> 04:04:00.700
by taking it out of antiquity and
bringing it to the contemporary.

04:04:00.700 --> 04:04:02.500
Thank you.

04:04:02.500 --> 04:04:07.170
[ Applause ]

04:04:07.170 --> 04:04:08.470
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: Thank you.

04:04:08.470 --> 04:04:09.770
Greetings, everyone.

04:04:09.770 --> 04:04:14.390
In November 1921 on the
stage of the Grand Hotel

04:04:14.390 --> 04:04:18.690
on Tehran's Lalehzar Street,
the historical musical Parichihr

04:04:18.690 --> 04:04:22.290
and Parizad was staged
twice for the benefit

04:04:22.290 --> 04:04:29.210 position:56%
of the newspaper [Inaudible] --
newspapers [Inaudible] respectively.

04:04:29.210 --> 04:04:35.450
Advertised as a play that would
"inform the audience of the customs

04:04:35.450 --> 04:04:41.430
of Sasanian era" and written by
a young playwright Reza Kamal,

04:04:41.430 --> 04:04:44.350
who later took up the
pen name "Shahrzad".

04:04:44.350 --> 04:04:48.810
The show drew several hundreds of
enthusiastic audiences comprised

04:04:48.810 --> 04:04:51.960
of both ticket payers
and trespassers.

04:04:51.960 --> 04:04:56.580
The significance of the play
is reflected in the debased --

04:04:56.580 --> 04:05:00.880
debates it instigated in the
periodicals in the following weeks

04:05:00.880 --> 04:05:04.820 position:56%
about various aspects of performance
including the actors' depiction

04:05:04.820 --> 04:05:09.610
of characters and the venue, all
of which provide us with insights

04:05:09.610 --> 04:05:14.070
into politics, perception,
and expectations pertaining

04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:18.910
to staging ancient Iranian
history in early 20th century.

04:05:18.910 --> 04:05:23.610
An audience member, in defense of
the play wrote the following letter

04:05:23.610 --> 04:05:28.990
to the playwright, "Mr. Reza
Kamal, I came to the show knowing

04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:31.960
that you brought a forgotten
part of Iranian history

04:05:31.960 --> 04:05:36.210
to life using historical
evidence -- evidences.

04:05:36.210 --> 04:05:39.480
I was especially excited
that the play is

04:05:39.480 --> 04:05:42.500
about King Anurshirvan's
famous dream,

04:05:42.500 --> 04:05:44.810
the one that many historians
have described.

04:05:44.810 --> 04:05:48.140
I couldn't believe that a
young Iranian would be able

04:05:48.140 --> 04:05:51.990
to convert this country -- his
country's history into a play.

04:05:51.990 --> 04:05:56.740
You have selected to depict
the era of the just king

04:05:56.740 --> 04:05:59.290
that all Iranians are proud of

04:05:59.290 --> 04:06:02.860
and a beautiful episode
unique to this era."

04:06:02.860 --> 04:06:09.040
Thus far, the letter tells us that
firstly, the notion of history

04:06:09.040 --> 04:06:12.030
in this context was
intertwined with nationalism

04:06:12.030 --> 04:06:13.990
and glory of ancient Iran.

04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:19.480
And secondly, literary imagination
counted as historical evidence

04:06:19.480 --> 04:06:22.760
as the most recognized to
Anurshirvan's dream as far

04:06:22.760 --> 04:06:24.990
as those historic,
[inaudible] book of the kings.

04:06:24.990 --> 04:06:31.130
The letter then continued, "But
then the day after the show,

04:06:31.130 --> 04:06:32.730
I was surprised to see

04:06:32.730 --> 04:06:36.430
that [Inaudible] itself had
published a negative review

04:06:36.430 --> 04:06:37.730
about your play.

04:06:37.730 --> 04:06:42.350
I'm writing to asking not to get
discouraged by these criticisms.

04:06:42.350 --> 04:06:45.240
They have complained that
depicting Parichihr whose dead body

04:06:45.240 --> 04:06:51.730 position:56%
on stage was not appropriate for the
20th century and that it was a sign

04:06:51.730 --> 04:06:53.030
of savagery, [inaudible].

04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:55.580
You shouldn't take these
interpretations seriously

04:06:55.580 --> 04:06:58.270
as such scenes are
prevalent and important phase

04:06:58.270 --> 04:07:03.190
around the world including
Salome and Othello.

04:07:03.190 --> 04:07:05.860
If you -- if having a dead body

04:07:05.860 --> 04:07:08.810
on stage is savagery
then all these writers

04:07:08.810 --> 04:07:14.480
of the civilized world
must have been savages.

04:07:14.480 --> 04:07:18.180
You were also condemned for
having a fortune teller who speaks

04:07:18.180 --> 04:07:21.190
from the other world but of
course, you're showing an era

04:07:21.190 --> 04:07:25.340
in which this idea was
very indeed widespread."

04:07:25.340 --> 04:07:29.000
This part of the letter tells us --

04:07:29.000 --> 04:07:34.060 position:56%
attest to the fact that when ancient
Iranian history was materialized

04:07:34.060 --> 04:07:38.550
on stage, it had to reflect the
values and rules of modern stage

04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:43.790
of 1920s and not of the Sasanian
era in which the plot was based.

04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:48.620
At the time, theatrical stage was
considered the site for display

04:07:48.620 --> 04:07:51.240
of modernity and a
school of morality

04:07:51.240 --> 04:07:53.540
and edification for its audience.

04:07:53.540 --> 04:07:56.220
Thus the backward signs of savagery

04:07:56.220 --> 04:08:01.060
and superstitious countered the
then modern Iranian notions.

04:08:01.060 --> 04:08:04.910
The letter then continued,
"A playwright has

04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:09.290
to depict the characters'
personalities and behaviors

04:08:09.290 --> 04:08:11.990
as much as their costumes.

04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:18.480
It would been ridiculous if you had
shown the [inaudible] dancing just

04:08:18.480 --> 04:08:22.280
as a young Belgian king
may dance with women

04:08:22.280 --> 04:08:24.340
or if you would have
depicted the courtiers

04:08:24.340 --> 04:08:27.700
of the 1st century
[inaudible] with ties or bowties

04:08:27.700 --> 04:08:30.910
of latest Parisian
fashion because some actors

04:08:30.910 --> 04:08:33.690
of Comedie Francaise may show
up [inaudible] on the stage."

04:08:33.690 --> 04:08:40.290
As evidence, no matter how much the
theatrical media of the time drew

04:08:40.290 --> 04:08:45.820
up on European inspirations or
dialogued with European aesthetics,

04:08:45.820 --> 04:08:50.440
vernacular and gender perceptions,
they are expected to be reflected

04:08:50.440 --> 04:08:55.570
in the depiction of important
historical characters especially

04:08:55.570 --> 04:08:56.870
the kings.

04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:59.440
In this case, dancing was
not considered appropriate

04:08:59.440 --> 04:09:02.050
for a [inaudible] Iranian king.

04:09:02.050 --> 04:09:07.910
However, as other sources on this
play indicate, it was acceptable

04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:13.770
for the female protagonist
Parichihr to dance and sing.

04:09:13.770 --> 04:09:16.170
Indeed, one of the most
important novelties

04:09:16.170 --> 04:09:20.010
of this play was the employment
of the young Armenian dancer

04:09:20.010 --> 04:09:23.800
and singer, [Inaudible]
Aqabayov to enact the role

04:09:23.800 --> 04:09:26.770
of Parichihr upon her
arrival from Europe

04:09:26.770 --> 04:09:30.720
where she received her
opera and ballet training.

04:09:30.720 --> 04:09:33.420
Praised widely for her sole --

04:09:33.420 --> 04:09:38.170
for her role as Parichihr which
literally means, fairy face,

04:09:38.170 --> 04:09:43.390
Aqabayov adopted the stage name
of Pari and became the star

04:09:43.390 --> 04:09:46.790
of Iranian stage for a decade.

04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:50.030
While there are no existing
images of her performance,

04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:54.170
a farfetched interpretation
on my behalf,

04:09:54.170 --> 04:10:02.060 position:56%
is to relate this balletic depiction
of the goddess Nahid on pointe shoes

04:10:02.060 --> 04:10:06.160
in the logo of the
periodical Nahid in 1920s

04:10:06.160 --> 04:10:08.860
to Madame Pari's success
at the time.

04:10:10.410 --> 04:10:16.830
Not only was Aqabayov's artistic
skillsets a novelty for that era

04:10:16.830 --> 04:10:21.740
but the public appearance
of female performers even

04:10:21.740 --> 04:10:27.150
on that modern stage was rare and
mostly limited to non-Muslims.

04:10:27.150 --> 04:10:30.810
In this era, most female
roles continued

04:10:30.810 --> 04:10:34.260
to be performed by
cross-dressed men.

04:10:34.260 --> 04:10:38.060
This was the case -- oops --

04:10:39.130 --> 04:10:43.940
with another important historical
opera contemporaneous to Parichihr

04:10:43.940 --> 04:10:49.730 position:56%
and Parizad which had been on the
stage of Grand Hotel since May 1921.

04:10:49.730 --> 04:10:53.350
This was the Resurrection of
Persian Kings in the Ruins

04:10:53.350 --> 04:10:59.690
of Mada'in written by the poet
and journalist Mirzah'i Eshghi.

04:10:59.690 --> 04:11:04.820
Writing the first historical opera
of its kind, Eshghi was inspired

04:11:04.820 --> 04:11:08.580
by his travel from Baghdad to Mosul

04:11:08.580 --> 04:11:13.090
where he encountered
the still glorious ruins

04:11:13.090 --> 04:11:15.910
of Sasanian [Inaudible].

04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:20.110
The script revolves around the
poet's own dream which unfolds

04:11:20.110 --> 04:11:24.700
against the backdrop of
this historical monument.

04:11:24.700 --> 04:11:31.480 position:56%
There he witnesses some of the major
ancient Iranian kings including

04:11:31.480 --> 04:11:36.720 position:56%
Cyrus, Darius, and [Inaudible] along
with Zoroaster, all of whom mourned

04:11:36.720 --> 04:11:42.130
for the condition of Iran in
1920 which was depicted as part

04:11:42.130 --> 04:11:47.340 position:56%
of the continuum of a dark age
which began with the "Arab Invasion"

04:11:47.340 --> 04:11:51.230
that had put an end to the
Golden Age of Sasanian Era.

04:11:51.230 --> 04:11:54.210
A significant role belonged to --

04:11:54.210 --> 04:11:57.680
in this play, belonged to
a Sasanian princess enacted

04:11:57.680 --> 04:12:01.630
by a cross-dressed man who
mourned for the poor condition

04:12:01.630 --> 04:12:07.950
of Iranian women symbolizing
modern Iran or all women of Iran

04:12:07.950 --> 04:12:12.310
and ancient Iranian princess
became a prevalent character type

04:12:12.310 --> 04:12:14.960
in nationalist plays and
operettas of that era.

04:12:14.960 --> 04:12:18.450
Similar to Parichihr and Parizad,

04:12:18.450 --> 04:12:23.020
Resurrection of Persian
Kings instigated responses

04:12:23.020 --> 04:12:27.340
for the audiences who recommended
a more appropriate attire

04:12:27.340 --> 04:12:29.090
for certain kings on stage.

04:12:29.090 --> 04:12:34.010
A favorable comment from
audience member reads,

04:12:34.010 --> 04:12:40.000
"This play is the best medium
for moving the sensitive hearts

04:12:40.000 --> 04:12:45.100 position:56%
who view Iranian kings [inaudible]
up in the ruins of Ctesiphon to pray

04:12:45.100 --> 04:12:46.940
for the progress of Iran.

04:12:46.940 --> 04:12:51.180
Accompanying them is Zoroaster
who begs for the bliss of Iran.

04:12:51.180 --> 04:12:56.360
How can not -- how can one
not be moved by these things?"

04:12:56.360 --> 04:13:08.230
While later stagings of
the Resurrection in 1923,

04:13:08.230 --> 04:13:13.830
Madame Pari took over the
role of the Sasanian princess.

04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:18.060
Raztakhiz's reference to Sasanian
history were indeed far more direct

04:13:18.060 --> 04:13:20.440
than Shahrzad's Parichihr
and Parizad

04:13:20.440 --> 04:13:24.260
and perhaps its success
prompted the selling

04:13:24.260 --> 04:13:28.160
of Shahrzad's play as
a Sasanian history.

04:13:28.160 --> 04:13:31.930
Visualizing the glorious
ancient Iranian history combined

04:13:31.930 --> 04:13:36.080
with nationalism and nostalgia as
well as binary characterization

04:13:36.080 --> 04:13:40.880
of us Iranians versus
them, the Arab invaders,

04:13:40.880 --> 04:13:44.160
was a recurring theme
even before these operas

04:13:44.160 --> 04:13:47.520
and it's continued afterwards.

04:13:47.520 --> 04:13:54.980
A good later example is
[Inaudible] written in 1927.

04:13:54.980 --> 04:13:57.820
Some of these plays
combine the ancient history

04:13:57.820 --> 04:14:01.060
with classical literature
including those dealing

04:14:01.060 --> 04:14:04.440
with [inaudible] namely [Inaudible]
which drew on ancient history

04:14:04.440 --> 04:14:14.580
to assign historical personas
to literary characters.

04:14:14.580 --> 04:14:21.080 position:56%
While others were based on
collaborations of historians, again,

04:14:21.080 --> 04:14:26.850
history in its early 20th
century sense with writers.

04:14:26.850 --> 04:14:30.240
These collaborations which
gradually became more conscious

04:14:30.240 --> 04:14:33.270
of archeological expeditions
and works

04:14:33.270 --> 04:14:35.750
of European Orientalist
scholars would lead

04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:41.520
to a more historically informed
detailing in the staging of plays.

04:14:41.520 --> 04:14:47.760
While Reza Shah's state is
nationalism promoted similar lines

04:14:47.760 --> 04:14:52.020
of thinking, it's important
to note that these authors

04:14:52.020 --> 04:14:54.730
that they're not necessarily
pro-state.

04:14:54.730 --> 04:15:05.860
In fact, Mirzah'i Eshghi was
murdered by the Pahlavi regime

04:15:05.860 --> 04:15:09.460
and Shahrzad committed suicide.

04:15:09.460 --> 04:15:15.020
An example of a pro-state
play is Zoroaster's Promise,

04:15:15.020 --> 04:15:20.130
[Inaudible] written in
1930 by [Inaudible].

04:15:20.130 --> 04:15:25.170
In this play, in the manner
of Eshghi's Resurrection

04:15:25.170 --> 04:15:35.320
of Iranian Kings, modern
Iran, Zoroaster, Darius I,

04:15:35.320 --> 04:15:38.500
[Inaudible] all visit the
playwright in his dream.

04:15:38.500 --> 04:15:40.480
The play culminates with all

04:15:40.480 --> 04:15:44.570
of these important figures praising
Reza Shah for his achievements.

04:15:44.570 --> 04:15:50.450 position:56%
In the words of the theater scholar,
[Inaudible], the goal of this genre

04:15:50.450 --> 04:15:54.460
of historical drama in that era
was to evoke emotional response

04:15:54.460 --> 04:15:59.720
in the audience while embodying the
official, the grandiose language

04:15:59.720 --> 04:16:04.230
and larger than life behaviors
as well as idealistic love

04:16:04.230 --> 04:16:07.930
to sacrifice for the Motherland.

04:16:07.930 --> 04:16:11.940
Concurrently, the first Pahlavi's
Women Emancipation Program

04:16:11.940 --> 04:16:16.640
in 1936 facilitated the
men's presence on stage.

04:16:16.640 --> 04:16:20.230
However, public performance
and especially dancing

04:16:20.230 --> 04:16:24.510
for Muslim women continued
to have its predicaments.

04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:29.510
As I argue in my book, these early
combinations of music, dance,

04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:31.970
and acting with Iranian literature

04:16:31.970 --> 04:16:36.240
and nationalist themes
gave legitimacy to dance

04:16:36.240 --> 04:16:41.010
and revered asexual female
performers appeared on stage

04:16:41.010 --> 04:16:44.710
as angels and Persian princesses.

04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:50.980
Such depiction of women as angel
and Persian princesses combined

04:16:50.980 --> 04:16:53.400
with nationalist and
revivalist attitude

04:16:53.400 --> 04:16:58.090
for ancient Iranian tradition
is best depicted in productions

04:16:58.090 --> 04:17:02.910
of the Studio for Revival
of Iranian Classic Arts.

04:17:02.910 --> 04:17:08.410
Founded during World War II by
the American Nilla Cram Cook,

04:17:08.410 --> 04:17:13.190
the company sought not to only
visualize ancient Iranian history

04:17:13.190 --> 04:17:20.910 position:56%
on stage but also use their range
of ancient motifs to reconstruct the

04:17:20.910 --> 04:17:25.740
"real Iranian dance" and bring
back its ancient religious

04:17:25.740 --> 04:17:28.770
and national status.

04:17:28.770 --> 04:17:32.950
Like Iranian -- like her
Iranian predecessors of 1920s,

04:17:32.950 --> 04:17:35.510
Cook drew up on Persian literature,

04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:40.380
archaeological findings,
and Zoroastrian text.

04:17:40.380 --> 04:17:44.810
Here I turned to her
piece, Ardeshir Babakan

04:17:44.810 --> 04:17:48.100
which bore many resemblances
to earlier works.

04:17:48.100 --> 04:17:51.530
It employed the backdrop of
a dream to bring the founder

04:17:51.530 --> 04:17:54.610
of Sasanian Empire into a
conversation with Darius

04:17:54.610 --> 04:17:57.920
in the background of his tomb.

04:17:57.920 --> 04:18:04.160
But comparing to the earlier
works, she had explicit details

04:18:04.160 --> 04:18:09.040
and program notes regarding
the use of ancient motifs.

04:18:09.040 --> 04:18:14.250
For instance, excerpt from the
translation of an inscription of --

04:18:14.250 --> 04:18:15.650
from Persepolis and [Inaudible],

04:18:15.650 --> 04:18:23.850
they are used for the
dialogue between the two kings.

04:18:23.850 --> 04:18:28.190
Angels of earth, fire,
water, sun, and moon --

04:18:28.190 --> 04:18:32.460
they're featured as characters
and their costuming was based

04:18:32.460 --> 04:18:38.690
on silver vessels of Sasanian era
held at the Museum of Ancient Iran.

04:18:38.690 --> 04:18:46.220
Providing the historical
introduction to Babakan's era

04:18:46.220 --> 04:18:51.140
and his significance, the
program notes declared,

04:18:51.140 --> 04:18:56.230 position:56%
"If you have chosen Ardeshir Babakan
as our first hero rather than Cyrus

04:18:56.230 --> 04:18:58.560
or Darius of the Golden Age,

04:18:58.560 --> 04:19:02.570
it's because he aroused the
sleeping fate, found the sacred --

04:19:02.570 --> 04:19:07.360
secret of new life and dared to
attempt the rebuilding of the world

04:19:07.360 --> 04:19:10.450
that had fallen into ruins."

04:19:10.450 --> 04:19:16.450
As the quote indicates,
Cook's connection

04:19:16.450 --> 04:19:22.190
with ancient history was not of
the romantic, nostalgic nature

04:19:22.190 --> 04:19:27.800
of the earlier writers but was
hopeful, [inaudible], invigorating

04:19:27.800 --> 04:19:31.490
and to some extent universalist.

04:19:31.490 --> 04:19:36.580
While the image in the printed
program indicates poses rather

04:19:36.580 --> 04:19:42.290
movements, Cook wrote elsewhere
that she drew up on old coins,

04:19:42.290 --> 04:19:45.970
sacred Zoroastrian
rituals, Zurkhanah

04:19:45.970 --> 04:19:49.800
and sculpture processions
of Persepolis.

04:19:49.800 --> 04:19:58.500
Especially [Inaudible] as a source
for revival of [Inaudible] dances.

04:19:58.500 --> 04:20:03.220
While she also claimed that
there were many similarities

04:20:03.220 --> 04:20:09.980
between ancient's Achaemenid
movements

04:20:09.980 --> 04:20:14.260
as well as those of the Greek.

04:20:15.270 --> 04:20:17.770
[Inaudible] -- the
historian [Inaudible]

04:20:17.770 --> 04:20:22.780
in his widely circulated article
on dance and history of Iran,

04:20:22.780 --> 04:20:29.670
criticized Cook's ideas on
this as baseless fantasy.

04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:33.660
It's also important to note that
[inaudible] in his text referred

04:20:33.660 --> 04:20:38.400
to Achaemenid kings dancing while
emphasizing that the type of dance

04:20:38.400 --> 04:20:42.140
that they did was sacred and
not cheap and degenerate.

04:20:42.140 --> 04:20:47.330
And now one may ask --

04:20:52.260 --> 04:20:54.520
-- I have to go back [laughter].

04:20:54.520 --> 04:21:00.390
That is, the Iranian playwrights of
1920s had an emotional attachment

04:21:00.390 --> 04:21:03.780
to Iran's glorious past
and used such nostalgia

04:21:03.780 --> 04:21:07.100
for the purpose of
regaining that glory.

04:21:07.100 --> 04:21:11.520
What was the American Nilla Cook's
intention for traveling to Iran

04:21:11.520 --> 04:21:16.910
in 1942 to revive the
ancient Iranian arts?

04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:18.440
My answer is two-fold.

04:21:18.440 --> 04:21:25.650
As in the case of many
modernist artists of her era

04:21:25.650 --> 04:21:31.550
who turned eastward for
the authentic, the natural,

04:21:31.550 --> 04:21:34.060 position:56%
and the universal material for arts,

04:21:34.060 --> 04:21:37.510
Iran and Persian language
attracted Cook.

04:21:37.510 --> 04:21:41.560
Furthermore, Nilla Cook's
parents were among key figures,

04:21:41.560 --> 04:21:45.940
the key figures involved the
American [inaudible] Hellenist

04:21:45.940 --> 04:21:52.120
artistic movements in
1920s and the organizers

04:21:52.120 --> 04:21:56.630 position:56%
of the important Delphic Festival in
Greece for the revival of Persian --

04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:59.750
of pure ancient Greek traditions.

04:21:59.750 --> 04:22:05.450 position:56%
Growing up in Greece, Nilla not
only witnessed major American modern

04:22:05.450 --> 04:22:11.010 position:56%
dancers including Isadora Duncan,
in search of natural dances in ruins

04:22:11.010 --> 04:22:16.490
of Athens but also was herself
involved in these dance activities.

04:22:16.490 --> 04:22:21.550
At the same time, like many
Orientalists of the wartime,

04:22:21.550 --> 04:22:24.440 position:56%
she worked with the U.S. government.

04:22:25.880 --> 04:22:31.680
Showing up in the wartime of Iran
in 1942, she temporarily was hired

04:22:31.680 --> 04:22:37.900 position:56%
by the American Embassy in Tehran as
a cultural relation representative.

04:22:37.900 --> 04:22:42.700
She later joined the Department
of Theaters of Iranian Ministry

04:22:42.700 --> 04:22:46.960
of Interior as director
meaning that she was the --

04:22:46.960 --> 04:22:51.130
she was in charge of
censorship of theater and cinema

04:22:51.130 --> 04:22:56.910
which at the time was very
much influenced by the Soviets.

04:22:56.910 --> 04:23:01.860
Meanwhile, she pursued both Iranian
and American resources ranging

04:23:01.860 --> 04:23:05.170
from the embassy to
Shah's mother in order

04:23:05.170 --> 04:23:07.940 position:56%
to create an Iranian National Opera.

04:23:07.940 --> 04:23:14.590
Inferring from archival
research at my archival research

04:23:14.590 --> 04:23:17.810
at National Archives, I
find that wartime atmosphere

04:23:17.810 --> 04:23:22.750
of American legation was
suitable for Cook's venture.

04:23:22.750 --> 04:23:26.370
Firstly, competing with
England and United --

04:23:26.370 --> 04:23:33.690
and the Soviets, the United
States was pursuing an independent

04:23:33.690 --> 04:23:36.910
propaganda system that
distanced United States

04:23:36.910 --> 04:23:41.410
from the negative reputation of
the British and Soviets in Iran.

04:23:41.410 --> 04:23:49.420 position:56%
Secondly, as quoted in the first
memorandum for propaganda activities

04:23:49.420 --> 04:23:54.280
in Iran, sent to State
Department in 1942,

04:23:54.280 --> 04:23:57.750
they had already found
Iranian soft spots.

04:23:57.750 --> 04:24:00.590
I'm quoting that document.

04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:05.240
"Iranian people are susceptible to
flattery especially in connection

04:24:05.240 --> 04:24:08.620
with Persia's contribution
to the fields of art,

04:24:08.620 --> 04:24:10.160
poetry, and architecture."

04:24:10.160 --> 04:24:16.530
Thus they recommended
flattery on these subjects

04:24:16.530 --> 04:24:18.510
as a medium for propaganda.

04:24:18.510 --> 04:24:23.430
I find that directly [inaudible]
this anecdote and the field trips

04:24:23.430 --> 04:24:26.570
of Arthur Pope to Iran
in preparation

04:24:26.570 --> 04:24:30.020
of his famous Survey
of Persian Arts.

04:24:30.020 --> 04:24:33.840
In fact, Arthur Pope
was very much present

04:24:33.840 --> 04:24:40.090
in all these documents
from 1930s to '40s.

04:24:40.090 --> 04:24:47.570
Cook argued that -- and Pope's
book was also one of the sources

04:24:47.570 --> 04:24:51.780
that Nilla Cook used for
her artistic creations.

04:24:51.780 --> 04:24:53.720
Cook argued that the environment

04:24:53.720 --> 04:24:58.480 position:56%
of Iranian theater was especially
dominated by the Russians and pushed

04:24:58.480 --> 04:25:04.710
for an American-based stage
project to counter the impact.

04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:10.160
At the same time, she added
another public diplomacy agenda

04:25:10.160 --> 04:25:15.690
for her project by using it to
"break the barrier of dancing

04:25:15.690 --> 04:25:20.320
for women of good families,"
an idea that was even quoted

04:25:20.320 --> 04:25:25.750
in Richard Arndt's book on
<i>American Cultural Diplomacy</i>

04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:29.880
<i>in the 20th Century </i>as a project
serving the diplomatic purpose

04:25:29.880 --> 04:25:31.510
of United States.

04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:38.710
Cook's point on this
barrier proved to be right

04:25:38.710 --> 04:25:42.090
when her advertisements
brought hundred men

04:25:42.090 --> 04:25:45.080
to the audition but no women.

04:25:45.080 --> 04:25:50.750
It was with the help of the U.S.
Public Relation attache Kyler Young

04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:55.760
that would finally persuaded a
few ballet-trained Iranian girls

04:25:55.760 --> 04:25:58.900
of mixed backgrounds
to join the studio.

04:25:58.900 --> 04:26:03.540
Among them, Natasha [Inaudible],

04:26:03.540 --> 04:26:10.380
who later on wrote her
memoir and Haideh Ahmadzadeh.

04:26:10.380 --> 04:26:14.940
And Haideh Ahmadzadeh,
who after a decade,

04:26:14.940 --> 04:26:17.000 position:56%
founded the Iranian National Ballet.

04:26:17.000 --> 04:26:23.860
In pursuit of this
goal, legitimizing dance

04:26:23.860 --> 04:26:27.280
through linking it with
glory of ancient Iran

04:26:27.280 --> 04:26:31.350
and Persian classical literature,
one of the earliest performances

04:26:31.350 --> 04:26:36.620 position:56%
of Cook's studio was at the
reception of Public Relation Attache

04:26:36.620 --> 04:26:40.670
at the Iranian Embassy
which was organized

04:26:40.670 --> 04:26:44.770
for "Iranian cultural leaders".

04:26:44.770 --> 04:26:54.120
The event was held in October 1945
at the garden of American Embassy.

04:26:54.120 --> 04:26:58.700
According to Young, about 300
intellectuals, educational,

04:26:58.700 --> 04:27:01.890
and cultural leaders including
those from University of Tehran

04:27:01.890 --> 04:27:04.770
and Ministry of Education
were invited along

04:27:04.770 --> 04:27:07.230
with members of Royal Family.

04:27:07.230 --> 04:27:12.930
The event became the talk of the
town for several weeks particularly

04:27:12.930 --> 04:27:16.300
because it was the -- as he
quotes, "It was the first time

04:27:16.300 --> 04:27:21.240
that reputable Iranian families
had permitted their daughters

04:27:21.240 --> 04:27:22.540
to dance publicly."

04:27:22.540 --> 04:27:25.420
Nesta Ramazani's reflection
on perform --

04:27:25.420 --> 04:27:30.400
on the performance further
completes Young's description,

04:27:30.400 --> 04:27:34.210
"Our show was an instant success.

04:27:34.210 --> 04:27:38.750
Far from being labeled as dancing
girls, we were seen as heroines.

04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:44.630
By infusing ancient Zoroastrian
rituals and legends with magic

04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:50.750
and vitality of movement, Ms. Cook
had tapped into the Persian pride

04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:53.560
in their ancient roots
and cultural heritage."

04:27:53.560 --> 04:28:00.120
Based on this success, Cook later
on held further public performances

04:28:00.120 --> 04:28:04.040
on Lalehzar Street and later
took the company to a tour

04:28:04.040 --> 04:28:10.060 position:56%
for several years in Middle East
and Europe and this was still 1940s.

04:28:10.060 --> 04:28:17.160
So just a few words to conclude,
since the late [inaudible] era,

04:28:17.160 --> 04:28:24.590 position:56%
experimentations with new approaches
to performing arts, Sasanian motifs

04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:30.750
and symbols -- sorry, with new
approaches to performing arts,

04:28:30.750 --> 04:28:35.310
Sasanian motifs, symbols and themes
have been adapted to the stage

04:28:35.310 --> 04:28:38.880
for telling dramatic
stories of Iranian nation,

04:28:38.880 --> 04:28:43.310
of its [inaudible] success,
failures, and revival.

04:28:43.310 --> 04:28:47.120
Said to be presented as musicals,
operettas, play or a dance,

04:28:47.120 --> 04:28:50.260
these theatrical staging
usually went hand in hand

04:28:50.260 --> 04:28:55.060 position:56%
with literary sources in visualizing
the kings, warriors, princesses

04:28:55.060 --> 04:28:58.030
and goddesses of pre-Islamic Iran.

04:28:58.030 --> 04:29:02.190
These dramatic ventures, they're
not only concerned with the glory

04:29:02.190 --> 04:29:05.040
of ancient Iran, but
they're informed

04:29:05.040 --> 04:29:08.790 position:56%
by scholarship produced at the time.

04:29:08.790 --> 04:29:13.170
In the meantime, depicting dancing
women as angels and princesses

04:29:13.170 --> 04:29:20.070
against the aura of ancient Iranian
glory legitimized dance for women

04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:23.730
that was otherwise considered
only a sexual display of the body.

04:29:23.730 --> 04:29:25.530
Thank you.

04:29:25.530 --> 04:29:32.050
[ Applause ]

04:29:32.050 --> 04:29:33.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank you, folks.

04:29:33.350 --> 04:29:37.490 position:56%
We have time for maybe two questions

04:29:37.490 --> 04:29:40.450
and after the questions,
I'm going to put it out.

04:29:40.450 --> 04:29:45.630
Right now, I would like to have
Mary-Jane and Fatemeh to come up.

04:29:45.630 --> 04:29:50.150
The moderators as well, I will
invite everyone who has spoken,

04:29:50.150 --> 04:29:54.330
all of the panelists, Touraj,
Khodadad and then of course,

04:29:54.330 --> 04:29:57.700
all the speakers to also
come for a group picture.

04:29:57.700 --> 04:30:01.260
And I want to give
Khodadad and Touraj a chance

04:30:01.260 --> 04:30:05.080
to also say some things since
they were co-conveners as well.

04:30:05.080 --> 04:30:10.320
And -- okay, so who
has the microphone?

04:30:10.320 --> 04:30:12.910
Do I get the microphone from you?

04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:14.210
All right.

04:30:14.210 --> 04:30:16.070
Could you -- all right,
if you have any questions

04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:21.190
for the wonderful last panel, John
will bring you the microphone.

04:30:21.190 --> 04:30:22.650
Thank you.

04:30:22.650 --> 04:30:26.300
&gt;&gt; All right.

04:30:26.300 --> 04:30:34.510
Fatemeh Keshavarz, my question is
when you read Persian literature

04:30:34.510 --> 04:30:37.450
from [inaudible] onwards
in modern Persian,

04:30:37.450 --> 04:30:43.320
there are constant references to
these earlier kings and heroes --

04:30:43.320 --> 04:30:45.710
[inaudible] and so forth.

04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:53.880
Obviously, they're not
accurate historical discussions

04:30:53.880 --> 04:30:59.490
but they show a level of
awareness that seems to be far

04:30:59.490 --> 04:31:01.350
from being totally forgotten

04:31:01.350 --> 04:31:04.070
and then rediscovered
in the 20th century.

04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:06.610
I wonder if anybody would
like to comment on that.

04:31:06.610 --> 04:31:08.910
Thank you.

04:31:11.250 --> 04:31:14.290
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Go ahead, Ida?

04:31:14.290 --> 04:31:16.580
Any comments, any responses?

04:31:16.580 --> 04:31:22.170
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: Well, I'm
thinking how to respond.

04:31:22.170 --> 04:31:25.390
I mean, I don't know if
you were referring to --

04:31:25.390 --> 04:31:27.200
&gt;&gt; I'm actually more referring

04:31:27.200 --> 04:31:30.530
to Judith's paper and,
you know, the others.

04:31:30.530 --> 04:31:33.200
I mean, you're most
welcome to address this.

04:31:33.200 --> 04:31:37.750
But I got the impression that
there's generally a thought

04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:41.730
that this past is kind of forgotten

04:31:41.730 --> 04:31:45.790
and then totally rediscovered
in the 20th century.

04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:49.020
And I do understand that there
is some of that but there seems

04:31:49.020 --> 04:31:54.880
to be a far more continued
awareness of that earlier history,

04:31:54.880 --> 04:31:58.090
if you read Persian literature,
you see constant references

04:31:58.090 --> 04:32:03.340
to all these heroes and
kings and things like that.

04:32:03.340 --> 04:32:07.620
So I'm just wondering if
that may not be an indication

04:32:07.620 --> 04:32:14.040
that there's not a total
rupture in that history.

04:32:14.040 --> 04:32:16.960
&gt;&gt; Judith Lerner: I will
try to speak to that.

04:32:16.960 --> 04:32:18.410
That's a big topic.

04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:22.220
I think there's a difference
between a past,

04:32:22.220 --> 04:32:26.700
let's call it a legendary
past and a historical past.

04:32:26.700 --> 04:32:35.510
And we do know that the Persians in
the first part of the 19th century

04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:40.600
and earlier, I mean, ever since
-- I mean, even if you read the --

04:32:40.600 --> 04:32:45.800
and the historians here can correct
me -- but even the Arab historians,

04:32:45.800 --> 04:32:49.570 position:56%
we don't know about the Achaemenids.

04:32:49.570 --> 04:32:52.430
They did not know.

04:32:52.430 --> 04:33:01.810
That's why Cyrus' tomb was the
mosque of the mother of Solomon.

04:33:01.810 --> 04:33:04.810
[Inaudible], they really
didn't know.

04:33:04.810 --> 04:33:09.230
However, the past was
known in the west

04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:13.690
because people read the Herodotus.

04:33:13.690 --> 04:33:14.990
They read [Inaudible].

04:33:14.990 --> 04:33:18.000
They knew about Alexander.

04:33:18.000 --> 04:33:23.360 position:56%
They knew and but that really wasn't
available or it doesn't seem to be.

04:33:23.360 --> 04:33:27.750
It could have been available but
it's not part of the culture.

04:33:27.750 --> 04:33:32.780
&gt;&gt; But that doesn't
[inaudible] all these --

04:33:32.780 --> 04:33:35.880
I mean, I'm wondering why is --

04:33:35.880 --> 04:33:39.370
there's a huge [speaking in foreign
language] which is based on that

04:33:39.370 --> 04:33:42.920
and then you get references in
[speaking in foreign language].

04:33:42.920 --> 04:33:48.660
And so you go on referring
to these past.

04:33:48.660 --> 04:33:50.560
I understand that that's
not historical before.

04:33:50.560 --> 04:33:51.860
&gt;&gt; Judith Lerner: It's a
different past, the recent past.

04:33:51.860 --> 04:33:54.330
&gt;&gt; With research, in fact,
there is an awareness

04:33:54.330 --> 04:33:56.510
of this old ancient history.

04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:57.810
Thank you.

04:33:57.810 --> 04:34:00.390
&gt;&gt; Judith Lerner: Right, but
it's a very different past.

04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:01.690
&gt;&gt; Samra Azarnouche: Does it work?

04:34:01.690 --> 04:34:02.990
&gt;&gt; Judith Lerner: Yes.

04:34:02.990 --> 04:34:06.400
&gt;&gt; Samra Azarnouche: May I -- I
had a comment about the memory

04:34:06.400 --> 04:34:09.070
of historical or mythical kings.

04:34:09.070 --> 04:34:12.780
So that's correct that in classical
literature, we have no trace

04:34:12.780 --> 04:34:16.240
of Achaemenides, only
Darius III, for instance.

04:34:16.240 --> 04:34:19.560
And because it is confronted
to Alexander, otherwise,

04:34:19.560 --> 04:34:24.420
we had no trace of him as well.

04:34:24.420 --> 04:34:32.430
So the Book of Kings and other
epic cycles are not history.

04:34:32.430 --> 04:34:38.260
But we have a source in which
we have a very accurate memory

04:34:38.260 --> 04:34:40.140
of ancient kings.

04:34:40.140 --> 04:34:42.780
And this source is Baroni.

04:34:42.780 --> 04:34:47.510
And Baroni has a list of
chronology of ancient people

04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:51.580
and he has a very accurate list
of the -- of Iranian kings.

04:34:51.580 --> 04:34:56.360
So all the Achaemenid kings
are here but they are mixed

04:34:56.360 --> 04:35:00.670
with [Inaudible] mythical kings.

04:35:00.670 --> 04:35:03.680
So both names are present
in the list.

04:35:03.680 --> 04:35:11.060
So it tells us that at one time
before Baroni, maybe at the time

04:35:11.060 --> 04:35:16.620
of the Sasanians, this mixture
has been made in the text sources.

04:35:16.620 --> 04:35:21.090
So Achaemenid doesn't
appear in literary

04:35:21.090 --> 04:35:24.140
because they have nothing
to do with it.

04:35:24.140 --> 04:35:29.670
I mean, they were erased from this
history long before Sasanian time,

04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:32.570
long before [Inaudible]
so there's no surprise

04:35:32.570 --> 04:35:36.960
that they aren't in our literature.

04:35:36.960 --> 04:35:41.500
&gt;&gt; Judith Lerner: And that
we also know that apparently

04:35:41.500 --> 04:35:44.700
in the early Sasanian period,
there still was a memory.

04:35:44.700 --> 04:35:51.230 position:56%
There still was the ability to read
-- or I should say, in the earliest,

04:35:51.230 --> 04:35:56.900
not just the early
Islamic period, excuse me.

04:35:56.900 --> 04:36:02.250
There was an ability
to read Middle Persian

04:36:02.250 --> 04:36:03.690
or I should -- no, I'm sorry.

04:36:03.690 --> 04:36:07.040
I'm -- forget what I just said.

04:36:07.040 --> 04:36:09.900
I'm a bit tired.

04:36:09.900 --> 04:36:11.920
The actual -- the Achaemenid kings

04:36:11.920 --> 04:36:18.530
and the Old Persian
could not be read.

04:36:18.530 --> 04:36:21.110
That had been forgotten.

04:36:21.110 --> 04:36:23.320
And so things came down.

04:36:23.320 --> 04:36:27.010
There is -- there are
certain formulae

04:36:27.010 --> 04:36:32.560
that the early Sasanian
kings used that parallel some

04:36:32.560 --> 04:36:36.670
of the Achaemenid formulae.

04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:39.370
And so there is a memory.

04:36:39.370 --> 04:36:44.830
But by the late Sasanian
times, for whatever reason,

04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:49.860
there was really a
forgetting of this past.

04:36:49.860 --> 04:36:56.820
And so, in fact, the being able to
read what was up there in Behistun

04:36:56.820 --> 04:37:01.130
and this was an ancient king
speaking in his own words,

04:37:01.130 --> 04:37:04.920
who was in a sense,
a world conqueror,

04:37:04.920 --> 04:37:08.170
was absolutely extraordinary.

04:37:08.170 --> 04:37:12.330
And when Rawlinson, you know,
he's not the only one who read

04:37:12.330 --> 04:37:15.720
or even read it properly
but he gave his translation

04:37:15.720 --> 04:37:20.280
to Mohammad Shah Qajar who was
absolutely ecstatic with it

04:37:20.280 --> 04:37:26.880
and gave orders to carve a
translation below Behistun

04:37:26.880 --> 04:37:28.180
in Modern Persian.

04:37:28.180 --> 04:37:29.480
It never happened.

04:37:29.480 --> 04:37:31.760
But he was so taken with this

04:37:31.760 --> 04:37:37.270
because this really showed the
antiquity and also the reach.

04:37:37.270 --> 04:37:40.450
Again, if you put it
into the context of 19 --

04:37:40.450 --> 04:37:43.140
early 19th century history

04:37:43.140 --> 04:37:47.380
and how Persia was
threatened on so many sides.

04:37:47.380 --> 04:37:49.140
They had lost territory.

04:37:49.140 --> 04:37:53.910
The country was verging
on bankruptcy

04:37:53.910 --> 04:37:57.590
and then practically
did become bankrupt.

04:37:57.590 --> 04:38:04.920
This was an amazing thing
to learn about for Persians.

04:38:04.920 --> 04:38:07.980
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
One more question?

04:38:07.980 --> 04:38:11.680
Go ahead. Or two more, okay.

04:38:11.680 --> 04:38:12.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

04:38:12.980 --> 04:38:15.400
I'm Laurel Gray, George
Washington University.

04:38:15.400 --> 04:38:19.910
I wanted to ask about those
magnificent Sassanid silver

04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:24.870
and gilt ewers that have
depictions of women dancing.

04:38:24.870 --> 04:38:29.330
I know every generation
sees things from the past

04:38:29.330 --> 04:38:31.390
through their own filter.

04:38:31.390 --> 04:38:34.920
And often you would say
that the inscription

04:38:34.920 --> 04:38:37.990
when someone is describing
let's say, dancing girls.

04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:42.660
But what is that current
attitude of scholarship

04:38:42.660 --> 04:38:48.200
because those are very precious
items and there's expense

04:38:48.200 --> 04:38:50.470
and craft in creating them.

04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:51.810
Are they dancing girls?

04:38:51.810 --> 04:38:53.110
Are they queens?

04:38:53.110 --> 04:38:54.410
Are they goddesses?

04:38:54.410 --> 04:38:59.130
I know that in a way for
later Islamic period,

04:38:59.130 --> 04:39:02.740
they would be shocking because
they were wearing jewelry

04:39:02.740 --> 04:39:09.420
and just jewelry in some cases
with some sheer veils and things.

04:39:09.420 --> 04:39:14.430
But when as someone trying
to reconstruct dance,

04:39:14.430 --> 04:39:16.330
we don't have a lot to go on.

04:39:16.330 --> 04:39:19.340
Usually it's very flat,
one-dimensional items

04:39:19.340 --> 04:39:20.910
or two-dimensional items.

04:39:20.910 --> 04:39:25.550
But that's a really important
key to try to understand that.

04:39:25.550 --> 04:39:28.870
What -- instead of just
dismissing it as a dancing girl,

04:39:28.870 --> 04:39:32.160
what can we look differently
-- more deeply?

04:39:32.160 --> 04:39:36.430
What is the status
of those items now?

04:39:36.430 --> 04:39:37.800
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: By the way,

04:39:37.800 --> 04:39:41.780
if you do not recognize the young
lady who's asking the question,

04:39:41.780 --> 04:39:47.860
she has been a firestorm
of dance in this DC area.

04:39:47.860 --> 04:39:51.880
She is the lady who has been
doing the Silk Road Dance Company

04:39:51.880 --> 04:39:57.980
that brings to the entire region,
Central Asian, Persian, Afghan,

04:39:57.980 --> 04:40:00.420
Turkic and also Arabic dancing.

04:40:00.420 --> 04:40:04.710
So she's asking questions based
on real love and interest.

04:40:04.710 --> 04:40:06.010
&gt;&gt; Judith Lerner: I understand.

04:40:06.010 --> 04:40:08.950
That's a very good
question [laughter].

04:40:08.950 --> 04:40:14.790
And one could do a whole
series of talks about it

04:40:14.790 --> 04:40:16.710 position:56%
because people have different ideas.

04:40:16.710 --> 04:40:18.540
I think they're certainly dancing.

04:40:18.540 --> 04:40:19.840
They're women.

04:40:19.840 --> 04:40:21.670
And they're scantily
dressed, if at all.

04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:22.970
And they are dancing.

04:40:22.970 --> 04:40:28.710
And it probably does reproduce
some kind of dances with scarves

04:40:28.710 --> 04:40:31.000
and which are still done today.

04:40:31.000 --> 04:40:35.400
But there are various
theories of what they represent

04:40:35.400 --> 04:40:40.050
such as Sasanian silver was
greatly influenced by the silver

04:40:40.050 --> 04:40:42.690
from the west -- Roman silver.

04:40:42.690 --> 04:40:46.440
And there's a whole --
the seasons, for example.

04:40:46.440 --> 04:40:49.110
You notice there are
four of them usually

04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:51.700 position:56%
and they carry different attributes.

04:40:51.700 --> 04:40:55.000
And so one theory is
it has to do with that.

04:40:55.000 --> 04:40:59.070 position:56%
Another theory is that it has to do
with the bacchanal and wine drinking

04:40:59.070 --> 04:41:02.100
and these ewers, of course,
were very special objects.

04:41:02.100 --> 04:41:03.460
They're not votive objects.

04:41:03.460 --> 04:41:04.760
They were used.

04:41:04.760 --> 04:41:07.420
Wine was kept in them.

04:41:07.420 --> 04:41:11.610
And for probably for
courtly banquets.

04:41:11.610 --> 04:41:17.070
So a lot of these themes
feed into each other.

04:41:17.070 --> 04:41:20.210
But for purposes of trying
to understand, you know,

04:41:20.210 --> 04:41:21.960
did they have dances like that?

04:41:21.960 --> 04:41:23.920
I would -- I would think yes.

04:41:23.920 --> 04:41:28.370
And that's why they're --
that's not why they're depicted.

04:41:28.370 --> 04:41:31.710
But certainly, that's part of
the feasting and the fun is

04:41:31.710 --> 04:41:36.640
to have these dancing girls.

04:41:36.640 --> 04:41:38.490
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Okay, we have
-- I have one more question.

04:41:38.490 --> 04:41:39.790
I'm sorry.

04:41:39.790 --> 04:41:41.090
We're running out of time.

04:41:41.090 --> 04:41:42.610
Go ahead. You go ahead and ask
your question and then I'm going

04:41:42.610 --> 04:41:45.380
to ask our wonderful conveners
and others to join us.

04:41:45.380 --> 04:41:50.410
Go ahead. He's bringing it
and dancing around [laughter].

04:41:50.410 --> 04:41:53.980
Speaking of dance [laughter].

04:41:53.980 --> 04:41:59.980
&gt;&gt; I know that many modern day
Zoroastrians believe in most

04:41:59.980 --> 04:42:05.470
of these post-Sasanian documents
and books which this panel

04:42:05.470 --> 04:42:08.320
and the previous panels
are referred to.

04:42:08.320 --> 04:42:11.860
And also many scholars
of Zoroastrianism

04:42:11.860 --> 04:42:15.540
and Iranian history also
rely on them because probably

04:42:15.540 --> 04:42:19.630
of the facility of translating
the language of those books.

04:42:19.630 --> 04:42:24.960
But they were all written
in the post-Sasanian period

04:42:24.960 --> 04:42:31.680
under the very repressive
Umayyad Dynasty and which tried

04:42:31.680 --> 04:42:36.960
to persuade people in the
Sasanian Empire to embrace Islam.

04:42:36.960 --> 04:42:41.370
And followed by the Abbasid one
where they tried to cajole many

04:42:41.370 --> 04:42:46.850 position:56%
of the people in the Iranian empires
[inaudible] to accept Zoroastrian

04:42:46.850 --> 04:42:54.230
or to accept Islam thereby keeping
the habits and the practices

04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:58.770
of the Sasanian court and
offering them prime ministerships,

04:42:58.770 --> 04:43:01.530
governorships and so
on and so forth.

04:43:01.530 --> 04:43:05.220 position:56%
They were also written and therefore
in a period where the [Inaudible]

04:43:05.220 --> 04:43:12.960
who wrote some of these books
were influenced either by Islam

04:43:12.960 --> 04:43:19.610 position:56%
or they felt that their own
security was going to be compromised

04:43:19.610 --> 04:43:22.210
if they wrote anything
which was not Islamic.

04:43:22.210 --> 04:43:23.750
In these circumstances --

04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:25.050
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Your
question, if you could --

04:43:25.050 --> 04:43:27.900
&gt;&gt; The question therefore
is that in this background,

04:43:27.900 --> 04:43:31.000
what is the authenticity of relying

04:43:31.000 --> 04:43:37.370
on interpreting both Zoroastrian
theology as well as Iranian history

04:43:37.370 --> 04:43:41.770
as many of the speakers
seem to have done?

04:43:41.770 --> 04:43:44.070
&gt;&gt; Samra Azarnouche: Well, I
guess the question is for me.

04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:50.550
Well, as I have tried
to demonstrate,

04:43:50.550 --> 04:43:54.150
for some very specific elements,

04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:58.550
we can say that it belonged
to the Sasanian period.

04:43:58.550 --> 04:44:03.040
But only when we can
point to a historical fact

04:44:03.040 --> 04:44:09.730
or to a geographical references,
or to a geographic reference,

04:44:09.730 --> 04:44:16.330
or to something that could have
a meaning only in Sasanian times.

04:44:16.330 --> 04:44:19.400
For all the rest, all the
theological knowledge,

04:44:19.400 --> 04:44:23.320
all the dogmatic literature,
we don't know.

04:44:23.320 --> 04:44:26.400
It could have been written
before or after Sasanian period.

04:44:26.400 --> 04:44:27.930
We have no clue.

04:44:27.930 --> 04:44:36.610
So and also I have to add
that this literature is --

04:44:36.610 --> 04:44:41.000
has very different genres.

04:44:41.000 --> 04:44:46.720
And we cannot treat apocalyptic
context like theological one

04:44:46.720 --> 04:44:49.700
like Zend text which
is the translation

04:44:49.700 --> 04:44:51.540
and commentary of the Avesta.

04:44:51.540 --> 04:44:56.440
They all have to be addressed
and commented differently.

04:44:56.440 --> 04:44:59.960
So basically, you are right.

04:44:59.960 --> 04:45:01.260
We don't know.

04:45:01.260 --> 04:45:05.960 position:56%
But for instance, in the apocalyptic
literature, it's very interesting

04:45:05.960 --> 04:45:15.250
because it's the genre in which
you can depict the present time

04:45:15.250 --> 04:45:17.280
but we're projecting
into the future.

04:45:17.280 --> 04:45:18.580
You say, "They will come.

04:45:18.580 --> 04:45:19.880
They will kill us."

04:45:19.880 --> 04:45:23.090
Or they're very destructive
and so on.

04:45:23.090 --> 04:45:26.630
But actually, you are referring
to the Abbasids, for instance,

04:45:26.630 --> 04:45:29.200
which are living at your time.

04:45:29.200 --> 04:45:33.130
So you see, there are also these
chronological problems inside each

04:45:33.130 --> 04:45:37.490
text because the authors
play with this,

04:45:37.490 --> 04:45:44.470
when it comes to, with
history actually.

04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:47.020
This is what I can say for
the Middle Persian that I know

04:45:47.020 --> 04:45:50.910
but I guess maybe other has
answers for other corpora.

04:45:50.910 --> 04:45:53.860
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Dr.
Azarnouche, would it be fair to say

04:45:53.860 --> 04:45:57.190
that this notion -- would it
be fair to say that this notion

04:45:57.190 --> 04:46:01.240 position:56%
that somehow, everything ceases
with the coming of Islam is nonsense

04:46:01.240 --> 04:46:05.110
because it obviously seems to
continue for centuries after.

04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:08.830
So there is the blurring of
line is because the culture

04:46:08.830 --> 04:46:11.960
and tradition they continue
in the Islamic period.

04:46:11.960 --> 04:46:16.270
&gt;&gt; Samra Azarnouche: This is not
only true for religious writings.

04:46:16.270 --> 04:46:18.340
Sorry but there's a noise on --

04:46:18.340 --> 04:46:20.070
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Yeah, guys.

04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:22.630
&gt;&gt; Samra Azarnouche:
And but it is also true

04:46:22.630 --> 04:46:25.050
for administrative documents.

04:46:25.050 --> 04:46:33.260
For instance, when you read Arabic
chronics, they tell us that well,

04:46:33.260 --> 04:46:39.950
the Persian continued to use their
language in a caliphate chancellery

04:46:39.950 --> 04:46:43.610
within the Muslim administration.

04:46:43.610 --> 04:46:47.730
So it is -- okay, we had no
information before reading this.

04:46:47.730 --> 04:46:52.410
I mean, we have only this
information by the chronic.

04:46:52.410 --> 04:46:53.810
But now we know that it was true

04:46:53.810 --> 04:46:56.450
because we have found
these documents written

04:46:56.450 --> 04:47:00.890
in Middle Persian dating
from the 7th, 8th century.

04:47:00.890 --> 04:47:06.540
There is a very large archive, the
Pahlavi Archive kept in the Bank

04:47:06.540 --> 04:47:12.900
of Library of -- I've shown
you one example earlier.

04:47:12.900 --> 04:47:16.200
This -- there are hundreds
of documents.

04:47:16.200 --> 04:47:19.060
They have been written
during the Islamic times

04:47:19.060 --> 04:47:24.030
but are in Middle Persian.

04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:28.210
They refer to Sasanian
administration.

04:47:28.210 --> 04:47:29.910
There is no Muslim.

04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:32.890
No -- absolutely not
Arabic or maybe one

04:47:32.890 --> 04:47:36.140
or two Arabic words
actually but not more.

04:47:36.140 --> 04:47:42.400
The same happens, we guess that
our archives is from Central Iran,

04:47:42.400 --> 04:47:44.890
the region of [inaudible].

04:47:44.890 --> 04:47:50.020
Another archive in Middle
Persian is from the 8th century.

04:47:50.020 --> 04:47:52.400
It comes from [Inaudible].

04:47:52.400 --> 04:47:56.280
When you read this text, it's
like nothing had happened.

04:47:56.280 --> 04:47:57.580
No trace of Islam.

04:47:57.580 --> 04:48:00.320
No trace of any political change.

04:48:00.320 --> 04:48:04.220
So these two documents,
these two examples show us

04:48:04.220 --> 04:48:05.520
that what's the chronicle,

04:48:05.520 --> 04:48:07.420
what's the [Inaudible]
says is totally true.

04:48:07.420 --> 04:48:11.250
The administrative and
some other institutions

04:48:11.250 --> 04:48:16.300
in Sasanian institution has
continued during the Islamic times

04:48:16.300 --> 04:48:18.250
without any change.

04:48:18.250 --> 04:48:23.490
So it is true for -- this kind of
institution, it's probably true

04:48:23.490 --> 04:48:28.360
for religious text and other
structures of the society.

04:48:28.360 --> 04:48:29.660
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Okay,
thank you very much.

04:48:29.660 --> 04:48:33.010
I know you have questions but
the lovely speakers will be here.

04:48:33.010 --> 04:48:35.410
But we need to take care of
some administrative things.

04:48:35.410 --> 04:48:37.560
First of all, if you have
not seen the book display,

04:48:37.560 --> 04:48:39.220
it's back in the conference room.

04:48:39.220 --> 04:48:41.050
Please, after this, go there.

04:48:41.050 --> 04:48:44.140
We need to vacate this
room by 4:00 and get ready.

04:48:44.140 --> 04:48:47.600
But what I would like to do
is ask Touraj and Khodadad

04:48:47.600 --> 04:48:50.820
since they were co-conveners
to please come up.

04:48:50.820 --> 04:48:52.870
We would like to hear
something from you.

04:48:52.870 --> 04:48:56.610 position:56%
And then I'm going to ask all of the
moderators and all of the speakers

04:48:56.610 --> 04:48:59.030
to also join us for
a group photograph.

04:48:59.030 --> 04:49:05.140
Fatemeh, John, Mary-Jane, all of
the other speakers, please come up.

04:49:05.140 --> 04:49:07.770
And if you need to ask
questions, the speakers are here.

04:49:07.770 --> 04:49:09.800
You're more than welcome to
approach them afterwards.

04:49:09.800 --> 04:49:11.100
Thank you.

04:49:11.100 --> 04:49:12.400
&gt;&gt; All right.

04:49:12.400 --> 04:49:13.700
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Please, please, please.

04:49:13.700 --> 04:49:15.000
Yes, absolutely.

04:49:15.000 --> 04:49:17.670
So Khodadad and Touraj, if you
have something to say, please.

04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:19.970
&gt;&gt; Touraj Daryaee: Yes,

04:49:21.390 --> 04:49:24.750
first actually is professor
Azarnouche said,

04:49:24.750 --> 04:49:29.320
having gone to [Inaudible],
I also was on the vicinity.

04:49:29.320 --> 04:49:31.900
I went to [Inaudible] next door.

04:49:31.900 --> 04:49:34.700
It was a Zoroastrian
school on the grade school

04:49:34.700 --> 04:49:39.790
so we were relatively close to our
boards, but just on the borders.

04:49:39.790 --> 04:49:43.080
Yes, I think this was very good.

04:49:43.080 --> 04:49:45.510
I wish we had a little
bit more of the reception.

04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:48.700
At first, we weren't sure how to
think of this because there were

04:49:48.700 --> 04:49:53.000
so many people and we had to,
you know, make it interesting.

04:49:53.000 --> 04:49:54.910
I think, [Inaudible], this
was really interesting

04:49:54.910 --> 04:49:57.040
with Ida Meftahi's paper.

04:49:57.040 --> 04:49:59.500
You know, that really sort
of brought interest, I think,

04:49:59.500 --> 04:50:03.730
for people who are interested
in the past but also now as well

04:50:03.730 --> 04:50:08.350
as [Inaudible] work on
the, again, this reception.

04:50:08.350 --> 04:50:12.220
So we're hoping to
publish the volume.

04:50:12.220 --> 04:50:15.000
And it should be something
like the Sasanian world

04:50:15.000 --> 04:50:16.810
and its reception, I think.

04:50:16.810 --> 04:50:20.390
And we need more reception,
I think, as far as that goes.

04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:23.180
And Hirad, again, thank you
for all that you've done.

04:50:23.180 --> 04:50:24.480
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: My pleasure.

04:50:24.480 --> 04:50:25.780
Again, thank you.

04:50:25.780 --> 04:50:27.950 position:56%
Khodadad, the work you've been doing
recently, I would like to plug this

04:50:27.950 --> 04:50:30.210
in as a Persian specialist here.

04:50:30.210 --> 04:50:34.820
Judith, definitely the work you're
doing, we've looked this time

04:50:34.820 --> 04:50:37.680
on the Sasanians and there's a
lot of work that have been done

04:50:37.680 --> 04:50:39.130
on [Inaudible] Achaemenid.

04:50:39.130 --> 04:50:43.650
Work on the eastern Iran, the
realm that you are working with,

04:50:43.650 --> 04:50:46.520
[Inaudible] -- what
is now Afghanistan,

04:50:46.520 --> 04:50:49.060
what is now Central
Asia, the Kushan.

04:50:49.060 --> 04:50:51.070
And the work that Judith
is doing right now

04:50:51.070 --> 04:50:56.890 position:56%
with the [Inaudible] really maybe in
a few years, we could potentially go

04:50:56.890 --> 04:51:00.350
and speak to folks and see if we
could have a talk that focuses

04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:04.730
on the eastern realm which
is really not worked on.

04:51:04.730 --> 04:51:08.290
The Central Asian, Afghan,
and the eastern side

04:51:08.290 --> 04:51:10.740
of Iran, the eastern [Inaudible].

04:51:10.740 --> 04:51:16.120
So I think of building on these
and let's maybe we can all talk.

04:51:16.120 --> 04:51:19.530
The other request I have is you
saw the books I have on display.

04:51:19.530 --> 04:51:22.740
I was only able to pool
a small number of them.

04:51:22.740 --> 04:51:26.780 position:56%
But a number of you wonderful
scholars, we do not have your works.

04:51:26.780 --> 04:51:29.630
Please work with me if we
can search the catalogue.

04:51:29.630 --> 04:51:31.480
If there are items of yours
that have been published

04:51:31.480 --> 04:51:33.270
that we don't have, we would love

04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:35.750
to get your material
for the collections.

04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:37.920
All right and that's it on my end.

04:51:37.920 --> 04:51:41.470 position:56%
I'm going to ask Mary-Jane and
Fatemeh, and John to please come up.

04:51:41.470 --> 04:51:44.020
And then all the speakers
also, please come up.

04:51:44.020 --> 04:51:45.620
Thank you.

04:51:45.620 --> 04:51:51.640
[Applause] Khodadad, if you would
want to say something, go ahead.

04:51:55.040 --> 04:51:56.340
&gt;&gt; Khodadad Rezakhani: I was --

04:51:56.340 --> 04:51:59.880
I wanted to just to be known that
the point of this whole thing

04:51:59.880 --> 04:52:01.910
as we talked originally
with Hirad was

04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:04.480
to show a bit of the
work in progress.

04:52:04.480 --> 04:52:08.220
And I think the selection of
the speakers that honored us

04:52:08.220 --> 04:52:12.690 position:56%
by showing up, very much showed that
people who are working on subjects

04:52:12.690 --> 04:52:14.050
that are being developed.

04:52:14.050 --> 04:52:19.590
So and things such as east Iranian
subjects are a natural continuation

04:52:19.590 --> 04:52:23.020
of these works in progress and I
thank everybody for their support

04:52:23.020 --> 04:52:24.630
and hope that this can continue.

04:52:24.630 --> 04:52:26.930
Thank you, [inaudible].

04:52:29.040 --> 04:52:32.060
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
