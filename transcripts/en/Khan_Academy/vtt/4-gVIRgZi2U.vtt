00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:02.595
- [Voiceover] In the last
video we did a quick review

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:04.342
of the exponential and what it means.

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:05.975
And then we looked in and figured out

00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:07.878
what the magnitude exponential is,

00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:10.609
the magnitude is 92 is equal to one.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:14.054
Now we're gonna look closely
at this complex exponential

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:17.887
as it represents a cosine,
a part of a cosine.

00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:23.754
Now we're gonna keep
combining some of our ideas

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:24.994
from the last couple of videos.

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:27.696
And you remember if one
of the things we did

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:29.604
is we used Euler's formula

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:33.678
and inside out and developed
an expression for cosine.

00:00:33.678 --> 00:00:35.928
So if I say cosine of theta

00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:40.273
I can say that equals one half

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:42.729
times E to the plus

00:00:43.998 --> 00:00:44.831
J theta

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.981
plus E to the minus

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:48.814
J theta.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.300
This is cosine of theta expressed as two

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.133
separate exponentials.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.734
And now we're gonna take
a really special step.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:02.712
I'm gonna put in an
argument right here of time.

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.032
I'm gonna say

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:05.532
cosine of omega T.

00:01:07.832 --> 00:01:09.262
T is time.

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:11.029
N is shape here

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.992
this symbol here is the lowercase omega

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:14.557
from the Greek alphabet.

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:16.514
And that's the frequency.

00:01:16.514 --> 00:01:19.097
So time is in units of seconds.

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:22.887
And omega is a frequency

00:01:22.887 --> 00:01:24.350
so it's in

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.605
units of one over seconds.

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:29.893
That's the units of
frequency are per seconds.

00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:31.661
And when these multiply together

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:34.314
we get dimensionless number right here.

00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:38.581
And we can take the cosine
of the dimensionless number.

00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.698
So what does this equal to?

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:40.615
This equals

00:01:41.648 --> 00:01:42.798
one half times

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:43.881
E to the plus

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.504
J omega T

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:49.050
plus E to the

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:52.336
minus J omega T.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.196
Well we make T the argument
of the cosine here.

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:01.040
T is the stuff that keeps
going up and up and up.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.663
The number T gets just
gets bigger all the time.

00:02:03.663 --> 00:02:05.310
And so we ended up with

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.024
a cosine wave formula

00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:10.398
I'll just to make a bad
cosine looking thing here.

00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:12.531
That's what a cosine looks like.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:15.161
And it keeps going and going and going.

00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:18.400
So we have an idea of what
a cosine wave looks like.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.195
The frequency determines how
fast this goes up and down

00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:23.563
or how often it goes up and down.

00:02:23.563 --> 00:02:25.087
Now what I want to do is I want to look at

00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:26.713
a really special thing.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:28.886
I want to look at what
is this thing right here?

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:32.734
What is this thing, E
to the plus J omega T?

00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:34.027
And what we see is

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:37.591
this cosine here is made
of two of these things.

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.034
So whatever these things are

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:42.528
I can make a cosine out of them.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.897
So now we're gonna really carefully add

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:46.480
E to the J omega T.

00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:50.249
What we just reviewed was

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.825
that this is a complex number.

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:54.408
Let's draw that complex number.

00:03:10.332 --> 00:03:12.679
So we're gonna put a number out here.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.414
We know it falls on the unit circle.

00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:17.547
We know its angle

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:19.648
is whatever is multiplying

00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:21.506
the J up in this exponent.

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:24.443
Whatever's up in the exponent
is the angle of this thing.

00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:26.595
So this angle right here

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:27.512
is omega T.

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:30.882
And we know the magnitude of this is

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:32.927
as we decided before,
the magnitude is one.

00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:35.711
That's why it falls on the unit circle.

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:36.817
Okay, so now look at this.

00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:38.939
Here's this number T that's
determining the angle.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:39.945
And that means, what?

00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:43.472
That means that the angle
is increasing with time.

00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:45.472
If time is equal to zero

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.215
the point is right here.

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:50.299
At time equals zero.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.992
Because angle is zero.

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:53.996
As time proceeds

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:56.353
the angle keep starts growing and growing

00:03:56.353 --> 00:04:00.520
and it basically keeps
growing and it keeps going.

00:04:02.282 --> 00:04:05.699
It comes back to here after
omega T equals two pi.

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:06.857
And then what happens?

00:04:06.857 --> 00:04:09.315
It goes, it keeps going around it again.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.077
And, this basically goes along

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:14.671
for as long as time goes along.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.203
So here's this number.

00:04:16.203 --> 00:04:18.206
Here's this complex number

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.665
moving along the unit circle

00:04:20.665 --> 00:04:24.534
in time, over and over and over again.

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:27.094
So this is a number that is rotating,

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:29.011
the number is rotating.

00:04:30.487 --> 00:04:32.306
So I can write here,

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:33.139
E to the J

00:04:34.672 --> 00:04:35.505
omega T.

00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:38.624
And I know that that
because time's up here

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:41.712
I know it's rotating in time.

00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:45.188
All right, now I'm gonna put
a different number on there.

00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:46.683
Let's put it over here say.

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:50.377
Actually let's start this number at zero.

00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:52.431
And I'm gonna call this number

00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:53.598
E to the minus

00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:55.875
J omega T.

00:04:56.943 --> 00:04:58.162
What does that number look like?

00:04:58.162 --> 00:04:59.014
That's this guy here.

00:04:59.014 --> 00:05:00.275
That's this one here.

00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:02.108
We'll make him orange.

00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:05.212
So at time equals zero is E to the zero

00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:07.974
or one, just as we would expect.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.844
Now as time gets bigger

00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:10.677
the angle

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:13.237
the thing multiplying J

00:05:13.237 --> 00:05:15.025
is minus omega T.

00:05:15.025 --> 00:05:17.980
And so the angle is becoming
more and more negative.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.397
So after a little bit of time

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.335
it's here.

00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:25.347
And after a little bit more time

00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:26.180
it's here.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.805
And what we notice is

00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:30.222
it keeps it rotates this way.

00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:33.239
This is what happens when you have

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:35.270
E to the minus J omega T.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.603
You rotate in this direction.

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:39.354
And it keeps going and going and going.

00:05:39.354 --> 00:05:41.975
So these two numbers are
pretty similar in behavior

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:44.858
except one rotates counterclockwise

00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:46.831
and the other rotates clockwise

00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:50.998
in our coordinate system
which is the complex plane.

00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:54.787
So in summary, if you see
either of these shapes

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:56.726
E to the minus plus J omega T

00:05:56.726 --> 00:05:59.059
or E to the minus J omega T.

00:06:02.293 --> 00:06:04.201
What pops into your head is

00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:05.868
a number that spins.

00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:12.553
So for me the simple idea is

00:06:12.553 --> 00:06:14.544
I have a number here and
I have a number here.

00:06:14.544 --> 00:06:16.759
They both spin in a complex base.

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.233
And to represent those
in mathematical notation

00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:22.021
I need this kind of notation here

00:06:22.021 --> 00:06:23.658
which is a little bit awkward

00:06:23.658 --> 00:06:25.201
but as I get used to it

00:06:25.201 --> 00:06:27.405
E to the J omega T is a spinning number.

00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:29.460
E to the minus J omega T

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.146
is a spinning number.

00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:33.544
This is a amazingly powerful idea

00:06:33.544 --> 00:06:36.063
and we'll be able to describe every single

00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:39.170
that happens using these kind of terms.
