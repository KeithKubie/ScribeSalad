IRE ADERINOKUN: Travelling to
Krakow has been really awesome.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.300
I don't think I would ever
have come to Poland in my life,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.360
except for having
an event like this.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.790
It happens pretty
much just once a year.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.070
You also can't really
overstate the value

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.220
of doing something like this in
the same room as other people.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.440
So everyone helps each
other, and it's just

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.390
really great that way.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.820
JEN PERSON: I think
that it is normal to be

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.820
a little nervous before
any sort of big event.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.840
But I'm hoping to take
that and sort of channel

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.920
into my excitement about
what I'm talking about.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.200
As a speaker interacting
with attendees,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.450
I get to share a
lot of my knowledge,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.190
and also I get to
learn a lot about what

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.106
they're doing with all
of our Google products.

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:45.576
This GDD event, there's
so much going on.

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:46.950
I would say that
my one regret is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.200
that you can't see everything.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.949
I think that I'm really
fortunate that you

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.230
can check out a lot of our
events that are recorded.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.040
So I can't wait to check
them out later on YouTube.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.790
HADI HARIRI: I love
the place because it's

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.520
such a vibrant
community of developers,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.560
and you get people
from all kinds

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.990
of areas, technological areas.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.570
You get Android developers
mixed with Cloud developers

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690
mix with frontend developers.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.280
And it really is a
good mix of everything

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.510
that Google is providing
for developers.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.920
SPEAKER: We're really excited
about the possibilities

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.590
for developers to build
some truly amazing things.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.940
