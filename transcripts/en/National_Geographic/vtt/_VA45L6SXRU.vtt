Brian Skerry:<i> How I wish
 everyone saw Bluefin Tuna</i>

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.010
<i> the way that I have.</i>

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.778
<i> For being underwater with them</i>

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.180
<i> I know of their greatness</i>

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.415
<i> and I am certain
 they possess abilities</i>

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.885
<i> and hold secrets
 we can barely imagine.</i>

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.653
( music )

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.555
( applause )

One of my more recent stories

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:27.059 line:0%
in the magazine;
in March of this year

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.829 line:0%
<i> the magazine published a story
 that I photographed about</i>

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.263 line:0%
<i> Bluefin Tuna.</i>

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.933
<i> This is a picture that
 I made in the Mediterranean</i>

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.102
<i> off of Spain where
 Bluefin are caught</i>

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.371
<i> in giant purse seine nets.</i>

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.040
<i> Methods of catching tuna
 like this</i>

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.575
<i> have been very destructive.</i>

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.345
They have actually resulted
in the collapse of tuna stocks

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.747
in the Mediterranean and
throughout the Atlantic...

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.583
with populations
being decimated.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:53.953
<i> And this is an image that
I made at the daily tuna auction</i>

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.622
<i> at the Tsukiji fish market
 in Tokyo.</i>

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:58.391
<i> Every single morning</i>

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.060
<i> the tuna bodies
 are lined up like cordwood and</i>

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.062
<i> auctioned off
 to the highest bidder.</i>

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.898
<i> It's really the lust for sushi</i>

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:07.099
<i> that has created this.</i>

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.268
You know,
I live in New England and

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.670
I've been on the water
most of my life.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.505
And I can remember
back in the early 70's,

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:15.742
fishermen catching Bluefin Tuna

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.076
and there was no market
for them.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.811
They used to call them
horse-mackerel.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.480
They considered them
trash fish and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.449
would bury them on the beach
if they caught one.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.184
There was really nothing
for them but once that...

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:29.088
that sushi craze sort of
took place and began,

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.957
the prices skyrocketed
and all of a sudden

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.692
the stocks began to plummet.

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:35.862
But this is what happens,
you know,

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.330
every single day. We can't
sustain this kind of thing.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.200
This animal now
has become the most valuable

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.702
animal on the planet.
A single Bluefin

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.805
has sold for over a
million dollars at this--

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.206
these auctions in Tokyo.

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.909
So you can imagine with a bounty
like that on their head

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.144
the future is probably
not very bright.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:53.546
There's actually
three species of Bluefin

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.748
but we were focusing
on the biggest and,

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.785
and sort of most magnificent,
the Atlantic Bluefin Tuna.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.687
<i> It's an animal
 that's quite unlike any other.</i>

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:04.791
<i> You know, these are animals
 that continue to grow</i>

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.359
<i> their entire lives.
 If weren't so efficient</i>

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.961
<i> at catching them
 there would be 30-year old</i>

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.429
<i> Bluefin out there
 that weigh a ton.</i>

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.299
These are animals that are
capable of generating heat

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.768
in their body. They are
effectively a warm-blooded fish.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.436
And because of that
they can swim

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.505
practically from
the equator to the poles

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.039
in search of their prey.

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.109
They criss-cross entire oceans

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.211
in the course of the year.
There's no predator on land

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.279
that covers
that kind of territory.

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.816
Um... you know,
they are truly amazing fish.

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.719
<i>But to find Bluefin in the wild,</i>

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.288
<i> I had to travel to a place
 where they are hunted.</i>

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:38.958
<i> And this time it was the Gulf
 of St. Lawrence in Canada.</i>

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.761
<i> And I would probably rather
 not see them caught at all,</i>

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.662
<i> but in small ports,</i>

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:46.332
<i> in Nova Scotia and
 Prince Edward Island</i>

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:49.435
fishermen head out
during their season

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.337
for just a very brief time

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.572
and they use only
a rod and a reel

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.007
to catch one fish at a time.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.042
<i> The season is very brief.</i>

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.178
<i> When I was up there
it only lasted for about a day.</i>

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.979
<i> They have extended it now
 a little bit longer</i>

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.582
<i> but it's still the same quota,</i>

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:03.916
<i> which is very low.</i>

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.651
<i> And it's essentially one man,</i>

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.819
<i> one fish.</i>

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.154
<i> As soon as they are caught
they are processed on the dock,</i>

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:11.257
<i> iced and shipped off to Japan.</i>

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:14.761
And in those weeks before
the fishing season begins

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.996
researchers also come here

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.132
to tag Bluefin.
They are trying to do science,

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.734
trying to look at their
migrations, where they go

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.402
and where they
migrate to and from.

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:25.771
<i> And they work with local
 fishermen as we see here</i>

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:27.073
<i> who'll catch the fish.</i>

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.408
<i> When they hook up on a giant
 Bluefin sometimes it takes,</i>

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:31.510
<i> you know, close to
 two hours to reel one in</i>

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.312
<i> and get it close to the boat.</i>

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:35.081
<i> And they've worked with
 a variety of tags</i>

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.115
<i> to put on these animals.</i>

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:38.484
<i> But the most effective
 or the most productive</i>

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.486
<i> over these years
 has been satellite tags.</i>

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.854
<i> They can tag the animal</i>

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:44.490
<i> and it can stay on for many
 months and then it pops off,</i>

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.625
<i> sends up a signal where
 they can retrieve it</i>

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:47.794
<i> and download the data</i>

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.962
<i> and see exactly
where this tuna has migrated to.</i>

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:52.532
<i> And it's been very valuable
 as a conservation tool.</i>

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.000
<i> And once they</i>

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.568
<i> catch the tuna,
 after maybe a two-hour fight,</i>

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:57.970
<i> they get it close to the boat</i>

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.838
<i> and then they have to
 get it up on deck very quickly</i>

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:01.607
<i> and do the science and
 work it up.</i>

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:02.908
<i> One of the researchers,</i>

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:04.576
<i> his job is the lip-hooker,</i>

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:07.045
<i> where he uses this big
 sort of metal hook</i>

00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:08.380
<i> to go through the bottom jaw,</i>

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.482
<i> which is the strongest</i>

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.784
<i> and then they very quickly
 get it up on the boat</i>

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.252
<i> and try to do up their...</i>

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.353
<i> their science here.</i>

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.622
<i> You can see the captain of the
 boat is aerating the fish,</i>

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:18.391
<i> he is putting water
 inside to aerate the gills,</i>

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:19.391
<i> keep it alive</i>

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:20.993
<i> and they are measuring it,</i>

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.728
<i> both length and girth.</i>

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:24.997
<i> They are taking
 pictures of the animal,</i>

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:26.899
<i> they are taking a DNA sample,
 blood,</i>

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.001
<i> all happens usually
 in about a minute.</i>

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.103
<i>It's amazing how well they work.</i>

00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:33.172
<i> So this was a GoPro video that</i>

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:36.675
<i> we did that just shows how
 this all happens very quickly.</i>

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.044
<i> So they measured as I said,</i>

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.645
<i> and you can see the
 size of these animals.</i>

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:41.480
<i> It's not the best
 with some shadows here,</i>

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.416
<i> but you do get a sense
 of the massive beast</i>

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:46.251
<i> that this Bluefin is.</i>

00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:49.054
<i> So, within,
 you know, 60 or 70 seconds</i>

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.357
<i>the fish is back into the water</i>

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:54.226
<i> and swimming off with
 that tag inside of it.</i>

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:57.596
I also wanted to show
another fishery for Bluefin.

00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:00.366
One that happens on the
other side of the Atlantic.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.635
And this is one that
actually dates back

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:03.869
thousands of years.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:07.339
<i> This is a view of a place
 called Barbate, Spain.</i>

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.141
<i> A little town in
 the Atlantic on the</i>

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.609
<i> southern coast of Spain</i>

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:12.578
<i> and it's one of many locations</i>

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:14.747
<i> that has done this very</i>

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.683
<i> old method of catching Bluefin
 for centuries.</i>

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.152
<i> It's a method called the</i>

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.819
<i> Almadraba Fishery.</i>

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.755
There used to be
many of these places.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.423
Today there is just
a handful left

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:26.191
and Barbate is one of them.

00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:29.462
But what they do is
they use a series of nets

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.831
to sort of passively
catch the tuna

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.332
as they are migrating

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.868
from the Atlantic
through the, uh...

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:39.004
Gibraltar Straits into
the Mediterranean

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:40.473
<i>and they get caught in this net.</i>

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.141
<i> There's sort of a line
 in the ocean there,</i>

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.576
<i> those are a line of buoys.</i>

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:44.777
<i> And those are the buoys,</i>

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.112
<i> those are the nets,
 so it's quite close to shore</i>

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.981
<i> that this all happens.</i>

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:51.116
<i> The way it works is the fish</i>

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:52.951
<i> once they hit the tail
 of that net</i>

00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:54.787
<i> they move through
 a series of chambers,</i>

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:56.055
<i> a series of rooms,</i>

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.656
<i> different nets and
 when they have</i>

00:05:57.656 --> 00:05:59.959
<i> enough tuna
 in the final chamber,</i>

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.161
<i> the "cámara de muerte",
 the chamber of death,</i>

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:03.462
<i> they sort of close it off</i>

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.898
<i> and then they begin
 lifting up the bottom</i>

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:07.800
<i> and they hold
 what's known as a "matanza",</i>

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.801
<i> the massacre.</i>

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.502
<i> And, here we see that
 very thing happening.</i>

00:06:10.502 --> 00:06:12.939
<i> These fishermen use these
 old wooden boats</i>

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.474
<i> and they form a square
 around that last chamber</i>

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:18.210
<i> and then they slowly begin
 muscling up those nets</i>

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.278
<i> and the tuna, you know</i>

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:20.779
<i> begin thrashing in very
 shallow waters.</i>

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.414
<i> We see a Bluefin right up here</i>

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:24.817
<i> swimming right up on
 the surface, almost full body</i>

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:25.885
<i> out of the water.</i>

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:28.888
<i> And then once they get
 the sort of tuna up there,</i>

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.724
<i> they hook them and
 bring them on this one boat</i>

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.458
<i> where they immediately
 bleed them</i>

00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.328
<i>and begin processing them and...</i>

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:38.197
You know, having swam with
Bluefin underwater

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:40.566
it's always a little difficult
for me to see

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.234
this kind of thing.
And I understand

00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:44.270
what they are doing
and it's a way of life.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.372
But in some ways
for me it was like

00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:49.141
seeing a crime unfold, you know.

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:51.610
I had such reverence
for these animals.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.545
I've always sort of wished

00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:55.247
that I could take
these folks underwater,

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:56.548
<i> very few of them dive.</i>

00:06:56.548 --> 00:06:58.117
<i> But I always wished
 I could take them underwater</i>

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:00.219
<i> to see Bluefin within
 its own element</i>

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:02.554
<i> and I have to believe
 it would change their mindset.</i>

00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:05.458
<i> To be underwater with these
 magnificent animals</i>

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.761
<i> is to witness
 the divine sense of nature.</i>

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:11.063
<i> They are the true
 thoroughbreds of the sea</i>

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:13.098
<i> with few if any equals.</i>

00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:14.566
<i> With streamline design
 that's been</i>

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:16.068
<i> studied by naval engineers,</i>

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:18.103
<i>they swim faster than a torpedo.</i>

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:20.339
<i> And likely posses
 physical endurance</i>

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.107
<i> that we can hardly fathom.</i>

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:23.575
<i> How I wish everyone</i>

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:25.710
<i> saw Bluefin Tuna
 the way that I have.</i>

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.413
<i> For being underwater with them</i>

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:29.782
<i> I know of their greatness
 and I am certain</i>

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.850
<i> they posses abilities
 and hold secrets</i>

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.952
<i> we can barely imagine.</i>

00:07:33.952 --> 00:07:35.287
Thanks very much.

00:07:35.287 --> 00:07:38.391
