00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.870
The antarctic ice sheet is DEFINITELY MELTING!
Here's a crazy idea: let's NOT wait until

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.559
millions of people are homeless before we
do something about it. Eh? Eh?

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:22.380
Hello folks, Laci Green here for DNews. When
it comes to the rising sea level, one of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.960
key players is our Southern buddy Antarctica.
Antarctica is a something of a neglected continent

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.320
because basically nobody lives there-- but
it is about twice the size of Australia and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.290
contains 90% of the earth's ice. The entire
continent is basically a 1 mile thick slab

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.440
of ice. If the whole thing were to melt, the
sea level across the planet would rise 200

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.320
feet. And humanity would be TOTALLY screwed.
Fortunately, we're only SLIGHTLY screwed.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.470
Multiple studies published in the journal
Science predict that we're looking at closer

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.391
to a TEN foot increase in sea level across
the planet by the year 2200. So hey! It's

00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:03.230
not 200 hundred feet...but 10 is still a lot,
even across the projected 200 year period.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.210
By the time your great-great-grandbabies are
walking the earth, around 29,000 square miles

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.020
of US land will be under water -- land that
is currently inhabited by over 12 million

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.700
people. Researchers at Climate Central say
that New York City, New Orleans, Miami and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.850
DC will be the areas that are most heavily
flooded. Various coastal cities in Texas,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.090
New Jersey, New England, Virginia, California
will also be severely affected. In Florida,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.409
the highest risk area, â…“ of all its housing
will go under, and because of what are essentially

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.720
holes in Florida's bedrock, levees and seawalls
will be useless. On a global scale, thirteen

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.670
of the world's largest cities and about 25%
of humanity rests in coastal areas that will

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.759
be affected. Some inhabited islands, like
the Maldives, are projected to go underwater

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.509
completely. Of course, this kind of rise also
poses a great threat for severe flooding during

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.510
storms like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane
Sandy. Plus tsunami zones from earthquakes

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.479
will extend much further back into the land.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.770
BUT! Before you freak, keep in mind that this
is something that will happen SLOWLY, over

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.810
time. It's not an overnight thing. The melt
predicted is also not reversible, it's gonna

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.959
happen, so cities will need to figure out
how they will handle the physical and economic

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.410
impacts -- a process that begins by scientists
and policymakers working together and asking

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.879
the right questions to get started. The American
Geophysical Union is already asking: alright

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.440
guys, what's our approach here? Should we
build up our seawalls? Should we start to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.730
zone future buildings and real estate further
up on the land? How will this affect our economy?

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.810
To prevent even more sea level rising, we
should also be seriously thinking about what

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.819
role humans play in preventing more ice melting.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.900
The common response to this kind of news is
usually fear (OH MY GOD!) followed by apathy

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.500
(I DON'T CARE!). I'd argue that the proper
response isn't fear or apathy at all -- it's

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.940
action. Action in the form of prevention and
adaptation. Time to roll up those sleeves

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.099
and get to work. What do you think? Tell me
about it down below and I'll see you next

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.019
time with more science updates.
