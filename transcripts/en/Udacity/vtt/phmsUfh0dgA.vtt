00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:02.020
&gt;&gt; All right, so here, here is, here's a table of

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.220
examples with the input pattern and the actual output pattern of the

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.260
hypothesis we're looking for. But I'm not going to tell you the

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.060
hypothesis, you have to figure it out. So the way you're going to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.520
do that is, by figuring out for each variable, does it

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.570
appear in the conjunction in its positive form, in its negative form

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.800
or it's not there at all? For example if you want to

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.490
say the hypothesis is X1 and not X5, you would write something

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.730
like X1 and not X5, and the other ones are all absent.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.870
And just to be clear Charles, I, I've picked this particular set

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.940
of examples so that, you particularly, Charles Isbell PhD, would have the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.870
best chance of figuring out the hypothesis with the smallest number of examples.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.080
&gt;&gt; I appreciate that.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.050
&gt;&gt; Go.
