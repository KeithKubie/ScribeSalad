there yeah I know how the solar flares

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
there yeah I know how the solar flares
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.210
there yeah I know how the solar flares
work so back in this happens about once

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
work so back in this happens about once
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.820

a significant enough solar flare so that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
a significant enough solar flare so that

power grid in 1985 and knocked out the
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340
power grid in 1985 and knocked out the
whole Northeast Corridor and so they

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
whole Northeast Corridor and so they
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.020
whole Northeast Corridor and so they
figure those things are about 1 in a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
figure those things are about 1 in a
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.389
figure those things are about 1 in a
century event but those single while you
