Before we get started, I want to be clear about

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.980
what we're not going to teach you in this course. We're

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.950
not going to be teaching mobile frameworks like bootstrap, or

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.990
native app wrappers like PhoneGap. These are great tools, but we

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.170
want to teach the fundamentals that you as a mobile

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.380
web developer need to know first. Many of our coding examples

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.710
are centered around a single conference application, which we put in

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.680
a GitHub repository. Not every concept fits well in that app,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.730
so we'll be using other examples too. We're going to begin

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.630
with a lesson on mobile development tools, showing you how to hook

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.610
up the DevTools to your mobile browser. If you already know how

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.550
to do this, feel free to skip this section. Let's get started.
