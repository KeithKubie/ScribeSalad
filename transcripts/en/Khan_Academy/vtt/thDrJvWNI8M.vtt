00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:01.920
- [Voiceover] Whereas to graph the circle

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.579
x plus five squared plus y
minus 5 squared equals four.

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:06.612
I know what you're thinking.

00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:08.319
What's all of this silliness
on the right hand side?

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.059
This is actually just the view we use

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.717
when we're trying to debug
things on Khan Academy.

00:00:13.717 --> 00:00:15.458
But we can still do the exercise.

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:17.850
So it says drag the center point
and perimeter of the circle

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.895
to graph the equation.

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:20.137
So the first thing we
want to think about is

00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:22.075
well what's the center of this equation?

00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:24.270
Well the standard form of a circle is

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.611
x minus the x coordinate
of the center squared,

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.918
plus y minus the y coordinate
of the center squared

00:00:32.918 --> 00:00:35.391
is equal to the radius squared.

00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:39.268
So x minus the x coordinate of the center.

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:40.592
So the x coordinate of the center

00:00:40.592 --> 00:00:42.368
must be negative five.

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:43.796
Cause the way we can get
a positive five here's

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:46.083
by subtracting a negative five.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:50.018
So the x coordinate must be negative five

00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:52.816
and the y coordinate
must be positive five.

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:56.902
Cause y minus the y
coordinate of the center.

00:00:56.902 --> 00:00:59.236
So y coordinate is positive five

00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:02.800
and then the radius squared
is going to be equal to four.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.796
So that means that the radius

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:05.795
is equal to two.

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:06.840
And the way it's drawn right now,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.883
we could drag this out like this,

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:09.916
but this the way it's drawn,

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:12.377
the radius is indeed equal to two.

00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:14.200
And so we're done.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.999
And I really want to hit the point home

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:17.276
of what I just did.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:20.425
So let me get my little

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:23.167
scratch pad out.

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.107
Sorry for knocking the
microphone just now.

00:01:26.107 --> 00:01:27.558
That equation was

00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:30.717
x plus five squared

00:01:30.717 --> 00:01:34.593
plus y minus five squared

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:36.567
is equal to four squared.

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:37.786
So I want to rewrite this as,

00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:41.563
this is x minus negative five,

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:46.078
x minus negative five squared,

00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:50.142
plus y minus positive five,

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:54.495
positive five squared

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:57.084
is equal to, instead of writing it as four

00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:00.404
I'll write it as two squared.

00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:02.064
So this right over here tells us

00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:03.562
that the center of the
circle is going to be

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:05.142
x equals negative five

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:06.721
y equals five

00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:09.344
and the radius is going
to be equal to two.

00:02:09.344 --> 00:02:11.341
And once again, this is no magic here.

00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:12.806
This is not just, I don't want you to just

00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:13.642
memorize this formula.

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:15.359
I want you to appreciate that this formula

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.830
comes straight out of
the Pythagorean Theorem,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.374
straight out of the distance formula,

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.429
which comes out of the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:24.217
Remember, if you have some center,

00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:27.827
in this case is the point
negative five comma five,

00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:30.973
so negative five comma five,

00:02:30.973 --> 00:02:33.388
and you want to find
all of the x's and y's

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:35.768
that are two away from it.

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:38.658
So you want to find all the x's and y's

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.179
that are two away from it.

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.897
So that would be one of them,

00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:44.056
x comma y.

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:45.856
This distance is two.

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:47.319
And there's going to be a bunch of them.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.743
And when you plot all of them together,

00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:52.914
you're going to get a
circle with radius two

00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:54.284
around that center.

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:57.639
Plus think about how we
got that actual formula.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.115
Well the distance between that coordinate,

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:00.915
between any of these x's and y's,

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:02.760
it could be an x and y here,
it could be an x and y here,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.490
and this is going to be two.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.278
So we can have our change in x.

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:08.890
So we have x minus

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.550
negative five.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.147
So that's our change
in x between any point

00:03:13.147 --> 00:03:16.305
x comma y, negative five comma five.

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:21.299
So our change in x squared

00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:23.692
plus our change in y squared,

00:03:23.692 --> 00:03:25.424
so it's going to be y minus

00:03:25.424 --> 00:03:28.443
the y coordinate over here, squared

00:03:28.443 --> 00:03:30.242
is going to be equal to

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.785
the radius squared.

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:34.654
So the change in y

00:03:34.654 --> 00:03:36.310
is going to be from this y

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.412
to that y,

00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:38.933
this is the end point.

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:42.868
The end minus the beginning y minus five,

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:45.759
y minus five squared.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.789
And so this shows for
any x y that is two away

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.470
from the center, this equation will hold.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.258
And it becomes,

00:03:53.258 --> 00:03:55.579
I'll just write this in neutral color,

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.063
x plus five squared

00:03:58.063 --> 00:04:01.047
plus y minus five squared

00:04:01.047 --> 00:04:03.137
is equal to the radius squared,

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:05.006
is equal to two,

00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:07.929
or let me just write
that, is equal to four.

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.682
And let me make it, I
really want to, you know,

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:13.397
I dislike it when formulas
are just memorized.

00:04:13.397 --> 00:04:15.394
You don't see the
connection to other things.

00:04:15.394 --> 00:04:18.291
Notice we can construct

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:21.120
a nice little right triangle here.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.941
So our change in x is
that right over there.

00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:26.820
So that is our change in x.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.260
Change in x.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.384
And our change in y

00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:32.903
our change in y, not
the change in y squared,

00:04:32.903 --> 00:04:34.401
but our change in y,

00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:36.386
is that right over there.

00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:37.303
Change in y,

00:04:37.303 --> 00:04:38.661
our change in y

00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:40.623
you could view that as

00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:45.221
y minus, so this is change in y

00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:47.345
is going to be y

00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:49.755
minus five.

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:51.821
And our change in x

00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:55.223
is x minus negative five.

00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:57.533
x minus negative five.

00:04:57.533 --> 00:04:59.680
So this is just change in x squared

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.213
plus change in y squared

00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:03.592
is equal to the hypotenuse squared,

00:05:03.592 --> 00:05:06.274
which is the length of,
which is this radius.

00:05:06.274 --> 00:05:08.178
So once again, comes straight out of

00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:09.757
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:05:09.757 --> 00:05:13.025
Hopefully that makes sense.
