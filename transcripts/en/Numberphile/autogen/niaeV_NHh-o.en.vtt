00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
there's been in advance in a

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620
there's been in advance in a
 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.030
there's been in advance in a
sixty-year-old Matt's problem and a

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040
sixty-year-old Matt's problem and a
 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.020
sixty-year-old Matt's problem and a
maths problem which was related to the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
maths problem which was related to the
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.970
maths problem which was related to the
four color theorem which is something

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980
four color theorem which is something
 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.680
four color theorem which is something
I've mentioned before

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690
I've mentioned before
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.299
I've mentioned before
perhaps I should do a quick recap of

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
perhaps I should do a quick recap of
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.010
perhaps I should do a quick recap of
what the four color theorem was it's a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
what the four color theorem was it's a
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.210
what the four color theorem was it's a
similar sort of thing really

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
similar sort of thing really
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.189
similar sort of thing really
before color theorem said imagine you

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
before color theorem said imagine you
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.189
before color theorem said imagine you
had a map right and I'm just going to

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
had a map right and I'm just going to
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259
had a map right and I'm just going to
make up some sort of map here and the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
make up some sort of map here and the
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.750
make up some sort of map here and the
idea was I want to color in this map so

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
idea was I want to color in this map so
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.050
idea was I want to color in this map so
that neighboring countries are not using

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
that neighboring countries are not using
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.720
that neighboring countries are not using
the same color so if I could have this

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
the same color so if I could have this
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.819
the same color so if I could have this
in it might be kind of this bit here the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
in it might be kind of this bit here the
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.000
in it might be kind of this bit here the
idea being that any map can be done

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
idea being that any map can be done
 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.330
idea being that any map can be done
using four colors or fewer or in other

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
using four colors or fewer or in other
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.040
using four colors or fewer or in other
words there aren't any maps that need

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
words there aren't any maps that need
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.619
words there aren't any maps that need
five colors so that's true that's a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
five colors so that's true that's a
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.440
five colors so that's true that's a
facts right that was proven in the 1970s

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
facts right that was proven in the 1970s
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.330
facts right that was proven in the 1970s
but this problem that I'm going to talk

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
but this problem that I'm going to talk
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.029
but this problem that I'm going to talk
about today comes from the 1950s and

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
about today comes from the 1950s and
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.889
about today comes from the 1950s and
it's not something that's been solved

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
it's not something that's been solved
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.930
it's not something that's been solved
yet it's called the Hodge Widger Nelson

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
yet it's called the Hodge Widger Nelson

problem catchy name and I'm going to try

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969
problem catchy name and I'm going to try
 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029
problem catchy name and I'm going to try
to quote you what the problem is how

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
to quote you what the problem is how
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.310
to quote you what the problem is how
many colors are needed to color the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
many colors are needed to color the
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.460
many colors are needed to color the
plane so that no two points that unit

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
plane so that no two points that unit
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.310
plane so that no two points that unit
distance are the same color that's very

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
distance are the same color that's very
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350
distance are the same color that's very
formal so let me just break that down

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
formal so let me just break that down
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.249
formal so let me just break that down
what it really means is imagine I'm

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259
what it really means is imagine I'm
 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.929
what it really means is imagine I'm
somewhere on this map here so there I am

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
somewhere on this map here so there I am
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.429
somewhere on this map here so there I am
and I'm going to go for walk I'm gonna

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
and I'm going to go for walk I'm gonna
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440
and I'm going to go for walk I'm gonna
take a step and my step is going to be

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
take a step and my step is going to be
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450
take a step and my step is going to be
one unit so these might not be countries

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
one unit so these might not be countries
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.190
one unit so these might not be countries
anymore because I'm changing the scale

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
anymore because I'm changing the scale
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.010
anymore because I'm changing the scale
of this so we're taking a walk and I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
of this so we're taking a walk and I
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.649
of this so we're taking a walk and I
want to go one unit maybe that's one

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
want to go one unit maybe that's one
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200
want to go one unit maybe that's one
unit whatever that means and then take

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
unit whatever that means and then take
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.960
unit whatever that means and then take
another step and I'll take one unit step

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
another step and I'll take one unit step
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270
another step and I'll take one unit step
but every time I take a step I want to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
but every time I take a step I want to
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280
but every time I take a step I want to
step on to a different color I want the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
step on to a different color I want the
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.800
step on to a different color I want the
color to change each time I step so I'm

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
color to change each time I step so I'm
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660
color to change each time I step so I'm
gonna go for a walk I want to change the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
gonna go for a walk I want to change the
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969
gonna go for a walk I want to change the
color change the color we go change the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
color change the color we go change the
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.740
color change the color we go change the
color again I could step back to here

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
color again I could step back to here
 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.590
color again I could step back to here
change the color again change the color

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
change the color again change the color
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.249
change the color again change the color
again I could go over here but then for

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
again I could go over here but then for
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.700
again I could go over here but then for
example I couldn't walk this way because

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
example I couldn't walk this way because
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.679
example I couldn't walk this way because
if I take a one unit step over here I

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
if I take a one unit step over here I
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.569
if I take a one unit step over here I
wouldn't be changing the color so the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
wouldn't be changing the color so the
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850
wouldn't be changing the color so the
question is is there a way to color the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860
question is is there a way to color the
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.219
question is is there a way to color the
plane so imagine this as an infinite map

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
plane so imagine this as an infinite map
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.109
plane so imagine this as an infinite map
is there a way to color it so that I can

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
is there a way to color it so that I can
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.940
is there a way to color it so that I can
take a walk always changing the color

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
take a walk always changing the color
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.580
take a walk always changing the color
can I do it so I can take any

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
can I do it so I can take any
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.460
can I do it so I can take any
so any walk that I care to do I will

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470
so any walk that I care to do I will
 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.350
so any walk that I care to do I will
always be changing the color with each

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360
always be changing the color with each
 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.870
always be changing the color with each
step I take and that's the question no

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
step I take and that's the question no
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.850
step I take and that's the question no
matter what direction you no matter what

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
matter what direction you no matter what
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.670
matter what direction you no matter what
direction you pick no matter what walk

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
direction you pick no matter what walk
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.480
direction you pick no matter what walk
that I choose to do every step land on a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490
that I choose to do every step land on a
 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.430
that I choose to do every step land on a
different color well four starts there

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
different color well four starts there
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.110
different color well four starts there
is a solution to this as seven colors

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
is a solution to this as seven colors
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.270
is a solution to this as seven colors
work we can do it with seven colors and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
work we can do it with seven colors and
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.890
work we can do it with seven colors and
we can prove that really really quickly

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
we can prove that really really quickly
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.870
we can prove that really really quickly
you take the infinite plane we're going

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880
you take the infinite plane we're going
 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.180
you take the infinite plane we're going
to tile it with hexagons so I've got now

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
to tile it with hexagons so I've got now
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.100
to tile it with hexagons so I've got now
a little unit of hexagons I got seven

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
a little unit of hexagons I got seven
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.870
a little unit of hexagons I got seven
hexagons there and I've used seven

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880
hexagons there and I've used seven
 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.430
hexagons there and I've used seven
colors and now I'm just going to repeat

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
colors and now I'm just going to repeat
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.850
colors and now I'm just going to repeat
this over and over so I'm going to

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860
this over and over so I'm going to
 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.820
this over and over so I'm going to
repeat this so I'm creating a pattern of

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830
repeat this so I'm creating a pattern of
 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.040
repeat this so I'm creating a pattern of
colors with my hexagons now all I need

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
colors with my hexagons now all I need
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.160
colors with my hexagons now all I need
to do to solve this problem is imagine

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
to do to solve this problem is imagine
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.020
to do to solve this problem is imagine
the diameter of those hexagons was less

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
the diameter of those hexagons was less
 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.320
the diameter of those hexagons was less
than one slightly less than one that

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330
than one slightly less than one that
 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.200
than one slightly less than one that
means that every step I take would be on

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210
means that every step I take would be on
 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.510
means that every step I take would be on
to a different hexagon so I could start

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520
to a different hexagon so I could start
 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.060
to a different hexagon so I could start
here and every step I take would have to

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070
here and every step I take would have to
 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.040
here and every step I take would have to
be on a different hexagon which is a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050
be on a different hexagon which is a
 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.840
be on a different hexagon which is a
different color I just add one thing

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850
different color I just add one thing
 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.630
different color I just add one thing
though we wouldn't want to step from

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640
though we wouldn't want to step from
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.080
though we wouldn't want to step from
this purple hexagon on to the next

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090
this purple hexagon on to the next
 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.120
this purple hexagon on to the next
purple hexagon which means I want this

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130
purple hexagon which means I want this
 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.940
purple hexagon which means I want this
distance to be greater than one which

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
distance to be greater than one which
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.830
distance to be greater than one which
means the diameter of your hexagons need

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840
means the diameter of your hexagons need
 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.420
means the diameter of your hexagons need
to be less than 1 and greater than 0.76

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430
to be less than 1 and greater than 0.76
 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.280
to be less than 1 and greater than 0.76
right fine that's all you need to take

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290
right fine that's all you need to take
 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.070
right fine that's all you need to take
the hexagons to be point 9 and the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080
the hexagons to be point 9 and the
 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.600
the hexagons to be point 9 and the
problem is solved you can walk around

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610
problem is solved you can walk around
 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.449
problem is solved you can walk around
that hexagon infinite plane and change

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459
that hexagon infinite plane and change
 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.190
that hexagon infinite plane and change
the color with each step and even if I

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
the color with each step and even if I
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.040
the color with each step and even if I
wanted to step on one of the same color

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050
wanted to step on one of the same color
 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.449
wanted to step on one of the same color
couldn't do it even if you wanted to

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
couldn't do it even if you wanted to
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.280
couldn't do it even if you wanted to
even if you tried you can't because

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
even if you tried you can't because
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.560
even if you tried you can't because
those hex cons are chosen so that you

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570
those hex cons are chosen so that you
 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.380
those hex cons are chosen so that you
can't step onto the color try to annoy

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390
can't step onto the color try to annoy
 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.050
can't step onto the color try to annoy
cool what's the problem exactly what's

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
cool what's the problem exactly what's
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.060
cool what's the problem exactly what's
the problem so we definitely have a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070
the problem so we definitely have a
 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.310
the problem so we definitely have a
solution and it can be done for seven so

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320
solution and it can be done for seven so
 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.600
solution and it can be done for seven so
the question is can it be done for six

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610
the question is can it be done for six
 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.350
the question is can it be done for six
colors or can we do it with five colors

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360
colors or can we do it with five colors
 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.449
colors or can we do it with five colors
for three to write how many colors

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459
for three to write how many colors
 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.490
for three to write how many colors
what's the fewest colors we can do this

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500
what's the fewest colors we can do this
 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.920
what's the fewest colors we can do this
with so we can eliminate some of the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930
with so we can eliminate some of the
 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.780
with so we can eliminate some of the
answers really quickly you can't do it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790
answers really quickly you can't do it
 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.390
answers really quickly you can't do it
with two I'll show you that so imagine

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400
with two I'll show you that so imagine
 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.520
with two I'll show you that so imagine
we try to do it with two so all I'm

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
we try to do it with two so all I'm
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.590
we try to do it with two so all I'm
going to draw out is the walk I'm just

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600
going to draw out is the walk I'm just
 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.630
going to draw out is the walk I'm just
going to draw a walk so I'm walking in a

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640
going to draw a walk so I'm walking in a
 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.580
going to draw a walk so I'm walking in a

now let's try and color this wall so say

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350
now let's try and color this wall so say
 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.100
now let's try and color this wall so say
I start in the green region and then

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110
I start in the green region and then
 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.600
I start in the green region and then
take a step and I want it to change

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610
take a step and I want it to change
 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.300
take a step and I want it to change
color so now I've stepped onto a blue

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310
color so now I've stepped onto a blue
 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.250
color so now I've stepped onto a blue
region then I want to take another step

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260
region then I want to take another step
 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
region then I want to take another step
and I want to change color now I've only

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270
and I want to change color now I've only
 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.570
and I want to change color now I've only
got two colors available so I'm gonna

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580
got two colors available so I'm gonna
 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.330
got two colors available so I'm gonna
have to step onto a green region here

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340
have to step onto a green region here
 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.310
have to step onto a green region here
but that means if I want to step back to

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320
but that means if I want to step back to
 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.810
but that means if I want to step back to
where I started and there's no reason

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820
where I started and there's no reason
 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.970
where I started and there's no reason
why I can't do that I'm not changing the

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980
why I can't do that I'm not changing the
 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.530
why I can't do that I'm not changing the
color I'm starting from green to green

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540
color I'm starting from green to green
 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.760

two well about three well again there's

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590
two well about three well again there's
 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.500

an example it shows you can't do it with
 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.050

that shape is one unit so you're walking
 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.670
that shape is one unit so you're walking
around that path great but can I do this

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680
around that path great but can I do this
 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.070
around that path great but can I do this
with three colors let's start with green

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080
with three colors let's start with green
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.650
with three colors let's start with green
and then I move on to the next step well

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660
and then I move on to the next step well
 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.870
and then I move on to the next step well
it might be blue no one to step here

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880
it might be blue no one to step here
 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.400
it might be blue no one to step here
this has to be a different color so

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410
this has to be a different color so
 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.570
this has to be a different color so
let's have a different color that's have

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580
let's have a different color that's have
 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.670
let's have a different color that's have
red now if I want to step on to the next

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680
red now if I want to step on to the next
 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.909
red now if I want to step on to the next
one where it can't be red so that's make

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919
one where it can't be red so that's make
 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.400
one where it can't be red so that's make
it or you can't be green as well because

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410
it or you can't be green as well because
 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.750
it or you can't be green as well because
I don't want to step back to the green

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760
I don't want to step back to the green
 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.969
I don't want to step back to the green
so it has to be believed so that one's

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979
so it has to be believed so that one's
 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.800
so it has to be believed so that one's
pretty okay now what if I take another

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810
pretty okay now what if I take another
 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.620
pretty okay now what if I take another
step I think I've got a choice here I

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630
step I think I've got a choice here I
 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.909
step I think I've got a choice here I
don't I think I can choose my color I'm

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919
don't I think I can choose my color I'm
 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.800
don't I think I can choose my color I'm
gonna choose green here for the middle

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810
gonna choose green here for the middle
 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.770
gonna choose green here for the middle
now for this if I take one step up or it

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780
now for this if I take one step up or it
 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.890
now for this if I take one step up or it
can't be green it can't be blue so it's

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900
can't be green it can't be blue so it's
 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.710
can't be green it can't be blue so it's
red and if I step down to here it can't

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720
red and if I step down to here it can't
 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.170
red and if I step down to here it can't
be blue green or red so I need a fourth

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180
be blue green or red so I need a fourth
 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.080
be blue green or red so I need a fourth
color I can't do it with three it can be

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090
color I can't do it with three it can be
 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.600
color I can't do it with three it can be
done before and then that's where we got

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610
done before and then that's where we got
 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.150
done before and then that's where we got
to 16 years ago that's as far as we got

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160
to 16 years ago that's as far as we got
 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.190
to 16 years ago that's as far as we got
we showed that it can be done with seven

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200
we showed that it can be done with seven
 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.440
we showed that it can be done with seven
it can't be done with two it can't be

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450
it can't be done with two it can't be
 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.200
it can't be done with two it can't be
done with three so maybe it could be

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210
done with three so maybe it could be
 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.890
done with three so maybe it could be
done with four five six and seven we

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900
done with four five six and seven we
 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.719
done with four five six and seven we
know is definitely true and that's where

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729
know is definitely true and that's where
 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.110
know is definitely true and that's where
we were 60 years until recently so in

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120
we were 60 years until recently so in
 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.080
we were 60 years until recently so in
2018 an amateur mathematician found a

walk an example of a walk that can't be
 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.270
walk an example of a walk that can't be
done before which means he can only be

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280
done before which means he can only be
 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.879
done before which means he can only be
done with five which means four is not

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889
done with five which means four is not
 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.980
done with five which means four is not
the solution so we've eliminated four

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990
the solution so we've eliminated four
 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.270
the solution so we've eliminated four

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590
maths for fun and this was a problem he
 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.700
maths for fun and this was a problem he
was trying to do for fun and so he came

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710
was trying to do for fun and so he came
 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.950
was trying to do for fun and so he came
up with a walk that can't be done with

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960
up with a walk that can't be done with
 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.190
up with a walk that can't be done with
four colours and what he did is he took

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200
four colours and what he did is he took
 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.560
four colours and what he did is he took
this example it's got a name he's called

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570
this example it's got a name he's called

the most nurse bindle exchanged name and

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970
the most nurse bindle exchanged name and
 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.390
the most nurse bindle exchanged name and
he made copies of that which he fused

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400
he made copies of that which he fused
 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.250
he made copies of that which he fused
together so he fused together lots of

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260
together so he fused together lots of
 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.560
together so he fused together lots of
copies of this and he created this

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570
copies of this and he created this
 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.550
copies of this and he created this
monster this monster Network 20,000
