that's a hard habit to break when it
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.010

there are 7.3 billion people around
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.600
there are 7.3 billion people around
today but by 2050 there will be at least

today but by 2050 there will be at least
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149
today but by 2050 there will be at least
9 billion people there maybe 10 billion

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
9 billion people there maybe 10 billion
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.340
9 billion people there maybe 10 billion
people and so those people are gonna

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
people and so those people are gonna
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.889
people and so those people are gonna
have to eat and it's very reasonable

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
have to eat and it's very reasonable
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.139

that all of us will move increasingly
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.469
that all of us will move increasingly
toward a plant-based diet and it will

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
toward a plant-based diet and it will
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.530
toward a plant-based diet and it will
not be economical to raise cattle and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
not be economical to raise cattle and
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.770

sell meat that it may go that way just
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.080
sell meat that it may go that way just
with market forces all this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
with market forces all this
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.720
with market forces all this
side or all this included or think about

all this at once what would be great I
 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.759
all this at once what would be great I
will say as a science educator a voter

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769
will say as a science educator a voter
 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.490

inherently fair we would have it on

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680
inherently fair we would have it on
 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269
on oil and gas used in transportation
 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.740

we'd have it on the transportation that
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.300

the oil and gas used to take ships
 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.569
the oil and gas used to take ships
across the ocean so it would be a fair

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579

goods or agricultural products this is a
 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.660
goods or agricultural products this is a
big idea but when you have the fossil

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670
big idea but when you have the fossil
 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.479

fuel industry working so hard to

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489
fuel industry working so hard to
 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.479
fuel industry working so hard to
introduce doubt about climate change and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489
introduce doubt about climate change and
 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.759
introduce doubt about climate change and
you have the climate change deniers who

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769
you have the climate change deniers who
 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.890
you have the climate change deniers who
have been so successful getting the idea

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900
have been so successful getting the idea
 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.650
have been so successful getting the idea
that doubt that plus or minus 2% is

that doubt that plus or minus 2% is
 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.449
that doubt that plus or minus 2% is
really plus or minus a hundred percent

really plus or minus a hundred percent
 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.909
really plus or minus a hundred percent
it's been very difficult to get this

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919
it's been very difficult to get this
 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.890
it's been very difficult to get this
sort of thing like a carbon fee or a

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900
sort of thing like a carbon fee or a
 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.319
sort of thing like a carbon fee or a
methane fee put in place so I'm

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329
methane fee put in place so I'm
 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.860
methane fee put in place so I'm
skeptical of a conspiracy but I am I

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870
skeptical of a conspiracy but I am I
 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.839
