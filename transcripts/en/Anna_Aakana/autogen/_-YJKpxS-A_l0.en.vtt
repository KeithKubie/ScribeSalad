00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.600
Hey Chris.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.300
Hey!

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.100
All right boys she made it to the party.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.220
Let's navigate.  Phil, how does the battery juice look?

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.980
We're at 89%.  She used up some juice texting an Uber ride over.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.920
It'll have to do.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.500
Okay I've located 4 outlets in the living room in case she needs to charge.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.740
She might need to use her phone if she wants to look busy or coy.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.700
Good idea.  Who's this guy?  Is she into him?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.840
Hey Melissa!  You made it!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.720
Yeah.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.680
Aw, welcome.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.600
That's James he's a work friend.  He and Courtney just broke up.  But he's a Ginger.   Zero possibility.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.080
Copy that.  Lets get her out of there.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.580
How's it going?

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.320
Good good!  I'm going to get a drink.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.060
Oh yeah.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.900
What are we looking at boys?

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.300
We got white wine, some microbrew and tequila.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.800
Shots?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.940
So we're raging tonight?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.300
It appears that way.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.920
Shot shot shot shot shot!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.780
Get her out of there.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.820
No exits found.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.620
Oh my God he looks so drunk!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.760
Drunk levels rising.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.400
Dive!  Dive!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.460
Ugh!

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.880
Cute boy alert!

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.700
Oh, I'm detecting hormonal shifts.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.660
Give me a line.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.280
Searching.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.880
You're not even searching, it's in sleeping mode.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.380
Oh.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.480
Stupid.  You stupid idiot.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.760
You're fired.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.040
I didn't do it.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.360
You're fired.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.980
Get me a line, Phil!

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.980
I like your big muscles.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.780
Oh yeah.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.940
That was awful.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.180
I'm wasted.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.240
Uh ma'am, actually I think he's kind of into it.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.520
We need an emergency exit strategy.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.560
I need to sleep.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.400
My mouth tastes like Captain Crunch and beef jerky.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.460
*burps*

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.960
Uh.  Ew.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.160
Stop it Phil!  Swallow it.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.820
Whatever.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.600
Whatever.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.100
Hey guys!  I hope you enjoyed that command center sketch.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.940
We have a few more in the works for you.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.080
And I wanted to let you know:

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.260
October 6th, I have a show at the Ontario Improv and it's all of my favorite Asian female comedians

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.500
and of course Brad for diversity.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.680
And this is actually like a test show.  If it goes well

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.040
I may go on tour across the United States and possibly

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.120
even some other countries.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.580
So if you've always wanted to see me do some stand up

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.600
come to that show or any of these shows.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.620
I'll be doing all the jokes!

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.000
A few weeks ago I was asked to take part in JCPenney's campaign

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.180
that celebrated female empowerment.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.900
There were so many rad women on this campaign.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.940
They had like a computer programmer, a U.S. Air Force Officer, a fitness enthusiast, and so many more.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.460
And they brought me on as an advocate for suicide prevention.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.200
As you guys know, my sister committed suicide 8 years ago and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.820
since then I've been very vocal about how we can prevent suicide

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.820
how can we combat bullying and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.580
end all the stigmas against mental illness.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.920
And it's hard to try to find like a comedic angle for all this stuff but

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.220
I've always been a strong believer that the best way to have people think about your message

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.880
is to have them laugh first.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.940
So yay.  Thank you so much to JCPenney for having me on this amazing campaign.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.980
And for letting me keep this dope outfit.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.340
I've worn it like so many times since I brought it home.  It's really cool.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.840
I'll put a link to the LookBook down in the description below

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.060
and of course you can get all of these fabulous outfits at JCPenney.com

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.240

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.420
