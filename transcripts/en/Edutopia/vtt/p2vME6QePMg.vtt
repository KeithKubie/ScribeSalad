[Albano Berberi playing violin]

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:38.236
&gt;&gt;Albano: Music is
pretty much everything.

00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:41.336
I've been with music pretty
much ever since I was born.

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:43.606
I started out with a keyboard.

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:48.156
I was playing the keyboard
ever since I was around 5.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:53.236
They say by one year I was
able to play the demo pieces

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:56.136
of the keyboards perfectly.

00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:23.566
&gt;&gt;And then I started the violin.

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.056
&gt;&gt;And there goes a door.

00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:34.886
The screen output is minimal at best.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:37.626
Most of the game is
played by sound alone.

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:40.696
Now I'm just running
through a passage.

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:40.766
Whew!

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:46.786
&gt;&gt;Basically I just encountered
this mad scientist that goes

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:47.966
around stealing my things.

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:49.116
&gt;&gt;Student: Come on, Albano.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:53.986
&gt;&gt;Albano: If you have like sound
orientation skills, you can do it.

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:57.506
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Let's go to page 275
in our books real quick just

00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:00.776
so we can review that and then
we'll have some people come

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:01.396
up to the board.

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:04.766
&gt;&gt;C minor seven diminish six.

00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:06.686
&gt;&gt;Albano: Six of two.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And the
last one is in E major

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:15.126
and that's seven diminish
six five of four major.

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:19.706
So Albano, what did
you get for this one?

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:23.696
&gt;&gt;Albano: B flat, D flat, and G?

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:33.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: B flat from the key
signature, D flat and G. Good.

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:37.326
&gt;&gt;Richard : This sounds
a little strange

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:41.626
but in 2008 this is a
wonderful time to be blind.

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:48.756
Digital documents allow content
to be displayed in multiple ways

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:51.026
like hearing it, feeling
it with braille.

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:54.146
Students who couldn't
see a computer screen

00:02:54.146 --> 00:02:57.366
or see a text book page can
now listen to the textbook

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:00.206
or feel the textbook
in a braille version.

00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:02.966
Students that haven't been
able to use their hands

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:06.566
for writing papers can
now speak to computers

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.476
and have their speech recognized
and converted into print.

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:11.566
&gt;&gt;Answer, air pressure
prevents this from happening.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:11.696
Source-

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:14.196
&gt;&gt;Richard: The beauty
of universal design is

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:17.826
when accessibility features
are built into the environment

00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:21.726
or into an educational system these
features are usable by everybody.

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:24.526
&gt;&gt;Gerald: We're going to go
back and review the grid world

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:27.316
because the grid world is
a big piece of the AP Exam

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:29.466
which we have two weeks
to get ready for.

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:32.216
So today we're going
to make a dancing bug.

00:03:32.216 --> 00:03:33.886
&gt;&gt;Albano: We call it
Dancing Bug Runner

00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:36.886
when it should be Dance
Bug Runner maybe?

00:03:37.386 --> 00:03:38.706
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, yeah, you're right.

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:41.636
&gt;&gt;Terry: When he first came here
he couldn't speak any English.

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:42.866
He spoke Greek only.

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.536
In a year he learned
to speak English.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:50.006
He learned to read and write braille,
devoured anything I could give him

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:51.306
that had to do with computers.

00:03:51.516 --> 00:03:57.216
He just has blossomed with that and
it allowed him to be able to compete

00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:00.986
and to just be a part of high school.

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:02.946
&gt;&gt;Albano: Wait, should it be
in the code or in the folder?

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:05.216
&gt;&gt;Gerald: One of the
things Albano has here

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:09.176
on his computer is a program called
Jaws which reads to him what's

00:04:09.176 --> 00:04:12.526
on his screen and he's able to
do 90 percent of the work here

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:15.416
in computer science
using that Jaws program.

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:19.486
&gt;&gt;Gerald: And in fact I
think it actually helps him

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:22.876
in doing programming because it walks
through the program sequentially.

00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:24.826
It reads each and every line to him.

00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:24.996
&gt;&gt;Albano: ...

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:28.006
backslash, where did they put it?

00:04:28.406 --> 00:04:30.206
Oh there we go.

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:32.816
&gt;&gt;Gerald Bilodeau: Doing computer
programming is by sequential logic

00:04:32.816 --> 00:04:36.036
and so where other students
tend to get hop around and look

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:39.116
for quick solutions, Albano
works through it line by line.

00:04:39.116 --> 00:04:42.826
The other students in class here
they get confused a bit by having

00:04:42.826 --> 00:04:46.566
so many options on the screen whereas
if they got through the program step

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:49.286
by step sequentially as
Jaws reads it for Albano,

00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:51.266
I think they could
benefit greatly from that.

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:53.486
It would force them to go
through the program line by line

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:55.446
which is one thing the
students don't want to do

00:04:55.446 --> 00:05:01.326
and I'd love to have them do it.

00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:05.166
&gt;&gt;Albano: Oh I set to "H".

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:06.666
&gt;&gt;Gerald: It's set to "H", yeah.

00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:12.336
&gt;&gt;So what we're going to do first is
we're going to share the limericks.

00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:17.046
&gt;&gt;Albano: The assignment was to write
a limerick but I was kind of inspired

00:05:17.126 --> 00:05:21.196
so I wrote five verses
and then I went home

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:27.266
and wrote the keyboard line for it.

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:30.216
&gt;&gt;This is called "Albano's Tale".

00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:32.416
It's a rather self-ridiculing
limerick.

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:35.556
I hope you like it because
it was fun writing it.

00:05:35.556 --> 00:05:38.236
&gt;&gt;[Singing] "Oh there once
was a lad named Albano.

00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:40.136
It was said he played the piano.

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:41.016
So he sat and [inaudible] and started

00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:50.386
to clean it 'Let's spin
us a tune' said Albano.

00:05:50.386 --> 00:05:56.286
So Albano [inaudible] and instead
started trying to sway, as he tripped

00:05:56.286 --> 00:06:00.436
and fell flat and his spare
[inaudible] went blatt,

00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:03.476
was a sad and horrible thing."

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:13.816
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I want you to negotiate
by yourself that little curve

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.256
that goes around the rotary.

00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:18.686
There you go.

00:06:18.686 --> 00:06:30.676
&gt;&gt;Now just put the map
in your head, Albano.

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:34.136
We crossed Huntington
and we walked on Mass.

00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:36.836
Ave. Now we've crossed Westland

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:40.286
and we took a left turn
so what's behind you.

00:06:43.106 --> 00:06:45.116
&gt;&gt;Albano: So probably it
would be actually Mass Ave.

00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:45.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Excellent.

00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:58.946
&gt;&gt;It's like a spiral, it
goes all the way around.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:02.356
&gt;&gt;Albano: Oh my god

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:03.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It's funny.

00:07:03.586 --> 00:07:05.756
&gt;&gt;Albano: I'm trapped.

00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:09.876
&gt;&gt;This is almost a
fully capable computer.

00:07:10.356 --> 00:07:11.366
You can type in notes.

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:12.716
You can go online.

00:07:12.716 --> 00:07:16.626
I'm pretty much signed on
to AOL Instant Messenger

00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:17.816
as soon as I get home.

00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:19.536
&gt;&gt;Computer: Message transmitted.

00:07:19.776 --> 00:07:22.286
&gt;&gt;Albano: And let's see if he
actually says anything back.

00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:24.516
There's this game called WarPath.

00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:27.936
Dinosaurs from Jurassic Park
fighting in a fighting arena.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:33.146
&gt;&gt;The sound in the game is
detailed enough so that I know

00:07:33.296 --> 00:07:34.786
when I'm the one being hit.

00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:37.946
The movement is like
only backward and forward

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:42.446
so there' no way I can stray off
a field or something like that.

00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:46.996
&gt;&gt;Oh no you don't.

00:07:47.356 --> 00:07:56.856
&gt;&gt;He is just about dead.

00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:01.596
&gt;&gt;For more information on what works

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:05.546
