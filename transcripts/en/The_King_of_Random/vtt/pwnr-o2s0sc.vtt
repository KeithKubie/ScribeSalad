00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.610
What's up guys, thanks for joining us today in our previous video

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.489
we showed you how to build a body of a crossbow using a

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.929
2x4 some PVC for the bows and some paracord for the string well today

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.059
We're going to cover how to build the trigger mechanism

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.540
And how to build your arrows the trigger mechanism has two main parts

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.510
And we're going to be building those out of this 3/4 inch plywood

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.409
We also have a couple of wooden dowels and these have two purposes first

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.350
They're going to be used as the hinge points for the two pieces of the trigger

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.419
And then we'll also build our arrows out of them

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.059
We can't very well use our crossbow until it's got a trigger

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.880
So let's get started to get some basic measurements for our crossbow trigger pieces. I'm going to remove the two bows from the body

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.290
Now I'm able to lay the body of the bow down flat on the table which is gonna make this easier as I said before

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.169
The trigger mechanism has two main parts one of them is going to be a sort of wheel with teeth on it on an axle

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.530
And that's going to be what actually catches the drawstring when you pull it back

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.288
The second piece will be what we actually think of as looking like a trigger and that will be another piece of wood that's on

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.509
a hinge that stops the first piece from

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.029
Rotating it until we want to I'll draw out the shape of the first piece of the trigger on this piece of plywood but before

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.939
I do that I'm going to drill a hole into the piece of plywood

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.180
The right size for the axle the hole is going to come first because I need everything else lined up around that bowl correctly

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.470
I've got a 3/8 inch dowel so I'm gonna be using 3/8 inch drill bit to match

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.660
All right after a quick test our 3/8 inch dowel fits into that hole very snugly

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.779
Probably end up sanding down the dowel. Just a little bit to make it so it can spin a little more freely on that axle

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.470
Here we have the basic shape of our trigger mechanism the hole will be down

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.089
Inside the body of the crossbow this notch down here is where the trigger mechanism

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.989
Will stop this whole device from spinning until we want it to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.740
you can see that the notch on top is in front of our axis and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.060
The notch on the bottom that stops it from spinning is lined up with the middle of the axis

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.309
I'll do a rough cut to remove this whole block of wood, and then I'll start getting in the details and the curves

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.999
There we go, we've got that basic shape cut out

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.269
It's looking pretty good

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.229
since this little notch is what the bowstring is going to wrap around we want that sticking up above the body of the crossbow I

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.069
Now have this flat portion of the trigger mechanism lined up with the body of the crossbow

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.139
I'm just going to mark where that hole is

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.799
There we have it now. I'll drill that out on the drill press

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:41.649
I'm using a drill press rather than the handheld drill because it is important that the drill hole goes straight up and down as much

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.400
as possible

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.379
Now it's pretty good

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.749
Use a piece of this dowel and fit it through both the trigger mechanism

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.250
And the body here just to hold the trigger in place as we measure for the next piece

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.169
For all the moving parts to fit together

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.639
Well, we need to be pretty precise on how our next trigger piece fits into the first one

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.980
So I'm going to use this piece of paper so we can trace the exact intersection of where the two pieces meet now

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.449
I've got the paper lined up so the corner fits right into this first notch that was cut

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.759
Sort of folding the paper around the body of the crossbow a little bit, so we can tell where the wood ends now

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.649
We'll have our main trigger come down just a little bit below that first notch right about here

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.959
And we'll have it extend about an inch and a half long right about there

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.819
We know that we need our hinge point to be in the middle of this extended piece of wood

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:40.869
It shouldn't matter extremely precisely where but we want the whole hinge mechanism to be behind the first piece of our trigger

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.328
That's an approximation for it. We'll go

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.329
All right now. We know about where our hinge

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.069
Hole is going to go and we know that it lines up perfectly with the first piece of our trigger now

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.168
We can remove the piece of paper and finish out the shape of our whole trigger mechanism

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.589
I'm going to cut out the piece of paper with the drawing of our trigger on it

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.989
And I'm going to use some spray glue to adhere that to our 3/4 inch piece of plywood alright and once again

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.198
I'm going to drill out the hole first and then cut the rest of it out

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.700
With the first piece attached with the temporary dowel and the second piece all cut out with the hole drilled

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.579
I'm going to mark where to drill the second hole into the body

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.529
You can now see the basics of how the trigger mechanism is going to work when the bowstring is drawn back and behind this notch

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.370
It will be holding pressure

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.229
Which is pushing against our trigger?

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.769
When we pull our trigger it drops the bottom piece out of the way and the top piece is then able to swivel

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.739
Letting our bowstring fly and launch our arrow

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.630
Now we have our two pieces cut out and we have the holes drilled for the axles to make them work

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.169
But we need them to fit inside the body of the crossbow

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.190
Properly haul out space for our two trigger mechanism pieces inside the body

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.359
I'm going to use this drill bit to make two holes that go all the way through the 2x4 and then use a

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.180
Jigsaw to connect those two that should give us a nice slot all the way across just measuring how far

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.060
You need to have space

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.780
That should be in front of the first trigger mechanism very back of the second trigger mechanism

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.229
It's right about here

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:44.520
And out there so we need to remove a slot about that size for a trigger pieces to fit inside

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.000
Seems to be working pretty well

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.149
I don't have a very deep plunge depth on this particular drill so it's gone down as far as it's able so I need to

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.449
Now raise the platform up so that I can drill the rest of the way through

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.929
Build a fair portion of the way through but another problem

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.130
I have is that this drill bit is not actually small enough to fit through the hole in the plate

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.329
I'm just going to leave this hole started with the drill press and then I'll finish it off with the hand drill

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.249
Now I've got these two holes drilled out, I'm going to use a jig saw to cut out the gap in between them

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.439
There we have it we now have a hollowed-out portion where our two pieces of the trigger?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.139
Can swivel and function see that the pieces fit through pretty easily?

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.690
Got lots of good range of motion there

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.159
Everything we want with all of our pieces cut out and ready, let's do a test fit

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.510
I've got a couple of pieces of dowel

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.080
And I'm gonna sand them down in the middle so that our trigger pieces will swivel more easily on

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.359
There we go, that's swiveling just how we want it

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.409
Perfect tension on this tooth up here when I pull the trigger

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.110
It releases

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.350
There we go you can see the string is being held by the trigger

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.440
See what happens when we pull

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:32.339
Hey, that's what we want to happen perfect now that we know the bow is working and the trigger mechanism is working

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.730
Let's make an arrow and make it fit on the bow to start making our arrow

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.730
We'll use a 3/8 inch dowel

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.230
To measure the total length that we want it to be from the back of the notch and our trigger mechanism to about an inch

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.569
And a half maybe 2 inches in front of the crossbow

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.939
I know a hacksaw isn't really designed to cut through wood, but on small pieces like a dowel it actually goes very quickly

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.900
They just have to stick the price tags on so well

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.710
Now they got the price tag off

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.599
Let's add a knock to the back of our arrow a knock is the little gap that fits over the bowstring

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.299
Now that I have the knock carved into the wood

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.680
I'm also going to sand down the two different faces so that it fits on the bowstring more easily

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:19.899
Now when our drawstring is around our trigger

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:26.439
You can see that at this point the arrow doesn't really have a way to reach on to the drawstring itself so what we need

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.259
To do is cut a small notch out of this piece of the trigger

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:39.669
With the notch cut our arrow can now fit onto the bowstring without the interference from the trigger mechanism

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.049
With the knot cut I'm just going to quickly hit the rest of the arrow with some sandpaper to smooth it down

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.459
One more step to make it slightly easier to use a crossbow as we want to carve a shallow channel

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.839
From the front of the crossbow to the trigger mechanism that our arrow can rest in

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.860
There we go the knock is cut into our arrow

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.550
We've grooved out a little bit of a channel on the body of the crossbow now

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.020
Let's add some fletchings or feathers to the back of our arrow now using tape with rubber gloves

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.920
It's kind of a nightmare

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.960
So I'm gonna lose them for a second as I make the fletchings for this arrow the design is pretty basic

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.720
We're just going to take a folded over piece of tape with edges left on it and attach that to the arrow itself

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.100
Fold this nicely in half

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.739
If we have our arrow fit inside the crossbow the way we want it with the nock pointed up and down we want one of

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.740
The fletchings to be pointing straight up

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.250
Obviously I have a little bit more tape here than as necessary trim some off

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.190
Now that doesn't look very much like an arrow

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.440
So let's take our knife and trim it down to smaller and give it a little bit of that classic feather shape to it

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.820
We've got one feather on our arrow. Let's add two more on the sides

00:10:19.109 --> 00:10:23.179
It's looking pretty good now. Let's add some weight to the end of our arrow

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:26.478
So it will fly point first every time now as a weight

00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:29.509
I'm going to try and put this screw into the end of the dowel

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:36.228
So I'm gonna pre-drill a hole and then add the screw now of course it is pretty tricky to drill perfectly straight into a dowel

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:39.709
I'm giving my best shot I

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:48.978
Tried to pick a drill bit that was almost as large as the threading on the screw

00:10:48.989 --> 00:10:51.048
So that well, it does still bite into the wood

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:54.228
It's not really pushing it apart any because I think it would just split if it did that

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:58.878
There we have it. It's not the most dangerous Arrowhead to ever made, but that's actually my goal

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:04.188
I don't want to make something that I'm accidentally gonna kill someone with so this will still give it some weight. It'll fly true

00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:08.869
It'll Pierce into fairly soft targets, but I'm not likely to really cut anything up

00:11:08.909 --> 00:11:12.589
I've marked off on this dowel a couple of spots that are the same width as our

00:11:12.689 --> 00:11:17.928
2x4 so when I cut those they should work as the hinge pieces for our trigger without extending to the sides at all

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:27.069
There we go that spins fairly easily just I want it, let's install this

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:35.240
Right

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.659
String this back up take it outside and see if it'll fire there we go. We've got our trigger mechanism working

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:45.008
We've built our arrow. We've got a target. Let's fire this thing at it. Oh

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:49.029
Oh

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:58.000
Short get a little bit more loft to it this time since I was a little low before

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.629
Shooting into the wind now - that's not gonna help

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.980
Ha hit the target again

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:16.569
Take that target almost the bullseye three two one oh

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:23.049
That almost went through a shot I've already taken

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:26.079
See that do that

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:29.049
Just turned into one bigger. Hole Oh

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.209
Oh, it's like half way worse

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:44.709
That steam hole again, that's a three-fer I still missed

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.990
Bullseye got it ha

00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:55.808
Turns out I am NOT very good at archery even with a crossbow all right

00:12:55.809 --> 00:13:00.249
We know that our crossbow works our trigger mechanism works our bow works and our arrow works

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:04.299
So I think the last step is going to be decorating this thing to make it look really nice

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.400
There we go we've got our crossbow

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.249
Fully decorated I used a rubberized paint on the bows

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.780
So hopefully that won't crack as the bow bends my wood stained everything that was wood

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:49.110
And I think this looks pretty slick now like we've got nice green wood nice dart boughs this thing looks great

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.770
Some of the design of this crossbow was shared with me by my friend Taylor

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.980
I want to give him a quick shout out Thank You Taylor there you have it now

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.489
You know how to build a trigger mechanism an arrow for your crossbow in a different video

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.660
We showed you how to make the body the bow and the strings so you put all this together

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.170
And you will have your very own

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:11.999
Functioning crossbow a couple of notes of safety that I hope you've already realized but never point your crossbow at a person or another living

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.900
Thing don't point it at things that can get broken or damaged point them only at designated

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.499
Targets when you're in a safe area, and you can't accidentally hurt anyone

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.489
This is not an ultra-powerful crossbow with a 100 plus pound draw

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:28.320
That's gonna shoot right through a lot of stuff, and it has a blunt tip so it's not the most dangerous

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.059
Type of bow and arrow in the world, but it can still hurt someone so if you build one be very careful with it

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.480
Thanks for joining us for this video today, and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:44.400
It just pops the foam at leas like assortment of foam cones on the ground everywhere ow

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:55.699
You

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.620
You
