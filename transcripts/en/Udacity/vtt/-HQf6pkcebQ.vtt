00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] I now want you to take each of these particles

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and simulate robot motion.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Depending on the heading direction,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
this might yield a different direction.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, each of these particles shall first turn by 0.1 and then move by 5 meters.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We already implemented something just like this for individual robot motion.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now I'd like you to apply this to the entire particle set.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, please go back to the code and make a new set P

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that is the result of this specific motion turning by 0.1

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and moving forward by 5.0

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to all of those particles in P.
