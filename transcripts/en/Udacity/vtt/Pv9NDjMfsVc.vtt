&gt;&gt; That's right David and that means that means-ends analysis doesn't not

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.180
always take us to what's the goal. Sometimes it can take us away from the goal.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.840
And sometimes means-end analysis can get caught in loops. Means-end analysis,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.220
like genetic and test, is an example of universal error methods.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.480
These universal error methods are applicalbe to very large classes of problems.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.430
However, they can rate few guarantees of success, and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.510
they're often very costly. They're costly in terms of computational efficiency.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.070
They neither provide any guarantees of computational efficiency, nor

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.300
provide any guarantees of the optimality of the solution that they come up with.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.130
Their power lies in the fact that they can be applied to a very large class of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.710
problems. Later in this class, we'll discuss problem-solving methods,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.740
which are very specialized problem-solving methods.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.650
Those methods are applicable to a smaller class of problems. However,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.770
they are more tuned to those problems and often are more efficient and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.932
sometimes, also provide guarantees over the optimality of the solution.

00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:45.470
Although means-end analysis did not work very for this problem. It in fact works

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.510
quite well for many other problems and therefore is an important AI method.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.320
Later in this class when we come to planning, we will look at more powerful

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.150
specialized methods that can in fact address this class of problems quite well.
