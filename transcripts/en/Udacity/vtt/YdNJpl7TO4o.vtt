00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.390
Martin uses the term stable to mean hard to change. Or, if you try to change it,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.290
it's going to have many implications. Typically, a module's hard to change if

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.080
a lot of other modules depend on it. Martin's stable dependency principle

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.110
suggests that you should depend in the direction of stability. In other words,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.210
no package should be dependent on packages that are more likely to

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.300
change than it is. This principle is similar to the previous one, that is, you

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.370
should depend downward and not introduce loops into the dependency hierarchy.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.040
Note that we usually think of the term stable as a positive term but Martin is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.490
treating it as undesirable. A corollary to this stable dependency principle

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.870
is Martin's Stable Abstraction Principle in which stable packages should be

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.000
abstract packages. The idea is that they're hard to change but easy to extend.
