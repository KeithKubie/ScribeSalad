00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:06.300
 Interviewer: As a message to viewers who are trying to get their lives together, 

00:00:06.355 --> 00:00:14.100
 young people trying to find their way through this increasingly dangerous minefield of politics that divides us today. 

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:22.500
 How do they know which rules of thumb and signposts they can use to see if they are on the right track? 

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:34.100
 Is what I learn, or what attracts me politically, inspired by what is best for my community? 

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:40.000
 Peterson: That requires careful thought and prayer, 

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:44.900
 if you want to approach it in a traditional way, you have to orientate yourself and determine your direction. 

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:48.535
 That is a process of self-examination: 

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:51.505
 What is your direction, where do you want to go? And the answer can just be 'nowhere'. 

00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:54.465
 That is why I created the 'Future Authoring Program'. 

00:00:54.465 --> 00:01:00.100
 You have to choose a direction, otherwise you are directionless. You turn around in a circle, 

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:03.085
 and you suffer, and so do the people around you. It is not a good solution. 

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:06.215
 Choose your direction, choose your goal. 

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:09.175
 You have to find out what it is, what works for you. 

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:12.225
 What purpose justifies all the suffering that you do in your life? 

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:15.165
 Begin to answer that question. 

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:18.045
 You will get better and better, it is a personal process. 

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:23.900
 And you must use your education to provide you with information. You also need a personal point of view. 

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:27.265
 If you don't have it, it will be handed to you. 

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:33.100
 And that may make you a puppet, a slave to other people's goals. 

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:37.400
 So I would say: what are the processes? 

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:41.100
 What I recommend to people is: clean up your room. 

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:45.075
 That's a good start. Organize the landscape immediately around you. 

00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:48.105
 Organize your time. Begin to control yourself. 

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:52.800
 See if you can stop saying things that you know are lies. 

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:55.855
 That is not the same as telling the truth. You are not that far in the beginning yet, 

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:58.865
 you're not good enough to even try it. 

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:02.700
 But anyone can stop saying things that they know are untruths. 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.800
 You can define that yourself. 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.700
 Interviewer: good, but in your definition of untruths this also means: 

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:14.300
 the higher level of moral inaccuracies. 

00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:17.345
 Peterson: indeed, it is a wrong way of life. 

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:23.300
 Interviewer: you can say something that is literally true, but in your view it is a 'black' truth, 

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:28.400
 morally speaking. You want to achieve a negative social goal with it. 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.545
 Peterson: I could also say: stop saying things that go against your conscience. 

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:38.000
 Instead of talking about untruths. Because what is true? 

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:42.800
 But what about this: stop saying and doing things that make you feel weak. 

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:51.300
 There how to just pay attention. Some things make you feel disintegrating, that is a physical sensation. Disintegrated and weak. 

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:55.185
 That is something Carl Rogers wrote about. 

00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.775
 He saw it as a part of ... 

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.145
 ... I have lost the word, it was something like integrity ... 

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:03.705
 but he did not use that word. 

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:08.900
 Some things increase your integrity and others disintegrate. 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.505
 You often disintegrate the things you do to impress other people. 

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:17.300
 Or because you are taking the shortest route. You escape your moral duty. 

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:20.925
 Your moral duty flows naturally from your goals. 

00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:26.200
 As soon as you have goals, you have moral obligations. They belong together. 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.255
 Because the moral duty prescribes what you must do to achieve your goals. 

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:34.400
 And if you have no goal, you are aimless. So that is not a solution. 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.315
 So with the goals comes the moral duty. And if you violate it, then you feel it. 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.265
 Then you know: I shouldn't do that. 

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:47.000
 That could be, it's not necessary. This is not necessary. 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.185
 But I would say you can start there. You start small. 

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:58.200
 Actually it is not small. Last night a girl came to me after my lecture, and that happens very often. 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.000
 She said: I started tidying up my room last year, and that has completely changed my life. 

00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:07.495
 She said: Your room is a reflection of your mind. And that is true. 

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:09.155
 That is absolutely true. 

00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:13.000
 As you are in your room, so is your room YOU. 

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:18.800
 People don't think that way, but that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if they think like that, it's like that. 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.800
 So clean up what you can tidy up and stop saying things that make you feel weak. 

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:27.065
 And then you will know what to do.
