The internet loves cats, but did you know
the print on the cats nose has a unique

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.799
rigid pattern just like a fingerprint?
Or that catnip really is like a

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.799
drug for cats?  One of its volatile
oils called nepetalactone enters

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.209
the cats nasal tissue and acts like an
artificial cat pharamone.  The sensory neurons are

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.740
stimulated and ultimately trigger a
behavioral and sexual response in the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.019
brain and body in around 80%
of cats.  Which must be nice considering

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.960
cats spend around 85%
of their day doing absolutely nothing.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
Drinking, eating, defecating and even
mating only take up about 4%

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.880
combined.  But when they are moving, they
always seem to land on their feet.  This

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.230
is because of something called the
"Righting Reflex".  Not only do cats have very

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.110
sensitive motion and gravity sensing
abilities allowing them to determine

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.700
which way is down, they also have an
extremely flexible backbone and no

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.570
collarbone.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.250
By bending in the middle and using fast
twitch muscle fibers they can whip

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.990
around without ever changing their net
angular momentum.  And did you know that

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.110
when a cat lifts its tail while being pet
it's really inviting you to smell it's

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.079
behind?

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.660
Cats use sent to communicate and this
exposes glands and pharamones holding

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.940
their signature smell.  A nice alternative
to a hug or a handshake.  They also

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.570
rub up against you to spread these
pharamones.  The glands on their face, tail and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.690
body help them to claim you with their
sent, while also leaving nearby cats

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.040
signals about their identity, sexual
availability and territory.  On the other

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.220
hand, cats bury their poop in an
attempt to hide its smell.  This evolutionary

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.010
instinct is not only to avoid attracting
predators

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.880
but to show that they're submissive to a
dominant cat in the wild.  In the case of

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.689
your house, this is your cats way of
recognizing you as dominant.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.810
Also in complete darkness cats can't
actually see, though they can see much

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.479
better than you and I in dim light. Cats have a layer of cells behind the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.340
retina called the "Tupetum Lucidum"
which acts like a mirror reflecting extra

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.549
light back at the retina.  In near darkness
this gives their eyes a second chance to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.909
pick up more light, but without any light
present they can't see anymore than we can.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.179
And if you ever see a cat with three
distinct colours, often called a Calico

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.090
or Tortoise Shell cat you can bet it's
female.  The fur colour gene is located on

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.310
the "X" chromosome.  This means females can have two colours in addition to white

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.509
because they have two "X" chromosomes.
 The male "Y" chromosome, on the other hand,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.180
does not have any colour genes, as a
result males will generally only have

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.999
one colour along with white

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.359
though in rare genetic cases it is possible for
them to have more.  Interestingly we still

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.799
don't really know why cats purr.  In fact
cats purr both during pleasurable

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.799
situations but also while they're
in duress or injured.  While many believe

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.509
it's a means to communicate passivity or
pleasure,

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.139
one interesting theory suggests that the
frequency that purrs occur at 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.319
(24 - 140 Hz) promotes healthy
bone growth and healing.  Because cats have

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.869
adapted to a lifestyle with frequent
rest and sleep, this may be a low

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.329
energy mechanism to promote muscle and
bone health.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.349
