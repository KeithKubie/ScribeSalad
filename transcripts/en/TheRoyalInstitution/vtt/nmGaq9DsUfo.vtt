00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.160
The earth is 4.6 billion years old,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
but we humans have been here for just the blink of an eye.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.660
200 thousand years, only.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.200
Compared to the vast length of time that the earth has been the earth.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.880
Bacteria on the other hand, have been on this planet long before us

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.360
In fact, for most of the time on earth,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.960
bacteria were here, they were here before us.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.080
They breed the life into our world,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.820
made it possible for us to evolve,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.700
and we know about the age of bacteria,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.380
we know they are about 3.6, 3.5 billion years old,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.640
the first bacteria arose.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.800
We know this because of places like this,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960
this is shark bay in Australia,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.460
you can see these beautiful structures.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.900
They are called stromatolites,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.180
and they are caused

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.880
by communities of bacteria that form thin mats,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.720
and these trap settlements,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.860
and then they precipitate Calcium Carbonate,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.120
and you end up having these stacks,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.780
and these are preserved very well.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.820
In the fossil record,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.560
so, this is a relatively young fossil,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.680
it is only 3.5 million years old,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.960
but you can see the tell tale patterns

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.620
of the stromatolite, and we've been able to find

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.660
stromatolites that are 3.5, 3.6 billion years old.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.220
So I think you are getting the picture,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.420
the bacteria are very old,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.120
and we draw a timeline like this,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.680
I struggled, because it is almost impossible to put humans

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.060
on the same timeline

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.940
as something that is 3.6 billion years old.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.560
I stuck it at the end there,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.240
a few pixels.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.700
200 thousand years ago,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.620
compared to this vast expanse of time.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.740
Now when we came on the scene as Eukaryotic cells,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.900
we were single celled organisms,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.360
we had a nucleus, felt pretty good about that.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.280
Bacteria did something very strange,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.580
they bestow bestowed upon us a gift,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.780
and that was that they invaded us.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.860
Physically invaded our bodies

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.760
and gave us the means to produce energy,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.720
and the first person who came up

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.220
with this endosymbiosis theory,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.580
actually was probably someone you have not heard of,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.020
Schimper in 1883.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.240
He thought, you know there are bacteria out there,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.500
that look suspiciously like those organs that we see in plants,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500
that are called chloroplasts,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.580
and people after him noted that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.580
well there are bacteria out there that look like mitochondria,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.940
which are the things inside us that make energy.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.060
So here is a bacteria that looks suspiciously like a chloroplast,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.340
and there is a chloroplast,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.680
I don't know if you agree with Schimper.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.540
And this is a bacteria called Rickettsia,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.840
which looks very much like a mitochondria,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.960
as you can see.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.400
So although a lot of people formulated these hypothesis

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.160
and developed them,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.780
Lynn Margulis, she usually gets the cut of this discovery,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.280
in 1967.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.020
well deserved,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.400
she gave some great evidence.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.260
But Schimper, nobody knows his name,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.000
and that is because, he put his theory

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.940
in a footnote.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.240
So the moral of the story is,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.260
if you have a great idea, don't put it in a footnote.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.060
Okay, so bacteria are ancient,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.380
they've been around, they're friendly ostensibly,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.080
they gave us energy,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.880
We've been living, and in love with them for so many years,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.920
but there are 5 million trillion trillion bacteria on this planet.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.160
That's more than the number of stars in the universe,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.600
if you can believe it.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300
and on our bodies, and in our bodies,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.280
not counting those mitochondria,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.540
100 trillion bacterial cells, right now, as we speak.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.960
That means that you are all

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.040
10 times more bacteria than human.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.580
If you find it a sobering thought.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.100
So we are vastly outnumbered,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.500
so given that, it's not surprising

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.980
that we often wrangle with bacteria.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.800
We have problems with them,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.200
they infect us, they make us sick,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.000
and they kill us, quite frequently,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and with alarming regularity.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.880
Okay, so we know that bacteria have been infecting us

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.000
for as long as we've been human,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.440
and before, animals get bacterial infections too.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.020
So bacteria have always been with us

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.960
and making us sick.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.760
The oldest known infection that we've been able to see

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.840
scientifically, is from 9000 year old bones.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.680
These are bones that were,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.920
this is brilliant actually,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.040
they were in an underwater city,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.560
off the coast of Israel.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.620
So these are underwater bones,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.520
a drowned city of Atlit-Yam.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.500
And you can see on these bones,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.700
the tell tale marks of Tuberculosis infection.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.680
They may just look like a bunch of holes to you,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.440
but if you are a scientist,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.740
I'm not one actually, that knows about this sort of thing,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.820
these are definitely TB holes.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.800
But you might say,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.240
okay,  I need more evidence than that.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.720
And despite the fact that

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.240
these bones were underwater, for 9000 years,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.160
they managed to pull out some forensic evidence,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.060
of micro-bacterium tuberculosis.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.560
What you can see here is a chromatograph,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.160
you see that 5 peak signature,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.400
which is a particular lipid that's only found in micro-bacterium,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.020
they found it on a woman's left rib,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.340
woman's right rib, and an infant's bone.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.900
And you can see the standard underneath,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.760
showing that those 5 peak superimpose.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.840
This is prove, that this lipid,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.780
found only in micro-bacterium tuberculosis,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.520
was present on these 9000 year old bones

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.520
that were underwater.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.580
That is an amazing story,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.400
science is amazing.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.420
This is the culprit, micr-bacterium.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.180
It's useful just to show this,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.180
because it shows you how small these things are.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.900
These things are 2 microns in length,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.040
and a micron is a millionth of a meter.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.420
And, despite the fact that they are so small,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.260
they can reek untold devastation on our species.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.000
and you probably all know about,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.020
2nd pandemic of bubonic plague,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.760
in the 13 or 14 hundreds,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.400
it's estimated, any where from 1/3 to 1/2 of Europe,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.320
depending on the statistics that you believe.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.160
And this illuminated manuscript from a contemporary bible,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.440
shows, basically, the fact that there is

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.400
really nothing you can do,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.840
if you have bubonic plague.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.660
You've got religion, you've got fairy dust,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.380
and you've got wishful thinking.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.280
But, they didn't understand,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.940
what caused it,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.500
they didn't know why they were sick,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.000
they didn't know how to cure it,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.820
they couldn't cure it,

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.900
they couldn't prevent it.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.900
It was a devastating disease,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.680
and this just goes to show you,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.040
how really devastating a bacteria can be.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.300
And I like this picture because,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.480
you can't get DNA or lipids off of this illuminated manuscript,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.880
but you can, the artists were so good back then.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.400
Look at the detail on these buboes,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.260
which are inflamed lymph nodes,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.020
characteristic of bubonic plague,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.520
and look at a modern day case, of bubonic plague.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.320
You can see, I think, that it really is bubonic plague.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.260
And this is caused by Yersinia pestis,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.640
which is a bug that lives in the hind gut of a flea,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.480
and this is actually inside a flea's hind gut right now.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.900
Great camera work there.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.720
So it is still with us, Yersinia pestis,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.560
this bacteria still causes the plague,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.120
in isolated places.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.060
And it's under control, for now,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.000
because of antibiotics, for now,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.640
hold that thought.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.480
Okay, so why are we all here,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.660
why aren't we all dead?

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.680
We should've been extinct millennia ago,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.760
this doesn't make any sense.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.380
Well we have defences,

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.460
you all know that we have a

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.060
very robust immune system.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.220
I'm teaching immunology to some students now,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.560
I think some of them are in the audience.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.120
Immunology is incredibly complicated,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.400
we have dozens and dozens of different cells,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.720
that patrol around, looking for invaders.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.980
We have specific proteins and compounds

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.300
that are specific for all these different bugs.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.400
You can get memories,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.680
so when you see the same bug again,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.760
you can fight it better.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.760
It's the most amazing system,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.600
but still, it's not enough,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.660
to concur a lot of bacteria.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.000
Here is the picture of an antibody,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.520
just to show you how beautiful these structures are,

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.880
these are these patrolling proteins

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.600
that can find bits of bugs that are alien,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.280
and go after them.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.420
Okay, so why doesn't our immune system do the job?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.720
we are highly evolved creatures,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.040
you know we are top of the food chain.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.480
Why can't we fight a bacterial infection alone?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.660
And the reason is,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.640
because of what's known as

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.780
cat and mouse evolution,

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.520
this is more coyote and roadrunner evolution.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.080
But, the basic truth is that,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.820
all though we come up with these elaborate defences,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.880
bacteria can evolve, very quickly

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.020
to outsmart us,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.100
to subvert us, to get around us.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.960
So no matter how many interesting and wonderful things

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.520
we develop in our immune system,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.580
the bacteria are always one step ahead.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.280
Okay, and I'd like to illustrate this concept of subversion.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.140
By showing you an example of,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.740
a bacteria that I work on.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.080
This is, I work in urinary tract infection,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.300
which doesn't sound so good at cocktail parties.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.720
It's a very serious disease actually,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.280
it is the most common infection disease with the elderly.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.440
And were it not for antibiotics,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.400
this disease would be devastatingly fatal.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.920
At the moment, it's under control.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.680
So UTI, is caused by several different kinds of bacteria.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.640
This is Escherichia Coli,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.200
E.coli, you probably all heard of him.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.100
He lives in your gut,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.660
he's friendly,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.840
he's suppose to be friendly.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.500
He digests your food,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.420
he comes out the other end.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.540
So E.coli, normally, is free living.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.500
So this means,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.760
they like to live on top of our cells

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.620
but they don't go any deeper than that.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.900
They hang out on the top of our cells,

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.980
and in our gut, this is all fine.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.800
But some times, these bacteria get into the bladder,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.060
I'll leave it to your imagination

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.020
why they get into the bladder,

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.680
but females have a bigger problem with this than males.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.800
It's because of the anatomy,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.340
and the proximity of these bugs to the bladder.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.640
So when the bacteria gets to the bladder,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.920
something really really strange happens.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.200
Very unusual, and it was totally unexpected

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.880
when this was discovered, about a decade ago.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.940
So, this is a micrograph,

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.540
this is from a lab in St.Louis,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.760
the ? lab.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.460
Beautiful micrograph of a mouse bladder.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.400
It's very smooth,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.600
well it's a bit bibbly bobbly,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.120
but, by in large it's quite smooth.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.300
You infect this mouse, with E.coli

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.400
up the bladder,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.560
look at that.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.760
This is what's called a pod.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.420
The scientists do have a sense of humour,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.900
this is technically called a pod,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.620
it looks very science fiction,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.840
and what it is,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.800
it's the bacteria,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.000
have physically burrowed into the bladder.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.560
Inside the cells,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.480
and they're going in there, they're regrouping,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.860
they're multiplying,

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.900
they're doing their evil things,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.140
they're getting really big,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.000
there is a huge colony,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.420
it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.680
and you can see,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.060
that it's so big that it's just distending the cell,

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.320
it's making a blister.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.580
Some people might have these inside you right now, actually.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.220
So, women get lots of UTIs,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.060
women get lots of infections like this,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.480
and between infections,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.800
they think they are okay,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.460
but a lot of them have these things going on.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.020
You can probably guess what happens next.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.940
These things can burst open,

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.060
and reinitiate an acute infection.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.220
So it's really heard to treat these bacteria.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.500
When they are in that pod,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.100
they are nice and safe,

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.720
the immune system can't get to them,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.560
antibiotics can't get to them,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.320
and they are all very cozy,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.400
and then they burst open.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.420
In my lab, we've shown that, other bacteria can do something similar,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.740
this is Enterococcus,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.800
which is very common urine pathogen.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.960
This is a red, side view of a bladder cell in red,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.200
you can see lots of blue bacteria

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.100
on the top of the cell,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.240
but you can also see in the side view there,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.620
there are lots of Enterococcus inside that cell.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.700
And they are doing very similar things to the E.coli.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.060
So this is a common strategy,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.560
that uropathogens use to evade the immune system in the bladder.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.680
And just for fun,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.280
I'm gonna show you this video.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.460
This is from, the Justice lab in the States,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.040
it's kinda cool.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.600
So this is the slow release pod,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.360
leaching these bacteria into the inside of the bladder.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.300
okay, now once they're in there, in the bladder,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.600
they're vulnerable again,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.300
the immune system can immediately get them,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.060
then who's gonna get them?

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.940
It's these guys.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.720
These are, these purple things,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.480
macrophages, monocytes.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.440
They're all fancy words,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.160
they mean, big cells,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.440
that eat bacteria.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.320
Hoover them up, they don't care what they are,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.080
they're tasty,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.500
they're gonna eat whatever is in there that's not suppose to be in there.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.800
This is MRSA bacteria being hoovered up,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.320
by a monocyte, but it could be anything.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.820
So when these E.coli burst out of their pod,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.680
into the bladder,

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.840
they're in trouble, because these guys are patrolling.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.340
So what do they do,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.980
well this is really interesting.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.520
So, some scientists and some colleagues have shown,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.720
that normally E.coli is a capsule shape,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.700
it looks like a tic-tac.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.420
And on the top panel you can see,

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.420
the characteristic tic-tac shape of an E.coli.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.480
But underneath, is what happens when that pod explodes,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.400
these bacteria shape shift.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.920
They actually elongate,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.860
and they form these long spaghetti like structures,

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.560
which have two functions,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.920
the first function is,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.240
basically mechanical.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.220
So if you were in the bladder,

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.820
and your host urinates,

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.600
it's like being in a firehose.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.820
And because you are so small,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.460
and the pee is so forceful,

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.500
so the spaghetti shape is been shown,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.840
to allow the bacteria to cling on in there,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.200
when the host is urinating.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.080
So, they don't want to get washed out,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.960
they want to stay right where they are.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.880
So that's an adaptation.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.960
The second thing,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.160
is truly amazing.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.360
The spaghetti shape appears to impart,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.500
almost a cloak of invisibility,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.580
to these filimentus bacteria.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.280
And this is a really cool video,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.420
from the same lab,

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.320
that showed the pod, the Justice lab.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.400
What you're looking at here,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.700
those dark, grey capsule shaped things,

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.140
are normal shaped E.coli.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.500
The big green thing,

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.580
has been false coloured in green,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.520
so you can follow it.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.100
It's a long filamentous form of E.coli.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.400
And the blue things,

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.960
are the big angry macrophages that are

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.500
chewing up the bacteria,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.280
or they are trying to anyway.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.800
So let's see what happens here, the video

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.060
so they are hoovering them up,

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.740
they're are hoovering them up,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.020
they're are hoovering them up,

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.540
hoover hoover hoover,

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.640
but they cannot seem to swallow that green thing.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.880
They try they try,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.480
They're either not tasty,

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.460
or they're invisible.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.020
or both,

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.020
we don't actually understand,

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.900
this strange thing that happens.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.520
But it's very advantages,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.720
if you're a pathogen.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.420
So, those are just two examples,

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.560
of strategies that bacteria use to evade us.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.580
And there are, countless others.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.200
Because there are so many different kinds of bacteria,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.160
and there are so many different strategies.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.600
I could talk for hours,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.660
I would never get through them all.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.940
So what I want to talk to you about now,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.880
is I want you to picture the world,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.100
if we couldn't control these bacteria.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.020
And this world used to exist,

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.740
so, 1900s,

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.240
United States for example,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.160
there are statistics suggesting that,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.300
from every 10 people who died,

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.960
3 of those people died from a bacterial infection.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.200
So 30 percent of people,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.380
who are dead, were dead because of bacteria, or complications from bacteria.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.260
That's a very high number,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.860
imagine what it would be like if you

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.720
you had a child who,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.900
fell on the pavement and scraped her knee.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.360
And the next day she was dead.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.620
Because she had an infection that you couldn't stop.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.680
Imagine that you prick your finger on a rose,

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.440
in the garden,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.700
and a week later you're dead.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.520
Because you just... there's nothing you can do.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.160
Nothing, imagine what that would feel like.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.700
And keep that in your mind.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.180
So, this is our saviour.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.500
Penicillin, you've all heard this story,

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.680
it's worth saying again isn't it,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.280
because Alexander Fleming actually gave a discourse,

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.320
I'm honoured to be here, where he once stood.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.220
He did it, had the famous accident.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.860
And this is actually a photograph of his petri dish.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.460
The famous petri dish that was growing bacteria,

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.340
and accidentally got a spore of mold on it.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.040
That's the thing on the top, the bid white thing.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.000
The small white things are bacterial colonies,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.480
and the big black hole,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.740
between them, is the zone of exclusion.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.700
where the bacteria could not grow.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.900
Because the mold was secreting something that stopped them.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.100
They killed them.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.120
And that was of course penicillin,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.700
his famous discovery.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.700
But Fleming really couldn't do anything,

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.860
Well, he tried, he published it,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.660
he tried to work with it,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.960
it was very complicated,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.220
and he eventually abandoned it.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.120
I just want to point out that,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.180
similar techniques are still used today.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.480
It's very quaint,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.480
but, the zone of exclusion is still used in diagnostic labs.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.540
What you're looking at here is the petri dish,

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.480
that has been spread with a sample from a patient.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.240
And each of those white disks,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.880
is impregnated with a different antibiotic.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.680
And then the plates are allowed to grow,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.900
and you can see what happens,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.140
some of the discs cause bacteria around them to die really well.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.260
And those bacteria are sensitive to the antibiotic,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.880
other parts you see are completely rubbish.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.160
They are doing nothing,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
and some are sort of mindle, fairly mindling,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.480
you wouldn't what to use that in the clinic either.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.080
So this is antibiotics,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.080
and the discovery.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.900
So, what is an antibiotic?

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.340
Well it is a chemical,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.040
its structure, it's a chemical compound

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.900
that's produced by a mold or bacteria another living organism.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.660
And, this is penicillin G,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.860
it's a beautiful molecule, it's very very simple.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.340
Some antibiotic are very complicated.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.920
This one is very simple.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.720
You can see the most salient feature here,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.500
I want you to look at it,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.680
is that 4 membered lactam ring in the middle,

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.560
I think you can see it.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.660
So this is penicillin G,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.860
It was a real bear.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.900
It was hard to isolate, it was hard to make useful.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.300
And Florey and Chain, shared the Nobel Prize with Fleming,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.440
For the discovery of penicillin,

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.820
because without those biochemists and their teams,

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.180
we never would've been able to mobilise this drug.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.360
And actually, if it wasn't for pharmaceutical companies,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.720
and sort of the war effort,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.920
we wouldn't have got penicillin out as quickly as we did, in the 40s.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.420
So that's penicillin,

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.520
how does it work?

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.300
well, it's a kind of a very nice strategy.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.300
So, what you're looking at here,

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.140
is the cell wall of a bacteria.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.560
So bacteria are enclosed by a rigid cell wall,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.900
and this cell wall needs constance maintenance,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.040
constant DIY.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.680
And that is because, bacteria are not static.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.840
They have to divide in two.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.200
So the cell wall is always shifting and changing,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.860
and you need somebody there to make sure that the wall is always sealed.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.980
And that's what this protein called DD-transpeptidase does.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.260
It's a long word there,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.880
it's just that grey shape.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.220
DD-transpeptidase, what it does,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.820
Is it morphs together the bricks of the cell wall,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.960
and it's always on duty,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.140
making sure that there is no holes in it,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.920
because if there are any holes or chinks, on this armor,

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.340
the bacteria will die.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.700
very important job.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.720
Okay, so what does Penicillin do?

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.600
Comes along,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.820
it's this, yea this orange thing in this picture.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.540
It simply docks the DD-transpeptidase.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.060
in a particular place,

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.320
and gums up the works.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.620
And that enzyme in now no longer able to maintain the cell wall.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.080
It's a simple, binding and blocking strategy.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.480
Very clever, so penicillin goes in,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.560
blocks all the transpeptidase, the cell wall looses it's integrity, and the bacteria dies.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.760
It's really nice.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.600
Um, that's just one antibiotic.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.040
We have lots of them, there's lots of potential targets.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.220
So if you're a bacterial cell, you'd have to do certain things to stay alive.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.600
And we know what does things are,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.440
you need to metabolise, you have to reproduce your DNA, make proteins.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.280
And, you do need to maintain those cell walls.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.040
So, this is a bit of a scary picture you don't need to be able to read it.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.080
This is just demonstrating, the different kind of antibiotics that we have,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.560
and where they are targeting a bacterial cell.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.220
You don't have to be able to read it,

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.400
just appreciate that there's a wide variety of antibiotics,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.100
all going after different aspects of what this cell finds crucial for survival.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.100
I have to point out, that the cell wall is a great target.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.240
because it's on the outside, it's like the ramparts.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.680
And also, it's quite difficult to get drugs inside some bacteria.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.700
So the cell wall is an obvious target,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.460
but there are other targets as well.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.940
So after the discovery of penicillin,

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:57.840
there was this guy, have you heard of this man, Selman Waksman?

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.220
Most people have not heard of him,

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.280
he is a hero,

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.600
he discovered single handedly, 20 different antibiotics.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.440
In the golden age of antibiotic discovery.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.100
Which is between 1940 and 1960.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.280
This guy was a soil guy, he liked the soil,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.480
he liked the bacteria in the soil, he liked the molds,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:21.880
he was a biochemist, he put together strategies and methods for isolating antibiotics from the soil microorganisms.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.380
Not making antibiotics himself, but finding natural products that were out there.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.680
And if it were not for this man, many of us might not be in this room

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.100
because our patents and grandparents wouldn't be alive,

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.060
he discovered Streptomycin, which is the most amazing antibiotic.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.880
And he discovered many many more.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.460
Selman Waksman, don't forget his name.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.820
So now what I'd like to do is, I hope I can read this cos I'm a little bit farsided.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.160
I would like to read you from Alexander Fleming's Nobel lecture,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.520
because it has a little story, that's very prescient and very pertinent.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.860
Okay, and this is because Fleming was already a little bit worried about this amazing discovery.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.280
He was worried that it wasn't gonna work for very long.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.760
So I'm gonna have to, I'm afraid I have to back off and read this.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:14.900
But I would like to sound one note of warning, penicillin is to all intents and purposes non-poisonous

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.660
so there is no need to worry about giving an overdose and poisoning the patient.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.840
There may be danger, though, in underdosage.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.080
It is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:34.600
by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them, and the same has occasionally happened in the body.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.280
This is in 1945, just want to remind you,

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.180
the time may come when penicillin can be brought by anyone in the shops

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.180
or off the internet

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.320
I added that bit,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.980
I'm sure he would have said it if he knew

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.860
and there is a danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself,

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.440
and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.640
make them resistant.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.360
Here's the hypothetical illustration.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.200
Mr.X has a shore throat,

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.920
he buys some penicillin and gives himself not enough to kill the streptococci,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.420
but enough to educate them to resist penicillin.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.580
He then inffects his wife, Mrs.X

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.760
gets pneumonia and is treated with penicillin.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.500
As the streptococci are now resistant to penicillin the treatment fails.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.160
Mrs.X dies.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.660
Who is primarily responsible for Mrs.X's death?

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:26.240
Why, Mr.X whoes negligent use of penicillin changed the nature of the microb.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.300
Moral, he says, if you use penicillin use enough

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.080
It's a brilliant story and I fell a little bit sorry for Mr.X,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.460
it's not completely his fault.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.680
But his fear, this is 1945 his Nobel lecture speech,

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.620
came true the same year, a little bit afterwards.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.800
As war starts to filter down from the fronts of WWII,

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.140
that soldiers were picking up resistant strains of gonorrhoea and syphilis,

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.540
from ladies like this.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.300
They look friendly, they look clean but they are not.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.880
So penicillin was released to the community as a drug,

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.460
and instantly resistance developed.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.180
Okay, how does this happen?

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.480
It's just evolution basically,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.040
you have a petri dish or body,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.120
infected with a white bacteria

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.960
one of these might mutate to become a resistant to a drug,

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.580
if you treat with that drug, all the white ones will die,

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.680
and the red ones will propagate.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.620
It's actually very simple, and it happens in the lab all the time.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.020
So what is the molecular nature of resistance?

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.000
It is different for every different antibiotic,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.500
because every antibiotic is different,

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.600
lets go back to our friend penicillin G.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.780
Recall it has that lovely four membered ring in the middle,

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.960
some bacteria produce an enzyme called β-lactamase.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.180
and β-lactamase has a very simple function,

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.280
it just snips that ring open.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.320
just like that,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.900
penicillin floppes open, it's no longer the right shape,

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.340
and it can no longer dock with DD-transpeptidase,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.580
and gum up the works.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.360
One little clip, penicillin is neutralised.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.640
And it's really easy for this enzyme, the gene that encodes it to be passed around.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.040
So β-lactamase is a serious problem.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:07.580
It has made a lot of penicillin family useless, to some patients.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.820
Now, there's more than one way to be resistant to penicillin,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.260
there's another way, and this is employed by MRSA,

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.800
which is of course the evil hospital acquired methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.720
which is all over the news,

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.040
and it is very common in hospitals,

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.580
and it's...some times has a β-lactamase,

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.040
but it has an additional defence against penicillin and their family members.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.420
What it does, if it says okay,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.060
you're gonna gum up my DD-transpeptidase,

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.580
um, I don't care, I'll make another one.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.020
I'll make a different DD-transpeptidase called MecA,

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.500
that's exactly the same as the original version, but it's slightly different.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.220
And then penicillin can no longer bind there,

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:51.980
so the only difference between MecA, and DD-transpeptidase is that region where penicillin binds and gums.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.000
So, it basically circumvents the whole problem,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.340
by producing lots of this other protein.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.940
So it's really devious.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:04.640
So antibiotic resistance, you hear about it in the news a lot, and we will talk more about that in a minute.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.100
You might think it' something that we caused.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.380
Because you do hear a lot that it's our fault.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.540
But actually, antibiotic resistance is ancient.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.240
just as ancient as antibiotics.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.180
Before we were even on the planet, there were bacteria communicating with each other,

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.200
fighting with each other,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.040
producing antibiotics, and producing antibiotic resistant genes,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.920
it was all going on before we even got here, so it's ancient.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.860
And the oldest antibiotic resistance gene that we were forensically able to identify is 30,000 years ago.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.160
and back then, that's what our ancestors were doing,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.000
they were making tools like that.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.720
And just as an aside cos I this it's interesting,

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.160
it may be that antibiotic are not actually weapons.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.100
they may be more communication signals,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.300
because it turns out, that in the wild, in the soil,

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.340
the doses of antibiotics that are in there are really low,

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.780
and they are actually no enough to kill things.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.600
so it could be their primitive form of communication,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.360
and antibiotic resistance might be a ping, you know ping back from that communication.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.760
Interesting aside.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.420
But we are able to exploit that, for now.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.640
To kill bacteria.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.000
So how did these genes get around?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.920
They do get around very very rapidly,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.720
how does this happen?

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.980
well there's a number of different mechanisms,

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.700
so these are two bacteria having sex.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.260
and they are connected by a structure,

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.520
and they are freely passing DNA back an forth.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.900
including resistance genes, probably.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:28.080
Bacteria can also pick up free DNA that's just been left in the environment when a bacteria dies,

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.900
it spews all it's DNA out,

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.820
other bacteria can just soak it up.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.180
Another really interesting way bacteria can get DNA  from other bacteria,

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.700
is through viruses.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.820
So, bacteria actually have their own viruses,

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.120
they're called bacteria phages,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.980
so if you are British, bacteria PHAges.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.700
I'm gonna call it bacteria phages,

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.060
so phages for short.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.700
So phages are basically glorified syringes.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:55.340
They go around, um, injecting DNA into bacteria and trying to kill them.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.560
And this is been going on for long before we were here as well.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.020
There all are ancient battles that we have just stumbled upon later.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.740
So, in doing this, sometimes they don't kill the bacteria, sometimes they just inject DNA from another bacteira

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.200
it's kind of like if you get a mosquito bite,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.340
and it's bitten your neighbour, and now it's coming, and it's bitten you and you might get infected by malaria.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.580
It's a very similar process.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:21.320
Okay, obviously, once you have a resistant bacteria in a patient or a person, on the tube,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.200
or on the bus,

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:27.500
you can spread that bacteria to your friend, your neighbour, your lover,

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.220
patient next door, the nurse who didn't wash his hands,

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.420
between patients

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.540
and this is another great way that antibiotic resistance can spread through the population.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.180
And obviously in hospitals it's a lot easier.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.380
So,  lets talk about hospital acquired infection,

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.280
this is a very complicated diagram, but I'll just walk you through it.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.780
There are two kinds of MSRA, is Resistant Staph aureus,

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.780
it's the Super Bug, that you hear about in the news.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.720
The one on the bottom, is in the community, it's actually not a hospital bug.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.140
It's resistant to methicillin, which is like penicillin pretty much.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.700
And it is resistant because it is of this blue gene,

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.840
down at the bottom there,

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.160
makes it resistant to methicillin.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.600
It's basically MecA, which I told you about already.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.480
So this is a sort of, relatively benign tamed form of resistant bacteria.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.940
But looked at the guy on the top,

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.540
this is from a hospital,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.860
he is got a very similar

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.880
genetic structure, but his got more things in it.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.920
It's a coset of resistance.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.300
Not only do you have methicillin resistance,

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.140
but you have another gene that can confers resistance to another antibiotic.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.360
You've got this guy here, confers resistance to 4 different antibiotics.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.600
So, you get 6 resistances with the price of 1, if you're infected with this guy.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.940
So this is why MSRA is so dangerous,

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.120
it can no only pass resistant genes, but it can

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.460
pass entire cosets of resistant genes.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.080
And bacteria are doing this all the time.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.980
Okay,  get's worse.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.300
It's gets worse.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.860
The other problem with bacteria, if they replicate so very quickly,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.060
and just to get your head around that,

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.720
I made a little video.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.400
In my lab, I put some bladder cells in the petri dish,

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.040
nice warm petri dish, with some medium.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.540
And I dribbled a little bit of E.coli on top.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.160
And I set up the time laps video,

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.520
and I just film them.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.380
So these bacteria, are dividing at their normal rate,

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.720
which is once every 20 minutes,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.760
and you can see that, with time, this is a 10 hour video,

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:20.300
the bladder cells below become invisible, they're so encrusted and covered with bacteria.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.500
They are just overwhelmed.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.680
Now there is no immune system in this dish,

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.560
and crucially there is no antibiotics.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.920
And this is what could happen in a patient,

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:33.760
if there is unopposed...if these bacteria are not opposed somehow.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.140
So, a colleague of my, Dave Spratt, his a microbiologist,

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.680
has a really nice way of thinking about it,

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.280
about how do you get your head around this time scale.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:49.420
Because the more you divide, the more you replicate, the more you can mutate, the more you can pass on genes, the more you can, get around us.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.940
He says, okay, 10 day ago, where were you,

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.100
you probably can remember, you look in your diary,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:29:00.180
10 days ago, was actually 500 generations for bacteria.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.280
Where were you 500 generations ago,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.300
anyone know?

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.680
You were in the Ice Age,

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:11.420
so this gives you a sense, of how quickly these bacteria can adapt.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.740
They just got all the time in the world compared with us.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.300
So, ladies and gentlemen, antibiotic resistance is accelerating.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.000
So it's been around for millennium,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.440
but, it's accelerating at a very scary rate,

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.680
and just to illustrate this,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.920
this graph is a little bit complicated,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.560
I'm gonna walk you through it,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.320
What we have is the time that an antibiotic was released,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.460
um, that's the blue triangle.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.060
or time it was discovered.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.900
And the, sorry that's the red.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.300
And in the blue triangle is the time that the resistance was noted in the population.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.000
You'll see penicillin actually was resistant before it was even released as a drug.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.600
Because it was in a laboratory, when they were working with it, they noted resistance.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.860
Penicillin did really badly,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.980
but actually, the next few to come along the pipe line were alright,

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.660
you had 10 years of grace,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.980
before resistance was noted.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.280
The one exception there is a penicillin family member,

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.580
so it's too similar to penicillin.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.720
The bacteria already knew that one.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.680
They've seen that joke before.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.800
So, what happened in 1980?

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.140
suddenly, for every new antibiotic that was produced

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.840
resistance developed very quickly,

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.340
within a year.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.880
Sometimes simultaneously.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.440
Suddenly that 10 year grace period was gone.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.040
What's happening here?

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.760
There're several reasons.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.680
One minor reason is that we try to get clever,

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.740
in the 80s and 90s, we thought well we understand science now,

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.680
you know, molecular biology, genomics,

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.100
lets design our own antibiotics, forget the things in the soil.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.840
Lets be clever and come up with our own,

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.260
you know we were rubbish.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.040
We made antibiotics, but their resistance developed like that.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.300
Because bacteria, they're all over that.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.620
You know, these are ancient molecules, you don't mess with them.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.000
The other thing that happened, I think you all know.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
This story, it's kind of sad.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.680
Antibiotics are being misused at an alarming rate.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.220
You hear this all the time, you hear this so much, that it almost doesn't sink in anymore.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.100
This whole antibiotics crisis thing, we hear it all the time,

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.960
and we'll get back to that too.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.240
We'll talk about that later.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.020
We can get antibiotics very easily.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.920
If you don't fancy taking your chances with a Canadian pharmacy online,

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.800
you can go back to your GP until she says yes.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.900
And people do do this.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.300
A study was published this year I think,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.700
that showed that, um, British GPs, often bow to pressure,

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.140
and prescribe antibiotics when they weren't necessary.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.120
And then once you get the antibiotic,

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.700
maybe you feel better in a few days and you stop taking the full course,

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.040
and that's the worst thing you can do,

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:37.560
because you are, like Mr.X and Mrs.X, you're educating those bacteria to resist you.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.720
If you don't take the full course,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.720
if you don't kill them all,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.700
some of them will survive a little bit,

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.360
they'll be a bit sick,

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.340
and then they'll evolve that resistance.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.340
And then the game is up.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.640
We also have, we are soaking our planet with antibiotics.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.260
Aquaculture, agriculture, life stock, there are antibiotics everywhere

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.700
they are dripping into the soil, they are in our water supply.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.660
They are educating the whole world's bacteria,

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.420
how to resist our weapons.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.400
It's like we are giving away the secret plans,

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.740
of our army, to the enemy.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.520
We just say, here it is, take it.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.700
Evolve resistance to it.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.540
And we now have, a perfect storm scenario.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:17.780
Where we have, many bacteria becoming resistant to all known antibiotics,

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.780
and the discovery pipe line is completely stalled.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.760
It's a little bit difficult to read this I think,

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.020
what you can see here, is that, in the golden age of discovery,

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.440
between the 40s and 1960s, 20 new classes were discovered.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.920
There has not been a new class of antibiotic discovered since 1987.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.220
Except for the one that was reported last week,

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.920
which I'll tell you about,

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.240
it's great timing.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.360
So, 3 new classes of antibiotics, since 1987.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.980
and keeping in mind it takes a very long time to go from mouldy petri dish, to tablet.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.700
It can take 10 to 20 years,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.020
to make a drug.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.300
out of a discovery.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.440
This is the discovery void, there has been no new classes discovered.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.860
It's scary, there's nothing.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.420
And this is mirrored by approval rates of new antibiotics,

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.200
as you can see here,

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.140
year by year, the number of antibiotics that are approved go down,

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:12.100
and actually, most of these antibiotics that were approved in the past few years,

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.340
they are not interesting new antibiotics,

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.480
they are just ripping off the same old penicillin,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.220
or the same old formula,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.400
they are just tweaking the side chains of it,

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:21.900
the chemists,

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.400
not making something novel.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.300
So the bacteria can evolve resistance to them easier,

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.300
cos they have seen something like it before.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.180
So, last year, you may have seen this alarming report from the WHO.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.560
I encourage you to read it, it's free online.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.560
Makes for some scary reading.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.380
Keeps me up at night sometimes,

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.440
it basically surveyed all the WHO regions,

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.800
and asked, okay you guys, in this particular country,

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.440
how may of your bacteria are resistant to X?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.080
how many,

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.440
and here's an example,

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.080
The top, you can't really read this but,

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:03.440
5 our of 6 WHO regions are reporting that 50% or more of E.coli are resistant to the front line antibiotics choice,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.880
In hospitals, 25% out of hospitals,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.200
so it's 50% of them.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.160
Here in the UK,

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.480
E.coli that causes urinary track infection, 50% of them are resistant to the front line antibiotic.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.940
So that's really scary.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.120
And actually, the future that we are all worried about,

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.840
is already here.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.260
I don't know if you know this, but there are now bacteria, that are resistant to all known antibiotics.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.000
This is only a very recent thing,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.320
if you look at the CDC report from 2013,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.700
It's claiming 25,000 Americans dying of infections that can't be treated.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:39.120
You're sent to the hospital, they do that panel I showed you with all the different antibiotics,

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.940
nothing is killing what's in you,

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.200
there's nothing left.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.520
They're cashed out,

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.160
there's nothing left.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.360
These people die,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:46.960
usually.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.420
and it's going to get worse and worse,

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.900
because the problem is growing.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.460
And we are not doing anything about it,

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.400
which is the theme of this talk.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.560
So why aren't we doing anything.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.780
Why is it so hard to make new antibiotics.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.300
And the reason is MONEY

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.460
It all comes down to money, antibiotics are cheap

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.600
you wouldn't pay 10,000 pounds for an antibiotic drug, like you would for a cancer drug.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.540
You don't take it every day like a Statin or a Beta blocker,

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.540
you take it maybe once a year,

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.540
once every 5 years,

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.620
and you take it for 2 weeks,

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.680
you don't take it every day,

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.760
for the rest of your life.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.360
So it's not a very profit orientated thing,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.680
and people like to trash pharma,

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.720
for not being altruistic enough to do things,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.860
but you know, without money, you can't do research.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.340
And the vast majority of drugs,

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.060
you develop as a company don't even make it onto the market at all.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:33.160
And the net, the stats here shows that basically the antibiotic is worth negative 15 million dollars,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.340
at the onset.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.960
It's not their fault.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.520
And also regulations, are really bad,

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.780
they have been really bad.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.040
There's a lot of red tape,

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.580
it's not easy to get new antibiotic onto the market,

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.540
there was a few scarcities a while back,

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.740
and there was an overcompensation,

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.140
and basically it's very difficult.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.560
And also, to be fair, as a scientist,

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.280
it's hard.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.700
We found all the easy fruit, the low hanging fruit,

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.920
Selman Waksman nicked them all, with his 20 antibiotics.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.720
Those were the easy ones, and it wasn't easy I'm telling you.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.580
It was hard.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.080
But antibiotics are hard, they are hard to purify, they are hard to make.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.800
They are hard to find.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.160
So we need new ideas,

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.380
and now we're quite desperate for new ideas.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.540
So what's coming down the pipeline.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.500
Well there's combination therapies, you probably hear about co-amoxiclav,

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.600
have you heard of this?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.080
co-amoxiclav, it's basically 2 antibiotics in 1.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:26.380
It's a penicillin like drug, but it also has an acid.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.600
That stops the β-lactamase from clipping that ring.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.900
So if you put them in together,

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.900
you restore the ability of the antibiotic to work,

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.160
It's a nice idea.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.820
This is kind of retro,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.840
so phage therapy, have you heard of phage therapy?

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.720
So, last century, we all decided in the West to go down the antibiotic route,

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.680
very expensive,

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:51.040
the Soviets couldn't afford it, so they decided to look at bacteria phages as a way to fight infection.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.320
And people have noted, that if you bathed in the Ganges, which is very polluted,

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.840
you got really sick, but then you were resistant suddenly,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.360
to a lot of different bacterial infections,

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.640
and people realised that phages were out there,

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.820
killing bacteria.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.080
And this is a really cool idea.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.680
So in Georgia, in the former Soviet Union,

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.800
you can go to the doctor, and get prescribed PYO bacteriophage.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.900
Which is a bottle full of bacteriophages.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.340
Really, I'm not kidding,

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.980
dozens and dozens of them in a bottle,

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:22.240
and it's so funny, because the bacteria are evolving resistance against bacteria phages very quickly,

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.400
they replicate even faster than bacteria do.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.840
so twice a year, these guys in Georgia, have to refresh the recipe.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.580
They have to go out and find the latest phages.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.200
Throw away the old bottles, make new bottles,

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.340
it's almost like our flu vaccine,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.400
every year we have to change it a bit.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.560
Twice a year, you've go to change these bottles.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.820
I think it's a really nice idea,

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.920
and a lot of people are looking into it,

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.480
because we are running out of other ideas.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.120
Okay, this is a little bit more science fiction,

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.580
this is CRISPER-Cas,

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.140
which is a fancy name, for a DNA that you can design,

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.700
that will go into a bacterial cell, and find an antibiotic resistant gene,

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.500
and nuke it.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.840
So suddenly, the bacteria is missing it's resistance gene,

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.480
Agh

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.660
and then you can kit it with an antibiotic,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.180
so you are basically curing them of resistance.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.880
This is a little bit further down the road,

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.040
because we have to work out how to get those DNAs into the bacteria,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.880
it's gene therapy so a little bit difficult.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.940
You have to design these really specific DNA,

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.380
you have to understand all biology,

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.480
but it's a really nice idea,

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.600
and this came out last year.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.220
To a lot of headline news which you may have read.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.980
But really, people are thinking you know we need to go back to the soil.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.340
There are so many bacteria out there, and I don't know if you know,

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.500
but, how many bacteria in the soil can actually be cultured in the lab?

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.960
Any guesses? Percentage wise?

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.340
1%

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.220
99% of moulds and bacteria, and things in the soil,

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.040
won't grow in the lab,

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.060
imagine how many antibiotics that might be hiding in there,

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.640
these treasures that we cannot grow.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.920
So this was a gift to Friday evening discourse speaker,

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.880
last week in Nature, a new class of antibiotic was discovered,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.640
after, you know, since 1987.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.380
and it was the most amazing paper,

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.300
it's a beautifully written paper,

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.960
it's actually quite technical, but

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.080
I think you might even be able to get a grim if you read it yourself.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.180
It's been made open access so every body can ready it,

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.540
cos it's so important,

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.420
A new antibiotic,

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.660
kills pathogens without detectable resistance,

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.380
how did they find this antibiotic?

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.220
They did, it was amazing, I wish I thought of this,

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.080
it's such as simple idea.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.380
They took a lot of soil bacteria,

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.080
instead of growing it in the lab,

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.260
they just buried it,

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.520
in the ground.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.720
And left it there.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.260
And then they dug it up,

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.460
and lo and behold,

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.820
all this bacteria were growing,

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.020
all these moulds were growing,

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.000
all these things were growing,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.080
that would never grow in the lab.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.700
It sort of like, dagh,

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.760
what a great idea.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.560
And, then they were able to use very classic methods to quickly isolate,

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.620
I assume it was quick,

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.600
quickly isolate brand new species of bacteria and brand new antibiotics.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.640
And this is, this one here, this is they call the soil hotel,

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.000
this is a soil hotel.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.520
Over laid with Staph aureus,

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.920
look for that zone of exclusion and isolate the compound.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.060
Teixobactin, you'l probably hear this word again,

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.820
it's a beautiful, very complicated antibiotic compared with penicillin,

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.960
a lot of them are.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.440
The beauty of this guy is that it fights bacteria in a different way.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.480
It doesn't fight proteins, like β-lactamase,

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.580
proteins are really easy to evolve resistance to,

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.620
cos you just need a gene.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.540
It fights a lipid.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.800
Lipids are not encoded by genes,

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.860
to inactivate a lipid you have to make a lipid,

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.760
you have to do use of different genes and lots of metabolism.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.220
And it's really complicated, it's hard to find one place where you can actually fight that.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.600
There is another antibiotic out there, called vancomycin, have you heard of this?

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:42.260
Vancomycin was an amazing, was, an amazing antibiotic, cos it's resistance seemed never to happen.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.800
Because it's against a lipid as well.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.860
It fights a lipid.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.860
And only recently, Vancomycin is now become resistant,

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.820
resistance has arisen, and it was a bit of a flick accident actually.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.660
It's a long story, I won't tell it,

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.540
but this guy also fights lipids,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.700
and it's great hope.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:00.460
Because the authors tried to find things that were resistant to this antibiotic, they couldn't find anything,

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.660
they looked every where.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.620
Not a sausage.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:08.440
So, hopefully if we treat this antibiotic with care, it will last us a good 10, 20, 30 years.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.480
And, unfortunately it only acts against a certain kind of bacteria.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.660
The Gram positives,

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.820
which leaves a big gap for the Gram negatives like E.coli and other big killers.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.280
But hopefully the strategy can be used generally.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.400
Maybe not just with soil, maybe we can go to the deserts, under the oceans, all different environments,

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.300
and find all these new bacteria,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.360
grow them in their environment, where they will, where they like to grow.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:33.560
So this is a brilliant discovery, I'm just, I'm so happy that I was around to see it.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.780
Okay, so another problem that we have,

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.320
with, this has nothing to do with resistance,

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:39.940
it's biofilm,

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.900
so have you heard of biofilms?

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.540
I mentioned biofilms at the beginning.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.120
These stromatolites are caused by mat formed biofilms.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.220
If you scrape your teeth right now, something comes off,

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.420
that's a biofilm,

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.640
of dental bacteria.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.320
Slimy rocks, that's a biofilm.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.000
Biofilms are everywhere,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.820
it was only recently appreciated, that most bacteria are living in these communities,

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.860
and they're not free living at all.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.900
And, this is just a schematic showing that these bacteria come together,

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.960
in groups, very complicated groups.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.460
And they form these primitive organs almost,

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.540
they secrete this slime, and slime protects them from antibiotics, and other things.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.600
And it's estimated now that, in the US,

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.120
It's causing a massive problem with health care,

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:25.560
because these things grow on catheters and in dwell in medical products,

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.280
and they are actually involved in a lot of infections,

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.420
and they're very difficult to treat, cos they are slimy,

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.320
and you can't get the antibiotics in there.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.400
And the other thing they do,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.060
is when they're in that community,

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.740
they're exchanging DNA,

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:40.260
lots, so they are exchanging resistance and they are making the problem worse.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.460
So we need to solve this problem as well.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.020
So just for fun, my lab is growing biofilms in the lab,

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.900
this is a beautiful video from one of my students,

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.780
as you can see, what you're looking at,

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:54.460
is just a thin section of biofilm.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.540
Top, these red things are metabolically active bacteria,

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:01.280
the green things in the middle are sort of structural, things that aren't growing very much,

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.340
and there's this channel,

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.400
can you see this blue channel,

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.800
water, nutrients can come through.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.060
It's a really beautiful structure.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.540
And what we are trying to do now,

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.320
I'm collaborating with engineers,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.680
in Oxford and at UCL,

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.600
we are trying to make nano-capsules and micro-capsules,

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.360
that can penetrate biofilms,

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:24.560
because, it's no good having an antibiotic that works, if you can't get that antibiotic inside, to where the action is.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.460
So I think that, collaboration between biologists and physicists and engineers,

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.420
are another thing that we need, to get out of this mess.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.560
So, we are in trouble as a species,

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.860
I think maybe I've convinced you that we're in trouble.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:40.080
But, I'm interested, just to finally, in the final few minutes of my talk,

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.780
where has this complacency come from?

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.640
Is not that we haven't heard about this hundreds of times before,

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.620
if you look at this media survey,

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.880
1961, in Good Housekepping,

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.940
which is a girly mag,

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.200
they were talking about antibiotics resistance,

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.060
and oh, don't overuse them, for casual reasons,

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.580
and every generation,

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.040
since now, and then, has sounded this alarm.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.080
Fleming sounded the alarm.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.060
Everyone was having hysterical head lines,

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.440
guys we are in trouble,

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.020
and nothing happens,

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.440
this happens in our country too,

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.080
so in 2013, chief medical officer said,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.660
guys, it's like climate change and terrorism rolled into one.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.820
A few headlines, all went quiet.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:21.620
The next year, David Cameron, ah, medical dark ages,

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.180
few head lines, went quiet.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.240
And Cameron, he said this thing which just made me laugh,

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.960
he has announced to review into why so few antimicrobial drugs have been introduced in recent years.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.340
We don't need a review, we know, we've known for generations,

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.960
that it's difficult, they have the incentives, the money, we know.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.480
We don't need a review.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.140
What we need is money, and effort put into this problem.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.600
And the US congress is doing great things with,

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.240
agh, cutting red tape to help,

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:50.740
and also we've got initiatives, they EU is throwing money on it,

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.060
UK has annouced a strategy,

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.160
So, I'm sure it's very good,

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.440
and of course, the Longitude prize is giving prominence to antibiotics.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.920
But what we really need, Mr.Cameron,

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.860
if you want to write to your MP,

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.140
you can tell them what we need, is money.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:09.420
Because scientific research is very expensive.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.560
And we spend hardly anything on it.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.800
If you look at this lovely graph, from scienceogram,

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.440
you can see that, the UK is at the bottom, out of the developed nations,

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.000
for spending money on science, it's 0.57% of GDP.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.560
And even the 0.79% that's a G8 average,

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.500
it's a pitiable amount of money to spend on research and development.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.340
For something as important as science,

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:35.720
because we need science not just for antibiotics, but for climate change, and for food security, all these problems that we have, to solve.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.780
And we need science to get us out of this mess.

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.460
And we are spending pennies on it.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.120
So I think you should all write to your MP, and tell them,

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.960
you're gonna vote in the next general election, what do you think about science.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.880
So, just in conclusion.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.860
keeping in mind, it takes 10 to 20 years, from discovery, to tablet,

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.840
we have a discovery void, aside from this wonderful nature paper that ruined my story,

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:03.720
no new classes are discovered since 1987, we are still in trouble with Gram-negative organisms,

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:08.020
given that, we need to put more effort and we need to stop just shrugging it off,

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.200
I think we have too many crises stories,

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.100
oh, the bacteria are coming, the bacteria are coming,

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.260
I'm not helping, I know,

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.180
but it really is time to get serious.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.340
We don't want to go back to that age,

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.660
when we are all dying,

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.000
bacteria are one step ahead of us,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.760
and we need something to catch up,

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.260
now.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:22.820
That's it,

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.380
Thanks.
