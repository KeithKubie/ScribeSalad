00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.350
Dating is weird.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.480
There’s flowers, chocolates, and promises
you don’t intend to keep.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.640
But humans aren’t even the weirdest when
it comes to love in the wild.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.990
Hey lovers, Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.220
To paraphrase the comedian Aziz Ansari, our
courtship rituals ARE WEIRD.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.040
I mean if we like a person, we turn to them
and say “hey you know this hanging out thing

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.040
we’re doing?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.800
Let's do this until one of us is dead.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.330
Also, wear this piece of metal and carbon
on your finger so everyone else knows we have

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.420
an arrangement”.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.399
But we aren’t alone in the animal kingdom
when it comes to weird romance.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.399
Oh no.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.480
In the wild, lots of times it’s the male
who is competing for female attention.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.800
Usually males strut their stuff by displaying
colorful markings, performing fanciful dances,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.140
and or even by fighting with another male.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.519
All to say “look at me!

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:47.530
I’ve got the best genes!

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.530
MATE WITH ME!”

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.159
But how does a pretty tail mean good genes?

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.210
Well, sexual selection sometimes means the
flashiest animal is the fittest.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.139
It’s when animals evolved traits to attract
a mate.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:01.660
I mean take a look at the peacock, probably
the most famous example.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.650
The males have these huge, pretty, but useless
tails.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.689
They aren’t good for anything other than
putting on a good show.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.079
But, the female peacocks think, because the
male is able to devote precious resources

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.659
and time to a rather useless appendage and
behavior, he must be in pretty good shape

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.640
and have pretty good genes.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.719
Over time many animals evolved a little oddly
because of sexual selection.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.770
There’s lots examples of odd courting behavior
in nature.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.530
But I’ll just focus on my favorite three.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.140
There’s the weird and wonderful hooded seal.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560
For hooded seals, size matters.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.770
To entice a passing lady, male hooded seals
inflate a giant red balloon-like hood out

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.500
of their left nostril and wave it around.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.310
According to a study published in the Canadian
Journal of Zoology seals also use these hoods

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.500
to produce calls and noises!

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.390
Usually these noises are to ward off a potential
adversary, but 12% of the time, they’re

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.270
to woo a lady seal.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.159
Besides the best call, the male with the biggest
hood, gets the girl.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.120
But if we’re going to talk about sexual
selection, we have to talk about birds.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.840
Birds man, birds are the best at flashy courting.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.820
Kind of similar to hooded seals male frigatebirds,
a tropical bird, have these huge red pouches

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.490
on their chests called a gular sac.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.490
During mating season, the sac is bright red.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.750
And the males gather in large groups of up
to 30 individuals.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.610
The females fly over the group and the males
inflate their pouches and use their beaks

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.900
to drum on it to attract a mate flying over
head.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.950
In a study published in the journal The Condor,
researchers found that the drumming on the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.220
pouches helps to tell the females about the
size of the pouch since the angle and distance

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.170
might make it hard to see.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.410
Once the female picks her lucky guy, she swoops
down and joins him.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.410
He takes her beak in his and they walk off
into the sunset.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.640
But my favorite courtship ritual might be
the bower bird.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.640
The males of this Australian avian build elaborate
structures to seduce a female.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.940
Often the structure, or bower, is made of
intertwining twigs and sticks.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.612
Sometimes the structure resembles a little
hut with an opening.

00:02:57.612 --> 00:03:01.950
And out on the front lawn of this little hut,
the bird collects things.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.290
Lots of bright or shiny items.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.310
It’s a garden of buttons or bottle caps
or flowers.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.820
All this building and collecting takes up
precious time he could have spent hunting

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.620
or foraging for food, but they pay off is
pretty great.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.200
A female bird will come and sit in his bower
and watch as the male performs a complex dance.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.090
If she doesn’t like it, or finds him lacking
in some way she’ll check out the bird next

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.090
door.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.950
But sometimes the grass isn’t always greener
on the other side.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.980
She could come back... once she checks out
a few places, she picks the one she likes

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.980
best.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.510
Picking the one you like best is always hard
choice, but the animal kingdom makes it a

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.880
little easier with things like flashy tails.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.400
While we might not have a gular sac or nasal
hood, there is always the tradition of giving

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
jewelry.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.550
Speaking of, special thanks to Kay Jewelers
for sponsoring this episode.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.010
For the bowerbird, every kiss begins a button
or bottle cap, for us humans, every kiss begins

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.010
with Kay.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.350
So courting is just the first step to making
future generations of seals and birds.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.910
And every species seems to have their own
strategy to making the beast with two backs.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.260
Some animals even mate to the death!

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:27.620
