HAOHSIANG LIAO: American
people, they usually

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.590
have the myth that Chinese
is a very difficult language

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.220
to master which is true if
you want to learn the four

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.600
skills altogether.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.050
We are talking about listening,
speaking, reading, and writing.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.070
Chinese is difficult in the
sense of Chinese characters.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.060
If you focus on just
listening and speaking,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.830
the structure of
Chinese language

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.470
is the same as English.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.280
It's SVO language.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.770
So you say, I like you.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.500
As long as you know how do
you say, I, like, and you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.290
individually, and you put
together, it's, I like you.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500
So it's not Japanese.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.260
Japanese is SOV.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.510
So you have to say, I
you like in Japanese.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.570
So again, if you
just want to focus

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.380
on listening and
speaking, Chinese

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.280
is not so difficult to master.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.430
Most of the Chinese textbooks,
they combine these four skills

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.530
altogether.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.080
So a dialogue would
be represented

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.780
in Chinese characters.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.790
And reading Chinese characters
is a big burden for beginners.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.110
And our curriculum here is our
speaking and listening class,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.970
they have different units.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.970
And that is one
of the reasons we

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.900
would like to adopt these
new materials at MIT.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.690
And the material is called
Basic Spoken Chinese

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.310
and Basic Written Chinese.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.510
So the idea is it
separates the speaking

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.460
and listening from the
reading and writing.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.010
So for the first two
weeks, our curriculum

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.140
here is that we focus on
the speaking and listening.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.300
So students, they get
a solid foundation

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.260
of what Chinese sounds like.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.810
After two weeks, then we
slowly introduce the reading

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.250
and the writing part.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.860
And our pace here is our
speaking and listening classes,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.350
they're always one week ahead
of the reading and writing.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.030
There are some good
purposes for doing that.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.730
One of them is reading and
writing will become review

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.090
for the speaking and listening.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.414
So when students
read, the materials

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:13.830
is something you already know
from speaking and listening.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.320
So their energy, their efforts,
can be put entirely focused

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.820
on decoding the characters.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.380
So they don't need to go
through the process of,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.410
so what is meant by this
word and by that word

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.555
because they already
learned this in the speaking

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:33.660
and listening class.
