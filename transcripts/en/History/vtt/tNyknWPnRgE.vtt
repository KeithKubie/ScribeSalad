00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.968
Look at that, Frank.

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:04.371
This is a original
Great Northern

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.906
Railroad bench out of a depot.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.375
MIKE: Oh, wow.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.410
Is this something you'd sell?

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.444
I think I would.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.912
You know, this is
how far it got.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.314
You're not doing
too much with it.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.282
MIKE: What I do know about
the Great Northern Railroad,

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.651
it ran from St. Paul,
Minnesota all the way

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:19.986
to Seattle, Washington.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.755
I'd like to pull it out of
here to see what it looks like.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.123
All right, let's pull it
out, see what it looks like.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.657
MIKE: This thing would have
been sitting outside the depot.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.760
People waiting for their
World War I veterans

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.163
to come home, World War II
veterans to come home, or maybe

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.731
a presidential whistle-stop.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.967
NARRATOR: In the lead
up to the 1948 election,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.035
President Truman has
traveled over 20,000

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.470
miles across the nation.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.572
Millions of people have turned
out to see the president

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.808
and hear his message.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:45.612
This is probably 1903, '04.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.913
FRANK: Early 1900s.
BRIAN: Yes.

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.148
MIKE: Brian is one
of those guys that

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.317
has gone beyond just the
picking part of this business.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.887
He's actually researching
the history of pieces.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.522
My depot is 1906.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.825
And the railroad got to
this town before Beacon.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:00:59.759
OK.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.794
So this would have
been the front.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:01.795
Yeah.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:02.629
It's missing one
of the brackets, one

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.063
of the little dividers there.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.432
MIKE: What are you
thinking on it, Brian?

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.568
Well, it's the only one
I've ever come across.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.237
A $300 bench?

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.606
It's original out of a depot.
This is great.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.208
I like it, but--

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.011
this piece to be
replaced is like--

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.579
FRANK: That's hen's teeth.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.047
MIKE: Yeah, I mean,
you're not going to find

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.148
the one with a star on it.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.616
This is for larger
people this section.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:24.751
Oh, is that what it is?

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.052
That's what it is.
[laughing]

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.687
It's for you and your
girlfriend sitting there.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:28.455
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.557
You can sit together.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.825
Honestly, I'll
tell you what, Brian.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.694
I'd be a player on this
thing for 200 bucks.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:36.129
I wouldn't be--

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.932
I think if it had
that piece on it, I--

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:39.666
$250.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.702
It's original.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.137
230 bucks.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.672
$240.
Final deal.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:49.909
$240.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.211
All right, you guys
got it it done.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.781
I decided to sell because
I've got a complete disaster

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.583
in a really cool train depot.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:57.317
Can you show us?

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.451
Absolutely.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.086
Come on in, guys.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.788
I didn't clean.
- OK, that's good.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.189
- We hope not.
- We like it dirty.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.290
We like it that way.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.158
Oh, wow.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.192
FRANK: Well, now we're talking.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.026
Yeah.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.728
Well, what else we got in here?

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.464
I hid a pedal car
down there years ago.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.499
I think it's--

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.033
- Right here?
- Yeah.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.836
FRANK: Jump on in there.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.371
Here, move this penguin.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.773
[grunting]

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:23.643
Jeepers!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.345
What if you don't buy
it when you get to it?

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.347
Well, I gotta see
what it looks like.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:31.551
Brian tells me the story of
him hiding it because he thinks

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.685
someone's gonna steal it.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.355
Freakin' doing what
my brother would do.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.056
All right, here we go.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.491
The grand finale.
BRIAN: Holy, man!

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.226
That was buried!
Ha!

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:43.196
Holy [bleep]!

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.230
Wow.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.999
Pedal car.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.233
It's got a good look to it.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.068
Look at that bad boy.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:49.903
He's got it.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.271
MIKE: I yank the pedal car out.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.640
It's got some wacky
fender flares on it.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.441
It's one I've never
even seen before.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.609
Somebody repainted it.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.646
It's got the wrong
steering wheel on it.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:01.514
What's with the wire
holding everything together?

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.216
Is that just holding
the front end on?

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.284
See the wire?

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.451
See the wire in front?
Is that holding--

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:06.686
Yeah, it's just holding that.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.454
It's missing the bolt to
the front end is what it is.

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:09.756
Yeah, I can see
it's separating.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:10.690
Yeah.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.891
- See what I mean?
- I think this--

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.725
I don't know, man.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.694
Rummage sale in Devil's Lake.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.062
Yeah.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.131
I'm trying to figure out what
the T would have been on it.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.599
FRANK: Maybe that's for Tesla.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.734
[laughing]

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.971
$200.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.506
MIKE: I worked hard
to get this thing out.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:30.009
BRIAN: $185.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.078
I'll give you
125 bucks for it.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.313
That's how hard I worked.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.881
FRANK: There you go.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.049
Thanks, man.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.151
I didn't spend a
lot of money on it.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.520
And he really did work for that.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.625
What we've got here is a
collection of Elvis Presley.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.194
Every one of these are Elvis.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:51.397
"Elvis Greatest Hits,"
"Elvis Blue Hawaii,"

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:54.467
"Elvis Back in Memphis,"
the "Golden Records."

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:55.868
So it looks like
something got onto it

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:56.869
or something scratched it up.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:57.837
Cat got it, they told me.

00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:59.238
Cat got it or
something like that.

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.641
Most of these records are
from the '60s and '70s.

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:02.842
Elvis was the man.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.544
He was making comeback specials.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.713
He was selling out
shows in Las Vegas.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.616
He was even hanging out with
Nixon at the White House.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.484
NARRATOR: The King
arrived at the White House

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.152
bearing a gift for
the president--

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:18.658
a Colt 45 pistol, which the
Secret Service confiscated.

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:19.892
That's pretty bad.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.194
Do you know what I mean?
You see it?

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.095
Ah.
Yeah.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.163
It's got definite
scratches in it.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.965
So I would just-- you know,
I would think some of them

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.867
are good, maybe some
are bad, you know?

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.837
What do you think?
BRIAN: $50.

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.238
- You got it.
- Thank you.

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.039
$50.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.040
Elvis Presley.
