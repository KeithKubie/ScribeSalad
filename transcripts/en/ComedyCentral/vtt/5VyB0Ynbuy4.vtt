00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.670
- SO ON THIS SAD,
AND YET HAPPY DAY,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.773
LET'S ALL RAISE A GLASS
TO CELEBRATE THE RETIREMENT

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.775
OF EVERYONE'S FAVORITE
PARK RANGER,

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:11.979
THE GLUE THAT HELD US ALL
TOGETHER FOR SO MANY YEARS,

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:12.980
TO...

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.981
HAROLD.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.282
- WHO THE [bleep] IS HAROLD?

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.283
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:17.684
- WOODY PUT HIM ON LOOKOUT DUTY

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.787
IN THE FIRE TOWER 20 YEARS AGO
AND FORGOT TO RELIEVE HIM.

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:23.657
- SO HE SPENT TWO DECADES
BY HIMSELF IN A SMALL TOWER?

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.926
- WOW, HE'S LUCKY
HE DIDN'T GO NUTS.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:26.994
- YOU'RE THE DEVIL.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.629
I WILL BURN YOU!

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.564 line:0%
 
[high-pitched]
YOU GOT TO CATCH ME FIRST.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.232 line:0%
 
[laughs demonically]

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:36.203
- TEQUILA SUNRISE,
HOLD THE SUNRISE.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:37.204
[glass shatters]

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.238
- IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.741
- WELL, AREN'T YOU A SWEETHEART.

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.442
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE BARTENDER

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.312
JUST GAVE YOU A FREE DRINK
BECAUSE HE'S A SWEETHEART?

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.947
- YEAH, WHY ELSE?

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.549
- BECAUSE YOUR PANTS
ARE SO TIGHT,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.551
I CAN READ THE MILEAGE
ON YOUR VAGINA.

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.252
- THAT IS SO SEXIST.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.022
I DON'T GET PREFERENTIAL
TREATMENT BECAUSE OF MY LOOKS.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.558
HE GIVES OUT DRINKS
BECAUSE HE'S A NICE GUY.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:00:59.493
- CAN I GET A GLASS
OF TAP WATER?

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:01.562
- BEAT IT, SEA WORLD.

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:02.129
[uplifting music]
