[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:12.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:12.864 --> 00:03:14.355
AARON ZEMACH: Awesome.

00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:17.960
And now everyone, again, let's
welcome to Google John Linnell

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.815
and John Flansburgh,
They Might Be Giants.

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:23.577
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.310
So I saw that music video for
the first time this morning.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.119
It was fantastic.

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.160
And it's got me thinking.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.027
I'm curious a little bit about
when you are working on a music

00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:42.110
video or you want a music
video for a song, what's

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.962
the collaboration process
like for you and the director?

00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:47.420
Do you send them the song and
sort of give them free range?

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.500
Is there a
back-and-forth involved?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.875
JOHN LINNELL: It's
normally that.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.220
I mean, the best results,
it seems like, we get

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.650
are from people who
are uncontrollable.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.820
And even for the stuff
we've done for kids,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.400
it's just we've gotten
spectacularly great results

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.240
when the people get to do
whatever they want and they are

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.670
bringing all this
stuff to the song that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.410
was not in our minds
whatsoever, just utterly--

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.660
stuff that makes our
jaws hit the floor.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.820
That's always a
great treat for us

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.240
because normally, we're really
used to what we're doing.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.200
And our ideas are
completely familiar to us

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.050
by the time we've ironed
them into a product.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.262
So it's a really wonderful treat
when somebody makes a video.

00:04:31.262 --> 00:04:32.720
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah,
that's awesome.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.920
And so this year, you're doing
another Dial-A-Song, new song

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.046
released every week online.

00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:40.378
And all of them are going to
have a music video attached

00:04:40.378 --> 00:04:41.150
to it, as well.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.650
And you did this
previously in 2015.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.480
JOHN LINNELL: Yeah.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.855
AARON ZEMACH: So
to me, it sounds

00:04:45.855 --> 00:04:48.425
like releasing 52 songs in one
year is just this grueling--

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:49.160
JOHN LINNELL: It's a bad idea.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.240
AARON ZEMACH: --process, yeah?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.885
JOHN LINNELL: Yeah.

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:53.468
AARON ZEMACH: So what made you
want to return through it again

00:04:53.468 --> 00:04:57.176
in 2017 for a second go?

00:04:57.176 --> 00:04:58.940
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
I can't remember.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.420
It does seem like a bad idea.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.680
The truth is-- the
origin story of the band

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.820
is really wrapped up in
this Dial-A-Song service

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.000
that we had that was
just a phone machine.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.025
And that was a lot easier than
the 52 songs in a year thing,

00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:19.400
actually, to be
perfectly honest.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.940
Because the Three-card
Monte trick of that

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.680
was that we had a suitcase
full of 40 cassettes and we

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.630
would just shuffle them around.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.880
And some things would
be in order to end--

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.510
we would bring in
new songs, take out

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.540
the really, miserably bad ones.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.590
And if we went away
on tour, my landlady

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.620
would come in and change them.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.130
And it was manageable.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.240
This thing is a
little bit more--

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.870
the 2015 Dial-A-Song project
was a little bit more

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.570
about facing the way the world
kind of takes in music now.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.440
I mean, social media is
discovery for a lot of people.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.480
The only way they
find out about things

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.330
is through Facebook or Twitter
or Instagram or whatever.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:17.480
So if you're not kind of feeding
that manic beast all the time,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.390
you're really just
talking to your front row.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.300
Ultimately, I guess, we
are always on a quest

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.590
to find more people to be
interested in what we're doing.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.020
I mean, we've been doing
this for so long that we have

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.120
to-- we have to find--

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.644
we need more people.

00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:41.060
AARON ZEMACH: And
so your strategy

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.397
sort of has been adapting,
over the years of your career,

00:06:44.397 --> 00:06:45.980
in new ways to find
that new audience?

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.896
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah.

00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:50.810
I mean, by being able to
say, on Facebook on any given

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.520
Wednesday, here's
a new song, that

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.370
seems like a much
more interesting way

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.762
of keeping it going.

00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:01.220
AARON ZEMACH: So
one of the reasons

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.720
that I've been sharing a few
of the songs that have come out

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.200
have been previews for the
new album, "I Like Fun".

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.690
And they have, if you listen
to the lyrical content,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.160
sounded anything
but being about fun.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.450
It's a pretty stark contrast.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.730
So just because it's the
world that we live in,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.060
and it's an album that must
have come together in 2017,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.784
was that in any part
influencing the tone?

00:07:22.784 --> 00:07:24.200
I mean, you've
always been writing

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.850
music that has
some darker tones,

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.280
but has the world of
2017 at all influenced

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.685
what became "I Like Fun"?

00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:31.310
JOHN LINNELL: I think
in a general way.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.650
But I mean, they're not
specifically topical songs.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.980
And there's a lot of
death imagery, which

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.000
is not particularly topical.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.440
Any old time is
good for a death--

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.505
you know.

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.174
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.090
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.980
I mean, one of the things
that does sort of come out,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.230
ultimately, when you stack
up a big pile of songs,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.740
is you realize how much
you're in the zeitgeist.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.260
I don't think you'd sit down
write a song thinking about,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.080
I'm going to write
something about right now.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.070
But when we do--

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.990
I remember at the
height of the Bush era,

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:14.660
we made a record, an album that
sounded extremely dystopian,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.799
for lack of a less
political word.

00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:18.590
AARON ZEMACH: Sure.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.330
So this is kind of
an unfair question

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.663
because it's like saying,
where do your ideas come from?

00:08:22.663 --> 00:08:23.480
But after--

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.560
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Oh,
we've got answers.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.559
AARON ZEMACH: OK, great.

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:28.067
Well I was going to say after
20 albums, how do you-- is it

00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:30.650
the zeitgeist-- or where are the
places where you keep drawing

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.360
inspiration for
songs, especially

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.030
since the range of They
Might Be Giants song content

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.310
tends to be a little bit
wider than your standard pop?

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.851
JOHN FLANSBURGH: It's right at
the bottom of a cup of coffee.

00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:41.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.850
We are truly
addicted to caffeine.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.600
And it is--

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.142
I don't know.

00:08:51.142 --> 00:08:52.641
JOHN LINNELL: There
isn't an answer.

00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:54.650
I mean, in a way,
if there were, I

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.170
think we'd be pretty
bored with ourselves.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:03.084
If we had a calculus
for writing songs,

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.000
I think it would be
pretty obvious that that's

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.910
what we were doing, and we'd
be disappointed in ourselves.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.860
But we're really--

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.840
I mean, the job gets
harder every year.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.600
We are really casting
around all the time

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.340
for something new and
meaningful to say in a song.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.800
And that doesn't mean--

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.200
I mean, they're
not these sort of--

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.260
I suppose it sounds
wrong to say they're

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.210
these deeply personal
statements that we're

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.160
saying something about.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.710
But they are meaningful.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.460
And we want to have an idea.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.070
That's the point of the
song, is to have a good idea

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.060
and put it out there and have
it be fresh and, obviously, not

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.960
repeat ourselves.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.570
I think the thing about what
we're doing is, at this point,

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.350
it's really obvious
to our audience,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.630
or to anyone who
hears one of our songs

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.730
who's familiar with us,
it's obvious it's us.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.120
It's like, clearly, this
is the kind of thing we do.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.040
But we're very
scrupulously trying

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.860
to write a new thing each time.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.690
And there's no really
simple way to do that.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.484
There's no formula, sadly.

00:10:14.484 --> 00:10:15.900
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
At some point, we

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.483
realized we were
running out of nouns.

00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:21.900
And we sort of gave
ourselves permission

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.604
to use the same nouns again.

00:10:25.604 --> 00:10:26.520
JOHN LINNELL: Adverbs.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.720
AARON ZEMACH: Recycle nouns.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.040
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
Moving on to adverbs.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.370
AARON ZEMACH: Right.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.140
So I guess when you're
putting your tour together

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.730
for the "I Like Fun"
tour, is that something

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.646
you're thinking about?

00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:36.630
How the new material is going to
fit with the old material, how

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.680
everything fits together?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.721
JOHN LINNELL: Sure, yeah.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.920
Well, I mean, the tour is
the beautiful part for us

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.800
because we have 30
years of backlog.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.580
So we have a huge amount
of stuff to choose from.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.200
That's the easy part.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.782
We've got so many songs
we can just make up--

00:10:52.782 --> 00:10:54.240
it's Flansburgh's
job-- and I'm not

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.330
trying to say it's
an easy job-- but he

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.547
does have an enormous
backlog of material.

00:10:59.547 --> 00:11:01.380
JOHN FLANSBURGH: It's
a huge responsibility.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.120
JOHN LINNELL: It's a
big responsibility.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.890
The weight on John's shoulders
is unbearable, I know that.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.910
But it's nice for us, I think,
that we have so many songs

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.605
that we can play songs that
we haven't played in a decade.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.230
It's very fresh and fun to pull
out something that's from long

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.440
ago that we're--

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.490
I don't remember
having this idea,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.372
but it's exciting to
experience it again.

00:11:30.372 --> 00:11:31.830
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
Like on this tour,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.640
we're doing a song-- we just
got a trumpet player full-time

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.680
in the band for the
whole touring act.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.471
We've worked with horn
players in New York,

00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:41.920
but it's expensive to have a
whole horn section come out

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.420
with you.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.850
So we figured out, we can clear
out the junk bunk in the bus

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.220
and get a trumpet
player in there.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:56.430
And it allows us to do a bunch
of songs that have brass in it.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:01.050
So it opens up a whole other
kind of song arrangement

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.850
that we haven't had before.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.860
Like, we're doing a song
called "Hey, Mr. DJ, I

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.359
Thought You Said
We Had a Deal" that

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:12.150
was like a B-side to
"Don't Let's Start."

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.484
And I mean, obviously, for
the people in the audience,

00:12:16.484 --> 00:12:18.150
there's like a front
row and a back row,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.680
and there are very
different kinds of--

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.680
and there are people who
have been dragged there

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.000
by their friends, who are
just only so interested

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.090
in what you're doing.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:30.000
But it is exciting to be able
to pull out a song like that

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.590
and have people in
the front really

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.590
go like, whoa, rather
than just have it

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.849
be like marching out
with your old favorites.

00:12:38.849 --> 00:12:39.640
AARON ZEMACH: Sure.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.473
So it sounds like it's
almost this new phase

00:12:41.473 --> 00:12:44.052
of the band, where there's this
whole catalog to draw from.

00:12:44.052 --> 00:12:46.260
I'm curious how that differs
from when you were first

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.530
touring or first starting out.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.640
JOHN LINNELL: Yeah.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.890
AARON ZEMACH: And I'd
especially be interested-- like,

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.590
in New York, since
you are highly

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.050
associated with the New York
music scene, clearly a lot

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.910
different now from the 1980s.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.630
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Well, the
1980s was a really unusual time,

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:05.730
especially in New York, because
we came up in this moment

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:10.440
where there were a tremendous
number of gatekeepers

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.250
protecting the things
that made a lot of money.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.070
We were very aware
that superstar acts

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.730
were trying to hold onto their
market share very, very hard.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.640
So even just breaking
into the local club scene

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.270
was very-- there was a lot of
folded arms and a lot of people

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.330
saying no.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.990
And it was very hard
to get past that.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.260
I think in 2017, 2018,
it's almost impossible

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.510
to understand how
democratized culture has

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.940
become because of the internet.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.390
People just have to like
it and it will suddenly

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.950
become very popular.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.160
There were so many people
in the way of anyone even

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.180
having any idea of what
you were doing then.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.310
You couldn't even
get a gig in a club

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.670
unless you fit into
the idea of that club.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.520
So we're the guys in
They Might Be Giants.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.975
What club do we work at?

00:14:00.975 --> 00:14:02.100
JOHN LINNELL: Right, right.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.020
JOHN FLANSBURGH: You know?

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.110
But fortunately, there was
this little cultural bubble

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.650
in the East Village which was
this very transgressive, very

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.270
druggie scene.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.030
But the main thing
about the East Village

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.738
scene that was kind
of fascinating-- this

00:14:16.738 --> 00:14:18.210
is 1984, '85, '86.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.060
The clubs were called
The Pyramid Club, 8BC,

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.910
[? Durenko, ?] places that most
people have never heard of,

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.790
but they were an incredible
phenomenon at the time.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.420
And this is at a time when the
"New York Times" and the "New

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.165
Yorker" would not cover
shows below 14th Street--

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.510
no reviews of anything
happening, unless it

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.920
was at the Village Gate.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.770
So you're basically talking
about this extraordinary period

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.810
of siloed-off culture.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.770
So this bohemian New
York scene was happening.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.230
And their emphasis-- and it
was very clear from club owner

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.160
to club owner--

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.550
that they only were
interested in original acts.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.010
So it was suddenly,
instead of being

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.400
in some college town where
the guy's like, "why don't you

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.800
do Blondie songs?"

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.660
all of a sudden, we
were in this situation

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.110
where our originality
could really shine

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.319
and it was really emphasized.

00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:12.151
JOHN LINNELL: Right.

00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:14.640
The other thing, the weird
thing about that situation

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.990
was we were playing in clubs
that weren't music clubs,

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.840
they were performance art clubs.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.480
So we were the normal thing
that was being brought in--

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.320
[LAUGHTER] just
to play some songs

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.770
in between some
unspeakably weird,

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.589
impossible-to-describe
thing that was going on.

00:15:30.589 --> 00:15:32.130
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
It's hard to imagine

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.280
a time when performance
art was the new thing that

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.440
was happening.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.660
Because it really
is indescribable.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.210
I think Daryl Hannah
in "Legal Eagles"

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:46.640
is the only actual cultural
document of performance art

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.240
that made it through.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.366
AARON ZEMACH: So now in
this democratized era,

00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:53.490
how do you fit into that
as a more established act,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.590
but with a very
specific audience?

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.670
JOHN LINNELL: We are a
brand unto ourselves now,

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.720
in which we can't kind of--

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.640
that's just the way it is now.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.120
So I think we're completely
also in a different position

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.620
from a band that's
starting out now

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.830
where, I don't know how
you establish yourself,

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:11.430
at this point.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:21.150
We are managing to garner
new, younger people,

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.860
but we also have this fan base.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.965
So there's a kind of
inertia to it that we enjoy.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.119
What advice would you give
to the artists starting out?

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.410
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Save yourself.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.587
I don't know.

00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:41.170
We just started doing
interviews again

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.620
because we're doing
this album and tour,

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.780
and somebody was asking me if
we considered ourselves a cult

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.280
band.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.680
And I realized, I don't
even know if that's--

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.230
actually, I'm so value-neutral
on the idea of what a cult

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.770
band--

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.230
like, is that really good?

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.260
Is that really bad?

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:57.700
JOHN LINNELL: Right.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.574
What should I answer?

00:16:58.574 --> 00:17:00.760
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.270
If it's good, yeah,
sure, we're a cult band.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.819
I mean, I think anything that's
been around for a long time

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.530
has an established audience.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:14.599
And the only problem
that we have is we--

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:15.604
I don't know.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:23.079
I always felt like we're just
another thing in the world.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.119
We don't have to be the
center of your life.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:28.180
I think people tend
to think of bands

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:34.220
that are left of center
as somehow like these--

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.140
as cults.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.320
I guess I feel
like I would prefer

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.690
not to be thought of as a cult.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.400
JOHN LINNELL: Well, I think,
to me, the obvious distinction

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.100
between us and a cult
band is that we don't

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.040
represent a lifestyle, I hope.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.152
Because that would be weird.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.360
JOHN FLANSBURGH: This sweater
represents a lifestyle.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.059
But that was my personal
lifestyle choice.

00:17:56.059 --> 00:17:58.350
AARON ZEMACH: Stanley Kubrick's
personal style choices?

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.890
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yes, exactly.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:06.490
But I was going to say,
there was a time somewhere

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:10.010
in the '90s where I could see--

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.960
we were playing some big
festival-y kind of show,

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.310
and there were two people--

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.700
two men-- in the near-front
row of the audience.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.520
And one guy was wearing
a Pearl Jam shirt

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.540
and the other guy was
wearing a Pearl Jam shirt.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.492
And over the course--

00:18:27.492 --> 00:18:29.610
we were doing a set we
were very familiar with,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.380
so my mind had time to wander.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.405
And I realized, at
a certain point,

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:41.180
one guy was actually wearing the
shirt ironically and the other

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:41.980
guy wasn't.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.130
And I sort of felt like,
that's kind of a good place

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.137
to be in the culture--

00:18:47.137 --> 00:18:48.470
JOHN LINNELL: That is the scope.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.520
JOHN FLANSBURGH: --the world.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.545
Dudes who wear Pearl
Jam shirts of all kinds.

00:18:55.545 --> 00:18:57.997
It's like a diversity move.

00:18:57.997 --> 00:18:58.830
AARON ZEMACH: Right.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.490
We had some interesting chats
earlier about technology,

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.220
since we are here at Google and
we have the self-driving car

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.350
and everything.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.980
And I was looking--
it's what we have.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.965
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.965 --> 00:19:09.590
I was looking--

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.072
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I thought
my car was self-driving.

00:19:12.072 --> 00:19:14.030
AARON ZEMACH: On the They
Might Be Giants Wiki,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.364
I was looking up earlier just
some of the different ways

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.946
that you've used the internet,
over the course of your career,

00:19:18.946 --> 00:19:20.340
as a way to distribute music.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.462
So in 1999, you
released an album only

00:19:22.462 --> 00:19:24.170
on the internet, back
when that was still

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.630
a bold, newsworthy move.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.710
In 2003, you had a They Might Be
Giants streaming internet radio

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:31.820
service.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.300
You started podcasting in
2005, long before "Serial"

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.310
or any of that took off.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.740
So I'm curious what music
distribution technologies

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.799
you're interested in today
that, in six or seven years,

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:46.340
everyone's just going to think,
oh, this is the way to do it.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.590
JOHN LINNELL: CD-ROM, I think.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.630
We're very exciting.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:49.290
AARON ZEMACH: It's
coming back around?

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:49.820
JOHN LINNELL: Yes.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.890
JOHN FLANSBURGH: It's
coming back, man.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.630
Don't give up.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.722
LaserDiscs.

00:19:53.722 --> 00:19:54.590
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.006
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
Actually, CD-ROMs

00:19:56.006 --> 00:19:58.280
are the only emerging
technology that we completely

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.050
skipped over, I
think because we were

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.590
right at the point of our deal
with Electro where we realized

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.297
that this could be our royalty.

00:20:09.297 --> 00:20:11.130
JOHN LINNELL: We were
too stingy, basically.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.796
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah,
it was just like,

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:17.110
we don't want to be the R&amp;D
department for Warner Brothers.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.690
But I think we're pretty
agnostic about emerging

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:21.995
technology.

00:20:21.995 --> 00:20:25.850
If there's something
coming up, it's really

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.490
a way to have people hear us.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:32.054
It's just another way to get
access to another audience.

00:20:32.054 --> 00:20:33.470
In the past couple
of months, I've

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.560
been actively working
on Spotify playlists.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.530
And sometimes,
you start to think

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.780
you're talking to yourself,
but then you realize, oh,

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.160
hey, 250 people are
subscribing to this.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.350
And that means they're
passing it along to x number

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.460
more people.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.600
And if you're open to it,
it's available to you.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.850
I think the internet
thing was something--

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.720
doing music distribution so
early on in the internet,

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:08.810
I think really made us aware
of what a lost opportunity

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.490
the early internet was.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.527
The whole Napster moment was
such a missed opportunity.

00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:18.860
There was so much money being
made in the music business

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.710
without the internet that they
just were really at loggerheads

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.120
about how to do it.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.120
But it was obvious that it was
going to be the way that things

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.250
were going to go.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.809
But nobody in the tall buildings
wanted to hear about it.

00:21:34.809 --> 00:21:35.850
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.930
Do you have ways that you
prefer to listen to your music--

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.505
streaming, vinyl,
or ways that you

00:21:42.505 --> 00:21:45.130
think people should be listening
to They Might Be Giants music?

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.789
JOHN FLANSBURGH: The
mystery of silence?

00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:48.289
John.

00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:50.470
JOHN LINNELL: I feel pretty
dumb because I listen

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.150
I often listen on my laptop.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.610
And it's like the worst,
absolutely the worst way

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.780
to reproduce music.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.420
JOHN FLANSBURGH: John listens
to mixes of They Might Be Giants

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.110
on his laptop--

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.170
JOHN LINNELL: On my
laptop, that's true.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.750
JOHN FLANSBURGH: --which
drives me insane.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.500
JOHN LINNELL: The
thing you sent me,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.700
I did listen to on speakers.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.701
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I know.

00:22:04.701 --> 00:22:05.200
Well--

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.030
JOHN LINNELL: Because
you asked me to.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.029
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I know.

00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:08.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.870
JOHN LINNELL: But yeah.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:15.940
I think, in a way, it's probably
not an accident because I've--

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.780
and you know this--

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.250
I've always had a kind
of slightly ouchy feeling

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.730
about the super high and the
super lows that were introduced

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.675
sometime in the 1980s.

00:22:26.675 --> 00:22:29.050
Where, before that, I felt
like the band with the music--

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.341
JOHN FLANSBURGH: When sound
reproduction became better.

00:22:31.341 --> 00:22:33.190
JOHN LINNELL: Became
unbearably good.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.010
And before that, there
was a narrower range,

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.700
narrower bandwidth, to music.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.180
And I felt like it was
in the right proportion

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.660
to my relationship with music.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.120
And now it's like these super
tingly highs and super crazy--

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.750
I mean, I feel like such
an old man saying this.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.420
But it's too much.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.370
Actually, Bob Dylan
said something to that.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.330
He was like, there's
just too much sound.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.143
You can hear the song anymore.

00:22:59.143 --> 00:22:59.990
AARON ZEMACH: Wow.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.750
JOHN FLANSBURGH: And when you're
agreeing with Bob Dylan about--

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.458
JOHN LINNELL: You know
you're an old man.

00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:06.414
JOHN FLANSBURGH: --about
audiophile stuff.

00:23:06.414 --> 00:23:07.330
AARON ZEMACH: Perfect.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.686
So in a few minutes,
we're going to open up

00:23:09.686 --> 00:23:10.810
to questions from the room.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.580
We have two
microphones if people

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.254
are interested in queuing up.

00:23:14.254 --> 00:23:15.670
While people are
moving, I do have

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.430
another question that
I'm very curious about,

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.860
"SpongeBob the Musical".

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.032
So the score for
that is many artists

00:23:24.032 --> 00:23:25.240
contributing different songs.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.310
One is contributed
by the two of you.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.260
"The New Yorker" said
that it was the standout

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.740
track from the show, alongside
John Legend and Cindy Lauper

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.799
and--

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:35.340
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
Those are the facts.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.340
AARON ZEMACH: Yes.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.680
Actual-- how did the two of you
get involved in that project?

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.280
JOHN LINNELL: We were approached
by them, which was great.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.730
And I think we were
given the choice

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.030
of two possible subjects.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.300
We picked the
Squidward solo song.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:58.590
And they just took exactly the
demo at pretty much verbatim.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.060
And I would like to take credit
for the whole amazing success,

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:07.930
but I think they had the idea
of having the squid do a tap

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.940
dance with all four legs.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.480
You have to see it in person.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.300
It's insane.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.200
It looks crazy.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.090
And that wasn't us.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.870
And that's a big part of why
that song just blows everyone

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:20.840
away, I think.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.756
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah.

00:24:21.756 --> 00:24:23.720
They turned into an
enormous production number,

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:30.160
so it was nice to see our
thing get amplified that way.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.840
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah,
that's super cool.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.250
So we have a question over here.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.083
JOHN LINNELL: Hello.

00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:35.980
AUDIENCE: So hi,
asking for a friend.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.984
What's some good advice to be
excellent at parkour at 58?

00:24:39.984 --> 00:24:41.226
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:41.604 --> 00:24:43.520
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Asking
for a friend, I like--

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.050
JOHN LINNELL: A friend, yes.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.341
JOHN FLANSBURGH: --I like that.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.554
You know, the song is very
much about a fantasy--

00:24:56.554 --> 00:24:58.470
JOHN LINNELL: I thought
you wrote it about me?

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.594
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I know it.

00:24:59.594 --> 00:25:00.250
I'm 57.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.330
JOHN LINNELL: I'm 58.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.130
So I think it's about me.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.561
I think the question
is addressed to me.

00:25:05.561 --> 00:25:06.560
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Please.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.445
Please.

00:25:07.445 --> 00:25:08.361
JOHN LINNELL: Calcium.

00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:09.880
Drink a lot of milk
for your bones.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.713
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I'm
answering for a friend.

00:25:11.713 --> 00:25:13.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.760
JOHN LINNELL: Yes.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.179
You know, shoulder
pads, I don't know.

00:25:18.179 --> 00:25:18.970
I've never done it.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.210
I have no idea.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.960
JOHN FLANSBURGH: How
do people do parkour?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.770
is my question.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:29.290
Because it's like, when you
see best of parkour 2017,

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.390
it's just like being
inside a dream.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.890
Also, how do you film parkour?

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.300
Where's that guy?

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.730
JOHN LINNELL: We can just
leave those questions

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.260
as an exercise for the listener.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.170
AUDIENCE: I wanted to follow
up on the "SpongeBob" question.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:52.910
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I thought
you were going to say I want

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.610
to follow up on the parkour.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:57.620
AUDIENCE: I have answers if
you want to approach me later.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.330
So Aaron was asking
you about, what's

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.510
the best medium to
listen to your music on?

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.222
And I feel like a
generation younger

00:26:06.222 --> 00:26:08.680
than me learned about They
Might Be Giants through "Malcolm

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.470
in the Middle" and that theme
song, and now people are

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.457
learning through Broadway.

00:26:13.457 --> 00:26:15.040
I'm curious what you
think about that,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.040
and if you have any stories
about failed opportunities,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.090
or songs you've
written that have--

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.070
the sitcom has been like, no,
that definitely doesn't work.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.695
JOHN LINNELL: Well, how
brutally honest should we be?

00:26:26.695 --> 00:26:27.820
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Go for it.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.940
JOHN LINNELL: We wrote a whole
raft of songs for the movie

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.320
"Coraline," which
only some of which

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.290
have ever seen the light of day.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.730
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I think 30
seconds of which were actually

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:38.280
in the movie.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.760
JOHN LINNELL: Well, 30 seconds
of which were in the movie,

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.301
and then there's
another song that we

00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:45.670
released on an album called
"Careful What You Pack".

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.890
But we wrote a ton
of other songs.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.840
And it was kind of a
bittersweet experience

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:59.080
because I think part
of it was, we were just

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.900
producing all this
material and throwing it

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.170
to the director, Henry Selick.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:10.734
And he is extremely true
blue in his creative process.

00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:12.400
And I'm not just
saying that to be nice.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.900
I really respect the guy.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.140
But he basically felt like
this whole bunch of things

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.050
that we'd given him were not
going to work in his vision.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.070
And there just wasn't
a way to make it work.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.770
And it was upsetting
and sad for us,

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.300
but it's just the thing
about collaborating.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.820
You know, it's just that's
what happens sometimes.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.520
JOHN FLANSBURGH: And movies
are such a by-committee,

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.560
kind of like it's
easier for people

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.850
to prove their value by
saying no to something

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:46.600
than actually
producing something.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.920
It was a weird kind of spanking
tunnel of an experience.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.240
But it's interesting.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.980
The "Malcolm in the Middle"
stuff, I feel like--

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.400
I never know-- there was
a period of time where

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.200
at 11 o'clock, there was a
rerun of the Mickey Mouse

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.150
show, "The Daily Show," and
"Malcolm in the Middle."

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.230
And I would just be
changing the channels

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:16.330
going like, wow, we are
completely dominating

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.999
this medium of television.

00:28:18.999 --> 00:28:21.040
But at the same time,
they're such faceless jobs,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.420
I don't think anybody--

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.870
with "The Daily
Show," the credit

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.540
ran once a week on
the Friday when it's

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.692
going [BUZZES], really fast.

00:28:31.692 --> 00:28:34.150
That's the only time you would
ever see our name associated

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.700
with the show.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.060
It's interesting to
do faceless stuff.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.300
For years, we did music
for Diet Dr. Pepper.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:49.010
And we did music for Dunkin'
Donuts for, like, four years.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.700
And it was a super-fun
job and nobody

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.580
knew it was us, which
was kind of great.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.660
JOHN LINNELL: I think
the Dunkin' one,

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.300
we were basically
hired to do us.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.030
So the people who were
already familiar with us

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.530
could probably identify it.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.572
My wife heard a commercial
and was like, oh, I know that.

00:29:05.572 --> 00:29:07.780
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Well, I
would hope your wife would--

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.420
JOHN LINNELL: She, at
least, identified us.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.720
But yeah, we were partly
influenced, I think,

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.750
by stuff that we
saw on TV where we--

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.480
not until 20 years
later-- found out

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.020
who wrote the, whatever,
"Mission Impossible" theme

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.830
or something.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.640
So it is a kind of work
that you can do, I think,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.350
where you're not
going to get credit,

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.435
but you get the satisfaction
of doing a good job.

00:29:34.435 --> 00:29:36.310
JOHN FLANSBURGH: And
you can explain yourself

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.750
to taxi drivers more.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.098
JOHN LINNELL: Right, exactly.

00:29:39.098 --> 00:29:40.847
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Or
your mother's friends.

00:29:40.847 --> 00:29:41.641
JOHN LINNELL: Yeah.

00:29:41.641 --> 00:29:42.690
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.590
AARON ZEMACH: Just out of
curiosity, how many people here

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.423
knew that They Might
Be Giants did the theme

00:29:46.423 --> 00:29:49.090
music for "The Daily Show"?

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.430
JOHN LINNELL: No one
is raising their hands.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.650
JOHN FLANSBURGH: You mean,
you guys didn't put it

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.270
into slow-mo on Friday?

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.814
AARON ZEMACH: OK, over here.

00:29:58.814 --> 00:30:00.730
JOHN LINNELL: First of
all, are you guys aware

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.060
that we wrote the
theme that-- when

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.923
your phone rings, that's us.

00:30:05.923 --> 00:30:07.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.606
Sorry, go ahead.

00:30:09.606 --> 00:30:10.480
AUDIENCE: I am sorry.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.740
I never heard of
you guys before.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.411
JOHN LINNELL: Not a problem.

00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:15.660
JOHN FLANSBURGH: "Daily Show."

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.030
JOHN LINNELL: "Daily Show."

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.570
"Daily Show. iPhone
ring, that's us.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.440
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.890
But I find you guys
to be very witty,

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:28.560
in contrast to your songs,
which are a bit dark.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.500
JOHN LINNELL: Ah, yes.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.670
Well, they're witty, as well.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.670
They're just dark witty.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.060
AUDIENCE: But you know, I
don't have a musical ear,

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.440
but my friend does.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.900
And I wonder if you can
write a line, anything

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.090
that occurs in your
mind, and sign it

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.144
for me, if this is allowed?

00:30:45.144 --> 00:30:47.310
AARON ZEMACH: Why don't we
circle around afterwards?

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.730
AUDIENCE: I have to
go for an interview.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.438
JOHN LINNELL: Oh.

00:30:49.438 --> 00:30:52.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:53.315 --> 00:30:54.106
JOHN LINNELL: Well.

00:30:56.524 --> 00:30:58.690
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I'll make
a little drawing for you.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.730
AUDIENCE: Please
address it to Katie.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.990
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Katie?

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.020
With a C or a K?

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.700
AUDIENCE: K-A-D-I-E.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.760
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I-E, OK.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.794
I'm going to make a
little like that and that.

00:31:12.794 --> 00:31:13.960
Who else has got a question?

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.445
Because I can do this--

00:31:15.445 --> 00:31:17.320
AARON ZEMACH: Let's go
over to this other mic

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.736
and have a question
while we wait.

00:31:18.736 --> 00:31:21.010
AUDIENCE: So first, I was
texted by an old friend

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.300
today, a very old friend,
and he said, hey, guess what?

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.840
I'm going to make you feel old.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.294
"Flood" was released
28 years ago today.

00:31:29.294 --> 00:31:30.960
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Oh,
I heard about that.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.251
AUDIENCE: And I was like, what?

00:31:32.251 --> 00:31:35.257
I'm going to go to a talk
by They Might Be Giants.

00:31:35.257 --> 00:31:37.090
AARON ZEMACH: 20 years
ago today, January 8?

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.130
AARON ZEMACH: Wow.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.520
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.075
They release the records they
don't believe in in January.

00:31:43.075 --> 00:31:44.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.176
AUDIENCE: Well, it was really
meaningful to my friend

00:31:47.176 --> 00:31:50.830
and I. So that was an
interesting moment.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:55.480
But I wanted to ask about
listening to music on laptops.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.530
Because I read something
about Dial-A-Song

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.510
where you said
that forcing to be

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.240
audible and sensible through
a phone changes your style.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.740
JOHN LINNELL: I
mean, that dovetails

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.600
into what we're talking about.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.864
Because I think it
influenced-- we've probably

00:32:09.864 --> 00:32:10.780
said this in the past.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:16.120
It influenced our writing style,
that the Dial-A-Song machine

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.360
was the most restrictive,
in terms of bandwidth.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.600
And there were even sounds
you couldn't make in the song

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.730
because they would trigger
the automatic rewind

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:25.910
of the machine.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:30.154
So it was a very,
very good discipline.

00:32:30.154 --> 00:32:32.320
JOHN FLANSBURGH: If there
is a long, sustained note,

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.034
it would basically
make it reject.

00:32:34.034 --> 00:32:35.950
So we would even get
into doing a thing that's

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.130
almost like a DJ thing.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.920
If there was like, I want
to know, it would be like,

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.810
I want to "kno-oh-oh-oh-oh."

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.220
Because that would allow
it to keep on working.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:52.159
JOHN LINNELL: Plus, in order
for the lyrics to be audible--

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:53.950
and this is another
thing that we've always

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.070
been kind of uptight
about, making

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:03.446
sure you can hear the words,
rather than have it be sort of,

00:33:03.446 --> 00:33:04.680
a what did he say?

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680
JOHN FLANSBURGH: A vibe.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.930
JOHN LINNELL: A vibe, right.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.940
This was another thing
about the Dial-A-Song,

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.860
the arrangement
couldn't be too fussy.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.190
And because we automatically
liked doing fussy arrangements,

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.930
we had to reel that in.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.180
So it's had a huge
influence on the way

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.790
that we write ever since then.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.939
And I think we still feel
like simpler works better.

00:33:24.939 --> 00:33:27.230
AUDIENCE: Are the laptop
speakers doing the same thing?

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.570
JOHN LINNELL: Sorry,
the laptop speaker?

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:29.069
Yeah.

00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:32.680
I mean, and like I
said, I just like

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.080
a controlled amount of
bandwidth when I'm listening.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.050
So I think it's all of a piece.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.266
This whole aesthetic
is kind of connected.

00:33:41.266 --> 00:33:42.640
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
And the opposite

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.014
that's happening
with most people

00:33:44.014 --> 00:33:45.610
is that they're on ear buds.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:50.590
And that can be a very
full-frequency experience, much

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.167
more than hi-fis ever were.

00:33:54.167 --> 00:33:55.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.200
JOHN LINNELL: Thanks.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.220
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Thank you.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.220
AARON ZEMACH: Over here.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.250
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.230
I started listening
to you guys when

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.390
I was growing up in
a place that didn't

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.160
get much alternative anything.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.280
And it was awesome and
freeing and opened my mind

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.190
to this whole
underground alternative,

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.780
not what everyone else was
listening to and doing world.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.620
And OK, A, thank you so much
and you totally changed my life

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.199
and made it.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.860
And B, you're still
involved with a lot

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:23.639
of experimental and
cutting edge and not

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:27.600
mainstream or not-yet-mainstream
people and acts and artists.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.810
How do you find those
people to collaborate with,

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.899
and where do you get
your influences from?

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:35.440
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
Well, I can answer--

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.430
I mean, in terms of the
video collaboration process,

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:41.989
it is very curatorial.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:45.540
A lot of times, we'll
simply ask people

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.000
we've worked with before
if they know of anybody.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.230
So it sort of
spreads out that way.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:55.750
And we also do these video
contests, which is a--

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.650
it's a strange thing
in the culture.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.310
Because when you post a contest,
you immediately get responses

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.860
from angry artists
who are like, artists

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:10.170
should be paid for their work
and these contests are just

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.670
ways of ripping artists off.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.000
And I'm very sensitive
to that idea, in a way.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.890
But unfortunately, I'm too busy
writing for a Ford commercial

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:23.970
for free to worry
so much about it.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:27.990
Because it is part of being
in the creative community,

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.150
that the audition never stops.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.300
And it is absolutely
frustrating.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.800
It never stops
being frustrating.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.960
And I completely understand
people being upset about it.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.900
But the truth is,
through these contests,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.390
we find tons of people that
we end up working with.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.810
We actually-- the current
contest that we have going,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.390
there are three winners.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.830
And we'll probably make other
videos with all three of them

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.700
because whatever they do will
probably be very interesting

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.760
and cool stuff.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.270
And it's just a way
for us to find more.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.340
I mean, we've got 52
weeks to program, so.

00:36:04.209 --> 00:36:06.000
AARON ZEMACH: It's
funny because I realized

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.262
I forgot to mention that
many years ago, I actually

00:36:08.262 --> 00:36:10.470
was a winner of a They Might
Be Giants video contest.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.720
JOHN LINNELL: No way.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.030
JOHN FLANSBURGH: You're kidding.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.090
AARON ZEMACH: I forgot
to say that, yeah.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.215
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Which one?

00:36:13.215 --> 00:36:15.610
AARON ZEMACH: For Omaha,
the Omaha venue song.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.520
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
Oh, right, right.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.155
But are you from Omaha?

00:36:19.155 --> 00:36:20.530
AARON ZEMACH: I'm
not from Omaha.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:21.699
No, sorry.

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:23.490
But we did end up
collaborating eventually.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.480
JOHN FLANSBURGH: There you go.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.813
JOHN LINNELL: Wow, that's great.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.490
AUDIENCE: I actually
have a question

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.550
from a friend who
introduced me to you guys

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:33.574
when I was very little.

00:36:33.574 --> 00:36:35.490
He's been listening to
you for his whole life.

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.090
So he's curious about your
song "A Self Called Nowhere."

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.210
If the lyric goes, "it's a thing
named id at the bottomless pit"

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.360
or "it's a thing named it
at the bottomless pit",

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.320
and if it's a
psychological reference.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.069
JOHN LINNELL: I can
answer that in a word.

00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:50.000
It's "it," which rhymes
with "pit," of course.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.250
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, of course.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.041
JOHN LINNELL: And I
also want to point out,

00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:58.147
we haven't been playing that
song for the last 20 years.

00:36:58.147 --> 00:36:59.730
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I
would say 20 years.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.520
JOHN LINNELL: We will be
playing it on our next tour.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.140
We just decided to
re-introduce it.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.306
Just by coincidence, we
are pulling that one out

00:37:06.306 --> 00:37:08.180
and we're going to be
playing it on the tour.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.020
JOHN FLANSBURGH: And
we'll be enunciating "it."

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.144
JOHN LINNELL: That's right.

00:37:11.144 --> 00:37:14.134
I'll be very clear
in my pronunciation.

00:37:14.134 --> 00:37:15.800
AUDIENCE: I'll be
sure to tell him that.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.258
AARON ZEMACH: You
just ended, like,

00:37:17.258 --> 00:37:19.215
40 very vitriolic
internet conversations

00:37:19.215 --> 00:37:21.602
that have been going
on for decades.

00:37:21.602 --> 00:37:22.810
JOHN LINNELL: Or was it "it"?

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:23.710
Maybe not.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.296
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I
thought everyone here

00:37:26.296 --> 00:37:28.984
had a nondisclosure thing?

00:37:28.984 --> 00:37:30.900
AARON ZEMACH: So is this
a question over here?

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.570
Great.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:32.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.934
So you guys talked
a bit about liking

00:37:34.934 --> 00:37:36.600
to be on the bleeding
edge of technology

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.070
and using new technologies.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.320
I'm wondering if there's
any new technologies you've

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.680
seen or heard of floating around
now that you haven't gotten

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.147
to take advantage of
yet that you'd like to?

00:37:46.147 --> 00:37:48.480
JOHN LINNELL: I don't think
we've used the word bleeding

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.087
edge actually.

00:37:50.087 --> 00:37:52.170
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah,
that's tougher than we are.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.400
JOHN LINNELL: Yeah, we're
more like just near the edge.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.990
We're not getting hurt.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.180
JOHN FLANSBURGH: This is going
to sound incredibly spaced

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.730
out because it's a
really spaced-out idea,

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.460
but I was having a conversation
with Pete in our office

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.780
about this yesterday.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.370
Like a lot of people who do
Kickstarter campaigns or do--

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:19.440
being in the arts these
days requires a lot of--

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.930
there are a lot of patronage
schemes that people do.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:25.170
And we started a
thing a few years back

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.210
called the Instant Fan
Club, where basically, we

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.679
had been in the studio
for six months longer

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:30.720
than we were planning on.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.240
We hadn't been on the road.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.460
We just were completely
broke and we actually

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.350
had to pay a lot of bills.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.940
So we thought,
let's do some kind

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.062
of pre-sale for this
record, even though it's not

00:38:41.062 --> 00:38:42.770
going to be out for
three or four months,

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:44.922
and at least we won't
be broke right now.

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:46.880
So we started this thing
called the Instant Fan

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.819
Club and pre-sold 5,000
records, and promised

00:38:49.819 --> 00:38:52.110
a bunch of other stuff, and
made it a really good value

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.670
for the people who joined it.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.830
And ever since then, we've
periodically had these Instant

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.180
Fan Club things.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:03.430
And it'll be just
really good deals.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:04.840
It's like a bundled thing.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.710
You get like $200 worth of
stuff for $100 or whatever.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:12.340
And a lot of times, there's
music exclusives in there.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.760
And I was trying to figure out--

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:19.330
in Britain, you do not
have to get permission

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.160
to have your recordings played.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.040
You have to grant permission
to have your recordings played

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.030
on the radio.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.620
It is not compulsory that if
you put a record or a recording

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.080
into the world that the
radio gets to play it.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.300
There's still this moment of
almost fine art possession,

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.440
like this thing exists, and
only the artists themselves

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.210
can determine where it goes.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.330
And I was wondering--

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.090
this is really on the cutting
edge of intellectual property

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.170
question--

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.010
would there be a way to
not publish your music,

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.720
but simply create a disk
or create a unique piece

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.560
of reproduced music like a CD?

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.350
And I think of the--

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:09.045
what was that thing that the
creepy pharma dude bought?

00:40:09.045 --> 00:40:10.420
AARON ZEMACH:
Wu-Tang Clan album.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.850
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I
mean, I was wondering,

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:16.210
are those compositions at BMI?

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.430
I would assume not.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.040
But they sold it like
a piece of fine art,

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.830
rather than a piece
of commercial art.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:27.130
And I'm wondering, could
we actually pull out

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:31.390
of the commercial marketplace
and create just fine art music

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:35.950
for our benefactors?

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.120
JOHN LINNELL: For oligarchs.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:37.995
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yes.

00:40:37.995 --> 00:40:39.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.459
And does anybody here
know that pharma dude guy?

00:40:42.459 --> 00:40:43.500
AUDIENCE: Not personally.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.470
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.553
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:40:45.553 --> 00:40:50.010
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Anyway,
those are my racing thoughts.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.265
JOHN LINNELL: That's a
horrible new trend that--

00:40:52.265 --> 00:40:53.890
JOHN FLANSBURGH: The
pharma dude thing?

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:56.849
JOHN LINNELL: Just the idea that
everything is for rich people.

00:40:56.849 --> 00:40:58.390
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
Well, I'm not saying

00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:59.598
it should be for rich people.

00:40:59.598 --> 00:41:02.320
I'm just saying it would be
interesting to just not have

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:07.260
it be something that
immediately goes to--

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.330
you know, I love the
streaming services.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.001
But I'm telling
you, the checks--

00:41:12.001 --> 00:41:13.250
JOHN LINNELL: It's killing us.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:14.166
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah.

00:41:16.337 --> 00:41:17.170
JOHN LINNELL: Hello.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:19.150
AUDIENCE: It was
interesting to hear

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.400
that your early, early
performances were

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.010
in these performance art
clubs in the East Village,

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:28.150
because your early shows
also had definitely

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.370
an aspect of
performance art to them.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.880
Like, the huge hats as
megaphones, and the sets

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.861
were pretty bizarre for
concerts at that time.

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.777
JOHN LINNELL: We were
forced to do that stuff.

00:41:38.777 --> 00:41:39.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
wondering, how much of that

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:41.320
was that influence?

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.040
And it seemed like that sort
of dropped out of your concert

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.320
structure more recently.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.520
At least, your concerts
don't feel as much

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.889
like bizarre performance art
as they did in the early days.

00:41:54.889 --> 00:41:56.680
And I was wondering if
that was intentional

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.970
or that was just sort
of how it evolved

00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:58.900
with the music evolving?

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.316
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
Well, we evolved.

00:42:00.316 --> 00:42:02.350
We worked as a duo for 10 years.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:05.760
And over the course of that
time, there was sort of like--

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.460
some prop stuff
moved into the act.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:15.520
I think probably the
biggest difference

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.292
between what we were doing
and what a "regular" rock

00:42:18.292 --> 00:42:20.750
band was doing is that we were
working with a drum machine.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:26.560
So in some ways, the props
might have been compensating,

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.330
on a theatrical
level, for what was

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:33.410
missing by having an exciting,
live drummer to watch.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:36.700
I mean, the thing that
I reflect on back then

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.820
is how committed we were to
the idea of the drum machine.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.120
For a lot of people,
I realize now,

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.970
working with a drum machine
is a complete wrong answer,

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.880
like that's never
going to be good.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.470
But at the time
I think we really

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.740
felt like, we are
just rocking so hard,

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.324
and this drum machine
is so excellent.

00:42:59.324 --> 00:43:01.281
JOHN LINNELL: It didn't
feel like a-- it wasn't

00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:02.230
a compromise.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.430
JOHN FLANSBURGH: It did not
feel like a compromise at all.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:05.740
AUDIENCE: The whole "Rhythm
Section Want Ad" song

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.850
sort of captured that.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:07.300
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Exactly.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.716
JOHN LINNELL:
You're reminding me,

00:43:08.716 --> 00:43:11.680
I think our very earliest
shows, before we started

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.530
doing these East Village
performance places,

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.230
we were playing in
showcase-y clubs,

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:21.070
trying to be like-- we played
at CBGB as a showcase band.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.550
And we were totally using
the props and stuff there.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:23.870
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Oh, sure.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:24.370
Yeah.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.185
JOHN LINNELL: So
it wasn't because--

00:43:26.185 --> 00:43:28.300
it was more like we found
another place where we'd

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.180
fit in, basically, was how we
ended up in the East Village

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.260
thing.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.180
JOHN FLANSBURGH: But
we stopped using them

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.920
when it became something that
people expected, basically.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.486
Like, if it's the first
time you've seen a band,

00:43:41.486 --> 00:43:43.360
and they do this thing
that's got this really

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.630
weird theatrical thing to it,
it's like, that's interesting.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:49.270
But as soon as it's like,
oh, bring out the thing

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:52.660
and it becomes this sort
of "Rocky Horror Picture"

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.260
tradition thing,
it was just like--

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.330
and that really
happened the second time

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.740
we toured the United States.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.470
And just suddenly, we
became this like straight,

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:04.397
no chaser, like two
guys, drum machine,

00:44:04.397 --> 00:44:05.480
that's all you're getting.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.313
JOHN LINNELL: Right.

00:44:06.313 --> 00:44:07.500
Say the catch phrase.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.904
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Right, yeah.

00:44:09.904 --> 00:44:11.320
AUDIENCE: Play
number three again.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.620
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:13.810
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Thank you.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:14.370
AARON ZEMACH: Do
you feel like that's

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.200
something you're actively
fighting against,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.920
like the mythos traditions
of They Might Be Giants is

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.910
something on your mind?

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:22.035
JOHN LINNELL: I don't know.

00:44:22.035 --> 00:44:24.930
I think in some ways, we want
to keep the spirit alive.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.210
The original-- you
know, we're always

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.120
trying to get back
to the impulse

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.960
that we started with with this.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.910
But as John said, we
don't want to keep

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.765
using the same
vocabulary over and over.

00:44:37.765 --> 00:44:39.390
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
There is a weird thing

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.030
about how bands kind of
turn on themselves, in terms

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.830
of if something is
successful for them.

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:47.690
They're like, that's the only
thing they don't want to do.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:53.340
I think you have to
really avoid that.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:58.370
It's sort of a grumpy thing that
we definitely want to not do.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.350
AARON ZEMACH: Totally.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:04.380
AUDIENCE: So with so many years
of making music and having

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.170
this giant repertoire,
are there any songs

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.300
that you've sort of gotten
sick of and are like,

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.480
I just never want
to play that again?

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.880
JOHN LINNELL: Absolutely, yes.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.755
AUDIENCE: Which ones?

00:45:12.755 --> 00:45:15.780
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Do we
have to say which ones?

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.860
Because we're
contractually obligated--

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.170
no, no.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.190
JOHN LINNELL: Yeah,
well, they come and go.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.140
I think there's some
that we've played

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.680
a lot that we get tired of.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:33.150
And then there's always the
option of rediscovering stuff.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.750
So I think that's a nice thing.

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:38.280
We have a big enough repertoire
that we can shuffle things

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:38.960
in and out.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.510
Weirdly, though, I think
we still kind of generally

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.759
like our early material.

00:45:46.759 --> 00:45:48.300
JOHN FLANSBURGH:
There are definitely

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.830
songs we don't have to rehearse.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:52.200
JOHN LINNELL: That's fun.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.420
JOHN FLANSBURGH: It's fun
not rehearsing those songs.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.910
And it is also fun--

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:58.710
the energy you get
back from an audience

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:02.810
when you're playing
a popular song--

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:10.110
I saw a recent film of The
Rolling Stones, and wow.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:11.010
But I have to say--

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.980
JOHN LINNELL: That's
a positive wow, right?

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.313
JOHN FLANSBURGH: --they're
still playing "Satisfaction,"

00:46:15.313 --> 00:46:18.600
which just seems crazy to me,
especially since they said they

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.210
wouldn't.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:23.406
They promised.

00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:24.582
AARON ZEMACH: Over here.

00:46:24.582 --> 00:46:26.790
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask
you about your kids albums,

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:27.800
actually.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.550
I've been a fan of you
guys since college,

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:31.830
and I bought "Flood"
on cassette even.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:35.580
And so it was great fun
to be able to introduce

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.230
the band to my kid.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.409
And he was a big fan
of "Here Come the ABCs"

00:46:39.409 --> 00:46:40.450
and "Here Come the 123s."

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.533
And I just wanted to hear
about what inspired that

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:43.780
and what's happening there.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.990
JOHN FLANSBURGH: It's a
curious thing doing kid stuff

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:51.090
because you're kind of
immediately declaring

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.910
that you're a nicer person
than you might actually be.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:58.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:02.400
We are guys who were in a rock
band, an alternative rock band,

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:06.270
at a time when you could
be extremely selfish.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:09.510
And doing kid stuff,
it's like you really have

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:12.614
to be extraordinarily nice.

00:47:12.614 --> 00:47:14.280
JOHN LINNELL: Well
you should say, like,

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.820
that's on behalf of the parents.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.420
The kids actually like
the mean attitude.

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:21.000
And they like the swearing,
I just want to say.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.630
The parents do not
like the swearing.

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.296
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Kids
love the swearing.

00:47:23.296 --> 00:47:25.170
JOHN LINNELL: Yes.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.800
JOHN FLANSBURGH: But
there's sort of like a--

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.920
writing kids' music is a
really great open invitation

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.660
to just write about anything.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:38.010
It is an enormous trampoline to
jump on and just write a song.

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:42.840
You talk about, how do you
keep writing new songs?

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.440
Having the opportunity
to write for kids,

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.560
I think, in many
ways, really got

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.270
us revved up again about
the whole writing process.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:56.000
Because there's no sense of--

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.020
no rock critic is going
to talk about your work

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.410
when you're writing
a kids' song.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:07.120
You're really just writing
for yourself and the audience.

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:14.010
And so it's just a very
kind of lovely scenario.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.640
But doing kids' shows is
something else entirely.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:25.080
And it's very hard to
mediate the demands of--

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.730
like, there are people--

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.550
when we do a kids'
show, we find out

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:35.760
right away that it is both too
long and too short, and much

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.470
too loud and much too quiet.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:42.870
So it's a strangely--

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:47.740
for something that
seems like it could--

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:48.796
it's just complicated.

00:48:48.796 --> 00:48:50.920
JOHN LINNELL: Yeah, kids
don't know what they want.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.780
That's the problem.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.460
So they're impossible to please.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.960
AUDIENCE: And you guys,
I'd like to thank you

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.880
on behalf of many parents
for making a lot of long car

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.100
journeys more tolerable.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:48:58.600
JOHN LINNELL: Oh, thank you.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.970
AUDIENCE: It's something we
could all listen to and enjoy.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:00.890
JOHN FLANSBURGH: They
are designed for that.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:01.270
JOHN LINNELL: Sure, absolutely.

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:02.712
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Thank you.

00:49:02.712 --> 00:49:04.170
AARON ZEMACH: So
before we wrap up,

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:05.430
I just have one more question.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:06.930
You mentioned "Self
Called Nowhere"

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:08.220
is going to come
back on this tour.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.094
You're looking at other
songs in the catalog.

00:49:10.094 --> 00:49:11.880
Is there any song,
in particular,

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.680
that you're excited to be
playing on the upcoming tour,

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.475
maybe that you haven't
played in a while?

00:49:16.475 --> 00:49:18.224
JOHN LINNELL: Well, I
would say that we've

00:49:18.224 --> 00:49:21.420
got a lot of new material
that we're really

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.032
thrilled to be introducing.

00:49:24.032 --> 00:49:25.740
I mean, for me, that's
the funnest thing,

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.200
is the new stuff.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.270
JOHN FLANSBURGH: I'm
super psyched about just

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.880
working with Curt Ramm,
our trumpet player,

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.080
and having long
car rides to talk

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.400
about politics with our band.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.500
That's-- yelling at the TV.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.320
JOHN LINNELL: Yeah.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:42.590
AARON ZEMACH: Great.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:44.310
Well, so very excited
to see you on this tour,

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:46.500
and thanks again to John
Linnell and John Flansburgh

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.280
for coming out [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:47.340
JOHN FLANSBURGH: Thanks.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.798
JOHN LINNELL: Thanks
for having us.

00:49:48.798 --> 00:49:51.230
[APPLAUSE]
