00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.719
In this lesson,
you learned about scaling and

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.060
deploying clusters into the cloud.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.560
Using these features of Cooper Nettie's
makes cloud applications more resilient,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.800
and now you can finally
call them production ready.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.300
Looking back over this course, you
learned about modern application design.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.320
You learn best practices for
using decorative package and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.660
distribute containers.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.378
And you learned how to manage and
scale containers Cooper Nettie's.

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:26.318
&gt;&gt; And for many of you, this is the
first container you've ever built, and

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:30.000
it's the first cluster you've
ever deployed, according to for,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.004
I expect great things from you, and
if you do, I'll come to your job, and

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:35.637
do the Cooper Nettie's dance

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:37.794

00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:39.744
