Julie: Hello YouTubers
I'm here at the World Economic forum and I

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.451
have one piece of advice and that is exercise,
but exercise three things.

00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:15.170
First of all, if you are lucky enough to live
somewhere in the world where you can vote,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.940
exercise you right to vote.
Because that is one of the most important

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.789
things we can do to improve our global citizenship.
Second thing is exercise kindness.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.900
Certainly on a day to day basis there's something
that each of us can do to exhibit kindness,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.110
whether it's locally or globally.
And lastly, just exercise.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.200
All of us at CDC know that that is the most
important thing you can do to protect your

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.210
health.
So have fun and exercise.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.930
Thank You
