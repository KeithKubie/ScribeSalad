(Psych2Go's Intro)

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.120
Being an introvert comes with many struggles.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.560
But introverts normally often internalise their problems.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.320
Mainly because they don't want to be misunderstood more than they already are.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.300
We want you to know that you are not suffering alone.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.460
Here are 5 problems introverts only understand.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.600
1.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.060
When you really want to be alone for awhile, but you're afraid to tell your friends to leave you alone

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.760
because you don't want to hurt their feelings.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.480
Even if you phrase it in a friendly manner,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.520
how do you know they won't feel offended?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.820
It's always a hidden miss-situation.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.480
Especially if you have highly extroverted friends that always want to hang-out.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.860
Although they can be understanding and supportive,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.860
they may go home feeling stifled, bored and low-key rejected

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.400
You enjoy their company and always have a blast when you get together,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.920
but you can't help the fact that your battery drains quicker than theirs.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.320
As of result,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.200
you're constantly torn between taking care of yourself

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.280
versus keeping your friends happy.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.340
2.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.280
When someone you don't know tries to engage in small talk and your answers are simple and to the point.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.260
You're already cringing because it's small talk.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.860
But hearing yourself present simple answers that don't add any flare to the conversation

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.440
makes you feel even worse.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.980
It's a sinking ship.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.980
Unless you quickly do something about it.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.480
As a result,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.200
you're often torn between taking action or letting the conversation fade until the person gets the hint.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.300
Either way,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.440
it adds pressure on you to make the decision;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.300
which is incredibly frustrating.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.320
3.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.820
You've been invited to multiple parties and now you actually have to go because you've given too many excuses.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.240
You've already used: the flu, house chores, family death and your other plans as excuses.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.180
But how many more times can you use them until they lose their credibility?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.080
So now you feel obligated to attend because you don't want to come of rude or insensitive to your friend's invitation.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.480
You try to relax, and have fun; but after a while,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.180
things start to get overwhelming.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.920
Halfway through the night, you try to come up with excuses to leave early.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.840
Sometimes, you wonder if you should've enlisted yourself in acting school.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.920
You'd do anything to experience the relief of curling up in your bed just to get away from it all.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.360
4.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.600
Presentations.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.780
'Nuff said.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.560
Although introverts can be some of the best motivational speakers and move people by their words,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.720
sometimes,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.700
getting up in front of a large crowd can be highly intimidating.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.340
Especially for those who identify as anxious introverts.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.620
Doing presentations often feels out of their element

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.040
because they don't enjoy being the centre of attention.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.300
So, when they find themselves in the spotlight,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.740
their worst nightmares are breathed into life.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.240
Generally,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.080
introverts prefer making things happen behind the scenes

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.780
and would rather observe on the side lines instead of actively participating.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.000
Although it may seem like they aren't doing much on the surface,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.140
they actually have rich inner lives that are usually more fulfilling than everyday life.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.600
5.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.260
People you've just met think you're self-absorbed or stuck-up

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.720
because you don't talk or share your life-story right away.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.340
You're not used to revealing so much about yourself right from the start.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.040
You're not trying to be mysterious or play-hard-to-get on purpose.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.020
It's just not your cup of tea to be so readily transparent.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.520
It takes time for your to warm up to others.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.640
You want to make connections and belong just like anyone else; but it's a slow, gradual process.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.940
As a result,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.720
others may consider you aloof or stuck-up,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.820
or you're actually just waiting for the right moment to open up.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.240
Do any of these problems resonate with you?

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.960
