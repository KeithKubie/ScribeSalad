00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:00.650
[LAUGH]

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.850
Notice that most of the traits we see in the list here,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.290
are things that I might even know about already. You know my ear

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.940
wax type, or my bitter taste perception, lactose intolerance. You know, are

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.660
are there any traits we can look at that I wouldn't already know?

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.630
&gt;&gt; Well, you might not be aware of whether you have HIV resistance.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.980
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.890
&gt;&gt; So and we what we'll, that is where we look at the CCR 5 gene.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.634
&gt;&gt; Right here.

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:26.520
&gt;&gt; Well we learned about the CCR 5 in less than 6.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.900
It says here that I'm not resistant.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.610
&gt;&gt; That's right. So, it's going to look at your actual genotype and here it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.710
says II. where the D indicates the deletion, the delta 32 deletion. So

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.400
people can have two deletions. They can

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.680
have deletion and the opposite of deletion

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.550
is the insertion. So you basically, I mean if you don't have the deletion,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.480
you, which is called insertion. So you just

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.470
have both, two intact copies of the gene.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.270
&gt;&gt; Now if.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.210
&gt;&gt; And therefore you're not resistant to HIV infection.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.680
&gt;&gt; So in this case, if the person, if an

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.340
individual needs two copies of the deletion to be resistant to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.710
HIV infection, is this deletion or the delta 32 that we

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.010
learned about in lesson six. Would it be dominant or recessive?
