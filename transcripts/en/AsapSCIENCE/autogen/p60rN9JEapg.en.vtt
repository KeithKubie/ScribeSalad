00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
 It's school time! 

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.000
 No wonder that many of us 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 They are determined to study acumen instead of studying for a long time. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.840
 But no tips and tricks study 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.560
 He works scientifically, 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.040
 Can you help you get full scores? 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.660
 The first step, research proved that the study sessions 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.400
 They are more effective when broken down into small, short parts. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.160
 Instead of stuffing your mind with information for ten hours in one session, 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.040
 Of the most effective division 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.060
 To sessions of twenty or thirty minutes over a few weeks. 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.180
 This is because your mind works better 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.860
 In coding information with neural connections 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.060
 In short, repetitive sessions unlike a long study session. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.500
 So, even learning different skills, 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.980
 Whether he studied swimming, tennis, or singing 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.280
 This method is often applied. 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.560
 While studying and staying up all night 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.460
 It may be a reduction, 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.060
 But it turned out to be associated with the lowest scores. 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.380
 After long night study sessions, 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.800
 Your thinking and memory may be negatively affected 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.840
 For a full four days. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.940
 Instead, create specific times per day, 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.400
 Or during the week, only to study 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.300
 Bring your mind through the creation of a routine 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.280
 Over time, the study becomes easier, 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 Because your mind is trained to study at those moments. 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 While many of us spend hours 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.160
 To read our memoirs in a negative way or to identify the important things in the book, 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.640
 Studies have proven that this is ineffective. 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.840
 This does not improve your understanding of the topics. 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.000
 And does not link key concepts together. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 It may even have a harmful effect, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.520
 It attracts your interest to less important information. 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.220
 On the other hand, memorizing cards, 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.060
 Installed as excellent tools to enhance memory 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.560
 Whether you read it during your scheduled study times, 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.340
 Or during your free time; for example, while you are on the bus home. 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.680
 It is also useful to have a specific goal 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.960
 Per study session. 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.120
 Instead of studying in a random way, 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.900
 Select an aspect to focus on 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.760
 Whether balancing chemical equations, 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.140
 Or learn how to conduct French verbs. 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.060
 If you can not explain the subject in a simplified way, 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.720
 It means you do not understand the subject well. 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.820
 A study was conducted where requested 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.380
 Of individuals reading a piece 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.660
 Then half of them were told 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.980
 That they will test about the piece, 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.200
 While the other half were told 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 That they would have to teach them to other students 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.880
 Participants who are taught, 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.440
 They did a good job of understanding key points. 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.060
 When education requires you, 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060
 Your mind regulates information 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.740
 In a more coherent and logical manner. 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.740
 Of course... 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.920
 training! training! training! 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.800
 Do not train on tests and focus your mind in the atmosphere of tests, 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.480
 Even if mistakes were made, 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.320
 It will help you identify gaps in your knowledge. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.140
 Studies have also proven that training on tests 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.160
 Boosts confidence, 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
 As a result it performs better. 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 So, where should you study? 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.080
 Studies have proven that owning a place 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.620
 A single study, 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.500
 Well equipped, 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.560
 Each tool you may need is the most appropriate place. 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.960
 Just as the times were created, 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.760
 This brings your mind to study. 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.780
 Do you have an amazing playlist to study? 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.060
 Slow down a bit. 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.580
 While some studies have proven that 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.320
 Some types of classical music are selected 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.520
 Can help to increase focus, 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.180
 However, a recent study has shown that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180
 Study while listening to rhythmic sounds in the background 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.780
 It can be distracted to focus 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.520
 And those who did not listen to music 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.320
 Think better. 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.680
 If you have not already done so, 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.340
 Put your phone aside! 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.540
 This does not require deep reflection, 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.940
 But your text message messages and social networking sites 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.420
 Decrease your concentration significantly. 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.920
 Of course, the tests can be worrisome, 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.240
 So if you want some advice 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.240
 About how to deal with anxiety tests
