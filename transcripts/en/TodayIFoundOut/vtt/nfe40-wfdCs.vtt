00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:30.140
“Twin films” is the term used to describe
a peculiar Hollywood phenomenon that just

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.580
about every year sees different major studios
releasing movies with almost identical plots

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.850
and themes to their competitors current offerings.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.579
Popular examples of twin films include Deep
Impact and Armageddon, two films released

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.810
within weeks of one another that centred around
saving the world from a giant meteor.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.230
Other popular examples include A Bug’s Life
and Antz – animated films about ants rebelling

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.440
against their hive.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.719
Then there’s Dante’s Inferno and Volcano
– both of which are disaster films about

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:57.860
volcanic eruptions.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.399
(As an idea of how common this is in Hollywood,
all of these films were released between 1997

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.439
and 1998.)

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.060
Or how about Chasing Liberty and First Daughter,
two romantic comedies released in 2004 centered

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.579
around the idea of the romantic escapades
of the President’s rebellious teenage daughter.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.490
Sticking with the White House, we have the
March 22, 2013 release of Olympus Has Fallen

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.159
followed by the shockingly similar June 8,
2013 film White House Down, which, to be fair,

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.560
are both mostly just “Die Hard in the White
House”.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.130
While it’s tempting to think this is something
of a modern phenomenon deriving from the popular

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.239
meme that Hollywood has run out of ideas,
in truth, twin films are as old as the film

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.340
industry itself.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.479
So how do these come about?

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.249
It turns out there are a variety of things
that may result in a twin film, with everything

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.090
from corporate espionage to pure coincidence
coming into play.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.419
For example, one of the most famous films
of all time, Gone With the Wind, is also one

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.729
of the most noteworthy twin films in history.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.090
In this case, famed actress Bette Davis failed
to secure the role of Scarlett O’Hara in

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.629
MGM’s Gone With the Wind.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.790
Looking to make their own Civil War film,
Warner Brothers snapped up the rights to a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.800
Broadway play called Jezebel, which, like
Gone With the Wind, was all about a fiercely

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.939
independent southern woman during the Civil
War.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.819
They then cast Davis in the title role and
slapped together a film as quickly as possible

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.700
in order to get it out before Gone With the
Wind.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.980
They were successful in this endeavor, with
the film being a hit and Davis even winning

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.150
an Oscar for her role in the movie.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.599
However, while Jezebel was well received,
it was soon eclipsed by its twin film, Gone

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.100
With the Wind, which would set a record for
the most Academy Awards and nominations, sell

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.549
around 25 million tickets from 1939-1940,
and then be re-issued in 1941 and 1942 bringing

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.860
the total up to just shy of an astounding
60 million tickets sold.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.400
This made it the highest grossing film ever
made up to that point.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.830
In fact, it is still generally considered
such after adjusting for inflation.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.109
(To be fair to recent films like Avatar that
have come close to the mark when adjusting

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.909
for inflation, Gone With the Wind has been
re-released many times over the years continuing

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:27.209
to pad the numbers; without those re-releases,
it would no longer hold the top spot; so it’s

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.790
possible many decades from now a few of those
other films might surpass it if they ultimately

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.099
show some semblance of staying power.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.160
Although, I don’t think anyone’s holding
their breath about the current #6, Furious

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.139
7, benefiting from a flurry of re-releases
over the coming decades…)

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.389
In any event, other twin films alleged to
have surfaced as a result of intentional corporate

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.690
shenanigans include the aforementioned Deep
Impact and Armageddon, largely because the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.739
latter film mysteriously went into production
just weeks after Deep Impact was announced.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.999
A lawsuit was threatened as a result, but
ultimately nothing ever came of it.

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:08.469
Likewise, it’s long been rumored that the
idea for the Dreamworks film Antz was stolen

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.900
from Disney by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the then
CEO of the studio.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.849
Prior to working for Dreamworks, Katzenberg
had worked for Disney and it’s alleged that

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.340
when he jumped ship, he took an idea Disney
had been working on about an animated film

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.099
about a non-conformist ant and made it his
own.

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.290
Again, nothing ever came of the allegations
and it’s still not clear which studio had

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.750
the idea first.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.889
Another reason for twins films coming to be
is just timing of some event or the like.

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.440
For example, this is the proposed explanation
for why Hollywood decided to release two competing

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.599
movies chronicling the life of Christopher
Columbus in 1992.

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.819
These movies, 1492: Conquest of Paradise and
Christopher Columbus: The Discovery were both

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:54.280
advertised as celebrating the 500th anniversary
of the “discovery” of America.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.949
(See: The Truth About Christopher Columbus)

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.070
Twin films can also arise as a result of studios
wanting to cover or delve into the same currently

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.270
en vogue topic at the time, but not necessarily
having been inspired by the knowledge that

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.680
another studio was working on something similar.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.210
(With the number of people working on movies,
studios pretty much always know what other

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.330
studios are developing at any given moment,
whether they widely announce a project or

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.330
not.)

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.669
Notable examples of this are the films The
Truman Show and EDtv released in 1998 and

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.860
1999 respectively.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.020
Both of these were made, as the British Film
Institute puts it, as a direct result of an

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.180
attempt to: “tap into the fascination with
the then-nascent reality television”.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.460
Then you have studios simply noticing that
a particular genre of film is popular at a

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.720
given time and attempting to cash in on the
trend.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.090
A great example is the year 1979 during which
five different Dracula movies were released,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.151
the most notable being Nosferatu the Vampyre
and Dracula- both of which weren’t just

00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:58.370
simple retellings of Bram Stoker’s original
Gothic masterpiece, but adaptations of previous

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.370
adaptations of his work.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.430
So the next time someone complains about the
supposedly “new” notion of Hollywood running

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.599
out of ideas based on recent offerings seeming
to be a slurry of remakes, just remind them

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:17.000
that at the end of the 1970s, studios released
five Dracula movies in quick succession, two

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.110
of which were remakes of existing Dracula
movies.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.099
Remakes upon remakes has always been the order
of the day going all the way back to silent

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.470
films, which were often just remakes of stage-shows,
books, other silent films, etc.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.660
A noteworthy early example of this is the
1939 Wizard of Oz staring Judy Garland.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.389
While you might be aware that it is based
on a book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:44.460
in 1900, you probably aren’t aware that,
beyond previous Broadway musical adaptations,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.740
the 1939 Wizard of Oz was something of a remake
of the 1925 film The Wizard of Oz.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.900
Yes, it took Hollywood just 14 years to decide
that modifying the story a bit and adding

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.889
a dash of new technology made making The Wizard
of Oz again a great idea.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.479
Originality has never been the name of the
game in Hollywood- adapting existing works

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:10.039
of various sorts has always been more of the
rule than the exception.

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:12.629
Modern cinema is no different in this respect.

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:16.449
Now, as you’d expect for an industry where
ego and self-aggrandizement are celebrated,

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:21.320
even when studios learn that a rival is planning
to release a movie with an almost identical

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.580
premise, they seldom back down to divert resources
into more unique offerings, which is a key

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.039
reason so many of these films are released
so close to one another.

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:36.060
A notable exception is the 1974 film The Towering
Inferno.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.910
The movie originally began life as two different
projects optioned by Warner Bros and Twentieth

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:46.810
Century Fox respectively following the success
of disaster movie, The Poseidon Adventure.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.680
After being outbid by Warner Bros for the
rights to a novel about a burning skyscraper

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.889
called The Tower, Fox attempted to steal their
thunder by purchasing the rights to a book

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:00.289
with an almost identical premise called The
Glass Inferno.

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:04.449
Both studios were set to make their own version
of the film, each starring big named actors,

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:08.659
with Warner Bros pegging Paul Newman for the
lead and Fox doing the same with Steve McQueen.

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:13.370
However, before production began, producer
Irwin Allen convinced executives from both

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.220
studios that there was no scenario in which
either studio would win if they decided to

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.539
compete with one another at the box office.

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:25.840
Instead, he proposed that they combine resources
to make a single, super film about a giant

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.159
flaming building.

00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:31.659
Not only would ceasing to compete on this
one help revenue while reducing overall cost

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:36.520
for each studio, but they could even have
both Newman and McQueen starring in it.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.110
The two studios agreed and terms were quickly
drawn up, with the historic union being formally

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.530
announced in a press release in October of
1973 that read:

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.930
It’s as though General Motors and Chrysler
combined their respective brainpower and manpower

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.720
and went Dutch treat on the bill to produce
a new model automobile.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.000
As for the film’s title, an agreement was
reached to combine the titles of the two novels

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.130
that served as inspiration for the film- so,
The Tower and The Glass Inferno became The

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.310
Towering Inferno…

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.850
In the end, the film was a massive hit, grossing
approximately ten times its production budget

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.360
and was nominated for eight Academy Awards,
of which it won three.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.360
Of course, although twin films are still just
as popular today as they were decades ago-

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360
seeing as in 2017 alone we’ve had competing
biopics about both Winston Churchill (Churchill

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.360
and Darkest Hour) and Tommy Wiseau (The Disaster
Artist and Best F(r)iends)- the current “in

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360
thing” in Hollywood appears to be aping
the idea of shared cinematic universes, in

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360
a not so-subtle attempt to emulate the success
of Marvel.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.360
(But seemingly always choosing, unlike Marvel,
to make cinematic universes darker and darker

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.360
as their stamp on their blow-em-up world ending
sagas, rather than Marvel’s choice of keeping

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.360
things generally light-hearted, even in their
films’ darkest moments- essentially never

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360
taking themselves and their brand of world-ending
plots too seriously.)

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.360
Examples of films launched recently that were
intended to be a jumping off point for a shared

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.360
cinematic universe include King Arthur: Legend
of the Sword (2017) and The Mummy (2017),

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.190
both of which failed to meet box office expectations
and resulted in plans for additional films

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.190
to be shelved.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.190
(A temporary setback; they’ll surely try
again and again.)

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.330
Meanwhile, a few years ago Hollywood was all
about adapting books aimed at young adults

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.760
into potential epic series, examples including
Divergent, The Maze Runner, Eragon, The Vampire’s

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.330
Assistant, Vampire Academy, A Series of Unfortunate
Events, and the Percy Jackson films- all of

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.280
which were an attempt to emulate the success
of similar offerings like Harry Potter, The

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.210
Twilight Saga, and The Hunger Games films.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:54.050
Looking to the future, it appears that twin
films are very much going to remain a part

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.660
of the cinematic landscape with, for instance,
there being at least half a dozen Robin Hood

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.670
films in development right now, including
one that’s supposed to be the launch pad

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.500
for a new shared cinematic universe…

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.420
Just for fun, we can only hope that studio
execs take a leaf out of Warner Bros and Fox’s

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:17.020
1974 playbook and decide to combine their
resources to make a single, giant Robin Hood

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.670
movie starring every major actor in Hollywood-
a feat Marvel seems to be presently striving

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.890
for anyway in their own little universe, which…

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:32.200
*lightbulb* Robin Hood as the backstory for
Marvel’s Hawkeye in a first step to bring

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:44.750
all cinematic universes from every film ever
made into 

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.850
one single megaverse.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:11:41.420
Just saying, I’d pay to see Inigo Montoya
as a member of 

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.120
the Avengers.
