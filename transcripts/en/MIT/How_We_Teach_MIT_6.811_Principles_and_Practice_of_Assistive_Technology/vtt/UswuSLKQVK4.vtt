00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.890
GRACE TEO: Having our students
be prepared to face failure

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.530
is really important,
because I think

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.435
it's essential to
the design process.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.410
Professor Rob Miller
came in to do a lecture

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920
on user-centered
design, very early

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.430
on in the semester,
where we basically

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.330
presented them this design model
where you do iterative design.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.600
Which means you quickly
come up with a prototype,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.734
you fail as fast as
possible, you figure out

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.400
where everything's
going wrong, and then

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.740
you make a second prototype.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.240
And you keep going around and
around and around this circle,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.320
until you reach that
perfect prototype

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.060
at the end of the day.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.740
And so I think they
knew from the start

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.270
that they were going
to have to just keep

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.410
making things and seeing how
they were going to go wrong.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.570
So failure became very
[? intrinsic ?] part

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.569
of the design process.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.360
In fact, we told them
right from the start,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.390
we expect you to have
three prototypes at least

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.080
by the end of the semester.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.670
And these are when your
prototypes should be ready by,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.390
and these are the weeks where
you will get to test them.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.170
And every week they had to
come back and tell the mentors

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.810
where things went well, and
where things didn't go well,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.910
according to some set
of success metrics.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.410
WILLIAM LI: Yeah,
I think the design

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.640
review of these mid-term
panels were really just that.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.225
To try to get feedback
on the design,

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:31.370
or really explain the progress
that they had made so far,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.030
and so I think that was a
big reason why we did that.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.190
I think having mentors this
year was helpful on this front

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.690
as well.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.200
The mentors were pretty
in touch with how

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.090
teams were progressing.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.840
We had each team fill out
this little form every week

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.330
explaining what was going well
and what they needed help with.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.750
So a big part of it was
creating the culture

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.480
that it doesn't have to go
perfectly well every week.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.370
There can be setbacks, there
can be different challenges

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.590
or obstacles to overcome.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.910
But we're here to
work through them

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.440
and figure out how to
deal with this situation,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.359
or brainstorm some ideas.

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:10.900
One of the other
things that we tried

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.410
this year was to
have these lightning

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.230
updates at the end
of every week's lab,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.200
just to inform the rest
of class where you're at,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.460
and what you were trying,
what progress you were making.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.510
I think this maybe
set up a little bit

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.290
of friendly competition, to see
where other projects are at.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.840
But it also helped
maybe the class

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.640
feel like we're all in
this together, I suppose.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.440
It's not always
going to be easy.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.450
Maybe there's
logistics challenges.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.140
Maybe there's design challenges.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.210
Maybe there's other
sorts of things.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.380
So I think students were
pretty open to sharing honestly

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.390
what their progress was,
and what they were doing.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.452
At least that's
what we tried to do.

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:03.660
GRACE TEO: We did get feedback
from students, though,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.570
that the lightning updates
might have been too regular.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.730
And they did say that it would
have been nice to have it once

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.460
every two weeks
instead of every week,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.680
and that would just
give them more time

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.410
to work together as a team.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.470
And we realized too
that, for our students,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.837
being able to do group
work outside of class

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:24.420
is actually difficult
because they all

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.180
have such busy schedules.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.210
So any time they structured
a time within a class

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.040
to just do group work together,
that was really valuable

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.720
for them.
