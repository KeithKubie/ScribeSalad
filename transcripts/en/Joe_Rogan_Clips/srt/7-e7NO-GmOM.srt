1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,530
In them. What does, I mean it's some sort
of chemical now, no other antigens, right?

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,460
They're, they're, they're fluid back
macromolecules. What's the liquids?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,280
Typically it would be saline or saltwater.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,640
And right now,
um,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,120
what is missing from
today's vaccine protocol,

6
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:24,120
if anything in terms of diseases
we should be vaccinating for.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,100
But yeah, there's certainly are,
um, you know, one of them is a big,

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,990
big problem among young infants,
especially premature infants called RSV,

9
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:38,730
respiratory syncytial virus infection.
What does that come from? It, it's um,

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,210
you know, it's a respiratory virus that
peaks around the same time that flu does.

11
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:46,860
So it's a very severe respiratory illness.
So this is again,

12
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,320
one of those vaccines
that's not a big moneymaker.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,210
So the bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation is trying to, uh,

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,490
provide grants for supporting that one,
that that's a good one.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,120
And then there are all the
diseases that affect poor people,

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,460
both in developing countries that even
among the point in the United States,

17
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:06,130
that was the subject of this book.
That's,

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,270
that's the next one called the
marble health. The next one.

19
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,760
So this is not released yet.
This is out. This actually,

20
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,610
this actually preceded the,
Oh look at this one now.

21
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:19,611
This book is all about poor people and
infectious diseases and that the rise of

22
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:23,640
these infectious diseases even in the
United States. That's right. So you know,

23
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:28,370
when we think about, so I, you know, let,

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,970
let this big campaign to raise awareness
of somebody call neglected tropical

25
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,910
diseases or NTDs.

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,450
These are the most common afflictions
of people living in poverty. Um,

27
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,070
I called them the most important disease.

28
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:46,071
You've never heard of their diseases like
schistosomiasis and chagas disease and

29
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:51,231
leishmaniasis and had been devoting
my life to seeing if we could develop

30
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,960
vaccines for those diseases in
the nonprofit sector. You know,

31
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:58,710
because the big pharmaceutical
companies just don't see,

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,180
just aren't going to take these on.

33
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,200
So we're trying to do in the
nonprofit sector. But this book,

34
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:09,030
the Blue Marble health book came out of
some number crunching that I did using

35
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,720
data from the World Health Organization
or something called the Institute for

36
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:16,380
health metrics and evaluation, which
is based in Seattle, Washington.

37
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,660
That found something very surprising.

38
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:23,661
And that is most of the world's poverty
related diseases are not necessarily in

39
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,440
the poorest,
most devastated countries of Africa,

40
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,280
meaning like Democratic Republic of
Congo or Central African Republic.

41
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,980
They're there,
but on a numbers basis,

42
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,200
most of these poverty related diseases
are actually in the g 20 economies,

43
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,760
the 20 wealthiest economies,
um, together with Nigeria,

44
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:46,170
which is not a g 20 country,

45
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:49,080
but it has an economy bigger
than the bottom three or four.

46
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,360
So that was pretty amazing. Amazing for
me to find that out. Because you know,

47
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,630
at first I didn't believe the
numbers because I said, well,

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,860
how could it be if their poverty diseases,

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,290
why are they in the 20
wealthiest economies?

50
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,270
And then I realized that it's among
the poor living in wealthy countries.

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,370
So the poorest of the rich today now
account for most of the world's poverty

52
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:16,540
related diseases. And what,
what's the cause of this?

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,270
So why, why the link with poverty?
So that's a great question.

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,420
One of the things I do in the
book is I asked that, well,

55
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:26,530
what is it about poverty that's making
susceptible? I don't think we really know.

56
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,830
I mean, clearly in some
cases, if you live in poor,

57
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,350
dilapidated housing
without window screens,

58
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,360
things like mosquitoes and kissing bugs
and sandflies can get inside the house.

59
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,470
Or if you look, um, in,
in poor neighborhoods,

60
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,790
like in and around Houston,

61
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,110
you see a lot of environmental degradation
or around the neighborhood you see

62
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:51,430
discarded tires that breed, it is
chipped. I mosquito or standing water.

63
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,870
But I don't, I don't think what, what,
what did the tires do? Discard. So yeah.

64
00:03:55,871 --> 00:04:00,871
So one of the best habitats for the
mosquito that transmits Danky and Zika and

65
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,790
Chikungunya and yellow
fever are discarded tires.

66
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,290
That's what they love. So this, you
know, if you go into poor neighborhoods,

67
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,590
you'll see a lot of tire dumping
for instance. And that's,

68
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,530
those are habitats for that
eighties Aegypti mosquito,

69
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,330
including in southern California.

70
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,580
Was that when the water gets in the
tightest around a little bit of water?

71
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,030
That's exactly it. Yeah. You know,

72
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,780
I moved into a house once in a Encino
down the street from here in fact.

73
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,640
And um, no one had lived in the
house for about a year. And a half,

74
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:37,780
two years and the pool had not been taken
care of and I went out into the pool

75
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,010
and it was green and there were
schools of mosquito Skeeto heaven.

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
Mosquito head is so strange.
So yeah, absolutely.

77
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:50,200
You go into poor neighborhoods, abandoned
swimming pools, things like that. That's,

78
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,170
that's where we're getting
a number of these diseases.

79
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,660
We don't have very many
mosquitoes in southern California.

80
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,870
I mean it's really kind of amazing in
that regard. Like, well it depends.

81
00:04:58,871 --> 00:04:59,590
So you know,

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,520
some counties where they do aggressive
spraying and things like that, you won't.

83
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,790
But many counties you probably,
probably some of the poorer counties,

84
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,440
poor districts you still do.

85
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,560
But I mean in terms of the
way it is on the east coast,

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,980
like I grew up in Boston and then
the summertime you just have fucking

87
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,590
mosquitoes everywhere.
They just can't get away from him.

88
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,780
And then I've been to Alaska,

89
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:22,750
which is the craziest place I've ever
been to in my life in terms of mosquitoes.

90
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:25,090
Right. Have you been? I
haven't been to Alaska,

91
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:30,070
but you get out of your car and they
attack you like a hoard of birds because

92
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,000
they only get one month of the
senior. Exactly. Yeah, they have.

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,470
So they're super aggressive and they are,
they're also very large.

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,220
The big problems along the Gulf coast
of the U s we have that aid is jipped by

95
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,980
mosquito and that's why I got
so worried about Zika virus.

96
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,210
The Gulf coast of the u s yeah.
Um,

97
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,360
mosquitoes and other countries
obviously contain malaria. I mean,

98
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:52,710
we've been very fortunate that that's
never made it over to here. Well, no, we,

99
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,010
we used to have malaria used to be
widespread in the United States. Um,

100
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,560
both the one that was a real killer
disease called Falciparum Malaria on the

101
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:06,920
Gulf coast and even up into
Illinois and the Ohio River valley.

102
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,850
We had a lot of malaria. When was that?
By five x in the 18 hundreds. In fact,

103
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:11,360
there's a whole,

104
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,170
there's a book written by Dickens when
he visited the United States called

105
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,160
Martin chuzzlewit.
No.

106
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:20,390
When he describes all of these
sickly people in Illinois and Cairo,

107
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,960
Illinois on the confluence of the
Mississippi in the higher river.

108
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,000
He's clearly describing malaria.
Wow. I did not know. Yeah.

109
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,850
So what stopped it? So that's
a great question. Um, we,

110
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,040
so there's actually a very nice book
written by a medical historian that Duke

111
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,250
University named Margaret Humphreys
called malaria race and poverty.

112
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,560
And she has a hypothesis but I think
she's onto something that um, it,

113
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,990
the decreased the malaria dropped in
associated with aggressive economic

114
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:55,991
development so that the FDRs new deal
included something called the Agricultural

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,680
Adjustment Act that got people off of,

116
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,000
off of with agrarian pursuits
and put them into factories.

117
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,030
Quality housing went up and
that's probably what caused
a lot of the reduction

118
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:13,550
in these tropical diseases. Remember
they're really diseases of poverty.

119
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,660
In fact I spent a lot of time working
in China and I'm seeing that play out

120
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:20,810
right now in China.
You know China is cuts is very,

121
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,330
very aggressive program
of economic development,

122
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:25,130
mostly in the eastern part of the country,

123
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,240
but in the southwest part of the country
go into you non Sichuan provinces.

124
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,170
You go back in time 75 years and you
still see those diseases. So spread.

125
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,310
Do you think that the best cure or the
best way to stop malaria would be just to

126
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,850
increase the economy of these areas in
Africa where they're experiencing it at?

127
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,620
Clearly economic development
is a very potent driver.

128
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,660
Now what it is about economic development,

129
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,520
we still don't have our
arms around that yet,

130
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:51,710
but economic development
is very important.

131
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:55,700
Just like for the neglected tropical
diseases we study. But you know,

132
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:59,480
unfortunately for many countries economic
development is still decades away.

133
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:03,200
So that's why, that's the rationale
for developing these vaccines.

134
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,710
Is it because of economic development
moves people into more urban environments

135
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,920
where there's less tropical diseases?
I think that's part of it.

136
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:13,130
Although now we're seeing some
tropical diseases thrive and urbanized

137
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:16,850
environments like you know, yellow
fever and Zika and dengue. He as well.

138
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,530
So it's not only urbanization,

139
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,820
you have has to be urbanization with
good planning that's not done unchecked,

140
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:26,510
that outstrips the infrastructure
in terms of water and sanitation.

141
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,990
So this brings me to the thing that I
wanted to talk to you about in the first

142
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:33,560
place. Cause this is what you brought
up to me. Um, when we were doing this,

143
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:35,780
a sci fi show, and, uh,

144
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,020
you said something to me that
has been haunting me ever since,

145
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,380
that the vast majority of people that
live in tropical climates have parasites.

146
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,620
[inaudible] vast at jar. Yep,
that's right. That's right.

147
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,090
There's things like Toxoplasma Gondii.
And so let's look at the,

148
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,500
let's look at the hit parade,
right?

149
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,640
The top one is one called
ascariasis intestinal roundworm. Uh,

150
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,370
the estimates are on 800 million people
have asked Russ Ron worms in their

151
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:05,010
bellies. Whoa. So hunter,

152
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,630
so more than one in 10
people on the planet,

153
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,630
and mostly people who live
in extreme poverty, um,

154
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,400
400 million have hookworm infection.
400 million have whipped warrants.

155
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:21,510
A lot of these are wormy diseases.
200 million people with scabies,

156
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:26,500
which is an ecto parasite on, on the
skin that causes terrible itching and,

157
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:30,900
and secondary bacterial infections.
Just to surmise, this is another one.

158
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,190
The point is every,

159
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:36,570
almost every single person who is
an extreme poverty has one of these,

160
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,210
what I call neglected tropical diseases.

161
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,900
And one of the interesting features
about them is they're very debilitating.

162
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:46,020
They not, so that not only
occur in the setting of poverty,

163
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,500
but I think they reinforce poverty
because they make people too sick to go to

164
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,360
work. They make a, they actually shape,

165
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,040
we can show they shave Iq points off
of kids when they have them. Well,

166
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:01,041
this is the hookworm connection to the
idea of the slack jawed dumb southerner,

167
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,310
right, right, right. States of America.

168
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,830
And now one of the things that we have
found, so ray Dalio Mahia on my faculty,

169
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:08,490
uh,

170
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,810
working with environmental activist named
Catherine Coleman flowers in Alabama

171
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:17,280
found that hook where Ms. Little present
and Alabama. So among the poor people,

172
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:20,790
so they understand what we're talking
about. Because for the longest time,

173
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,420
there was this stereotype about
people that lived in the south,

174
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,760
that they were dull minded,
right.

175
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:31,440
And that this could be directly
connected to hook worm infection,

176
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:34,590
which had run rampant. Right. There
was even the term given called,

177
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,270
they call it the germ of laziness,

178
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:39,720
then hookworm infection because
it causes severe anemia.

179
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,600
So if you're walking around with terrible
anemia, of course you're agreeing to,

180
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,443
you're to,

181
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,000
you're not feeling up to working a
full day and all that sort of stuff.

182
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,950
So hookworm was wildly president,

183
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,970
president in the southeastern United
States at the turn of the 20th century.

184
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
And then as malaria went down
with economic development, so,

185
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,930
so did hookworm infection as well.
But we still have pockets in this country.

186
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,120
And this was an understood at the time,
right?

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,320
They didn't know that these people
were infected with hookworm for, for,

188
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,860
for forever. No, up until very recently.

189
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:14,220
So the cause of hookworm wasn't
discovered until 1900 what is that?

190
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:18,320
Cause it's called indicator Americaness
the American killer as that.

191
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,440
And that's the name of the worm.

192
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,390
And this is from walking barefoot or
that goes in through the hands or enters

193
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,650
all parts of the body. So it's very common
to get it from walking barefoot. Right.

194
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,860
Which was more common in the south. Right,
right. So that's one of the diseases.

195
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:35,940
We've made a vaccine for this
now in clinical trials. Yeah.

196
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:39,270
When I found that one out, I was
like, oh my God. Well that's it.

197
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:41,880
That totally makes sense.
Because for the longest time was there,

198
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,080
there was that stereotype.

199
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,340
And then when you find out that it's
directly connected to a massive infection

200
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:51,900
of this disease, this worm, so these
are the diseases that are holding back,

201
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,250
people who live in poverty.

202
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,770
And originally I thought only in places
like the poorest countries in sub

203
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,600
Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia,

204
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,220
but now I realize it's these pockets
of poverty across the entire planet,

205
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,180
that people are affected by these diseases
and these diseases can be vaccinated.

206
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,580
That's where we're trying to prove
that we can make a vaccine against.

207
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:13,660
And there is a hooker and vaccine
right now in clinical trials. Yeah.

208
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,610
Just in clinical trials.
