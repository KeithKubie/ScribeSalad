00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.640
Is there some evolutionary reason why dogs
eat out of a bag?

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.350
Can we just feed the dang dog our leftovers?!

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.390
Let's SCIENCE THIS THING!

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.160
Hey pet people!

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340
This is DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.200
Dogs are probably the oldest domesticated
animal, with mitochondrial DNA evidence suggesting

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.280
they split from wolves 100,000 years ago[a].

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.500
At the time, humans didn't have extra food
laying around, and would usually kill competing

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.270
carnivores like wolves.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.930
Smaller, less-aggressive wolves would likely
scavenge near human encampments, eating from

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.070
trash piles and snatching leftovers.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.430
Over generations, humans purposefully fed
the cuter, friendlier wolves, and we set ourselves

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.500
on a path of domestication to create the dog.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.280
But, if dogs evolved alongside humans, as
evidence suggests, then they were eating the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.219
same things we were eating!

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.710
But today, Americans often avoid giving dogs,
"People Food," so what changed?

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.520
In short, nothing.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.000
As dogs and humans grew together, we shared
food.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.570
But, as human society advanced and pet ownership
grew, we couldn't simply feed them table scraps

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.570
in our cave.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.360
In 116 BCE, Marcus Terentius Varro wrote a
farming manual which included advice for feeding

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.189
working farm dogs -- barley bread soaked in
milk, and bones from dead sheep.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.380
During the middle ages, common families who
needed work dogs, fed them whatever was leftover

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.430
-- so we're still following that ancient system
-- but by the 19th century, Empress Tzu Hsi

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.960
of China fed her dogs shark fins, quail breasts
and antelope milk, and the royalty of Europe

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.700
fed their pups roast duck, cakes and candies.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.130
The rich got kinda cray with their puppy chow.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.000
During the Industrial Age, dog food started
to show up in the West as the middle class

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
prospered.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.500
As they cost both money and time, pets were
considered a luxury item, and people wanted

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.110
to show off their climbing of the socioeconomic
ladder by purchasing a prime pooch.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.210
Entrepreneurs learned these nouveau caninophiles
needed help to feed their new friends -- and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.470
in the 1850s James Sprat of Cincinnati invented
dog biscuits from wheat, beet root and vegetables,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.079
bound with beef blood.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.090
The dry food was a hit, and by the 1920s canned
wet food was also in production -- it was

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.879
mainly horse meat, and by 1941 canned food
was 90% of the market.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.409
Then due to rationing during World War II,
dry food became hugely popular again.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.730
At the same time, people around the world
still fed their dogs what they evolved to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.659
eat, table scraps and leftover people food.

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.439
In the 1960s, to protect and grow their giant
industry, the Pet Food Institute, a lobbying

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:44.501
group for pet food -- campaigned the American
people by funding "scientific studies" and

00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:49.340
running radio and TV ads touting the "dangers
of table scraps."

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.469
Thus, we began to shy away from feeding dogs
the same things we were eating.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:01.090
However, dogs CAN EAT people food if it's
healthy.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.010
They probably shouldn't eat fast food, or
a mass of cheese (a little is okay), or candy…

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.449
But on the other hand, if you're eating roasted
chicken, green beans and potatoes…

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.699
Table scraps might not be so bad.

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:17.699
Dogs can safely eat flax, green beans, eggs,
pumpkins, peanut butter, carrots, apple slices,

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:18.930
and sweet potatoes…

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.249
But they CAN'T eat chocolate, coffee, yeast,
alcohol.

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.189
They can eat grains, but they're better off
with meats.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.430
And that's not entirely off from where the
pet food industry is going.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.599
These days, you can buy luxury dog food akin
to those Victorian princes and empresses -- duck,

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.459
squash, salmon, turkey and berries.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.589
It's literally just PEOPLE food in dog packaging.

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:43.189
Or if you'd rather save some coin, you CAN
stick to the bagged dry food.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.909
A professor of veterinary nutrition at Ohio
State University says, his students have studied

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.919
the diet history of thousands of animals and
haven't found any evidence that one dog food

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.290
is better than any other.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.449
