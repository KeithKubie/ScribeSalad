00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.379
Over on the side board here,
I want to show you a few

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:26.482
representation of the ethylene
molecule that we were talking

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:32.275
about at the end of last hour.
When you see representations of

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:35.652
molecules that appear throughout
your textbook,

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:39.543
as well as in this class,
I want you to see if you can

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:44.168
recognize just what property of
the molecule it is that is being

00:00:44.168 --> 00:00:46.371
represented.
In this case here,

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:50.408
we have arbitrarily sized
spheres that represent the two

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:54.152
carbon atoms and the four
peripheral hydrogen atoms.

00:00:54.152 --> 00:00:58.190
And then, what I have plotted
around it is a see-through

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.081
representation of the electron
density at a particular

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:07.000
isosurface value of 0.1
electrons per unit volume.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.308
So, that is a representation.
And we are going to be seeing a

00:01:11.308 --> 00:01:14.468
number of different kinds of
representations,

00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:18.489
and you will need to be able to
distinguish between them.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:22.079
And, in particular,
we were talking last time about

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.813
different kinds of bonds.
We talked about sigma bonds

00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:29.763
that were cylindrically
symmetric about the internuclear

00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:34.000
axis of the two atoms that are
bonded together.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.363
And we also talked about pi
bonds.

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:40.588
And I brought up the pi bond in
connection with the ethylene

00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:44.025
molecule that we were just
looking at a different

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:47.248
representation of.
And so now, let me show you

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:51.544
what a pi bond can look like.
Here is a representation of the

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:55.053
ethylene molecule.
Again, I have arbitrarily sized

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:59.278
spheres that show us just where
the nuclear positions are in

00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:04.554
three-dimensional space.
So, we are talking about the

00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:08.658
equilibrium geometry of the
ethylene molecule.

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:14.131
And what you see here is that
if the molecule is lying in the

00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:19.513
x,y-plane, then each of these
carbons has a 2pz orbital that

00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:23.070
has a positive lobe and a
negative lobe,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.810
respectively,
above and below the plane of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.307
the molecule.
And so, normally,

00:02:30.307 --> 00:02:34.692
when we talk about atomic
orbitals, we can reference their

00:02:34.692 --> 00:02:37.461
phase as either positive or
negative.

00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.615
And we often,
in representations like this

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:44.307
one, associate the positive
phase with one color,

00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:48.615
here blue, and the negative
phase with a different color,

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:51.846
here yellow.
I can choose whatever colors I

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:55.000
want for those,
but this is also a type of

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.532
isosurface.
And it represents the in-phase

00:02:59.532 --> 00:03:04.345
side-to-side overlap of the
positive above the plane lobes

00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:09.242
of the carbon 2pz orbitals and
the negative lobes below the

00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:14.055
plane of the carbon 2pz orbitals
experiencing side-to-side

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:16.588
overlap.
And so you see the two

00:03:16.588 --> 00:03:20.472
electrons that could be paired
up, spin paired,

00:03:20.472 --> 00:03:24.018
one spin up,
one spin down in this pi bond,

00:03:24.018 --> 00:03:29.000
are smeared out both above and
below the plane

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.016
But there is no contribution at
all to the electron density in

00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:35.320
the plane from an orbital like
this.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.348
When we looked at electron
density isosurfaces,

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:42.364
as we have done a few times in
this class, what we are looking

00:03:42.364 --> 00:03:45.788
at there is an isosurface
corresponding to all of the

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:49.409
electrons in the molecule.
And here, what we are looking

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.701
at is an orbital that can house
just two electrons,

00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:56.124
one spin up and one spin down,
so we are focusing our

00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:59.745
attention on a function that
involves just two electrons

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:02.971
bonding in a pi bond that has,
as a nodal surface,

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:08.628
the plane of the molecule.
The plane that contains all six

00:04:08.628 --> 00:04:12.360
of these nuclei,
the two carbons and the four

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.583
hydrogens.
We talked about nodal planes

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:18.975
last time.
And the issue of nodal planes,

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:22.706
nodal surfaces,
is going to be very important

00:04:22.706 --> 00:04:26.692
in today's lecture.
Let's go over here and start

00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:30.000
talking about hybridization.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.731
On this board last time,
I gave you kind of a timeline,

00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:49.979
where we talked about
contributions to different

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.711
aspects of electronic structure
theory for molecules by

00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.752
different people,
some of who were recognized

00:04:56.752 --> 00:05:00.000
with Nobel Prizes,
others who were not.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.585
And one of those people,
namely Linus Pauling,

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:09.375
who won two Nobel Prizes,
not both in chemistry,

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:14.878
came up with this idea of
hybridization to solve one of

00:05:14.878 --> 00:05:19.872
the problems associated with
atomic orbital nodes.

00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:25.885
And let me work on this and
illustrate this to you by taking

00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:32.000
a pretty simple molecule that
has only four atoms.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.874
And this molecule is one that,
in fact, we have seen before.

00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:41.253
It is an example of a Lewis
acid, so any discussion of

00:05:41.253 --> 00:05:46.128
electronic structure of this BH
three molecule better

00:05:46.128 --> 00:05:50.507
come out with a description of
why it is a Lewis acid.

00:05:50.507 --> 00:05:53.316
But let me now point something
out.

00:05:53.316 --> 00:05:57.529
That is, if I make the
direction that coincides with

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.000
this top B-H bond,
the x-axis.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.768
And in the plane of the board,
the y-axis perpendicular to it,

00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:08.035
as shown.
And then, of course,

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:11.866
the z-axis coming
perpendicularly out of the plane

00:06:11.866 --> 00:06:14.915
of the board.
Linus Pauling recognized a

00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:17.964
problem.
And let me give these hydrogens

00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:20.700
descriptors.
I will make this one A,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.000
this one labeled B,
and this one labeled C.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.753
And the problem is that we have
a pz orbital with one positive

00:06:29.753 --> 00:06:33.649
lobe coming out of the plane of
the board, up here.

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:36.454
This would be where the blue
lobe is.

00:06:36.454 --> 00:06:40.818
And the yellow lobe would be
back behind the plane of the

00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:45.727
board, analogous to the pi bond
that we just looked at up on the

00:06:45.727 --> 00:06:48.610
screen.
And what you will see is I can

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.116
draw it this way.
I am rotating this planar BH

00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:55.000
three molecule.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.294
That allows me to draw the pz
orbital in a way that you can

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:12.744
visualize.
And the observation that I want

00:07:12.744 --> 00:07:19.038
you to take away from this
drawing is it has to do with the

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:25.007
relationship in space of the
three hydrogen nuclei as an

00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:30.000
important property of the 2pz
orbital.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.687
What we can say is that these
three hydrogens,

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:40.000
A, B, and C reside in the nodal
plane of the 2pz.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
They lie in the 2pz nodal
plane.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.606
That is, the 2pz on the boron.
And the wave functions that

00:08:05.606 --> 00:08:11.016
these hydrogens bring into the
problem of the electronic

00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:16.622
structure of the BH three
molecule are spherically

00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:20.360
symmetric.
They are simply 1s orbitals.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.557
And so, if you draw one of them
here, remember that a 1s orbital

00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:33.557
is spherically symmetric.
You can see that any positive

00:08:33.557 --> 00:08:40.672
reinforcement that would occur
by overlap here is equal and

00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:47.174
opposite to the negative
reinforcement that will occur

00:08:47.174 --> 00:08:51.959
down here.
And this is something that is

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:58.828
true whenever a hydrogen s
orbital lies in a nodal plane.

00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:03.000
There is no net overlap--

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.153
--between the boron's 2pz and
the hydrogen 1s orbitals.

00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:21.116
When we try to describe the
bonding in this molecule,

00:09:21.116 --> 00:09:26.937
we cannot have any bonds that
involve 2pz and any of the three

00:09:26.937 --> 00:09:32.568
hydrogen 1s orbitals because
there is no net overlap between

00:09:32.568 --> 00:09:36.301
them --
-- because those spherically

00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:40.246
symmetric orbitals lie in the
nodal plane of 2pz.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.863
And that means,
further, that we need to form

00:09:43.863 --> 00:09:46.000
three in-plane bonds.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And that is the xy plane in
plane bonds.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And these three bonds must be
equivalent.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.039
And what is interesting about
the fact that they must be

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:26.446
equivalent is that what are the
three orbitals that the boron

00:10:26.446 --> 00:10:31.000
has that are in the x,y-plane,
the three valence orbitals?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.119
There is the 2s,
the 2px, and the 2py.

00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:38.502
Three orbitals that are not
identical to one another,

00:10:38.502 --> 00:10:43.223
yet we need to make three
identical bonds because all the

00:10:43.223 --> 00:10:48.197
studies that we do on the BH
three molecule tells us

00:10:48.197 --> 00:10:53.340
that each of these bonds are the
same length, the molecule has

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.218
the perfect symmetry of a
Mercedes Benz symbol,

00:10:57.218 --> 00:11:02.258
it's trigonal planar.
It has this three-fold

00:11:02.258 --> 00:11:06.466
rotational symmetry to it.
And so somehow,

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:10.983
using a 2s, a 2px,
and a 2py, we need to make

00:11:10.983 --> 00:11:15.705
three equivalent bonds.
This is an energy level

00:11:15.705 --> 00:11:19.400
diagram.
And so, Pauling came up with

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.635
the idea of promotion.
And promotion will correspond

00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:27.920
to the following.
I can draw 2px,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.062
2py, 2pz, and 2s.
And I can populate with

00:11:33.062 --> 00:11:36.200
electrons.
The boron atom has three.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.131
Now I have put in three
electrons into this energy level

00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:44.000
diagram for the boron atom.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And now, this concept of
promotion kicks in --

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.938
-- and reorganizes us
electronically,

00:12:04.938 --> 00:12:06.000
as follows.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.484
According to our discussion,
we need three equivalent

00:12:19.484 --> 00:12:23.237
orbitals down here with the
three electrons in to pair up

00:12:23.237 --> 00:12:27.190
with the three electrons that
come into the problem from the

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.666
three hydrogen atoms.
At the end, we will show how

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:36.904
those electrons form the
hydrogen atoms come in and pair

00:12:36.904 --> 00:12:42.047
up with these three electrons on
a promoted boron atom.

00:12:42.047 --> 00:12:45.666
Up here, we have the boron 2pz
orbital.

00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:49.000
That stays by itself.
And down here,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
we are going to have a set of
sp two hybrids.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.369
The idea is now somehow we are
going to get three orbitals down

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:10.582
here by mixing one part s and
two parts p.

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:15.000
And, if we do this correctly
mathematically,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.239
these will have the right
orientation in space to be

00:13:20.239 --> 00:13:25.890
hybrids that have proper
directionality for good overlap

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:32.297
with our hydrogen 1s oribtals.
These are going to be three

00:13:32.297 --> 00:13:34.000
equivalent hybrids.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.051
How do we do that?
Well, we are going to get our

00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:45.000
equations for hybridization.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.636
And we are going to develop
these using some of the results

00:13:57.636 --> 00:14:00.000
from quantum mechanics,
which is what Pauling did.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.775
And essentially,
what we are going to do is seek

00:14:13.775 --> 00:14:17.469
equations that have one part s
and two parts p,

00:14:17.469 --> 00:14:20.923
each of them,
but which point in the correct

00:14:20.923 --> 00:14:25.502
directions in space for making
three separate two electron

00:14:25.502 --> 00:14:30.000
bonds between the boron and the
three hydrogens.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.420
And so, I will just call them
sp two of A,

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:41.598
because we are going to need
one that points toward that A

00:14:41.598 --> 00:14:46.368
hydrogen, which is along the
positive x-axis,

00:14:46.368 --> 00:14:52.655
we are going to need one that
points toward the B hydrogen,

00:14:52.655 --> 00:14:58.292
and we are going to need one
that points toward the C

00:14:58.292 --> 00:15:02.303
hydrogen.
And the idea here is that we

00:15:02.303 --> 00:15:07.181
are going to have some amount of
the boron 2s,

00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:11.616
px and py --
-- because pz is not

00:15:11.616 --> 00:15:14.446
contributing to these three
hybrids.

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:19.134
And each one of these is going
to have some quantity of the

00:15:19.134 --> 00:15:22.125
three orbitals that we have
available.

00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:26.248
And what you need to keep in
mind here in setting up

00:15:26.248 --> 00:15:30.452
equations like this is that px
has a definite spatial

00:15:30.452 --> 00:15:35.383
orientation with respect to the
coordinate system that we have

00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:38.924
chosen.
And so does py.

00:15:38.924 --> 00:15:46.238
And the way that we will make
this come out using our blue

00:15:46.238 --> 00:15:52.141
chalk is to note that we have a
coefficient C1,

00:15:52.141 --> 00:15:57.274
C2 and C3.
Our job is going to be to find

00:15:57.274 --> 00:16:01.380
the values of these
coefficients,

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.000
C4, C5, C6, C7,
C8, and C9.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.082
We can use the rules of quantum
mechanics, and I am going to

00:16:12.082 --> 00:16:17.958
summarize a few of these rules
for you before this lecture

00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:22.391
ends, to find the values of
these constants.

00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:26.000
Let's go over here and begin.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.603
Let's make note of the dictates
of symmetry.

00:16:53.603 --> 00:16:58.379
I will reference symmetry a
couple of times today in class

00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:03.072
in working on this problem of
finding those coefficients,

00:17:03.072 --> 00:17:07.316
one through nine.
The neat thing is that the 2s

00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:11.389
orbital centered on that boron,
which is going to be

00:17:11.389 --> 00:17:16.182
participating in these hybrids
that are going to point toward

00:17:16.182 --> 00:17:19.376
hydrogens A, B,
and C, that 2s orbital is

00:17:19.376 --> 00:17:23.450
spherically symmetric.
Its wave function is the same

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:28.242
as you go radially out from the
boron center in any direction

00:17:28.242 --> 00:17:31.846
into space.
What that symmetry

00:17:31.846 --> 00:17:38.205
consideration dictates is that
there will be the same amount of

00:17:38.205 --> 00:17:43.230
boron 2s in the hybrids for A,
as for B, as for C.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:50.000
And what that means is that C1
is equal to C4 is equal to C7.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.625
And we are going to need a
value for this.

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:06.843
And we can get a value for that
by taking into consideration

00:18:06.843 --> 00:18:11.000
something called unit orbital
contribution.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.612
What that says is that we have
to use the boron's 2s orbital

00:18:26.612 --> 00:18:35.000
completely and identically once
in that set of three equations.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.238
In other words,
we are going to distribute it

00:18:38.238 --> 00:18:40.593
evenly among those three
hybrids.

00:18:40.593 --> 00:18:44.936
And we have to distribute all
of it evenly among those three

00:18:44.936 --> 00:18:47.512
hybrids.
And here we are going to be

00:18:47.512 --> 00:18:50.751
interested in the square of the
coefficients.

00:18:50.751 --> 00:18:54.725
And that is because when we
talk about atomic orbitals,

00:18:54.725 --> 00:18:58.994
we know that the probability of
finding an electron in that

00:18:58.994 --> 00:19:04.000
orbital is related to the square
of the wave function.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.714
And so, normally when we plot
orbitals, like I just did with

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:11.365
the pi bond of ethylene a few
minutes ago, we are making an

00:19:11.365 --> 00:19:14.953
isosurface that corresponds to
some percent probability of

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:17.661
finding the electron at that
point in space.

00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:20.808
So, we are interested in
probability distributions.

00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:24.334
And these are related to the
square of the wave function.

00:19:24.334 --> 00:19:27.481
Here, for unit orbital,
we are going to say that C1

00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:32.873
squared equals C4 squared.
Sorry, plus C4 squared plus C7

00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:38.140
squared is equal to one. And,

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:44.174
therefore, C1 is equal to C4 is
equal to C7 is equal to one over

00:19:44.174 --> 00:19:48.101
root three.

00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:51.261
Now, we have found C1,
C4, and C7.

00:19:51.261 --> 00:19:56.338
And, if we are going to
complete sp two of A,

00:19:56.338 --> 00:20:01.892
get this first hybrid of the
three, I am going to go across

00:20:01.892 --> 00:20:05.468
this way.
I just went down one,

00:20:05.468 --> 00:20:09.662
four, and seven and pointed out
that by the symmetry of the s

00:20:09.662 --> 00:20:13.996
orbital is due to the fact that
the s orbital contributes once,

00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:16.933
unit orbital contribution,
we could get C1,

00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:19.659
C4, and C7 equal to one over
root three.

00:20:19.659 --> 00:20:23.784
Now I am interested in C2 and

00:20:23.784 --> 00:20:27.000
C3, so let's draw a little
picture.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.755
This, remember,
is our 1s orbital on HA.

00:20:38.755 --> 00:20:44.629
And what we are trying to do is
to construct a hybrid focusing

00:20:44.629 --> 00:20:49.251
on that top equation that will
be directed at HA.

00:20:49.251 --> 00:20:53.681
And we are keeping our axes the
same as before,

00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:59.555
so that x points up and y goes
to the left, as I am drawing it

00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:04.634
here.
And z would be coming out at

00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:08.918
us.
What I am going to draw now is

00:21:08.918 --> 00:21:13.591
a picture of the boron's 2py
orbital.

00:21:13.591 --> 00:21:20.341
And, as I usually do,
I am taking the convention that

00:21:20.341 --> 00:21:28.000
the negative phase lobe of the
boron's 2py orbital--

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.273
Negative is shaded.
That is my convention.

00:21:32.273 --> 00:21:38.110
That 2py orbital lies in the xy
plane and points along y.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.114
Its positive lobe,
in fact, points along positive

00:21:43.114 --> 00:21:46.449
y.
Its negative lobe points along

00:21:46.449 --> 00:21:50.618
negative y.
And what can we say about the

00:21:50.618 --> 00:21:56.247
relationship of the HA 1s
orbital to the 2py orbital of

00:21:56.247 --> 00:22:00.000
that central boron atom?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.074
Let me phrase it this way.
The 2py orbital of our central

00:22:11.074 --> 00:22:16.932
boron atom has a nodal plane.
What is that nodal plane?

00:22:16.932 --> 00:22:22.355
xz is a nodal plane of the 2py
orbital, right here.

00:22:22.355 --> 00:22:27.020
Just like this.
And so, what you see is that

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.901
this HA is not only in the nodal
plane of 2pz,

00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:37.000
it is also in the nodal plane
of 2py.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.123
And that means any positive
interference by bonding between

00:22:42.123 --> 00:22:47.777
HA's 1s and the positive lobe of
2py would be exactly canceled by

00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:52.459
the equal and opposite negative
interference between a

00:22:52.459 --> 00:22:57.406
hydrogen's 1s orbital and the
negative phase lobe on 2py.

00:22:57.406 --> 00:23:02.000
And that means that we know the
value of C3.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.678
We can say, therefore,
that C3 is equal to zero.

00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:17.631
That is really cool because now
we are going to be able to bring

00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:26.157
in one more consideration and
complete the formula for sp two

00:23:26.157 --> 00:23:29.000
of A.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.806
We are going to be able to use
the normalization condition,

00:23:43.806 --> 00:23:44.000
--

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.192
-- which tells us that C1
squared plus C2 squared plus C3

00:24:01.192 --> 00:24:08.000
squared is equal to one.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.961
Once we formed this new hybrid
by mixing together s and p wave

00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:15.467
functions, we are going to find
that this normalization

00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:19.558
condition must be satisfied for
the hybrid orbital just as it is

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:21.831
satisfied for these atomic
orbitals.

00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:25.922
That is so that the probability
of finding an electron somewhere

00:24:25.922 --> 00:24:29.623
is space associated with this
hybrid wave function is one,

00:24:29.623 --> 00:24:33.000
if there is an electron in this
orbital.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.044
That is where this comes from.
And we know that C3 squared is

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:42.570
zero. C1 squared is one

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.800
over root three. So,

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.845
we know that sp squared of A is
equal to one over root three.

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:57.982
And then we can say that,

00:24:57.982 --> 00:25:02.616
by virtue of this and the fact
that C3 is zero,

00:25:02.616 --> 00:25:08.560
C2 could be equal to either
plus or minus the square root of

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:14.000
two over three.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.434
And we have to figure out which
one of these to use.

00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:22.000
Remember that C2 is the
coefficient on px.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.521
Let's reference our diagram on
our coordinate system.

00:25:26.521 --> 00:25:30.000
We have our x-axis and our
y-axis.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.811
And we are looking for the sign
of the coefficient on the boron

00:25:37.811 --> 00:25:42.724
2px orbital.
That is our C2 coefficient.

00:25:42.724 --> 00:25:49.653
And I am shading negative here.
And, in order to overlap

00:25:49.653 --> 00:25:56.456
constructively and form a bond
to the 1s orbital of HA,

00:25:56.456 --> 00:26:02.000
we want positive as our
coefficient.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.625
Because that is going to make
the same phase lobes interact in

00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:13.730
a sigma fashion.
We know that sp squared of A is

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:19.812
equal to one over root three
times the boron's 2s orbital

00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:25.243
plus the square root of two over
three 2px orbital.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.688
And now that we have the
coefficients on that hybrid

00:26:36.688 --> 00:26:41.819
orbital, we can draw a picture
of what that is.

00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:48.400
That is equal to taking the
boron 1s orbital here and adding

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.084
to it the 2px orbital that looks
like this.

00:26:53.084 --> 00:27:00.000
This is the conceptual
breakthrough that Pauling made.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.875
You could mix atomic orbital
wave functions located on a

00:27:03.875 --> 00:27:07.820
central atom in order to
generate these hybrids that have

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.118
the proper directionality for
good overlap with the peripheral

00:27:12.118 --> 00:27:14.584
atoms that bond to the central
atom.

00:27:14.584 --> 00:27:18.106
And when I do this,
what you can see is that we are

00:27:18.106 --> 00:27:21.981
going to get constructive
interference with the positive

00:27:21.981 --> 00:27:25.504
lobe and destructive
interference with the negative

00:27:25.504 --> 00:27:29.309
lobe when we add this boron 2s
orbital to the boron 2px

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:33.021
orbital.
And that should give us

00:27:33.021 --> 00:27:38.381
something that looks like this,
with an enlarged lobe pointing

00:27:38.381 --> 00:27:42.424
along positive x and a
diminished negative node

00:27:42.424 --> 00:27:46.378
pointing along negative x.
That is our hybrid.

00:27:46.378 --> 00:27:49.893
We have developed some
coefficients here.

00:27:49.893 --> 00:27:54.375
We just got it pictorially,
and here we show you the

00:27:54.375 --> 00:28:00.000
picture of the hybrid.
And then, we need to continue.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
We need to use the remainder of
our 2px orbital.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.063
The one thing we cannot do in
constructing a set of hybrid

00:28:20.063 --> 00:28:26.234
orbitals from a set of atomic
orbitals is forgetting to use

00:28:26.234 --> 00:28:31.767
part of our orbital.
We need to use all of the

00:28:31.767 --> 00:28:38.078
orbital that we are given to
construct these hybrids with.

00:28:38.078 --> 00:28:44.610
And what that means is we have
now a relationship between C5

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:51.032
and C8, because we now know C2
is plus root two over three.

00:28:51.032 --> 00:28:57.232
Let's use
this unit orbital idea and

00:28:57.232 --> 00:29:03.632
reference 2px --
-- and say that C2 squared plus

00:29:03.632 --> 00:29:10.312
C5 squared plus C8 squared,
these are all the coefficients

00:29:10.312 --> 00:29:16.054
that deal with the px
contributions to these three

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:22.500
hybrids, is equal to one. And

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.304
we know C2 squared is equal to
two-thirds.

00:29:27.304 --> 00:29:33.614
And now let's draw a picture to

00:29:33.614 --> 00:29:39.327
help us figure out something
else about C5 and C8.

00:29:39.327 --> 00:29:46.439
Here I am simply representing,
with the same coordinate system

00:29:46.439 --> 00:29:52.968
that I am using throughout,
the boron atomic orbital that

00:29:52.968 --> 00:29:58.118
is the 2px orbital.
And, if I consider,

00:29:58.118 --> 00:30:04.583
down here, the s orbitals on HA
and HB, I can say something

00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:10.714
about the way in which 2px
interacts with HA as compared

00:30:10.714 --> 00:30:15.396
with the way in which it
interacts with HB.

00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:21.416
Notice that these HA and HB
atomic positions are mirror

00:30:21.416 --> 00:30:27.547
images of each other with
respect to this 2px orbital in

00:30:27.547 --> 00:30:33.283
the middle.
That tells us that C5 must be

00:30:33.283 --> 00:30:37.358
equal to C8. We are using

00:30:37.358 --> 00:30:43.811
symmetry as a mathematical
argument here to say that C5 is

00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:48.339
equal to C8.
Therefore, we can figure out

00:30:48.339 --> 00:30:54.792
exactly what C5 and C8 are
because we already know that C2

00:30:54.792 --> 00:31:00.000
squared is two-thirds.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.243
We know that C5 squared plus C8
squared has got to be equal to

00:31:08.243 --> 00:31:13.648
one-third. And that

00:31:13.648 --> 00:31:21.351
means that C5 is equal to C6,
sorry, C8, which is equal to

00:31:21.351 --> 00:31:30.000
one over the square root of six.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.175
Because we put this in here,
we will get a sixth plus a

00:31:34.175 --> 00:31:37.036
sixth, two-sixths,
which is one-third,

00:31:37.036 --> 00:31:39.974
plus the two-thirds,
which will be one.

00:31:39.974 --> 00:31:42.989
And so, we know it is one over
root six.

00:31:42.989 --> 00:31:46.469
However, it could be a positive
or a negative.

00:31:46.469 --> 00:31:49.716
And we need to figure out just
which it is.

00:31:49.716 --> 00:31:52.577
Is it positive or is it
negative here?

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:56.520
And I will come back to that
issue just in a moment,

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:02.185
when we draw these functions.
But notice that these are the

00:32:02.185 --> 00:32:06.482
coefficients on 2px and the
positive lobe points up toward

00:32:06.482 --> 00:32:08.894
HA.
We are going to need it to be

00:32:08.894 --> 00:32:13.266
flipped around and be pointing
down if we are going to form

00:32:13.266 --> 00:32:16.959
bonds to HA and HB.
So, that will dictate the sign

00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:19.522
here as negative one over root
six.

00:32:19.522 --> 00:32:22.989
We do not have,
yet, the complete equations for

00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:27.738
sp two of B and sp
two of C because we

00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:34.000
need C6 and C9.
Let's see how we can get those.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:08.350
C6 and C9 relate to the py
orbital that is oriented like

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:14.230
this with reference to our
coordinate system,

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:19.709
with the negative phase shaded
as follows.

00:33:19.709 --> 00:33:25.857
And specifically,
C6 relates to the interaction

00:33:25.857 --> 00:33:31.705
with this HB down here.
And C9 relates to the

00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:35.522
interaction with the 1s orbital
on HC down here,

00:33:35.522 --> 00:33:39.258
on the lower right.
And because this py orbital

00:33:39.258 --> 00:33:44.050
charges phase as we pass through
the origin, and we want the

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:48.680
positive phase to match up both
with HB and with HC in the

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.878
contributions to the hybrid wave
functions, we are going to know,

00:33:53.878 --> 00:33:58.670
and by the symmetry of this
problem, that these are negative

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:06.444
mirror images of each other.
So, we know that C6 is equal to

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:12.609
negative C9. And if we put that

00:34:12.609 --> 00:34:18.200
together with unit orbital
contribution,

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:26.086
we can see, because we know
that we have our sp two of B

00:34:26.086 --> 00:34:31.964
and sp two of C,

00:34:31.964 --> 00:34:42.000
both of them have one over root
three of the 2s contributing.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.822
And then we are looking for six
and nine.

00:34:46.822 --> 00:34:53.815
We found out over there that
both of them have negative one

00:34:53.815 --> 00:34:59.000
over root six as the coefficient
on px.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.081
And then, we know that since
this is the one that points to

00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:06.880
B, we do not need to flip the
phase on py to get a bond

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.891
forming between py and HB.
This is going to be a positive,

00:35:10.891 --> 00:35:13.916
and then this one is going to
be a negative,

00:35:13.916 --> 00:35:17.646
for the reasons I just
mentioned, that we are going to

00:35:17.646 --> 00:35:21.234
need to flip that py
contribution to sp squared of C,

00:35:21.234 --> 00:35:24.260
as compared to sp squared of B,

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.215
in order to get this positive

00:35:27.215 --> 00:35:32.000
lobe over here interacting with
HC in that function.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.401
I am going to draw these
functions in just a moment.

00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:41.319
But now, when we note that
normalization requires that the

00:35:41.319 --> 00:35:45.979
sum of the squares of the
coefficients be equal to one,

00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:50.121
and we know that C3 was zero,
so that there is no

00:35:50.121 --> 00:35:55.040
contribution at all of py to sp
squared of A,

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.786
and all of it must be here and
here, that means that our

00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:06.000
coefficient is one over root two
of py.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.181
Using these restrictions from
quantum mechanics,

00:36:10.181 --> 00:36:15.519
we actually have coefficients
on the spx and py orbitals that

00:36:15.519 --> 00:36:20.501
show how they go together.
And the way in which these add

00:36:20.501 --> 00:36:24.416
up is similar to what we have
seen over here.

00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:29.131
It is a little more complicated
because both px and py

00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:34.157
contribute.
Let me show you what they look

00:36:34.157 --> 00:36:37.842
like.
This mathematical manipulation

00:36:37.842 --> 00:36:43.631
of these functions produces
linear combinations that all

00:36:43.631 --> 00:36:49.526
three look the same as the
symmetry of this problem would

00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:53.210
dictate.
It is a three-fold symmetry

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:58.157
type of problem.
And this is our sp two

00:36:58.157 --> 00:37:05.000
orbital pointing toward B with
this mathematical form.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.590
We have to flip around px so
that the positive lobe of px

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.524
contributes down here.
We do not have to flip py.

00:37:13.524 --> 00:37:18.524
And we have differing amounts
of px and py in this hybrid wave

00:37:18.524 --> 00:37:21.393
function.
But the math of the atomic

00:37:21.393 --> 00:37:25.737
orbitals guarantees that this
form would be physically

00:37:25.737 --> 00:37:30.000
indistinguishable from this one
over here.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.017
They would look exactly
identical if I plotted a

00:37:34.017 --> 00:37:39.230
probability density isosurface.
These two-dimensional pictures

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:43.333
that we draw on the board are
like slices through

00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:47.521
three-dimensional probability
density isosurfaces.

00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:50.769
That is what these
representations are.

00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:55.811
And then, we note that the py
orbital is flipped around when

00:37:55.811 --> 00:38:00.000
we form sp squared of C.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And that leads to this
appearance.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.853
I would like to show you what
one of these might look like if

00:38:15.853 --> 00:38:21.121
you calculated it from the math
that we have developed,

00:38:21.121 --> 00:38:22.000
here.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.628
I have actually got more work
to do here in the next five

00:38:54.628 --> 00:38:57.933
minutes, so let's keep our
concentration.

00:38:57.933 --> 00:39:01.501
Look at this orbital.
This thing is a beautiful

00:39:01.501 --> 00:39:04.262
hybrid orbital.
And I have calculated this with

00:39:04.262 --> 00:39:06.904
reference to a particular
arbitrary molecule.

00:39:06.904 --> 00:39:10.267
This was calculated with
reference to the water molecule.

00:39:10.267 --> 00:39:13.449
The positions of the nuclei in
the water molecular are

00:39:13.449 --> 00:39:16.091
indicated by these arbitrarily
sized spheres.

00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:19.153
That is a typical ball and
stick representation of a

00:39:19.153 --> 00:39:21.855
molecule in 3D.
You can see that the oxygen of

00:39:21.855 --> 00:39:24.436
the water molecule is colored
red, in there.

00:39:24.436 --> 00:39:27.318
That is arbitrary.
And then we have the hydrogens

00:39:27.318 --> 00:39:30.917
in white.
And then I have a big positive

00:39:30.917 --> 00:39:34.689
lobe in blue here and then a
smaller yellow lobe that is our

00:39:34.689 --> 00:39:38.589
negative lobe on this orbital,
here, which is an added mixture

00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:40.634
of an s orbital with a p
orbital.

00:39:40.634 --> 00:39:44.662
I am not telling you the actual
coefficients that went into this

00:39:44.662 --> 00:39:47.666
particular hybrid,
but you can see how if I were

00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:51.374
to take a two-dimensional slice
along the long axis of this

00:39:51.374 --> 00:39:54.123
hybrid orbital,
it might look something like

00:39:54.123 --> 00:39:59.496
what we have drawn over there.
Namely, with one nice large

00:39:59.496 --> 00:40:03.656
directed lobe,
that can have good overlap with

00:40:03.656 --> 00:40:08.834
a hydrogen 1s orbital in order
to give rise to a good two

00:40:08.834 --> 00:40:12.532
electron bond between hydrogen
and boron.

00:40:12.532 --> 00:40:17.710
And let me illustrate how that
impacts on how we draw our

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:22.703
energy-level diagram for the BH
three molecule.

00:40:22.703 --> 00:40:27.880
What we have now is a situation
in which, as you go up in

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:35.000
energy, you find three orbitals
that are all at the same energy.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.400
These lines indicate places
where we can put electrons.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.000
And, in fact,
they look like this.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.000
They represent positive
interference up along x.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.512
Positive interference between a
sp two hybrid that

00:41:04.512 --> 00:41:08.559
points down at atom B,
right here, overlapping nicely

00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:12.682
with the hydrogen 1s wave
function that is sitting out

00:41:12.682 --> 00:41:17.118
there, surrounding that nucleus.
And then over here is our

00:41:17.118 --> 00:41:21.708
hybrid orbital sp squared of C
that points down

00:41:21.708 --> 00:41:27.000
here and interacts with the
hydrogen 1s orbital on atom C.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.647
And so, the idea is now this
system, BH three,

00:41:31.647 --> 00:41:34.803
has a total of six valance
electrons.

00:41:34.803 --> 00:41:39.801
Valance shell electron pair
repulsion theory could be used

00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:44.974
by you to predict the geometry
that we started with for this

00:41:44.974 --> 00:41:48.306
problem.
But now, we can populate these

00:41:48.306 --> 00:41:52.778
bonding orbitals with electron
pairs, as shown here.

00:41:52.778 --> 00:41:56.987
And then, this problem has one
more aspect to it,

00:41:56.987 --> 00:42:02.248
namely that up here somewhere
higher in energy there is a 2pz

00:42:02.248 --> 00:42:05.229
orbital on the boron that is
empty.

00:42:05.229 --> 00:42:09.000
And this empty orbital --

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.476
-- is our feature that gives
this molecule Lewis acid

00:42:21.476 --> 00:42:24.317
character.
We know that this is an

00:42:24.317 --> 00:42:29.052
electron deficient system.
It does not satisfy the octet

00:42:29.052 --> 00:42:31.197
rule.
And, specifically,

00:42:31.197 --> 00:42:35.121
where it is missing electrons
are in that boron 2pz orbital.

00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:38.115
That allows you to predict
something about the

00:42:38.115 --> 00:42:40.842
stereochemistry of reactions,
for example.

00:42:40.842 --> 00:42:43.902
It says that if some
nucleophile or Lewis base,

00:42:43.902 --> 00:42:48.093
a source of a pair of electrons
is going to come in and approach

00:42:48.093 --> 00:42:51.951
that planar BH three
molecule, it will do so either

00:42:51.951 --> 00:42:55.742
along positive z or along
negative z because that is where

00:42:55.742 --> 00:43:00.000
the big lobes are of that empty
pz orbital point.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And, this valance bond theory
--

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.272
-- satisfies this problem,
that Pauling noticed,

00:43:15.272 --> 00:43:20.181
of how do we make three
identical bonds in a plane that

00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:25.181
contains three dissimilar atomic
orbital wave functions,

00:43:25.181 --> 00:43:29.354
an s orbital px and a py?
Well, he found that

00:43:29.354 --> 00:43:33.772
mathematically you can mix them
together in ways that gives you

00:43:33.772 --> 00:43:37.906
three identical hybrids that
have the needed directionality

00:43:37.906 --> 00:43:41.398
for the forming of these three
two electron bonds.

00:43:41.398 --> 00:43:44.819
There is an alternative
solution to this problem,

00:43:44.819 --> 00:43:48.097
and we will call that molecular
orbital theory.

00:43:48.097 --> 00:43:52.017
Don't forget about Robert S.
Mulliken, MIT undergraduate

00:43:52.017 --> 00:43:54.868
thesis 1917.
And MO theory is a different

00:43:54.868 --> 00:44:00.000
perspective on electronic
structure theory for molecules.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.733
And we will launch into that on
Wednesday.
