00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:03.156
 In this video we will examine the liquid-mosaic model 

00:00:03.156 --> 00:00:05.960
 of the cell membranes. 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.764
 Why is it called a liquid-mosaic model? 

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:11.006
 To be clear 

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:12.570
 what we see, 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.247
 if this is a cell here, 

00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:18.936
 this is her membrane, 

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.662
 it isolates the inside of the cell 

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.047
 from the outside environment. 

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:29.050
 Here we see a transverse cut of the membrane. 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.170
 Below is the inside of the cage. 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.236
 If we compare the two charts, 

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:39.496
 it's the inside of the cell, and that's the outside environment. 

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:42.470
 When we look closer, 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.485
 this little part here 

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:49.337
 is actually made up of a double phospholipid layer. 

00:00:49.677 --> 00:00:50.964
 I call double phospholipid layer, 

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:53.216
 but what is phospholipid? 

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:54.290
 That's a good question. 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.837
 When you understand what phospholipids are, 

00:00:56.837 --> 00:00:58.980
 it will be clearer why they form 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.327
 double layers like this and why they are at the root 

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.140
 of so many membranes in biological systems. 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.271
 This is a phospholipid, 

00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:10.144
 I will record it, 

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:14.955
 this is a phospholipid. 

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.852
 And as the name suggests, it is made up of a lipid and a phosphate group. 

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:19.116
 We have a whole video about lipids, 

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:20.683
 as a whole, the word lipid 

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:25.588
 means something that does not easily dissolve in water. 

00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:27.899
 This is true of this phospholipid. 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.278
 It has hydrocarbon tails, 

00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:32.218
 which come from fatty acids. 

00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:34.595
 These hydrocarbon tails 

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:37.470
 have no charge or polarity. 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.702
 We know the water molecule is polar, 

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:41.547
 therefore, can form hydrogen bonds 

00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:43.537
 and is attracted by other water molecules. 

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.649
 But these tails are not polar, 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.509
 they are not attracted to water and 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.630
 water is not attracted to them. 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.632
 These tails are hydrophobic. 

00:01:52.632 --> 00:01:57.638
 We have hydrophobic tails, 

00:01:58.938 --> 00:01:59.943
 they are 

00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:02.651
 lipid part of the phospholipids. 

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:07.646
 Then we have the phosphate head 

00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:10.556
 right here. 

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:13.537
 As you can see, she has a charge. 

00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:18.388
 Charged molecules feel good in polar solvents like water. 

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.604
 They will dissolve easily, therefore this part 

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:23.187
 will be hydrophilic. 

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.921
 In fact, molecules that have a hydrophilic part 

00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:31.274
 and a hydrophobic portion 

00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:33.317
 have a special name. 

00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:37.863
 They are called amphipathic, sometimes it is difficult to pronounce this word. 

00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:41.509
 Phospholipids are amphipathic, 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.027
 which means they have a hydrophilic end, 

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:48.310
 which is attracted to the water, 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.620
 and a hydrophobic end which is not. 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.382
 I hope this starts to clarify why phospholipids 

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:56.721
 are organized in this way. 

00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:57.969
 You can imagine, 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.179
 that hydrophilic heads will want to be there, 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.278
 where water is. It will either 

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:04.581
 outside or inside the cage. 

00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:07.325
 Hydrophobic tails 

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:08.484
 will repel the water 

00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:09.839
 or going away from the water. 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.382
 So they will stand against each other 

00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:14.607
 inside the membrane. 

00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:16.644
 But the best of such a structure, 

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:19.474
 made of this amphipathic molecule is that 

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:21.969
 allows creation 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.925
 of these double phospholipid layers. 

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:27.195
 This is remarkable. 

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:29.942
 If we go back, 

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:33.486
 even before the formation of cellular forms of life, 

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:36.794
 phospholipids could form 

00:03:36.794 --> 00:03:41.528
 these spheres surrounded by a double phospholipid layer. 

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:43.861
 I will draw them cut crosswise, 

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:45.684
 so that you can imagine them. 

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.888
 I hope I will make a nice picture. 

00:03:48.888 --> 00:03:53.301
 I think to paint 

00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:54.948
 the whole thing 

00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:56.481
 and you will most likely get it. 

00:03:56.481 --> 00:03:59.627
 This will be one layer 

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:02.704
 of phosphate heads pointing outwards. 

00:04:02.704 --> 00:04:04.896
 This is the inner layer, 

00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:07.164
 I draw a cross cut. 

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:10.293
 Then we have hydrophobic tails. 

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:14.539
 I will make them in another color. 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.527
 Here are the hydrophobic tails. I think you understand. 

00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:22.152
 We have hydrophobic tails on both sides. 

00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:24.486
 Therefore, a structure can be spontaneously formed, 

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:25.638
 which begins to resemble 

00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:27.453
 of the protocell. 

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:30.601
 Obviously, in order to have a real life, 

00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.274
 we need some kind of information to be passed on to the generations, 

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:35.057
 as well as some kind of metabolism. 

00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:37.590
 Then the cell will be alive in all life definitions. 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.862
 You can imagine how this basic structure of the cell membrane 

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:44.830
 is also formed prior to the appearance of live cells 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.344
 with the help of the amphipathic properties of molecules such as phospholipids. 

00:04:50.344 --> 00:04:51.238
 All right. 

00:04:51.238 --> 00:04:54.354
 We can form a double phospholipid layer, 

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:57.187
 and all these other things I've painted here? 

00:04:57.187 --> 00:05:02.060
 These are proteins. This here is an example of protein, 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.662
 this here is protein, 

00:05:03.662 --> 00:05:05.954
 this is white, it's white. 

00:05:05.954 --> 00:05:08.451
 He drew a few ellipses, 

00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:10.802
 to denote the different types of proteins. 

00:05:10.802 --> 00:05:12.450
 But it is important to understand that 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.469
 in cells, there is a wide variety of membrane proteins. 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.070
 The membrane is a lot 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.031
 complex structure. 

00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:21.420
 She is not 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.938
 homogeneous double phospholipid layer, 

00:05:24.938 --> 00:05:28.044
 there are a lot of things in it. 

00:05:28.044 --> 00:05:29.678
 If we look at this cut, 

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.710
 we will see them. 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.012
 We see them on this chart. 

00:05:36.012 --> 00:05:38.582
 We can say that there is a mosaic of things in the phospholipid double layer. 

00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:41.405
 Mosaic is a picture made by 

00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:43.179
 different components, colored in different colors. 

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:45.535
 As you can see, here we have all the components, 

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:47.497
 different types of proteins. 

00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:50.747
 We have proteins like the ones that pass through the membrane. 

00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:53.057
 These are transmembrane proteins, 

00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:55.194
 this is a special class of integral proteins. 

00:05:55.194 --> 00:05:57.051
 We have integrated proteins like this, 

00:05:57.051 --> 00:06:00.974
 which are in contact with one part of the double layer, 

00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:03.285
 until they cross it all. 

00:06:03.285 --> 00:06:06.159
 We also have glycolipids. 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.674
 This is a glycolipid here. 

00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:14.599
 Glycolipids are remarkable. 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.363
 They nest in the membrane, 

00:06:16.363 --> 00:06:17.838
 because they have a lipid end, 

00:06:17.838 --> 00:06:19.381
 which is hydrophobic. 

00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:20.763
 He'll get along well with everyone 

00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:22.655
 remaining hydrophobic items in the membrane. 

00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:28.088
 But their other end is a chain of sugars, 

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:29.760
 this end will be hydrophilic 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.730
 and will point to the external environment. 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.600
 These sugar chains 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.240
 are very important for intercellular recognition. 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.687
 Your immune system uses them to distinguish 

00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:40.127
 cells 

00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:41.637
 of your body - 

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:43.296
 those with whom he should not enter into confession, 

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:44.423
 those who have to defend 

00:06:44.423 --> 00:06:46.108
 from the cells that are foreign to the body, 

00:06:46.108 --> 00:06:47.954
 those who can attack. 

00:06:47.954 --> 00:06:49.524
 When people talk about blood groups, 

00:06:49.524 --> 00:06:51.355
 they talk about 

00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:55.531
 specific glycolipids we have on our cells. 

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:58.761
 This does not exhaust the subject 

00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:02.495
 for glycolipids and their role 

00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:04.670
 in intercellular recognition 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.868
 or designation. 

00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:10.417
 Remarkably, these chains of sugars 

00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:12.762
 can participate in so complex and useful 

00:07:12.762 --> 00:07:15.492
 cell behavior. 

00:07:15.492 --> 00:07:18.741
 But we do not just want sugar chains of lipids, 

00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:21.050
 we also want sugar chains of proteins. 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.448
 Here we have a glycoprotein. 

00:07:27.998 --> 00:07:29.752
 As you can see, all these things are arranged 

00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:31.568
 in a mosaic. Actually, we have not finished yet. 

00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:33.473
 In the membrane we have cholesterol. 

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:35.483
 Cholesterol is a lipid, so he will stay 

00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:37.302
 in the hydrophobic portion of the membrane. 

00:07:37.302 --> 00:07:40.344
 It contributes to the fluidity of the membrane, 

00:07:40.344 --> 00:07:44.786
 helps her not to be too fluid or too stiff. 

00:07:44.786 --> 00:07:49.003
 It's cholesterol. 

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:51.584
 So far we have seen the parts of the mosaic in the membrane, 

00:07:51.584 --> 00:07:53.282
 and the liquid part? 

00:07:53.282 --> 00:07:55.541
 I just mentioned the role of cholesterol 

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.269
 in maintaining the right level of fluidity. 

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.262
 The good thing about this structure is that it is not rigid. 

00:08:01.262 --> 00:08:04.004
 If these things get collapsed 

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:06.048
 or if something goes away, 

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:09.010
 the phospholipids will be rearranged spontaneously 

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.307
 and will fill the gap. 

00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:12.930
 You can imagine that all these things are floating around, 

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.048
 that this membrane has the consistency 

00:08:16.048 --> 00:08:19.890
 of vegetable oil or of salad dressing. 

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.098
 It has no elastic, rubber texture 

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:26.958
 like a balloon. 

00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.826
 It's actually liquid. These things can move around, 

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:33.167
 but although it is liquid, 

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:35.897
 can divide the two environments. 

00:08:35.897 --> 00:08:37.661
 The internal environment of the cell 

00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:41.792
 from the outside environment. 

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:45.689
 That is why we call the liquid-mosaic membrane model.
