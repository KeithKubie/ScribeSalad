00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.787
Okay, this is a really tricky problem. But the answer is the last one right

00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:14.160
here. Methianine or M, P or Proline, D or Aspartate, or S or Syrine. Now if

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.440
you had trouple getting this, let's walk through

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.000
it really quick. I can immediately get rid

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080
of these first three answers over here for

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.530
one very important reason. We have one start

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.240
codon and it's Methanine. A ribosome is looking for that start codon

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.660
and if I read my mRNA ACA, no that's not it, CAG, no that's not it, AGA, no

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.730
that's not it, GAU, no that's not it, AUG, there it is, AUG. AUG's my

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.510
star codon. Right? That means I get a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.360
Methionine. None of these start with Methionine. All

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.750
of these start with Threonine which is an

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.240
ACA. So, if you just start at the beginning,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.050
you would have started with the Threonine and probably

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.170
gotten one of these three answers. This is the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.500
one, I think if you end up going all the way to the very end, and the second

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.230
one, is if you might have noticed a stop

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.410
codon. ACAGAUGCCUGA stop, right? And some of you might

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.090
have stopped completely and just put TDA, or if you

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.250
stopped and then kept going, right, that would not have

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.585
been accurate, as we see over here. Is a better

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.960
example of why you wouldn't want to do that. We know

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.930
now that we want to start at AUG, okay, so now

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960
we know the first one is Methionine, and because we

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.230
have a non-overlapping code, our next one is CCU. We

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.410
don't do UGC or GCC, the next codon is CCU.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.570
Go over here. CCU is Proline, so we have a P. They all have a P. The next

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.420
one is GAU. GAU. Aspartate D, they all have

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.920
that. The next one would be UCA, UCA Syrine right here.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.540
So the next one should be Syrine. They all have that. And then we get to UGA.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.050
And you'll notice that UGA is one of

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.600
our special stop codons. This would tell the ribosome

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.420
to stop translating right here. And actually the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.480
only one that stops is MPDS, this last one

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.050
right here. The other ones actually keep going.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.230
ACC, ACC. Is Threanine, right? They actually thought that

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.550
they should drop in another amino acid and keep

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.950
on going. When you get to a stop codon,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.200
you stop translating. From AUG to UGA, this would

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.900
be our actual code that gets turned into protein.
