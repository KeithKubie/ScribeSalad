HOLLY KRIEGER: So, today I want to talk about the Mandelbrot set.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.500
But I want to— so, there's so many videos and websites and Java applets

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
and all of these things where you can see the beauty of the Mandelbrot set.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
And this really nice fractal picture, and you can zoom in and see all of the interesting things.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.500
What I want to talk about is: What is this object?
So, what is the picture a picture of?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
Why do we care about this picture other than just its intrinsic, sort of, appeal?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.040
And, so… just to generally talk about the way maybe the mathematicians would look at the Mandelbrot set.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.480
The first thing we need to understand is
that this entire thing is happening

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.000
in the world of complex numbers, okay?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.440
So, if you remember, complex numbers—

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.680
the complex plane, the way that we view this
is that we have two axes

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.900
and we plot on this plane numbers of
the form, say a + bi,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.920
and here these two things are
real numbers

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.500
and 'i' is a symbol that means that i² = -1, okay?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.960
So most people are familiar with this
but just a reminder.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.890
It's a convenience in some sense but there's also a lot of useful information in this representation.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.500
So for example, one thing that's very natural to look at
is if I plot some complex number, say a + bi, okay?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.790
Maybe this is something like you know
3 + 2i, something like that,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.360
then one sort of natural quantity
associated with this thing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
is the distance from this point to the
centre point of the plane.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.610
And so this distance, which we call the
magnitude of the complex number,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.600
it really has some inherent mathematical
properties that we really care about

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.580
and so the fact that this is so easy
to visualize in the complex plane

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.670
and you can also visualize addition of
complex numbers and subtraction, and so on

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.780
in this plane in a very geometric way
is really helpful.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.410
So how do we get to the Mandelbrot set from here?

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.700
So here's sort of just the naive definition.
Let's take a complex number c

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.380
and let's associate to this complex number
the following function:

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.500
so this is a function which takes as an input
some complex number z and outputs z² + c

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.700
So I'm thinking of this complex number
as being associated to this function,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.300
and we— what we're interested in
is the behavior of 0 under iteration.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.180
So, by iteration of f_c,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.299
I mean what happens when I take 0
and I plug it into this function,

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.100
and then I keep doing that to the result.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.810
So, for example, if we're looking at f₁(z)

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.700
Well, f₁(0) = 0 + 1, which is 1

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.500
f₁(1), so now I apply it to the answer that I got, right?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.520
This is 1 + 1 which is 2.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.200
f₁ of the previous thing which was 2
is 2² + 1 which is 5

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.100
f₁(5) is 5² +1 which is 26, and so on.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.500
So that's what I mean about the behavior of 0
under iteration for a particular value of c.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.110
Now, what the Mandelbrot set is concerned with

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.180
is what happens to the
size of these numbers

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.010
and by size, I mean exactly what we were
talking about before about the distance

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.400
from the number in the complex
plane to this point, 0, okay?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.200
So it turns out there are two options for a function f_c(z),

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.300
defined to be z² + c:

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.600
The first option is that the distance from 0

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.860
of the sequence we get,
gets arbitrarily large.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.500
BRADY: That means it blows up.
DR. KRIEGER: It means it blows up.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.000
It gets as large as you want it to be, okay?
So, this is what people mean

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.200
when they say that the iterates go to infinity, okay?
They mean not necessarily that, okay,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.950
they look like real numbers or
integers or something like this,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.500
but that the "size" of the number,
in this sense, goes to infinity.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.200
The other thing that can happen
is that the distance is bounded.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.500
The size is bounded. So, and in fact you can
say that it never gets larger than 2.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.660
So you have this sort of dichotomy
where only one of two things can happen:

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.860
If you give me a complex number c

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.099
and I start iterating zero under that function z² + c

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.490
either the distance of the iterates
to 0 in this complex plane

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.700
gets really large for all of them, so you
can bounce back and forth, right?

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.500
It gets really large for all of them.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.909
Or, it stays close to 0, within
a distance of 2 from 0.

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:45.640
So, for example, to illustrate these two cases,
we already wrote down a few iterates

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.200
under z² + 1 of 0, and as you can see
their size is growing and in particular

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.979
we've got some things that are
further from 0 than 2 is,

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.229
and so this c = 1 is case 1.

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.900
But there's another possibility so let's look at,
well, a good contrast maybe would be z² - 1.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.400
although this might be a little misleading
[evil giggle]

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.280
so if we look at, say 0, and
we start applying this function

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.639
well, f_-1(0), that's 0 - 1 which is -1.

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.800
If we plug in -1 into that function we
have (-1)² which is 1, which is 0.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.500
Oh, wait, okay, but we know
what happens to 0, right?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.440
It goes back to -1.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.050
So these iterates just alternate
between -1 and 0.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.270
And so in particular they never get large, right?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.300
So that's an example of case 2.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.850
So, the definition of the Mandelbrot set, then,
one definition of the Mandelbrot set,

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.800
which we usually call M, is the set of C,
complex numbers C,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.810
for which case 2 holds.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.550
And I'm kind of all over the place here
so let's be clear,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.880
Case 2

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.500
So, in other words, if I look at the
function represented by this complex number,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.300
if I look at z² + c and I start iterating 0
under that function, everything remains bounded.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.000
BRADY: It's the guys that don't blow up
rather than the ones that do.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.700
DR. KRIEGER: That's right, it's the ones that
don't blow up instead of the ones that do.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.560
And this is also in case you're curious
how these pictures are always generated.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.400
So if you wanna figure out to draw a picture
whether c is in the Mandelbrot set or not,

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.080
Well, you just start iterating
0 under z² + c

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.850
And if it takes a long time to get big
then you can give it one color

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.600
If it gets big really quickly you can give it a different
color and that's how you get these shadings.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.680
I'll point out here that everything
that's in the Mandelbrot set

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:49.000
has to be within distance 2 of the centre, right?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.459
Because of exactly this case 2 thing that I said

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:55.900
that once your iterate is larger than
2, you're out of the picture.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.459
So the inside of this thing, let's fill this in here,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.880
this is what's known as the Mandelbrot set

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.689
So let's look at our examples, right?

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:07.800
So we had two examples,
we had c = 1, and we had c = -1.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.449
So -1, is right here, is indeed
inside the Mandelbrot set.

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.919
1 is right here, and it's outside.

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:22.500
Let me take the easiest example inside
of there, so we look at 0, right? c = 0,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.000
And we start iterating, well, what is
the function associated to c = 0?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.500
f₀(z) is z²

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.800
okay, so, let's start iterating 0, well,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.800
0² = 0

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.200
So no matter how many times we apply
the function we just stay at 0.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200
BRADY: So you're in the club.
DR. KRIEGER: So you're in the club, that's right.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.300
But if we take, say, some small number here

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.649
It's a little hard to compute without taking
a real number, so I apologize, but

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:53.189
if we we take something like 1/8,
something like that

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:58.800
if we start iterating so the first iterate is 1/8
and then you start adding things under iteration but

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.519
but it's never enough to get you outside
of that disc of radius 2.

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:04.500
BRADY: These guys are blowing up.
DR. KRIEGER: That's right.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.500
BRADY: These ones are not blowing up.
DR. KRIEGER: That's right.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.700
BRADY: What's happening at the edges, then?
Is that where things are interesting?

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.779
DR. KRIEGER: That's where things are interesting, right?
Where you go from blowing up to not blowing up,

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:18.400
is dynamically interesting and just sort
of, loosely speaking, the reason why

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.800
is that you can't predict what's going to
happen if you change c a little bit, right?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.800
So if I have some c on the boundary here,
so it so happens that 1/4 is on the boundary,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.009
if I move that c around by a little bit,
anything can happen, right?

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:35.800
You might have your orbit blow up,
you might have it not blow up.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.100
And so you can't predict what happens
when you move your c around a little bit

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.469
And that's why it's interesting.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.429
[fading in] And all of these separate disconnected pieces

00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:55.600
and so it turns out that another way you
could define the Mandelbrot set

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.000
is by which of these two behaviors you get.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.860
When you draw the filled Julia set, for z² + c,
do you get kind of one piece, one blob?

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.500
Or do you get a bunch of disconnected pieces?

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.000
So if you get one piece, one blob,
you're in the Mandelbrot set.
