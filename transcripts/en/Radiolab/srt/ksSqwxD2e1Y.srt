1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,690
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,590
S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hey.
Hi. How are you? I'm fine.

3
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:17,250
How are you Robert? Nice to speak
to you after all these years. Yes,

4
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,480
it's been quite a few years.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,120
I should let you know the Jad Abumrad
has just wandered in. Hello. Hi Jad,

6
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,260
this is Adrian Noey.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,150
Last name is N. O. E. N.

8
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:30,030
I'm director of the National
Museum of Health and medicine.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,990
So you know why we're calling
you, right? Yes. Okay.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,320
So what's the spring
it on the audience? Um,

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,420
I don't remember how I
happen to bump into you.

12
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:40,950
I don't even know how this came up.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,850
I think you and I had, um,

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,880
been coke presenters at a ted
conference probably a decade ago.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,460
We may have been talking about, um,

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,640
important events in New York
or civic architecture, but I,

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,420
but I do remember perking
up at the phrase grants too.

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,440
So Robert said something to
you about grants tomb. Yes.

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,480
And then you turned to be, say it again.

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,590
Now you may know who's
buried in grant's tomb,

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,870
but I know it's buried in grant's tumor.

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,150
Yes. He turns it out at the
museum. She works at, there is a

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,300
tumor that had been excised from the
throat of president grant in the 1880s

24
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,320
actual tissue from grant's tumor. Yes,

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,333
that's right.

26
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,093
Yes. Here we are,

27
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,970
the National Museum of Health
and medicine in Gladesville name.

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,580
It is kept behind several locked doors,

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,030
so you guys don't have an inkling of what
you're about to see if we go in there

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,020
now, but it's a privileged
area. This is Brian's Spatola.

31
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:52,130
He's the collections manager and he let
us down a long hallway to some doors and

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,080
took me back. Oh, holy moly. Oh my God.

33
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:00,470
There's like other twin babies
and in Formaldehyde look,

34
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:05,471
Greens heads torsos and majority
even gotten to the tumors.

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,330
Right. So he let us out of that
room and into another one in the,

36
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:11,930
you're sitting on a table and
waiting for us is this, is this,

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,080
the thing about which we spoke it is was
President Ulysses Simpson grants tumor.

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,310
Oh Wow.

39
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,800
Lots of it was resting in a
box that looked as it happen
and it's exactly like a

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,820
cigar box. Oh. Which is a little ironic.

41
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,960
This was the guy who never ever
stopped having a cigar in his mouth.

42
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,650
He never stopped having cigars.

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,790
He smoked as many as 12 cigars a day. Wow.

44
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,230
So it was probably the
cigars that made the tumor

45
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,060
February of 1885 tissue
was removed, examined,

46
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,370
and his physicians, um,

47
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,090
concluded that he had a squamous cell
carcinoma and ultimately he was treated

48
00:02:56,201 --> 00:03:00,610
for pain and died in July
of 85. That same year.

49
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,710
Well, it's pretty fast. So that's
what killed president grant then?

50
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,260
It was a tumor. Yes. I didn't know that.

51
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,820
So you see the staining that they use
to bring out the details in the cells is

52
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:17,760
the darkness, the tumor, the
darkness is the tumor. Wow.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
The very stuff that even though
president grant got through Vicksburg,

54
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,680
I didn't even know he came east and
they fight, tried to kill him here.

55
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,300
They tried to kill him
there. They tried to go.

56
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,420
Then he goes and becomes president.
This is what actually killed him.

57
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,520
This is what kills him.
Wow. Can I touch it? Um,

58
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,683
no,

59
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,550
we may not be able to touch the actual
tumor of the president of the United

60
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,820
States, but we can touch on this
subject. We can grasp this subject.

61
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,230
We can examine this subject coming
up on radio lab for the next hour.

62
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,650
It's totally tumors. Oh,
come on. Don't call that.

63
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,590
Cause really what we're going to talk
about are not just any tumors but famous

64
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,080
tumors, immortal tumors, devil tumors,

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,830
he just tumors and tumors that speak up.

66
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:03,930
[inaudible]

67
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,160
I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm
about to be confused.

68
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,800
The Big One and I'm Jad Abumrad
this is Radiolab. Stay with us.

69
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,623
[inaudible]

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,590
wow.

71
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,240
Alright. To get things
to get things rolling.

72
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,400
This first story is about something
that we thought was not possible that we

73
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:33,060
hoped was not possible.
We learned it from, uh,

74
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,950
I'll make it work from this Guy David
Coleman. I'm a science journalist. He is,

75
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:39,990
I think my favorite in my generation.

76
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:42,330
I think he is the best writer
that writes about science.

77
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,360
I specialize in evolutionary biology and
travel on assignment to far away places

78
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,580
and interesting situations.
All right, so first of all,

79
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,950
where are you going to take
us to? What part of the world?

80
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,940
I'm going to take you to

81
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,773
Tasmania,

82
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,130
which is the island state off the
south coast of Australia. You know,

83
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:07,080
you go to Australia and you think of
Brock and deserts and red dirt and heat,

84
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,660
but you keep going south all
the way off the south coast.

85
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,560
Suddenly you have these
rolling green countrysides,

86
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,060
lots of wallabies,

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
one of the species of kangaroo that
like bonding them countryside with

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,470
wallabies. Is that the, exactly
with small kangaroos hopping around,

89
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,330
but our story does not actually
begin in Tasmania. Nope.

90
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,370
It starts in Holland with a gentleman
by the name of Christo Bosh.

91
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,460
Is that bar as in B a r Bosh?

92
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Christo bars is a wonderfully
independent spirited plumber.

93
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,773
A plumber,

94
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,480
plumber guy do to make a living on the
photographing is for me a big hobby. I,

95
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,170
we don't know just how
great a plumber he is,

96
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:54,880
but he's a very good wildlife photographer
and he looks for interesting animals

97
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,070
to shoot with the camera.
I mean, so over the years,

98
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,720
often he puts down his
ranch and he travels. Yeah,

99
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,180
well we don't have that many animals
here in Holland. A little bit of Roe,

100
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:04,910
deer and sometimes a Fox.

101
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,410
And in the early nineties he goes to
take his latest photography sabbatical in

102
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,030
Tasmania. Have I gone to
a attach mania on boat?

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,220
And were you there to take pictures of
wallabies or Kangaroos? No, no, no, no.

104
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,500
He was there this time to photograph
devils. Tasmanian devils. Yeah. Oh,

105
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,070
I quite liked the animals. What
is, I mean, I know the cartoon,

106
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,440
but what does a real Tasmanian
Devil acce look like,

107
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,630
whether they're about as
big as a little pit bull,

108
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,030
but look a little bit more like a
bear cub white yoke on its chest.

109
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,610
Big Set of formidable teeth. They'll
eat almost anything. Anything,

110
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:45,560
anything like Afar Plata, push, kelp,
maggots and fish snakes, garbage cans,

111
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,400
occasional rubber boot,
you name it. Anyway,

112
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,430
when crystal gets to Tasmania,
he drives up the coast.

113
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:54,860
He finds dead animals on the
road, you know, roadkill,

114
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:59,060
roadkill from the road to use as bait.
What sort of roadkill? Oh, Kangaroos,

115
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,580
a little devil can eat
a kangaroo. Oh yeah.

116
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,140
When the three four five together to eat
a big kangaroo in an hour is gone. Wow.

117
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,290
So he takes the dead kangaroo,
drags it to clearing in the forest,

118
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,590
sets up his photography equipment, very
close. And then what happens? Well,

119
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:13,424
you just wait

120
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:16,930
[inaudible]

121
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,250
so he waited

122
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,470
as the nightfall little black
ships began to creep out of the,

123
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,420
you can hear them sniffing
and refine the roadkill.

124
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,623
Ah,

125
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,990
and then I just started eating and
fighting with each other. [inaudible]

126
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,450
this squad scary. If you don't
know what what you're hearing

127
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,110
as the e Christina,
Danny, at a safe distance,

128
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,080
English shadows takes their plunger.

129
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,043
Okay.

130
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,723
[inaudible]

131
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,730
over the years he's done
this over and over and over,

132
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:16,810
but he always sees lots of devils.
Devils in front of his lenses.

133
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,790
Sometimes 20 devil's running around,

134
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,550
devil's in his kitchen or come
into your tent. Devil's everywhere.

135
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,760
But after a bunch of
trips, something happened.

136
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,670
It was Easter 1996 he was in the park
watching a dead kangaroo and waiting for

137
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:35,240
the devils to show. But only
thing I saw was one devil,

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,060
just one, eh? [inaudible] I'll try
another spot. I had another spot,

139
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,410
tried it at two devils.
They're not gone entirely,

140
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,700
but they're scarce.

141
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,560
And you notice something strange
about one or two of the devils.

142
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,610
It was something on the face
is fasion on the backend,

143
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,810
on their mouth and something
that looked like a growth,

144
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,790
a large ugly growth
thought. Oh well maybe uh,

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,430
they've been bitten, are fighting
with each other and bits troll on up.

146
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,400
But it was really big, you
know, and blood coming out.

147
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,960
And this was the first alarm bell.

148
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,240
So crystal, you were the
first to see it. Yes.

149
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,190
And this was just the beginning.

150
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,080
[inaudible]

151
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,400
like a pie out of hell and dark
death is sweeping Tasmania.

152
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,310
Television reporters got this.
Don't fronted anything like this.

153
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,470
And began reporting that more and more.

154
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:37,730
Tasmanian devils had these lumps on
their faces. They fill the eye sockets,

155
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:40,640
they puff out the lips,
they infect the gums.

156
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,280
It's really sad and hideous
and whatever they were,

157
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,680
they turned out to be lethal.
To jump ahead a little bit.

158
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:48,410
The effect that it's had in
the population, in some cases,

159
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:52,430
devil populations collapsed
by 90%, died off very quickly.

160
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:56,240
Scientists looked at the disease and
determined that it was some kind of tumor

161
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,400
cancer, a cancerous tumor. And then
the question was what's causing them?

162
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,080
So what, what, what did they think? Well,

163
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,840
the toxic chemical was guest number one,

164
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:08,660
some poison or pesticide
from the environment. Yes,

165
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:13,070
number two was a virus. So they
tested in places where the doubles,

166
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,950
they're looking for something toxic
or some virus and they found nothing.

167
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,090
And then along comes a woman
named Anne Marie Pierce.

168
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,870
She looked at some tumors close up, um,

169
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,050
very close up from 11 different devils.

170
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,230
So she's looking at the first tumor and
she found that the chromosomes were sort

171
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:37,990
of mangled, which isn't really that
strange because that's what cancer is.

172
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,540
It's like your genetic
stuff gone screwy. Right?

173
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,620
But then she looked at the tumor from
the next note and she found not just also

174
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:45,610
mangled chromosomes,

175
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,390
but chromosomes that were mangled in
exactly the same way as they had been in

176
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:53,150
the first devil. Hmm. So now she
looks at a third identical metaphor,

177
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,250
identical and then a
fifth identity. All 11.

178
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,310
Exactly the same pattern
in each [inaudible].

179
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,640
Does that I,

180
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,210
I feel the sensation of awe,

181
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,440
but I don't quite have these
understanding attachment.

182
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,330
Does that mean that that
these tumors are all brothers?

183
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:16,500
What that meant was that these tumors
were all genetically identical.

184
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,420
They were all the same tumor. How
can they all be the same tumor? Well,

185
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:22,560
they can't because,

186
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,590
because that wouldn't mean that these
Tasmanian devils caught the cancer from

187
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,810
some other Tasmanian Devil. Exactly.
Wait, what do you mean exactly?

188
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:31,860
You can't catch cancers.

189
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,970
Epidemic of cancer in Tasmanian devils
was a crazy impossible tumor that was

190
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,903
jumping

191
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,310
[inaudible]

192
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,550
with leaping from one devil to another.

193
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,020
[inaudible]

194
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,120
raping tumor. Yeah, a leaping tumor

195
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,220
[inaudible] point in this tale where we
really have to question everything that

196
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,990
we thought. We knew. No cancer.

197
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,810
Now most people think of cancer as like
a situation in which one of your cells

198
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,350
starts replicating and it doesn't stop.

199
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,200
It replicates uncontrollably

200
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,420
until it destroys you.

201
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,750
Okay. So that's like the one cell theory,

202
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,340
which is frankly how I thought cancer
worked. Oh Peter, we have to go ahead.

203
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,010
Just start. But then we spoke with this
fellow. Yup. His name is Carlo Maley,

204
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,510
cancer biologist at the Wistar Institute.

205
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,760
And he told us if you really want to
understand what's happening with the

206
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,920
devils, you're going to toss
out the one cell theory.

207
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,190
Cause cancer is not just not
just a cell going haywire. No,

208
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,570
it's actually many cells
competing, competing for space,

209
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,410
competing for resources and in the
process driving each other haywire.

210
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,050
Like if you were to
somehow go into a tumor,

211
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,030
he says what you would find is between
a billion and a trillion cells in there.

212
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,170
So these are different cells,
this huge clump of cells in there.

213
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,940
They're all fighting it out.
Cause you know space is tight,

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,170
food is scarce.

215
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,000
And what'll happen is in the middle
of this melee and you as the sales are

216
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:18,450
competing each individual
sellers trying to copy itself,

217
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,450
copy, copy Gabby. And somewhere
along the way you get eventually

218
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,690
a copying error. And every so often
says, Carla, one of these mistakes,

219
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,870
we'll give the new sale a new
talent. In the case of cancer,

220
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:36,490
it usually starts with
something pretty simple,

221
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,850
like the ability to slurp up food,

222
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:44,230
Fester nutrients like oxygen and
glucose. Now with this advantage,

223
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,310
that mutant and all of its progeny
will take over that area of the tissue,

224
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,710
but

225
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,890
not for long because now you've got
all these beauties and they start to

226
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,360
randomly again, you get
another copy of the state

227
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,710
and maybe this second copying mistake
gives the cell the ability to divide

228
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,820
faster, right?

229
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,110
So there it is proliferating faster than
its neighbors and it takes over growing

230
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,840
and displacing the other cells. But yeah,

231
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:17,260
it just keeps getting worse because
now you've got these double meals.

232
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,320
They can eat fast, they
can divide quickly,

233
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,890
and they start to fight until you
get a third mutation, then a fourth,

234
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:28,891
and you just keep ratcheting it up and
eventually roughly five to 20 mutations,

235
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,530
you end up with a cell that
is so gnarled, so mutated,

236
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,680
and so powerful that it can
literally spit a kind of acid

237
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,580
called a matrix metallo protease that
allows it to rip through the membrane

238
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,690
barriers, and

239
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,670
this is when you're really in
trouble because now the cell can roam

240
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,480
and so the cells leave the primary tumor,

241
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,560
they've got dissolved their way into
a blood vessel. That's a mutation.

242
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,890
Then they've got to survive and
the blood, another mutation,

243
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,440
then they've got to stick
somewhere else yet another.

244
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,740
Then they've got to dissolve back
through the RTL adding in another. Yeah,

245
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,540
so it sounds like cancer is always
evolving to be more cancerous. It totally,

246
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,374
yes.

247
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,620
This also explains why we
haven't been able to cure it.

248
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,830
Why when a person takes
chemotherapy drugs, the cancer
will go away for a while,

249
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,750
but then it'll come back

250
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,250
stronger cause the cells have
evolved a resistance to those drugs.

251
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:34,870
When I first got into work on cancer,

252
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:39,871
I was impressed at how malevolent the
disease seems as if it's being designed to

253
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:42,890
kill us. So here's my question. Um,

254
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,600
this leaping tumor in
the devils [inaudible],

255
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,420
is this a case where the tumor is actually
evolving into a new form like after,

256
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:54,010
say the 50th mutation or whatever?

257
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,040
Like now it doesn't just have
the ability to travel in a body,

258
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,010
but it can somehow leap out
of a body through the air

259
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,920
and into another body? Sure.

260
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,250
I mean, the only, that's really
scary. Yes it is. It is pretty scary.

261
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,730
But, but this is amazingly rare
and according to Carlo demand,

262
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:16,850
some pretty special circumstances. Oh,

263
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:21,851
would m a Tasmanian devil would some
tumor get from one individual to another?

264
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:27,260
What would, well, how would that
happen? Tasmanian devils. God bless him,

265
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,750
bite one another in the face a lot.

266
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,770
They're scrambling over carcasses.

267
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,350
They're fighting and biting,
swallowing, crunching,

268
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,170
and the males also bite females
during the meeting period.

269
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,140
He's

270
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,490
a little bit of a rough lover.

271
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,310
So you have the male and the female
biting each other in the face. So, uh,

272
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,890
devil with a tumor on its face,

273
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,550
let's say it's mating with another devil
and it bites that second devil in the

274
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,750
face. What exactly happens at that
point? Is it just rubbing its tumor?

275
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,940
When you think of these big ugly
tumors, think of fetter cheese.

276
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,120
And when one devil bites another,

277
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,150
there's a tendency for the tumor to
crumble and to shed tumor cells that then

278
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,280
fall into the wounds on
the second devil. But um,

279
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,990
some of you I don't understand. Um,

280
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,670
why wouldn't the immune system of the
devil's kill those cells prevent those

281
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:31,520
cells from taking root? Yeah. Cause
that's what immune systems do.

282
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,100
And the latest answer is that, well,

283
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,740
Tasmanian devils don't have as much
genetic diversity as you would expect.

284
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,310
Whether that means David explained to us
is that the Tasmanian devil population

285
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,170
has gotten so inbred,

286
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,200
they are so alike at a genetic level
that their immune systems now confused.

287
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,180
They don't know the difference between
their own cells and invading cells coming

288
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:55,800
in from other devils. Exactly.

289
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,460
Which doesn't actually sound like
the tumor is all that powerful.

290
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:01,650
So I asked Carlo Maley,
you get a mutation.

291
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,950
That's really the story
of a tumor evolving,

292
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,040
more adaptive or is it just the story
of a tumor getting lucky them those.

293
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,440
I think those are the same
story. How do you mean?

294
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,140
I mean evolution is all about dumb luck.

295
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,543
The way he explained it,

296
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,120
it's dumb luck that the tumor
was on the outside of the face.

297
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,310
It's dumb luck that they
bite each other a lot.

298
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,840
That a cell could come along that
could shed and fall into a wound.

299
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,980
It's all dumb luck. But that he
says is what makes evolution happen.

300
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,950
That's natural selection right
there. And when you step back,

301
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,630
sometimes the results are just

302
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,220
nuts. Yeah, just nuts.
This is the point. Yeah.

303
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,370
Where we need to talk about a
transmissible tumor in, in dogs,

304
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,550
canine transmissible venereal tumor.

305
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,461
This is a tumor.

306
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,780
He says it's evolved way beyond the
one in the devils and way longer.

307
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,763
How long is that

308
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,970
Donna? Well,

309
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,970
it's been going on for
somewhere between 220 500 years.

310
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,010
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Between 220 500 years.

311
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,100
Yeah. Yes. Unit. Yes. Over
to millennia. Exactly.

312
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,150
And if that's the case,

313
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:17,151
then it's the oldest continuous animals
cell line in existence on planet earth.

314
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,340
You might need to say that again

315
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,060
because that is just too strange.
It is. It is. Even stranger,

316
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,260
it says David [inaudible].

317
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,190
When a tumor lives this long
propagates itself this long,

318
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,630
you can only really call it one thing.
This tumor is essentially an animal,

319
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,040
a parasite, not a species of parasite,

320
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,640
but one individual parasite
that may never die.

321
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,043

322
