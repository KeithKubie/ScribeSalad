00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.267
FRANK: Oh yeah.

00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.802
OK.

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:03.970
This might be muddy because
the top on this one's open.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.572
FRANK: Oh, we don't
care about mud.

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.173
So there you go, fellas.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.242
FRANK: So I get in the second
bunker, here's a Texaco sign.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.243
Here are some cans.

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.378
Here's a Coca-Cola sign.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.712
Every room is packed.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:15.315
It's like putting a fat
kid in a candy store.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.451
"Texaco Gasoline, Localized
For You," I like that.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.387
I think if you look
on the back, it's got--

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.454
yeah, there's your name.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.689
It says Frank right on it.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.456
FRANK: It says Frank
right on the back?

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.858
That's right.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:25.859
And you know what it says
right on the front here?

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.760
- Uh-huh?
- It says $60.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.427
Ooh.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.395
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.162
You got it.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.663
Hey, Dan, Rob.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.800
The only time I ever
see these signs they're

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.702
on top of the buildings.
- Yep.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.171
This was a 17-foot long
sign that went on the top

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.906
ridge of the transfer station.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:42.308
It said Conoco
Oil Company on it.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:46.780
Very, very highly sought after
sign to the Conoco collectors.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.181
Yeah, they were on
top of the building.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.849
You still have the original
mounts on this one.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.886
Would you do 800 on the pair?

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.121
I think it's a
pretty cool piece.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.224
Robbie, I'd like to
have 1,000 bucks.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.459
Can you do that?

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.827
- I'll do 1,000.
- Oh.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:01.694
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.029
I'll do 1,000 on it.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.863
Appreciate it.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:04.864
What about the Coca-Cola sign?

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.500
It's so bad that it's good.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.301
It's hurting.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.202
It's got rust.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.437
It's got bullet holes.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.105
It's beyond character.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.506
And it's cool.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.275
I would take 150 bucks for it.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.876
All right.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:19.212
It would be a great piece for
somebody to put on their barn.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.313
No one's going to touch it.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.614
This one's safe and sound.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:22.982
I think he's got a vision.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.018
You could take a brand
new car and knock a hubcap

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.753
and break a headlight
out, and the value

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.787
drops to half to people.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.222
They can't see past it.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.024
He can see past it.
- You bet.

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.358
- Wow.
- Whoa!

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.393
You can pick till you puke.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.794
Frank was digging in a box.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.963
And I said, what
the hell's he doing?

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.064
Oh, looky there.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:39.132
It's a Goodyear's Tire.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.033
You found a nugget.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.334
It's double-sided.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.336
It's still very,
very presentable.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.704
I buy anything
that's good Goodyear,

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.906
Goodrich, anything that's good.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:47.941
$80.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.975
Well, I'm not going
to argue with you.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.777
You found it.
- Team me, baby.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.246
You know, we dug two good things
out of there, any one of them.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.614
Matchless Auto Lamps.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.715
That's bad it's so faded.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:56.916
FRANK: Look at the girl on it.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:57.617
Oh man.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.751
- 10 bucks.
- Yeah.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.786
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.254
He's got a nose for good crap.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.522
FRANK: 50 bucks.
- Absolutely.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.723
All right.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.258
I mean, the guy's
like a bloodhound.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.426
He just went right to it.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.461
S&amp;H Green Stamps--

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.631
now this isn't
porcelain, 40 bucks.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.932
Yeah, that's fine.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.534
Frank goes right to
the bottom of the pile

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.503
like a rabbit-- you know,
dog hunting a rabbit.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:17.804
I mean, how do you do that?

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.138
150.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.673
I would gladly take that
for it, to be honest with you.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:23.076
I mean, them guys are
professional pickers.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.277
That's all there is to it.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.645
Heck, I'm doing pretty
good in the front rounds.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.113
Yeah, you are.
You're a scrounger.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:29.582
This thing right here is
a wind charger for a farm

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:31.417
basically is what they are.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.585
It sat on a pole.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.454
It generated electricity.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:37.957
Like this one says 32
volt, Wincharger Corp,

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.359
Sioux City, Iowa.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.895
This wind generator would have
been used to charge batteries,

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.696
to power a radio on the farm.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.565
So this piece is the long piece.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.233
And then there's your
generator up there,

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.568
which looks like it's all gone.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.136
The brake is here, but
it's bent and mangled.

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.839
Now, I know they reproduce
a lot of these parts.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.841
They're pretty darn cool
when they're set up.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.278
Think about how isolated a
family farm was in the 1920s.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.613
This was their connection
to the outside world.

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:01.814
I'll tell you what
I'd want to do--

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.517
this piece and the
tail, the rest of it the

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.686
remains here, 400 bucks.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.954
Ooh, that's a lot.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.389
Are you sure you want
to pay that much?

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.490
This is a good
decorator piece.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.257
Right, right, right.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.825
OK?

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.327
This piece put back together
is going to demand good money.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.995
You get down the road 100
miles, you're going to say,

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.398
oh, man, I paid too much.
- I don't think so.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:19.966
I think 400 is a good number.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:20.967
OK, buddy.
